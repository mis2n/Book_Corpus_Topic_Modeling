7 PREFACE 
HE Childrens Foundation has for its object the 
study of the child and the dissemination of kuc wl- 
edge promotive of the well-being of children. It 
came into existence at Valparaiso, Indiana, late in 1921, 
when a charter was granted to it by the State of 
Indiana as a corporation not for profit, and a gift was 
made available to its Trustees for effecting its organiza- 
tion and developing its program of work. 
The Foundation has first undertaken the task of 
appraising present-day knowledge relating to the nature, 
well-being, and education of children, and through this 
volume, ““The Child: His Nature and His Needs,”’ it 
seeks to make this knowledge available for practical use 
everywhere by those who are in immediate contact with 
children, fashioning their intellect, moulding their char- 
acter and influencing their physical development. 
Special acknowledgment is due Professor M. V. 
O’Shea of the University of Wisconsin, and the staff of 
eminent students in the field of child life who have 
collaborated with him in the preparation of this work. 
The second contribution of the Foundation will appear 
late in the year 1925. It will deal comprehensively 
with the problems arising out of the changing, economic 
and social conditions as they affect the well-being of 
childhood and youth in the American home. 
The Trustees invite the counsel and desire to enlist 
in the work of the Foundation the codperation, good will, 
and efforts of individuals, associations, institutions, or 
enterprises, having directly or indirectly for their objects 
the well-being of the childhood of the human race, or 
having at their command the facilities or instrumentali- 
ties desirable to be employed for arousing individual 
and public interest in, and disseminating knowledge 
about, the well-being of children.

INTRODUCTION 
OOKS, pamphlets, and articles relating to child 
B nature and ways and means of improving the 
mental and physical condition of childhood and 
youth have increased enormously in number and variety 
during the last eight or ten years. Legislation designed 
to promote the welfare and training of the young has also 
increased greatly during this period. Of course, men and 
women in all times have been interested in the well-being 
of children, but in most countries this has been the chief 
concern of only a small minority. Until very recently, the 
care and culture of the young have been assigned almost 
entirely to parents, governesses, and teachers. But this 
is not the case to-day. In some countries, particularly 
in our own, statesmen are coming to see that the stability 
and prosperity of a nation depend mainly in the long run 
upon the mental poise and acumen, and the social under- 
standing and good will of the rising generation, which 
values can be secured only by a proper regimen of bodily, 
mental, and social training. Those who are studying the 
requirements of national welfare as well as those who are 
charged with the conduct of governmental affairs, at 
home as well as abroad, are turning their attention to-day, 
very much more generally and acutely than they did 
formerly, to the promotion of the physical, intellectual, 
and social well-being of the rising generation. Our own 
country has led in this new movement, but all progressive 
countries have shown, or are now showing, that they 
regard the careful investigation of the nature and the 
needs of childhood and youth and the dissemination of 
knowledge relating to education and child welfare as of 
supreme importance. Increasing

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
One of the most significant phases of the awakening 
The of interest on the part of all our people in childhood and 
in eencte youth relates to the shifting of emphasis in the activities 
gists of psychologists. A few years back, most American 
psychologists and all the psychological laboratories in 
our country were devoted to the analytical or experimental 
study of the mature mind. One of the most distinguished 
of these psychologists said two decades ago that he could 
see no reason for studying the mind of the child as dis- 
tinguished from the mind of the adult; if we could find out 
how the mature mind was constituted and how it func- 
tioned, we would know how the child mind was consti- 
tuted and how it functioned, because the latter was 
simply a miniature copy of the former. He and his psy- 
chological and philosophical colleagues did not take seri- 
ously those who were beginning to say that in the 
development of the human mind from birth to maturity 
changes occur which make it different, not only in strength 
or range or power but also in other important respects, in 
the adult stage from what it is in infancy, childhood, or 
youth. But every psychologist of any standing agrees 
to this view to-day. A majority of the psychologists who 
were formerly indifferent to the study of mental develop- 
ment as distinguished from the analytical and experi- 
mental study of the mature mind are now devoting a part 
of and some of them all their time and energy to the study 
of one or another aspect of the mind of the child or the 
youth. The psychological laboratories of our country are 
being utilized in considerable measure everywhere, and 
almost completely in many places, for the investigation 
of problems connected with the maturing processes of the 
human mind. Numerous clinics have been established 
during the past ten years especially for the investigation 
of child development, alike in its normal and in its 
abnormal manifestations. It would probably be within 
bounds to say that there is at least ten times as much

INTRODUCTION 
intelligent attention being given now to a study of the 
physical, intellectual, social, and moral development and 
well-being of childhood and youth as was the case two 
decades ago in our country. 
As it happens in respect to every movement of this The Indi- 
character, individuals and institutions have been con- eerie 
cerned in their investigations and in their service with oF Agency 7 : is Concerned 
special aspects of the development and well-being of child- with but a 
hood and youth. There has been little attempt thus far P aol the 
at codrdination of the results of investigations and the ture ot 
outcome of various efforts to promote the well-being and the Young 
education of the young.. Each student of mental develop- 
ment has confined his attention to some particular phase 
of child nature or child training, so that he could go 
farther in exploring it than anyone had done before him. 
Every investigator understands that if he attacks a very 
complex problem he is not likely to go a great way with it 
unless he breaks it up into subordinate problems and 
selects the one that he is equipped to investigate with some 
degree of success. The individual student depends upon 
others to combine the results of his particular investiga- 
tion with the results of the work of his colleagues who are 
studying related problems. He does not consider it to 
be a part of his task to show how the results he secures are 
related to the results secured by those who are investigat- 
ing different problems from his own. It is essential to the 
development of any science that the individual investi- 
gator should not be concerned so much with the science 
as a whole as with the particular problem with which he 
is wrestling, even though this problem has to do, in the 
case of human development, with but a very small sec- 
tion of the nature and needs of a child or a youth. 
The Childrens Foundation, as Mr. Myers, its founder, The Task of 
has pointed out in the Preface to this volume, is seeking The Chil- 
to be of service in performing the task of codrdinating, Foundation 
interpreting, and applying the results of investigations

  Bridging the

Between 
Knowledge 
and Practice THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
relating to the development of childhood and youth 
which have been made in recent years, and also the out- 
come of experiments in promoting the well-being and 
education of the young. In the present volume it has been 
the aim to sum up and apply what is known regarding the 
nature and the physical, intellectual, social, and moral 
needs of childhood and youth. It has not been possible, 
of course, to treat all aspects of child nature and every 
requirement for the well-being and education of the 
young; only the more general aspects have received 
attention. It is anticipated that in due course other 
volumes will be published in which it will be possible to 
deal in much detail with the well-being and education of 
childhood and youth in the home, in the school, and in 
society. It is expected that when this program shall have 
been completed, it will have been possible to present a 
coérdinated view of the nature and needs of childhood 
and youth under all the conditions and all the situations 
of contemporary American life. 
Anyone who has become aware of the gulf that exists 
between our knowledge of the nature and needs of the 
young, and our practice in the care, training, and educa- 
tion of children, will appreciate the importance of a pro- 
gram designed to organize, interpret, and apply what 
has been or is being established regarding the require- 
ments for sound physical, intellectual, social, and moral 
development. In Chapter I, Professor Baldwin has shown 
the need of bridging the gap between our knowledge of 
childhood and youth and our practice in the training of 
the young. Probably few persons will question the state- 
ment that we have gone much farther in our investigation 
of child psychology and child development than we have 
gone in adapting our training to the nature and needs of 
children. As a matter of fact, those who have been 
charged with the care and culture of the young have not 
been in close touch with those who have been busy in

  INTRODUCTION 
the study of childhood and youth. The investigator and 
the practitioner have not been walking side by side; 
in fact, they have had little or no communication with 
one another. The investigator has been saying: “It is 
not my duty to see that the truths I have been establish- 
ing are recognized and taken advantage of by parents, 
teachers, and social workers. I have all I can do to ferret 
out truths, and I must let somebody else apply them. If 
no one who is training the young, or looking after their 
physical development and their health, hears about the 
facts I am establishing, why I am blameless in the matter. 
I cannot be an investigator and a trainer at the same 
time. It is not my duty even to present my results in a 
form so that they can be understood by the practitioner. 
He must grow up to my position if he wishes to under- 
stand what I am doing. I cannot do justice to my 
scientific work if I cannot employ terms and modes of 
expression which will accurately and adequately convey 
the truth as I find it, whether or not the practitioner can 
comprehend these terms and understand the modes.”’ 
On the other hand the practitioners, i.e., the parent, 
the teacher, and the social worker, have been saying: 
“We are too busy with practical matters to spend time 
and energy in trying to understand technical material 
pertaining to the nature and needs of childhood and 
youth. We are confronted by actual problems that have 
to be solved from moment to moment; at least, something 
has to be done in regard to them, and we cannot take 
time off to speculate about scientific matters. We must 
treat children the best we know how until someone 
shows us, in an intelligible and practical way, that we 
can employ better methods than we have been employ- 
ing.” 
As a consequence of the attitude of practitioners and 
investigators toward one another’s work, the care and 
the training of the young have not been greatly influenced

    For the 
Performance 
of the Task THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
by all the investigation of child nature and child develop- 
ment that has been going on in our country and to some 
extent in other countries during the past decade. Not only 
has Professor Baldwin shown in Chapter I, but Professor 
Goddard has shown in Chapter VIII, and Commissioner 
Tigert in Chapter XVI that a gulf exists between what 
we know about the nature and needs of childhood and 
youth and what we are actually doing to promote the 
physical, intellectual, social, and moral well-being and 
development of the young. The home is probably farther 
behind than the school in taking advantage of established 
knowledge regarding childhood and youth; but society 
is farther behind than either of them. They are all a 
long distance in the rear of our knowledge of child nature 
and the most effective methods of promoting the well- 
being and education of the young. 
As suggested above, The Childrens Foundation has 
addressed itself to the task of bridging the gulf between 
knowledge and practice in respect to the care and culture 
of childhood and youth. For the performance of this 
task, men and women have been selected who are familiar 
with what has been established regarding the problems 
which they have discussed, and they are also familiar with 
the practical needs of the parent, the teacher, and the 
social worker. Each contributor to this volume has been, 
and is, an investigator in the department which has been 
assigned to him. He has also been, and now is, a student 
of ways and means of making the knowledge in his 
department available to practitioners. 
It was said to each contributor at the outset: “It is 
expected that you will make a survey of what is known in 
your special department, and will present this knowledge 
in such phrases and in such form that it can be readily 
understood and its importance appreciated by those who 
are actually in contact with childhood and youth. It is 
expected further that you will show how the knowledge

INTRODUCTION 
which you present relates concretely and practically to 
the every-day problems of dealing with the young. It is 
not desired that you should attempt to apply this knowl- 
edge in every possible way in which it can be applied, 
but only that you should go far enough to show the parent, 
the teacher, and the social worker that the knowledge in 
question has a vital relation to the actual task of rearing 
the young so that they may gain physical, intellectual, 
social, and moral stability and efficiency. Neither the 
trustees of The Childrens Foundation nor the Editor of 
this volume will impose any particular views upon you in 
the treatment of your theme. You will have a free 
hand, only so that you conform to the general aims of 
The Childrens Foundation and the objects of this vol- 
ume.” It is believed that each contributor has performed 
his task efficiently, and has gone as far as space limitations 
would permit in presenting knowledge in his particular 
field and suggesting how it can be applied in practice. 
With a view to assisting the reader to become familiar 
with the contents of each chapter and of the volume as a 
whole most readily and with the least expenditure of 
time and energy, each important point discussed is indi- 
cated marginally at the proper place in the text. The 
essential points developed in each chapter are summarized 
and phrased simply; and the analytical Index will assist 
the reader to locate easily any topic he is interested in and 
which is treated in this volume. A list of the most helpful 
- books and articles in the fields covered is given in the 
Bibliographies. Finally, biographical data concerning 
each contributor are given in the Appendix, so that any 
reader who is interested may become familiar with the 
principal facts regarding the interests and achievements 
of any author whose views and suggestions seem to him 
to be of value. 
The Editor desires to express his gratitude to various 
persons, in addition to the contributors to this volume,

who have been of service to him in the performance of 
his editorial duties. Without the advice as well as the 
material assistance rendered by Mr. Lewis E. Myers, 
Founder of the Childrens Foundation and president of 
the board of trustees, the completion of THE CHILD: 
His Nature AnD His NEEpDs would have been im- 
possible. He read all the manuscripts contributed 
to this volume and made very helpful suggestions relat- 
ing to the arrangement, content, and style of each chap- 
ter and of the volume as a whole. His profound inter- 
est in promoting child well-being and his experience as 
an educator as well as a man of affairs have made his 
counsel and constant encouragement and support of 
exceptional value. 
Mr. Lorne W. Barclay, vice president of the Chil- 
drens Foundation, formerly Director of Education of the 
Boy Scouts of America, has brought to the task of putting 
this volume through the press an extensive knowledge 
alike of child life and of the most effective methods of 
making scientific knowledge intelligible and helpful to 
those who are charged with the care and culture of the 
young. His expert knowledge of the problems involved 
and his enthusiasm and skill in solving them are reflected 
in the final form and character of this book and its 
mechanical features. 
The thanks of The Childrens Foundation and of the 
Editor of this book are due to a number of persons who 
codperated in securing effective photographic illustra- 
tions. Mention should be made in particular of the 
service rendered by the following: The Playground

from these sources a large number of photographs, many 
of them made especially for this volume, from which 
those that appear herein have been selected. 
When the plans for this book were made it was 
decided that an account should be given of the aims and 
achievements of all the foundations, agencies, or insti-

nature or the promotion of the well-being of the young. 
This program was carried through, with the result that 
stories of the aims and achievements of a large number 
of foundations and welfare institutions have been secured. 
It has been found, however, that the volume would be 
far too large if all this material should be included, so 
it has been decided to issue it some time in the near 
future as a separate monograph. ‘The Editor desires 
to express his appreciation of the codperation of all these 
foundations and institutions in preparing accurate and 
readable accounts of their purposes, plans of organiza- 
tion, and the work which they have already achieved.

PRESENT STATUS OF OUR KNOWLEDGE 
OF CHILD NATURE
-P-A-G-E-22
There is really no clue by which we 
can tread our way through the mazes 
of culture and the distractions of 
modern life save by knowing the true 
and natural needs of childhood and 
adolescence. Childhood is thus our 
pillar of cloud by day and fire by 
night. Other oracles may grow dim 
but this one will never fail.

BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF 
Cuttp NATURE AND THE TRAINING OF CHILDREN 
HE development of scientific principles and the 
practical application of scientific laws are fre- 
quently independent lines of human effort and 
originality. Some investigators are chiefly interested in 
extending the theoretical boundaries of their science, 
while others are absorbed in extending the applications 
of their science to human welfare. In the field of physics, 
for example, on the one side we find Einstein and Michael- 
son working during a life-time on the theoretical aspects 
of the law of gravitation and the nature of the atom; on 
the other side, Edison absorbed in applying the theoretical 
principles discovered by others to their practical use in the 
electric light, the phonograph, and other devices, and 
Ford furnishing cheap automobiles. The same is true 
of the science of child welfare. Occasionally a scientist 
combines the theoretical with the practical, but such 
persons arerare. To-day we have sixty national organiza- 
tions to promote child welfare and thousands of persons 
engaged in this praiseworthy activity, but the number of 
organizations devoted to research in this field is limited 
to very few. Consequently much of the welfare work is 
misdirected propaganda, inefficient effort, and inaccurate 
application of the fundamental principles of child develop- 
ment. 
In child psychology and in child training many workers 
are advancing their own special fields. In some lines, the 
theoretical scientific work is going far ahead of the prac- 
tical; in other lines, the practical scientific is clearing the

way for the theoretical. Those of us who are most inter- 
ested in the study of children believe that we are just 
beginning to find the basic problems of child development 
and child training. At no period in history have the 
science and the practice of child development been more 
intimately associated than at the present time, when the 
study of the child is the center of interest in home, in 
school, and in social and religious organizations. 
The aim of this chapter is to present in a brief way 
some of the outstanding examples of how scientific knowl- 
edge is being applied to the enrichment of child life. 
This will be done by presenting a few of the contributions 
which child psychology has made to educational practice 
in the application of the principles of child development 
to school training; the outstanding books that combine 
the best theory and practice of to-day; the application of 
the principles of individual development to school pro- 
motion; the application of psychology to education; the 
development of laboratory schools for the study and 
training of children; the application of psychology to the 
growth of normal and superior children; and the applica- 
tion of the principles of mental and physical growth to 
the promotion of superior children in school. 
The gap between the theory and practice of child 
psychology has extended throughout the history of educa- 
tion. In some instances these two aspects of the science 
of child development have run parallel for long periods 
of time with little or nothing in common. On the other 
hand, child psychologists and some great teachers have 
consciously or unconsciously fused theory and practice 
into a unified attitude toward children. Herbart’s 
psychology and methods of teaching in the nineteenth 
century furnish an illustration of theory and practice 
running parallel, but almost independently. His theo- 
retical psychology with its intricate and arbitrary mathe- 
matical symbols was obsolete before his methods of 
14
-P-A-G-E-25
BRIDGING THE EDUCATIONAL GAP 
teaching became assimilated into educational practice. 
The same condition may be said to hold true in a less 
marked degree of English education of to-day, where 
little or no relation exists between English child psychol- 
ogy and English educational practice. But in France, 
and particularly in America, the science of educational 
psychology with its vast amount of data and its systematic 
methods has in a very large measure determined educa- 
tional practice and administration. 
The outstanding contributions of recent years that 
have most successfully combined theory and practice in 
child development are those of James, Dewey, Hall, 
Thorndike, Binet, Stern, Bagley, and Terman. William 
James, in his Talks to Teachers, 1894, produced the first 
distinctive book in educational psychology in this country. 
It is as interesting as a first-class novel and the chapters 
on the laws of habit and will, and on what makes life 
significant, are classics in this field. John Dewey’s 
School and Society, 1900, brought the earlier cultural 
epoch theory of Herbart, Ziller, and Rein in Germany, 
and the new philosophy of pragmatism directly into 
schoolroom practice so that pupils were taught to “make” 
knowledge in accordance with the theory of following 
the order of development of the race. This book is a 
description of the University of Chicago Laboratory 
School of the earlier days. G. Stanley Hall’s Youth, 
1916, gives a multiplicity of applications of the value of 
instinctive development in child life. E. L. Thorndike’s 
Principles of Teaching, 1906, was the first successful 
attempt to bridge the wide gap that had existed between 
the subject matter and methods of instruction on the one 
hand and the development of the child on the other, 
with particular reference to native and acquired charac- 
teristics of children. ‘There is a rich mingling of theory 
and practice on every page. Alfred Binet’s The Develop- 
ment of Intelligence in Children, 1916, first published in

the form of scales for the measure of intellectual level of 
children, 1905, 1908, and ro11, is the greatest single 
contribution to the application of psychology to the prob- 
lem of measuring mental development. William Stern’s 
Psychological Methods of Testing Intelligence, 1914, has 
fused theory and practice into an applied psychology. 
William C. Bagley’s Educative Process, 1905, combined 
most effectively the general problems of child develop- 
ment and the processes involved in training and school 
work. It was the beginning of the present-day move- 
ment that takes child psychology into the schoolroom. 
Following Binet’s development of a scale for measuring 
the intelligence of children and elaborating upon Stern’s 
concept of an intelligence quotient for designating children 
of different degrees of intelligence for the same chrono- 
logical age, Lewis M. Terman’s Measurement of Intelli- 
gence, 1916, is the outstanding book that successfully 
combines intelligence testing with schoolroom practice 
and schoolroom administration. 
In the field of child psychology a series of books has 
contributed to specific phases of child growth from both 
the theoretical and practical points of view. Among the 
most used books are those by J. M. Baldwin, Claparéde, 
Colvin, Freeman, Gates, Judd, Kirkpatrick, McCall, 
Norsworthy and Whitley, O’Shea, Pintner, Pyle, and 
Whipple. 
In the field of mental deficiency, Binet, Goddard, 
L. S. Hollingworth, Kuhlmann, Wallin, and Fernald 
have combined theory and practice in public school and 
institutional training. In juvenile delinquency, Healy 
and Bronner carried the principles and the practice of 
child psychology side by side from the laboratory into 
the courts of Chicago and Boston. 
During the last twenty years, several school systems 
have attempted to concentrate on a particular plan or 
theory of educational training. Frequently portions of 
16  
-P-A-G-E-27
BRIDGING THE EDUCATIONAL GAP 
such plans have been taken over by other school sys- 
tems and in this way the educational work of the country 
at large has been modified and frequently greatly im- 
proved. As a general rule, changes from theory to 
practice are slow and often result in many modifications 
and compromises before an effective practice is worked 
out. A few years ago it was generally conceded that 
private schools were more likely to carry out experi- 
mental investigations and practice than public schools, 
but this is no longer true. To-day most of the extensive 
experiments in education, aside from those in laboratory 
schools of the types mentioned, are being carried out 
in public school systems. A few of the best organized 
plans for relating some of the basic principles of child 
development to the methods of school administration 
and teaching are cited as type illustrations: 
The Dalton plan provides for the various phases of 
individual development. This plan treats the school 
as a sociological laboratory and provides for free activity, 
individual needs, and different rates of speed. Instead 
of classrooms there are subject laboratories, each under 
the charge of a teacher, where the children go as they 
feel the need, working by themselves or in groups and 
asking for aid as they require it. Half of the day is 
free time used as the child wishes; the rest of the day is 
taken up with conferences, assembly, art, athletics, 
manual training, and such subjects. This type of or- 
ganization was first tried by Helen Parkhurst at Dalton, 
Mass. It is being used in several hundred schools 
in England and in an increasing number in this country. 
The Batavia plan is the outgrowth of over-crowded 
schoolrooms. The plan requires, in addition to the 
regular teacher, a teacher who devotes her time to giving 
the laggards individual help as needed. It is another 
attempt to provide more individual instruction through 
the course of study and the recitation. The Batavia

pian grew, in the main, from a congested schoolroom 
situation and later led to the study of individual dif- 
ferences. ‘This is a good illustration of practice preceding 
theory. 
... The Winnetka system is somewhat similar to the 
—— others in the method of assignment and provision for 
individual differences, but it does not provide for sep- 
arate subject teachers. There are some group activities. 
The checking up of work is by diagnostic tests. 
The Mann- The Mannheim system is based on class distinctions. 
ne Phi plan, which was started in Germany in 1880, pro- 
vides for children of varying ability by offering different 
types of education. It provides the regular eight 
grades for normal children; six grades for furthering 
classes; and four grades for defective children, in auxiliary 
schools, and special language classes for the gifted chil- 
dren. Here we have an application of the more general 
principles of the theory that children mentally fall into 
three or four distinct classes, with social distinctions 
more or less parallel. It also recognizes the inability of 
the schools to hold their pupils for equal periods of years. 
The Platoon The Platoon school provides for supplementary work. 
oe ie type of school, while making sure that the ‘“‘tool 
subjects” receive necessary attention, aims to provide 
ample time and opportunity for physical training, for 
cultural subjects such as music, art, and literature, for 
shop work, and for other special subjects, and also to 
provide socializing and Americanizing activities in the 
auditorium. It combines social participation and theory. 
The pupils are divided into two platoons. Each spends 
a half day in the home room and the other half day in 
auditorium, gymnasium, library, shop, and in domestic 
sclence rooms, music, art, and special classrooms. The 
platoons change places at the middle of the forenoons 
and afternoons. The plan was introduced in Detroit 
and is being tried in Pittsburgh, Akron, and Newark. 
18 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
BRIDGING THE EDUCATIONAL GAP 
Other school systems somewhat on the same plan 
as those just mentioned are the two or three track 
systems. In Santa Barbara three courses—minimum, 
average, and enriched—are provided. In this plan the 
assumption is made that the normal child of one year 
is not the normal child of another year, and therefore a 
“concentric method” of repeating the same subjects 
on different levels of attainment is followed. The 
Cambridge plan begins at the fourth grade with two 
parallel courses; in one the work is done in four years, 
in the other the same amount is done in six years. At 
LeMars this division begins at the first grade and pro- 
vides one six-year and one nine-year course of elementary 
school work with two transfer points. 
A detailed study of any one or all of these illustrative 
plans of child training will show that the problems of 
school promotion not only involve, but also furnish, 
many of the fundamental principles of child develop- 
ment and child training. 
In order to develop sound fundamental principles 
and norms, educational psychology needs to be char- 
acterized by painstaking detail in scientific procedure, 
investigation, and experimentation. It is the scientific 
attitude and method, which acquire a multitude of 
organized facts for analysis, description, and explanation, 
that will give us principles for our new science. No 
science is isolated; all sciences work into each other and 
are interdependent, especially during the earlier stages 
of their standardization. No science can appropriate 
the results of other sciences and become a new science. 
The allied sciences are not adequate to furnish and 
explain all the principles involved in education, since 
they are necessarily incomplete; and, what is equally 
important, education has its own data, its own point 
of view, its own problems and situations, its own his- 
tory, and its own practices and opportunities for

experimentation. While education will develop propor- 
tionally with its most closely allied sciences, during the 
next decade we must look, in the main, to experimental 
education and educational practice as the chief sources 
for the discovery and formulation of new principles. 
Educational psychology is rapidly becoming an 
empirical science with its own data, its own point of 
view, its own problems and situations, its own history, 
and its own practices and opportunities for experimenta- 
tion. It is largely through scientific experimentation 
that principles are established and ‘“‘tried out,” as indi- 
cated by the types of school training and experimentation 
that have been mentioned. 
In our experimental work we need not only aggressive 
scientific analysis, but consecutive studies through a 
long course of years, giving full, accurate, and systematic 
accounts of problems in school administration, methods 
of teaching special subjects, and the accompanying 
changes in the progress of learning. As in all sciences, 
it is essentially the point of view and the methods of 
attack which this new phase of educational psychology 
takes that characterize it as a science and distinguishes 
it from the history of education, methods of teaching, 
and school administration. The purpose of educational 
psychology is to analyze, classify, describe, explain, and 
evaluate educational processes in the child in order to 
discover principles of child development and to bring 
the child into situations which will stimulate and foster 
good mental and physical growth. 
One of the best means for the discovery and appli- 
cation of principles of education is to control, direct, 
and modify the scholastic life of the child on an experi- 
mental basis, aiming to “try out” definitely conceived 
theories on a limited number of children, to verify 
observable principles from miscellaneous school prac- 
tices, and to discover new principles that may be further

tested. This is what Pestalozzi attempted and what 
Froebel did most successfully, although the followers of 
each have, in many instances, stereotyped the principles 
into dogmas or changed them into petty devices. Ex- 
perimental schools like those of Pestalozzi and Froebel 
isolated and intensified certain principles that were not 
apparent in more complex situations. In the one, these 
centered in the main around sense perceptions; in the 
other, around self-activity. There have been several 
similar schools, and the number is rapidly increasing. 
In Germany, Rein’s “Uebungschule” in Jena and 
Francke’s “Stiftung” in Halle are examples; in France, 
Binet’s Laboratory School at 36 Rue Grande aux Belles, 
Paris; in Italy and Switzerland, the Montessori schools; 
and in England, the Fielden Demonstration School in 
Manchester. 3 
In this country, aside from several progressive pre- 
paratory schools which are attempting reform movements 
in education, we have in Chicago the Francis W. Parker 
School, which emphasizes community life and claims 
that the formation of character, and not the acquisition 
of knowledge as an end in itself, is the chief purpose of 
the school. It therefore discourages all artificial in- 
centives such as grades and prizes. The University of 
Chicago Elementary and High Schools, and the Lincoln 
and Horace Mann Schools, of Columbia University, 
and the University of Iowa Observation Schools and 
Pre-School Laboratories have become great working 
laboratories for educators and psychologists throughout 
North America. There are also schools at the uni- 
versities of California, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, 
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, 
and Wisconsin, and at Bryn Mawr College, as well as 
at other state and private institutions. These and 
other laboratory schools are centers of research where 
the gaps between the theoretical and experimental

knowledge of child development and child training are 
constantly being bridged and new chasms are constantly 
being brought to light for further study. 
ff To-day the science of child psychology has developed 
to such an extent and the field of education is so chang- 
ing and so complex in its various aspects that no one 
student can conceive a complete laboratory school 
which will meet the requirements of an adequate educa- 
tional theory, a constructive system of training, and a 
complete psychology of the child. Consequently our 
laboratory schools of to-day are based on the principles 
of coéperative research and codéperative training. In 
these schools, specialists are in charge of special subjects, 
such as reading, writing, and spelling. Other specialists 
are in charge of the pre-school, the elementary, or the 
high school children, the psychological examination of 
the children, the course of study, and the administra- 
tion of the school. In short, a group of specialists 
direct the various phases of the child’s training and 
development. 
The dependence of health upon physical well-being, | 
the large percentage of physically defective children in 
our public schools, the relation between physical growth 
and school progress, and the relation between mental 
and physical development, all point to the need of wide- 
spread information in regard to physical growth and 
development of school children. A knowledge of a 
child’s stage of physical development is an important 
factor in placing him in the grade where he can do his 
best work, in prescribing the amount of school work 
he should be expected to do, in promoting him, in pro- 
viding suitable schoolroom equipment, in directing his 
physical training and choice of games and sports, and 
in interpreting his stage of social maturity. With 
school children of the upper grades, who are about to 
enter the industrial world, physical status must be con-~-

sidered when advising them as to the type of occupation 
they should enter. 
Although many early investigations had been made 
of the height, weight, and other physical measurements 
of large numbers of children of various school ages, it is 
only within recent years that consecutive measurements 
of the same groups of children have been carried on in 
order to find out how children grow physically. The 
earlier method measured groups of different children 
for each age and attempted to standardize, on the basis 
of the results of these measurements, heights, and weights 
that should be attained by each child of a given chrono- 
logical age. This method is inadequate and inaccurate 
for studying the growth of individual children and for 
predicting a child’s probable measurements at a later 
age. The method of individual growth curves of a 
child’s development is used by the writer (Chart 1, p. 26.) 
For parents and teachers, the weight-height-age 
relationship is the most practical index of the physical 
status of the child, as normal growth in weight and 
height is probably the best single index of good health 
and good nutrition during childhood. ‘Teachers, health 
workers, and parents should understand that the weight 
tables supplement and contribute directly to physical 
examinations. ‘They are not supposed to take the place 
of a medical examination, which should be given every 
child at least once a year. 
The weight-height-age table in the hands of the 
uncritical examiner may be grossly abused. The abuses 
of the table are due to lack of standardization of instru- 
ments, methods of measuring and recording, and, espe- 
cially, to wrong interpretation of data. Every effort 
should be made for a consistent, careful, and intelligent 
use of weight-height-age indices of growth (Tables 1 
and 2, pages 24 and 25). 
The use of the table is illustrated at top of page 26.

CHART 1 
The normal child not only has a chronological age in 
years, months, and days, but also a physiological age 
indicative of its physical development and its stages of 
physiological maturity. There are several ways to 
26
-P-A-G-E-37
r BRIDGING THE EDUCATIONAL GAP 
compare the physiological maturity and chronological 
age: the teeth of the physiologically older child are 
usually further developed and more in number, the 
height is greater (Chart 1), and the change in voice 
takes place earlier than in the physiologically younger 
child. 
Adolescent boys and girls mature at varying chrono- 
logical ages. Some girls mature at eleven years of age 
and others not until sixteen or seventeen years of age. 
Some boys mature at twelve years of age and others 
not until sixteen or seventeen years of age. As a general 
rule, tall boys and tall girls mature earlier than short 
ones. That is, tall, well-developed children are older 
physiologically than short children at any age during 
childhood. 
Physiological age is directly correlated with stages of 
mental development. The physiologically more mature 
child has different attitudes, different types of emotions, 
different interests from the child of younger physiological 
development, although of the same chronological age. 
Physiological age has a direct bearing on pedagogical 
age, or ability to do school work, as many of our schools 
are begiiining to realize. The larger and more physio- 
logically mature child may be able to do certain types 
of school work better, although of inferior ability in 
specific traits which have been greatly emphasized by 
the school curricula. No child should be promoted or 
demoted without consideration of his or her physiological 
age. Girls may be expected to progress more rapidly 
through the grades than boys. 
The writer’s results show that tall, heavy boys and 
girls are older physiologically and further along in their 
stages toward mental maturity, as evidenced by school 
progress, than short, light boys and girls. Studies of

School in Chicago, the Johns Hopkins Demonstration 
School, the University of Iowa Observation Elementary 
and High Schools, and a special group of mentally su- 
perior children in California show that, as a general rule, 
good mental development accompanies good physical 
growth during childhood (Charts 2 and 3, page 28). 
The writer is carrying out an investigation in Cleve- 
land, Ohio, where representative schools in each of the 
five districts have been selected, to provide practical 
school methods for promoting or advancing pupils in 
accordance with the basic laws of child development and 
with a view to giving each child opportunities and 
training for the highest degree of efficiency which his 
capacity and stage of maturity affords. A thorough 
analysis of the pupil is made physically, mentally, 
socially, and educationally. 
Basing the practical school problem on the experi- 
mental data presented, it is recommended that pupils 
who are physiologically accelerated (those children who 
are relatively large for their chronological age, sex, race, 
and social status) be promoted as rapidly as thorough- 
ness and educational accomplishment will permit. It 
is believed that the superior children may safely be per- 
mitted to advance two, three, or perhaps four grades 
beyond their chronological age if their health is good 
and their mental and educational maturity corresponds 
with their physiological acceleration, as is usually the 
case. 
The children of superior ability (advanced mental 
age) can complete the course at an early chronological 
age with superior knowledge and training on account 
of their superior ability and advanced maturity. 
The physically accelerated pupils of normal or average 
ability can complete with average training the school 
course at an early age chronologically. 
Pupils who are physiologically young (children who

are relatively small for their chronological age, sex, 
race, and social status) are not hurried through school, 
even though they be of superior mentality. Such su- 
perior children are advanced in the horizontal direction 
of the course by means of enrichment of the course of 
study through some type of grade sectioning, by adding 
extra subjects, by allowing for elective work in special 
fields, by encouraging elementary research work, by 
supplementary training through excursions, or by other 
types of supplementary work. The average or retarded 
pupils may safely be permitted to continue in the normal 
grade in average or lower sections. Many of these 
pupils may safely be permitted to continue in a grade 
below their average chronological age. The pupils of 
superior ability can complete the course at the normal 
age or later with greatly enriched information, enriched 
attitudes, enriched training in approaching problems and 
in taking part in extra-school activities. They will have 
many educational assets, without the great liability of 
immaturity for college, for society, or for their life’s work. 
To recapitulate: The development of scientific 
principles and the application of scientific laws are fre- . 
quently independent lines of human effort and originality. 
The science and practice of child development and train- 
ing are more intimately associated to-day than ever 
before in the history of psychology and education. This 
is shown by the many excellent available books in edu- 
cational psychology, by the numerous schools and school 
systems based on the principles of the individual develop- 
ment of the pupils, by the present status of educational] 
psychology as a science, by the establishment of labora- 
tory schools for studying children, by the application 
of the laws of physical growth to the practical problems 
of health education, mental development, and the pro- 
motion of normal and superior children in school.

THE CuHILp’s INSTINCTS AND IMPULSES 
F LATE there has been much controversy as to what Is an 
() what constitutes an instinct, indeed asto whether ‘™st#act 
anything properly called instinct even exists. 
Without entering upon what would probably prove a 
boring and unprofitable discussion, let us explain that 
our study is to be of the sorts of spontaneous behavior 
we may expect from the great majority of children, in 
contrast to the actions they have been deliberately 
taught to perform. Certain trends to behavior are 
found so universally, and are, so many of them, recog- 
nizable in the lower animals apart from direct education, 
that it seems simple to explain them by saying they are 
due to original nature, however modified they may 
become by the particular life experiences of any one 
child. Moreover, many characteristic ways of behaving 
appear at similar successive periods in the life history of 
so many children that it is fair to conclude that some 
inner law of growth determines their development in 
this customary sequence. 
For some of these behavior trends we use names 
such as curiosity, jealousy, suggesting primarily the 
emotions felt. For others we use abstract terms such 
as ownership, gregariousness. For the simpler, more 
definite modes of behavior we describe the act itself, 
such as crying, sucking, walking. Thorndike would 
prefer us to give in detail the acts observed and the 
immediately provoking cause, such as “dodging the 
head”’ when “seeing a blow aimed at us,” rather than! 
31
-P-A-G-E-42
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
“to be led astray in interpretation by any term such as 
“the instinct of self-preservation.”’ 
Our chief task in this section of this volume is to 
consider the commonly observed ways in which children 
behave, and the likes and dislikes they reveal, so that 
we may differentiate normal from unusual behavior 
and thus be guided in our dealings with children. Whether 
normal or unusual, these tendencies must all be evaluated 
as desirable or undesirable for the children’s best ultimate 
adjustment to the physical and social world in which they 
live. If desirable we shall want to perpetuate them; if 
undesirable we may need to eliminate them but surely to 
redirect them. We will sketch first these three methods 
of dealing with tendencies, and then take up four or 
five of the most fundamental manifestations of original 
nature. 
Perpetuation If an instinct or impulse leads to desirable results 
a amg we wish to strengthen and encourage it. This is effected 
Satisfaction in one of two ways. First, we may associate some 
Reward sqtisfaction in the child’s mind from having acted in the 
desired manner. Since it is a fundamental law of our 
nature to repeat an action that brings pleasure as a 
result, this method of reward is an obvious one to utilize 
in perpetuating an instinct. Thus, we praise a child’s 
efforts at construction in wood or textiles; we show 
appreciation when he manifests sympathy; we smile at 
the child who obeys a generous impulse. Many actions 
bring their own reward without any emphasis by the 
adult on the pleasant effect. Thus, the desire to make a 
noise brings joy to the ears of the small drum beater 
and horn tooter, whatever it does to the ears of those 
not actively producing the noise themselves. The baby’s 
impulse to grab food finds a reward in the satisfaction 
of hunger, and the more immediate pleasant taste in 
the mouth. 
32 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE CHILD’s INSTINCTS AND IMPULSES 
The second method of encouraging instincts is that 
to which we resort when a child seems to be slow in re- 
sponding, or when the environment offers little oppor- 
tunity for the tendency to find expression. It is called 
the method of stimulation, or use, and represents some 
effort on our part to supply the deficiencies of the environ- 
ment, or to make certain aspects of it more attractive. 
Thus, the adolescent who is slow in adjusting socially 
is provided with extra opportunities to meet varied 
social groups. A sluggish appetite is coaxed by special 
dainties. The collecting instinct is stimulated by the 
example of other children. 
“Iwo warnings are necessary here. One is to see that 
these methods of reward and stimulation are applied 
to the truly desirable, not to the undesirable tendencies. 
Bad training would stimulate the fear instinct by shut- 
ting a child up alone in the dark; it would stimulate the 
fighting response by grasping him and shaking him when 
he was inattentive. Bad training rewards the disposi- 
tion to whine, cry, and complain, by favoring the child + 
on the occasion of such behavior and letting him gain 
what he wants. 
The other warning is that the reward must be con- 
nected in the child’s mind with the desirable action, 
not given vaguely because of good behavior. To this 
end, the younger the child, the sooner must the pleasant 
effect come after the act, since the memory for time 
intervalsis poor. Also the pleasantness should preferably 
be a natural result of the deed, not some artificial pleasure 
in no way logically linked with the action. 
If an impulse leads to undesirable results we may 
wish to get rid of it. This, too, is effected in two ways, 
each of them the opposite of the two already described. 
First, we associate dissatisfaction in the child’s mind 
with the wrong response, using the law of human nature

Tendencies:

tion
-P-A-G-E-44
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
that a tendency is weakened when the effect is unpleas- 
ant. Thus, when a boy is jeered at for cringing and 
showing fear he is less likely to play the coward in just 
that way again. A bad tasting substance will check 
the impulse to cram things undiscriminatingly into the 
mouth. 
Disuse The second method of elimination is called disuse, 
meaning simply removing every favorable stimulus to 
the action so that it will not occur. Thus we take 
precautions to avoid alarming children. We keep knives, 
matches, and other harmful things out of the baby’s 
reach. 
Again some warnings are necessary. First, disuse 
can be merely a temporary method of treatment, suitable 
only for the very youngest children, or those below par 
| physically or mentally. Second, as in the case of re-~ 
wards, the pains and penalties must be associated in 
the child’s mind with the deed, not with the person 
who administers them. For the smaller children retri- 
bution must be swift, if not immediate. In all cases 
the logical outcome of the action is preferable to an 
artificial punishment. Herein lies one value of self 
government in a group, where the penalty imposed 
represents no one person’s temper, no caprice, but the 
collective judgment of one’s mates. 
A third warning is that neither disuse nor punish- 
ment is sufficient to eliminate a very strong tendency; 
all it does is to check that particular manifestation of it. 
Either method is but negative, and should be followed 
up by a positive way of dealing with undesirable in- 
stincts. . 
Ways of What we need chiefly to consider is how to modify 
redirecting the less desirable behavior, how to find another and a 
Substitution better outlet for the impulse than the one the child hap- 
pens to be using. Here again we have two ways. The 
simplest is known as substitution. To take small bites 
34 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE CHILD’s INSTINCTS AND IMPULSES 
rather than to cram the mouth full, to stroke the cat’s 
head rather than to pull its tail are substitutions for the 
two-year-old. To wash and dry the hands rather than 
rub the stickiness off on the clothing, to lead the gang 
on a nature study treasure hunt instead of ona pilfering 
expedition, are substitutions for older children. Good 
form and movement in dancing rather than holds and 
gestures that are objectionable are substitutions for the 
adolescent. 
The other method, known as sublimation, usually 
involves changing the ideas and the emotional attitudes, 
so that the action is consistently modified, or is forth- 
coming on a different occasion. Thus, to fight, not just 
in self-defence, or in personal rivalry, but in defence and 
rescue of another, or for a cause, is sublimation. So 
also is giving up desired food in order to feed someone 
else. Still further, the action may be completely trans- 
formed, as when a boy fights, not physically, but through 
a committee or by writing in the school paper. 
Other illustrations of all these six methods, reward, 
stimulation, punishment, disuse, substitution, sublima- 
tion, will be given in connection with special tendencies 
that will now be discussed. 
John B. Watson, from his intensive work with young 
infants, tells us there are just three typical modes of 
behavior indicating instinctive emotions. ‘These we may 
name rage, ove, and fear; and since the distinctive reac- 
tions are observable from birth we may well call them 
fundamental trends. 
The first, anger, is excited by hampering the baby’s 
movements. Even gentle restraint of the head or 
limbs with no attendant pain suffices to produce the 
anger responses. Later, any thwarting of movement, 
any failure to make physical objects move at wish, any 
foiling in a purpose, any obstruction in carrying out a 
plan serves to arouse anger. What wonder then that

  Aids in 
Control of 
Anger THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
we find nervous children of two to three years old who © 
frequently fly into a rage. Consider the stimulations 
to anger they receive all day long. Their bodies are 
pulled, twisted, held, restrained in so many of the ex- 
igencies of being taken for a walk in busy streets, of 
being lifted in and out of cars, of being dressed. They 
tug at heavy furniture, fail to manipulate fine mechanisms, 
are constantly disappointed in going where they wish to 
go, and doing and getting what they desire. They are 
hurried, when they are all set to stop and examine. 
The first undirected slashing movements and easily 
recognizable cry of temper of the infant grow into attacks . 
on objects or people, plus a bellowing roar. A child may 
throw himself down, kick and fight any would-be assist- 
ant, or even pound and hurt himself. Extreme glandular 
changes affect the circulation and respiration to the 
point of physical exhaustion when the fit is over. Older 
children cry less and fight more. Crying, as Woodworth 
points out, is an expression of baffled helplessness and 
inefficient self pity. Once a child finds more efficient 
outlets for his impulses he need no longer cry. 
How shall we deal with anger? Prevention is of 
course desirable, in that a little thoughtful care may 
avoid many of the constant, daily provocations to wrath. 
Check in the early stages if possible, for often when the 
flames are well started the fire has to burn itself out. 
Before that uncontrollable stage, however, there are 
various helps. One is the physical cooling off by cold 
water, and plenty of it, inside and out. Another is 
violent muscular activity to work off the rage, a race 
up and down stairs for instance. Another is substitut- 
ing another emotion, even fear—‘‘Look out, you'll fall!”’ 
Then there is the proverbial “soft answer,” which indi- 
cates no malevolence on the part of the person who is 
doing the thwarting. Humor, from gentle amusement 
to a good laugh with the revelation of comradely fun, 
36

SO 
  THe CHILD’s INSTINCTS AND IMPULSES 
is the best solvent of disagreeable tempers, and is per- 
haps one of the most constructive ways of helping a 
child to acquire the habit of self-control. To this we 
can add reasonable explanation of the necessity of 
thwarting, if such exists; or we can help the child to find 
a better way of overcoming the obstacle if there is no 
reason to be baffled. 
Rage, like fear, can be conquered by finding ways 
te control the opposing circumstances. Like fear, too, 
it can be developed into veritable obsessions and abhor- 
rences, real perversions in the adult. Like fear, too, 
if aroused by one person chiefly it can mar a child’s 
development, and warp and twist the young growth 
‘ into a mental deformity later on. 
- The second fundamental group of emotional reactions 
/ has to do with what we call Jove, or sex in the Freudian 
sense. “This impulse involves phenomena in two dis- 
tinct realms. One is purely physiological and includes 
the specific sensations, the muscular reflexes, and the 
glandular secretions occurring in normal sexual excite- 
ment, which are called detumescence. ‘The other is 
mental, and includes the thoughts of romance, the 
imagination, the complex of motives and behavior that 
accompany being in love, which together are called 
\contrectation. 
During the first few years, from birth to at least 
three years old, more commonly five, and sometimes 
seven or eight, a child is in the neutral period, so named 
because gratification may result from stimulating almost 
any part of the body. The infant expresses pleasure 
when he is laid face down over someone’s knee, when 
he is patted or stroked. Later, intense gratification is 
derived from sucking the thumb or some form of ‘‘paci- 
fier.” Apart from the danger to the thumb and the 
mouth it is an undesirable habit for a child, since it 
functions as an abnormal source of sex pleasure. To

Period THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
break it, we must remember that it is the mouth, not 
the hands, that should experience unpleasantness; that 
neither punishing the hands, nor disuse by restraint of 
the hands will be likely to set in motion the natural 
inhibitions by which a child learns self-control. Ex- 
treme delight in being tickled is another early phase 
of sex pleasure, and should be avoided unless we care 
to bring about premature stimulation. 
In general, proper hygienic care, seeing that the 
genitals are kept clean, that the evacuation processes 
aré regular, that there is no friction from rough or ill- 
fitting clothing will serve to keep little children develop- 
ing normally. 
The contrectation phenomena show chiefly in that 
the young child’s affections go out to anyone who feeds 
him, cuddles him, plays with him, acting the part of 
nurse or mother. If one parent does this entirely while 
the other is mainly associated in the child’s mind with 
thwartings and stimuli to fear, he will fixate on one 
and feel repelled by the other, an early bent which may 
very considerably influence the character of his sexual 
development later. 
The undifferentiated period succeeds the neutral 
period, beginning at any one of the above ages, depend- 
ing on the particular child, and lasting till the onset of 
puberty. Detumescent phenomena are still incomplete 
since the body is immature; but specific sensations of 
pleasure become gradually localized in the sex organs. 
Curiosity is early directed to them, and we need to 
be on the watch to prevent any bad sex habits or any 
dirty tricks such as children sometimes perform together 
in toilet and bath rooms. Later perversions of exhibi- 
tionism and other revolting acts may originate in bad 
practices in this childhood period. We must not forget 
that bedroom and bathroom manners need as direct 
and graded teaching as do table and parlor manners; 
38
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE CHILD’s INSTINCTS AND IMPULSES 
and that the right mental attitude is immensely more 
important in this case. 
Contrectation impulses find expression in the strong 
attachments a child may feel for another child, or for a 
grown-up, or even for an animal. There is generally a 
fairly continuous sequence of these attachments, and 
therein lies a better chance for normal development than 
if there is fixation for long on one person. ‘The attrac- 
tion may involve great desire to be with the loved one, 
to exchange caresses, to kiss and fondle the person. 
This desire may extend to objects worn, used or touched 
by the one beloved. Sometimes there is a longing to 
be ill-treated, to suffer at the hands of the beloved; 
sometimes there is a pleasure in causing them pain. In 
these tendencies originate adult perversions of fetichism, 
masochism, and sadism respectively; they therefore 
surely need re-direction into more normal lines. The 
emotions of so-called shame or modesty, and of jealousy, 
may be felt very keenly in this childhood period, needing 
sympathetic guidance. 
In the third, or developmental, period, since the 
body matures at any age from eleven on, the two sides 
of the sex impulse come together, and the detumescent 
processes are complete for the first time. Any one of 
four types of stimuli may arouse them. (1) direct 
excitation, as in sexual intercourse; (2) indirect physical 
means, from local irritation or stimulation of other 
parts of the body. Thus, trouble in the bladder and 
rectum, too warm a bed, masturbation, climbing a pole, 
or riding a bicycle may serve to cause detumescence. 
The other types of stimuli are psychic: (3) violent 
emotions of dread, anger, horror, as well as the emotions 
natural to sex desire; (4) imagination dwelling on 
romantic thoughts or on sexual acts may bring about 
detumescence. 
There are three possible phases in this coming

Period THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
together. One is that of complete association, as in full 
and final development; another is of complete dissocia- 
tion, each set of processes working independently as 
to occasion, and not understood by the adolescent as in 
any way related. There is a third possibility, that 
contrectation and detumescence may occur at the same 
time, but that their inter-relationship may not be ap- 
preciated by the boy or girl. Thus, in the first flush of 
worshipful romance, when occupied with pure and 
adoring thoughts of the beloved, an involuntary orgasm 
may prove overwhelmingly horrifying for the half- 
informed adolescent, though fortunately this experience 
is rare. 
The hygiene of this period is to be treated in a later 
chapter. Let us consider some of the emotional phases. 
For awhile, from ten or eleven on to fourteen or 
more, boys and girls develop an aversion for each other’s 
society, an impatience and lack of sympathy with the 
group aims and interests of the opposite sex. They do 
not frequently play together, boys will not read girls’ 
books, and so on. They have plenty of slighting re- 
marks for the personal appearance and habits of the 
other sex, and joyful derision for the kissing and em- 
bracing they see portrayed in moving pictures. Chums 
and friends are of their own sex, though occasional 
idolizing of some one much older is found. Then, one 
day, the fifteen-year-old finds him or herself no longer 
indifferent to, but strangely interested in some one. 
Physical characteristics are discovered as beautiful, 
mannerisms are found fascinating, and lo, the youth or 
maiden is “‘in love,”’ and weaves a most disguising halo 
round the loved one’s head. For the next few years 
there is probably a succession of these attachments. 
When enquiring of the eighteen-year-old boy after his 
best girl it might be more tactful not to give her name; 
for the chances are she is not the same individual as the 
40
-P-A-G-E-51
THE CHILD’s INSTINCTS AND IMPULSES 
one you heard of six months ago. Besides being boy 
or girl crazy, as the case may be, an adolescent fre- 
quently includes among the transient loves some member 
of the same sex, and people far removed in age, and 
quite unsuitable as possible mates. Thus we have the 
“crush” on a teacher, the worship of the matinée idol, 
the boy of sixteen to nineteen willing to marry a woman 
three times his age, the girl longing for a heart-to-heart 
talk with the middle-aged doctor or spiritual adviser. 
The emotions are more keen than in the undifferentiated 
period so that they are liable to lead to more pronounced 
behavior. 
Manifestly, this instinct calls for guidance. Too 
strong to be inhibited, ignorant attempts at suppression 
may simply force individuals to find outlets which may 
or may not be desirable. In fact, numberless mal- 
adjustments, psychoses, ‘‘complexes,” erratic ways of 
thinking and behaving are traceable to repressed sex 
instinct. Substitution and sublimination are emphat- 
ically the methods to be used in directing these impulses. 
From the earliest questionings of children as to the 
functions of their own bodies, as to where babies come 
from, as to animal matings they may observe, we may 
give the scientific truth with all the atmosphere of in- 
terest in the true and the beautiful. Children get in- 
formation anyway—it is the parents’ privilege to see 
that they get the right kind in the right way, instead 
of from questionable sources with a morbid, even obscene 
emotional coloring. Biological facts are taught in 
nature study and hygiene courses, love episodes are 
dwelt on in literature and the drama, but they may not 
be connected in the adolescent’s mind with the chivalric 
ideals that should function in matters of dress, of dancing, 
of desirable etiquette. 
The physical restlessness may find substitutions in 
hard work and in athletics. The disturbing thoughts

and emotions need sublimation in some form of creative 
work. It is here that talents in art, in music, in crafts- 
manship, in writing may’ be helpfully developed, also 
the ability to organize and direct others, to be of service 
to groups of one’s fellows. 
Much more of this will be suggested in the chapter 
on adolescence. We will pass to a study of the third 
fundamental emotion, that of fear. 
In an elaborate study of children’s fears made by 
Dr. G. Stanley Hall, numberless things are listed of 
which people confessed they have been afraid. Watson 
assures us that we have learned to fear these, that orig- 
inally only two causes of fear behavior are found, these 
being a sudden, loud sound, and the removal of support 
(fear of falling). Strike a piece of metal loudly behind 
an infant, or twitch and jerk the blanket on which he is 
lying, and, immediately, fear reactions are induced. 
How does he become afraid of so many other things, 
then? Because on some occasion one of these causes 
occurs simultaneously with some other stimulus—say 
a barking dog approaches—henceforward the fright at 
loud sounds may be shown at the mere sight of an animal, 
even though he is quiet and friendly. Then the fear of 
the sight of a dog may be transferred to the feel of his 
coat, thence to fur, and so on in long sequence. Or a 
child is wakened by some loud sound and by the violence 
of his muscular reaction perhaps rolls off his pillow. 
Two original causes of fear now unite to terrify him. 
If he is in the dark, fear is quickly transferred to darkness 
itself. If it is light, the transfer may be to the sight of 
his sleeping place, so that thereafter he screams when 
laid down, awake, init. If he is alone, the transfer may 
be to the feeling of solitude; though darkness and soli- 
tude, as Thorndike points out, are conditions which always 
enhance fears of any kind. Since terrified screams ordi- 
narily bring prompt help and relief, a baby soon links 
42
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE CHILD’s INSTINCTS AND IMPULSES 
crying with summoning people for any whim. . Here, 
then, we see development in two lines, one an endless 
chain of associated fears, the other a bad habit from an 
original impulse. 
Fears are much more easily induced than they are 
cured. It would seem advisable to apply the method of 
disuse so far as possible, and prevent children from 
becoming frightened, especially in the extreme degrees 
of alarm. Paroxysms of terror are as dangerously potent 
for the psychic life as are the bacilli of tuberculosis for 
the physical life. Like them, these terrors may be 
walled up, so to speak, for years; but let a weakened 
nervous condition ensue in later life and they may 
become active with deadly effect, just as the germs will 
issue from their segregated sac when disease weakens 
the lung tissue. Thus the obsessions, phobias, horrors 
of ‘“‘nervous” adults are almost always traceable to 
some early childhood experience, forgotten but not 
lost as a factor for abnormal behavior. 
Granted that disuse is often out of the question, the 
problem is how to deal with fears that do exist. Fear 
is a very real experience in child life, and our task is to 
dispel useless fears and train children to fear the right 
things and to act efficiently. Warning shouts and the 
loud honk of the automobile serve their purpose’ only 
if they incite to suitable action. Fear of falling must 
teach improved motor control. We might well substi- 
tute fear of germs, with measures to combat them, for 
senseless behavior at fear of mice. 
Fears must be met in the open and conquered, rather 
than suppressed. There are two main ways of laying 
them. One is by the example of others. A little child 
soon takes his cue in emotions from those around; so 
that if in the doubtful situation of a new experience he 
hesitates, then is the opportune time to express some 
other emotion, interest, enjoyment, amusement or what

not, and encourage him to share our point of view. 
The other way is that of better knowledge, and control 
of the situation. Superstitions vanish when we in- 
vestigate scientifically. Dread of the unknown dis- 
appears when mastery is assured. The imaginative 
child need not fear witches, goblins, giants, etc., for we 
can help him to see the difference between fact and fancy. 
He himself can create such beings to talk about at pleas- 
ure; but never can he see, feel or hear them, nor can 
they touch him. 
An illustration of overcoming fear of the dark, so 
long a hindrance in children’s thoughts, is given, com- 
bining the force of example, the change of emotion, the 
definite association of pleasure, and the element of 
control. 
“We can make it dark when we choose by shutting 
our eyes. Blind people have it dark all the time; how 
do they manage? By feeling and listening. Let us see 
what we can find out that way. Let us both shut our 
eyes and walk round the room. You touch something 
and tell me what it is. Now I’ll do something and you 
listen and tell me what I did. ... Now we'll count 
how many steps from the door to the big chair. Now 
you go out of the room; I'll stay here and turn off the 
light. You come in when I call, and find if I’m in the 
chair. . . . Now we'll both go out. You go in again 
while it is dark, and see if you can take just the right 
number of steps to the chair. If it is a book I have 
left there you may bring it here. If it is a candy you 
may eat it.... Now see how quickly you can go 
upstairs. Now try again with your eyes shut; do you 
know how many steps before the turn? . . . Now I'll 
blindfold you; try again, and be quicker. . . . Now this 
time I’ll lift you and put you part way up. Find out 
by your feet when you get to the turn, and see how 
quiet you can be... . ”

THE CuHILD’s INSTINCTS AND IMPULSES 
There seems to be a very deep-seated tendency in 
the human race to hoard. In common with the magpie, 
the squirrel and the bear, children manifest a proclivity 
to help themselves to attractive, portable articles, to 
store them away, and later to visit the repository, con- 
template, manipulate and enjoy the contents. Un- 
directed, this tendency may become dissipated in harm- 
less and useless ways; misdirected, it may become a 
social nuisance; wisely directed it may serve to further 
scientific knowledge and to bring aesthetic pleasure to 
thousands. 
At first, developing from noticing and grasping, a 
young child simply picks up an attractive object and 
finds delight in holding it, or keeping it near by till his 
attention is distracted. By the time he is four years 
old, there is a joy in having a special, definite place in 
which to keep the treasures, and the further joy of 
turning over the collection, examining and handling it. 
Until the age of seven or eight, the objects collected are 
quite miscellaneous and of a trivial nature. The ma- 
terial easily found in the environment will determine 
what particular things are amassed. Pebbles, hen 
feathers, buttons, marbles, scrap pictures, bits of metal, 
pieces of ribbon are all welcomed if available. 
After the age of six or seven the social elements of 
imitation and competition begin to affect the collecting 
craze. A fashion may set in for shells, or paper dolls, 
or cigar bands, or little pictures. The child whom the 
others envy is the one who has the largest collection. 
From eight to twelve the fever seems to be at its height, 
over ninety per cent of children collecting something or 
other then, and frequently acquiring great stores of more 
than one kind of thing. Burk, in a study of California 
children’s collections, points out age periods of greatest 
interest, such as marbles from six to thirteen, but chiefly 
at eight and nine. Birds’ eggs are interesting from nine

on, but mostly between twelve and fourteen. Stamps 
hold the field from nine to fourteen or fifteen, after which 
the bored adolescent may present the too-little-apprecia- 
tive small sister or brother with a well-filled stamp 
album. In the teens the sentimental factor is more 
dominant. Then it is that personal souvenirs are sought 
for—autographs, friendship symbols, dance programs, 
anything to remind the collector of the good times 
experienced or the personalities admired. The accom- 
panying diagram shows the general age of waxing, 
height of attractiveness, and waning of several different 
interests:

glass and pottery chips, scraps of textiles. In nature 
study material boys’ tastes run to animals’ teeth, claws, 
_ legs and other parts, not to mention live frogs, insects, 
lizards and the like. Girls’ tastes run to leaves, mosses, 
seaweed, butterflies and other colorful things. Both 
boys and girls value small samples of food products, 
though it is scarcely likely that they remain for long 
on exhibition; but it is the girls who appreciate samples 
of soap, perfume, and other toilet articles. Both sexes 
enjoy finding or active hunting for treasures, but boys 
show more initiative in buying and in driving hard 
bargains with each other in a brisk trade. 
Seldom is any but acrude attempt at classification 
evident. At eight or nine some arrangement by size or 
color may obtain; while after eleven some basis such as 
price, shape, or, in the case of girls, artistic effect, may 
be chosen; but before thirteen it is rare to find any 
kind of genuine organization of permanent worth. 
Obviously, here is the great opportunity to direct this 
instinct, substituting emulation for quality rather than 
for mere quantity at the nine-year level, and leading 
on to the idea of the “best” being the most complete 
and representative collection. We can suggest better 
values, either aesthetic or scientific, for the type of 
thing collected, and codperate for arrangement of the 
material on a worthwhile basis. 
The instinctive desire to acquire and own things 
arises in close connection with the interest in food. The 
first object a little child claims as his own are those 
which help to satisfy hunger. Soon the sense of pos- 
session includes articles which minister to other bodily 
needs. Thus it is my bottle, my spoon, my little chair, 
my crib, my place by mother. Toys and clothing are 
recognized and treated as special belongings, too, and 
thus the child is well on the way to developing what 
proves to be one of the strongest motives in our life

endeavors. To gain or retain possession of anything— 
lands, education, friends, health, goods—we will dare 
and do almost anything. Wisely directed, then, this is 
a tremendous force towards achievement; undirected, 
it may go to waste; misdirected, it may work untold 
misery. | 
The sense of ownership is bound up with a child’s 
sense of self and with the extent of his group conscious- 
ness, and is therefore both an index of and a factor in 
his moral growth as he changes from a self-centered little 
individualist to a more socialized citizen. Let us list 
the various reasons a child feels as valid to prove 
ownership. 
One reason is the amount of effort expended in ac- 
quisition. A young child counts effort to attain as the 
equivalent of the right to possess. With the baby this 
is physical effort to reach and grasp something attractive 
—notice how strenuously he objects if the coveted object 
is removed. The older child hunts, or risks himself 
physically. The child of ten or eleven feels the truth of 
“first come, first served,’ “findings is keepings.” 
J. Johnson in his studies among the boys on the 
McDonough Farm noted that they acknowledged as 
owner any child who would mark his find, much as we 
respect the staking claim of a miner, or the right of the 
first comer who has marked his seat in the car. 
Another reason for the feeling of ownership is that 
of labor expended. ‘Thus, in the orphans’ home the 
door handles are Annie’s because she cleaned them. At 
home they are Fred’s chickens because he looks after 
them, though the parents pay for the food and shelter 
required. Constructive work gives a specially clear 
sense of ownership. Though it be father’s tools and 
materials yet the bird-house Harold made is unques- 
tionably his. ‘The effort may be less direct, as in choice 
and purchase; if the money for the purchase has been 
48 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
THE CHILD’s INSTINCTS AND IMPULSES 
difficult to amass then the sense of possession is the 
more keen. Lastly, an object bestowed upon a child is 
regarded as his own, somewhat in proportion as the 
child likes the doncr, and partly as he previously desired 
the object. 
In all these cases children not only lay claim them- 
selves to things but recognize the claims of others as 
just. If they know that another child has worked for, 
made, bought or been given something, they look upon 
it as his, and would sympathize with him in its loss, or 
in any accident to it. 
A child does not distinguish individual ownership 
when goods are bestowed in bulk, or are held in common 
by a group, or are acquired in routine fashion. The 
groceries on the pantry shelf belong to whom? ‘To the 
family? To mother who bought them? To father whose 
money paid for them? Or to any child who is hungry? 
But food once served on individual plates at a meal 
is unhesitatingly claimed as one’s own. Not a few 
squabbles arise from the necessity of determining whether 
articles are held in common indiscriminatingly for any 
would-be owner, or belong to one member of the group. 
More arise from the need to prove priority rights in 
treasure trove, or in the claim renewed first after an 
interval. Marshall races after supper to the coveted 
corner of the couch with his book; it is his for the next 
half hour because he got there first. He is called away 
- on an errand and Elsie slips into it meanwhile—thereby 
inevitably setting the stage for a quarrel. 
Until the adolescent’s group sense is widened beyond 
the limits of the gang, or his class in school, or his school, 
he is unlikely to feel ownership for fixtures in the streets, 
for trees and bushes in the parks. But once the group 
spends labor, or constructive effort, or its own cash on 
public grounds the attitude is completely changed.

children object violently, tends to check his first impulse 
to grab indiscriminately what he wants. The fact that 
the others explain their objections by such reasons as 
“Tt is mine, I found it first,’ “Mama gave it to me,” 
help him differentiate between mine and thine. His 
own first all-sufficient reason for claim, “I want it,” 
has to be replaced by reasons which others will respect. 
When called upon to give up something he is using, or 
to prove that it is‘his, a further appreciation of socially 
acceptable criteria for ownership is developed. 
Responsibility in ownership comes partly through 
sympathy, but may be trained by utilizing the suggestions 
given above. Working with mother to clean and polish 
the bath-room fixtures, or the furniture, will beget a 
feeling which will oppose wanton treatment thereof. 
The job of sweeping the porch will help prevent the care- 
less tracking in of dirt. The club’s interest in decorating 
the room where they meet will lead to better under- 
standing of property rights. Lastly, in the abstract 
sense, we not only work for the cause because it is ours, 
but feel it is ours because we have spent effort and 
labor upon it. 
What children feel impelled to do may or may not 
be desirable from the social standpoint. Some tendencies 
may be perpetuated by seeing that they bring satisfac- 
tion, or by stimulating children to act in the required 
way. Undesirable tendencies may be eliminated by 
seeing that dissatisfaction results, or by preventing any 
opportunities for their exercise. Most tendencies need 
redirection, by substituting different modes of action, 
or changing the thoughts and emotions in connection 
with the tendency. 
Three types of emotional response are shown in 
early infancy. Anger is aroused by thwarting. Wise 
guidance is necessary if self-control is to be gained over 
rage, temper, sullenness. Love impulses have two

aspects, each meriting study of its characteristic phases 
in each of three periods of childhood. Normal develop- 
ment in the third period is helped by careful training 
in the first two. The adolescents’ love emotions may be 
intense and lead to erratic behavior; they need a sym- 
pathetic understanding. Most fears are induced, not 
original. They require intelligent codperation for their 
cure. All these emotions need control and sublimation, 
rather than suppression and repression, if children are 
to develop into normal adults. 
Collecting is a dominant interest for many years, 
with characteristic age changes. Unguided, the tendency 
may be useless and wasteful; guided, it has great educa- 
tive value. The feeling of ownership is an index to a 
child’s sense of self and of his social relationships. Con- 
ditions are pointed out which do, and do not promote 
the growth of this feeling. As a motive, it may be per- 
verted to criminal uses; trained, it develops responsibility.

she goes up and down stairs? Do all children bang 
doors at this age or that? Is John being babied 
because he is helped with his buttons and has his face 
washed? Does it need special training to enable chil- 
dren to turn corners without bumping, and to keep their 
hands off the wall at the turn of the stairs? Is Mary 
below par because she does not carry a well filled cup 
and saucer without spilling? Why does this youth ap- 
pear so disjointed, whether walking, sitting, or standing? 
How much we should appreciate standardized scales 
of motor abilities in ordinary life tasks, so that we could 
get a rating for performance just as we do for reading 
ability or for general intelligence!\ Most of the norms 
that are available, however, are for tests such as strength 
of grip, rapidity of tapping, steadiness in fine movements 
of aiming at a mark or tracing a line. From the thou- 
sands of measures taken on such tests we know—what 
we probably guessed before—that boys are stronger than 
girls, on the average, at every age; and that strength 
and speed increase with age. Over 86% of children 
are right handed, while dull children are more likely 
to be left handed than bright children. 
Observation of infants reveals that the first use of 
the limbs is in simultaneous, parallel fashion. Nerve 
coérdination has developed by the sixth month so that 
deliberate alternate movement is possible. Grasping 
is stimulated at first by the sense of being touched; [ IT necessary for Ann to make such a clatter as

upon seeing an attractive object. In the earliest grasp- 
ing, thumb and fingers act together, making the hand 
a simple hook. By the twelfth week the thumb is 
opposed to the fingers. For a considerable period in 
taking hold of an object proffered, say a book, the over- 
hand grasp is preferred (thumb under, fingers over) in 
distinction from the older, adult underhand hold (fin- 
gers under, thumb over). For smaller objects, such 
as a spoon, the overhand grasp will be retained till 
the wrist motion of turning at the right time to permit 
safe conveyance of the contents of the spoon to the 
mouth is coérdinated. ‘That is to about three years old. 
By courtesy of Miss R. Andrus, whose intensive 
observation work with young children is yet unpublished, 
a few selected norms of performance are here given. 
Beyond the age of four we have little as yet but 
vague generalizations from the experience of gymna- 
sium directors, psychologists, doctors and health clinics. 
Children can use a cup by the handle by two years 
and a half. They can carry cups from two and a half 
to three, and carry a small pitcher of water easily by 
three. By three also they can assist in laying plates, 
spoons, etc., on the table, and by four should be able to 
fold their table napkins. They can wash their hands, 
palms and backs, by three years old, and dry their hands, 
too. Shoes and rubbers can be put on unaided from two 
and a half to three, and fastened by buttons or lacing 
by three and a half. The stockings should be put on 
at this age also. In learning to go upstairs, they hold 
on and go both feet on one step at first, then with the 
feet the same way but without holding, till two and a 
half. Then, using the feet as we do but with hand 
assistance till three or more; between three and a half 
and four they can progress as we do. 
Children can use a dust pan and brush by three and 
a half. In playing ball, it is after three before it is usual

to catch a ball of tennis size, though it may be success- 
fully thrown forward a distance of seven feet between 
two and a half and three. Bouncing a ball straight is a 
feat for the four-year-old. 
Therefore some few of the queries above for Ann, 
John, Mary and the rest can be answered. Much of 
the bumping, clattering, spilling, dependence on assist- 
ance is an unnecessary retention of an earlier habit, and 
is an evidence of lack of good training. 
Large, How is control gained? Movements of the larger 
el ee muscles, those older in point of developmental history, 
First and nearer the trunk, are controlled before movements 
in the smaller, accessory muscles. ‘Thus, a baby is able 
to bend, to roll over, sit up, hitch along, before it can 
stand or walk. It can use the tongue for efficient eating 
before the adjustments for speech sounds are possible. 
The fine adjustments for the dentals, d, t, th, and for 
r, 1, and s are learned last of all. The nerve strain of 
focusing the eyes and steadying the hands to thread a 
needle and string small beads is too much for the four- 
year-old. Fine technique of violin and piano work is 
not to be demanded of five-year-olds’ fingers, nor delicate 
wrist play in fencing from the eight-year-olds. But 
running, balancing, climbing, jumping rope, tossing 
balls, dancing, are helpful activities, in graded series of 
difficulties. 
Tyler points out three stages of growth for every 
organ in the body. First is mere enlargement, when 
exercise is unnecessary, second is growth requiring much 
exercise for healthy development, third is the approach 
to full maturity, when severe training looking towards 
endurance of strain is possible. The restlessness and 
quick tiring of young children indicates a need for plenti- 
ful free exercise which is not continued for long at a 
time. The ten-year-old could well go for an eight-mile 
hike which the five-year-old could not do; though the five-

His ActTIvE NATURE AND NEEDS 
year-old may easily walk that far in the course of the 
day’s ordinary activities. 
Three things about the facts of growth are important 
to remember because of their bearing on motor ability. 
One is that increase is not uniform, but that there are 
periods of spurt, and periods of comparative rest. An- 
other is that all parts of the body, bones, muscles, limbs, 
trunk, the various organs, follow a law of growth of their 
own, also marked by these accelerations and retarda- 
tions. The third is, that rapid enlargement of one part 
may coincide with a resting period for another part. 
The legs increase in length more than the trunk between 
nine and fourteen, which taxes the internal organs to 
supply heat and growth material to the limbs. Plenty 
of nourishing food and fresh air and exercise is obviously 
necessary. When bones are lengthening more rapidly 
than the muscles which act as their levers, the stretch 
on the latter may give rise to crampy ‘“‘growing pains.” 
When the muscles increase disproportionately a resulting 
flabby weakness is evident. This means that children 
are continually obliged to readjust their mechanisms 
of control. Awkwardness in sitting down, and in gait, 
may be lack of habituation to the changing hip and 
pelvic bones as well as to the extra length of limb to be 
managed. ‘Nervous’ movements may indicate imper- 
fect adjustment due to irregularity in growth. 
Persistent practice is the only way to acquire all 
the series of habits. The hunger for climbing, balancing, 
doing stunts is a sign of the great need of the constantly 
changing body. Certainly up to fifteen children should 
be freely encouraged in all that tends towards graceful 
codrdination. Later, feats of strength and endurance 
are welcomed. 
If we were to sum up comprehensively, yet briefly, 
how to understand children’s active nature, we would 
say—Watch them at play. Play is, truly, their chief

business in life. In its many varied forms we may see 
revealed the possibilities for the development it affords, 
the dominant interests at different age levels, some 
distinctive characteristics of boys and girls, and get the 
clues as to the needs of childhood. 
We will deal with these in reverse order. 
A crying need in many homes is sufficient space. 
Though the children’s room, the attic, the barn, to say 
nothing of the great out-doors, wait with friendly mien 
for the small-town or country-bred child, yet probably 
one-third of our child population live under conditions 
of urban life which preclude much play. The congestion 
in our cities, from the nine people in three rooms of the 
tenement, to the family of three in the expensive two- 
room-and-bath hotel apartment, is hard alike on chil- 
dren and on adults from the standpoint of normal child 
activity. Nor are our streets a desirable playground 
from any point of view. True, our social conscience 
is stirring itself to provide more parks, playgrounds, 
and recreation centers, and to divert traffic from particu- 
lar streets during a certain few hours, and also to recog- 
nize the rights of other people’s children to a place in 
which to play; but much remains to be done in providing 
facilities for play. 
A second need of active children is t#me. This may 
sound ridiculous when we think of the long “golden days 
of childhood,” so free in retrospect from the pressure of 
care and the rush of work of which we are now so con- 
scious. Yet the fact remains that the “poor little rich 
girl,” as well as her fellow citizen of the slums, already 
a victim of child labor, may have no free time in which 
to play, since she is so constantly supervised, so hurried 
from study to social engagement. 
A third need is that of playmates, preferably of a 
like age, but not imperatively so in the first two or three 
years of life. Our sympathy goes out to the only child, 
56
-P-A-G-E-73
  His ActivE NATURE AND NEEDS 
and the child widely separated in age from others in the 
family. Even though such may have school friends 
with whom they pass hours in play, they miss a good 
deal in their continuous family relationships. 
A fourth need, apt to occur instantly to an adult 
mind, is that of equipment. What would the playground 
be without its swings, basket-ball stands, sand-box and 
other apparatus? The recreation park suggests at 
once various ball fields, the tennis nets, wading pool and 
lake with boats. The play room implies playthings; a 
gift to a child calls to mind a long array of bats, balls, 
kites, tops, dolls, boats, puzzles and the like—in fact 
the bewildering variety offered to our gaze in such pro- 
fusion at the holiday season. Here is a real problem. 
A toy, as Woodworth points out, is primarily some- 
thing a child can make move in some way. The more 
he can do with it, the more he can find new possibilities 
of bending it to his will, of making it carry out some 
purpose, the greater the enjoyment from that toy. The 
movement may bring enjoyment to the senses, ‘such as 
noise, or the feeling of swift motion, or pleasing spatial 
arrangement. Herein lies the fascination of toy drums, 
fire crackers, swings, roller skates, a box of paints, and 
pattern making with colored cardboard. 
Then again, the movement may be of his own body, 
gaining skill, or gaining power at a distance. Balls, 
bows and arrows, slingshot, bicycles, radio sets, give this 
sort of joy. The movement may be due to manipula- 
tion by which the child creates shapes to his fancy. 
Clay, damp sand, snow, fire, water, building blocks, 
illustrate this sort of plaything. The movement may 
be attractive because it appears to defy gravity; hence 
the pleasure in kites, soap-bubbles, tops. Lastly, the 
movement may be chiefly in the child’s imagination, 
and the toy that stimulates it is loved because it is a 
diminutive edition of things adults use. Dolls and their

manifold appurtenances, boats, miniature animals, toy 
‘railways, farm scenes and a host of models of all kinds 
will readily be recognized by adults and children alike 
as fit toys. 
From this standpoint, daddy’s foot is a toy when 
the wee child gets a ride on it; likewise the high-powered 
racing car with which his older brother defies the speed 
laws. Both bring the sensory enjoyment of unusual 
and rapid motion. 
What of the mechanical toy that is wound up and 
does one thing only, and does it all by itself? Children 
soon tire df it, and no wonder. After the first novelty of 
its movements has worn off, if no further developments 
can be expected, and if no manipulation brings any 
change except to destroy the mechanism, the interest is 
lost. Obviously, then, in selecting toys one considera- 
ticn should be what the children can “do with’’ them. 
Very often the simpler the toy the richer it will be in 
possibility of manipulation or imagination, and there- 
fore the more stimulating. It is the joy in activity that 
is the essence of play, not mere passive admiration of a 
technical perfection. Better the box of clothespins from 
which people and log houses can be constructed, than 
the most accomplished, and therefore finished, limited, 
mechanical doll. 
Another guiding consideration in selecting playthings 
is of course the age of the child. While motor coédrdina- 
tion is poor, no complex, small objects requiring fine 
muscular adjustments are suitable. A wagon or car 
rather than a bicycle for the three-year-old; three simple 
light-weight tools rather than the complete carpenter’s 
kit for the seven-year-old. Mechanical instruments 
requiring precise control at eleven rather than at eight; 
and fine sewing materials and implements later still. 
A fifth need is that of intelligent suggestion of plays. 
and occupations that will open up new vistas to the child 
58
-P-A-G-E-75
His ActivE NATURE AND NEEDS 
and prevent his remaining bored on a low level of achieve- 
ment when he is ready for something further. With a 
child who lacks initiative, this method of stimulation ‘is , 
very helpful; and for many groups, wise guidance will 
provide opportunities for enjoyment and progress which 
they would be unlikely to discover for themselves. It 
is in this sense that we teach or supervise play. Such 
teaching must fulfil its function of leading and encourag- 
ing along the path of adventure, and avoid the fatal 
mistake of driving and commanding along the track of 
slavery. For children most emphatically do not’ want 
to be “‘bossed” in their games continually. ‘To be told 
what to do, an¢é how and when to do it at every step is 
no fun, since one essential in play is freedom of choice. 
One thing the play teacher should know is what 
games are appropriate to the mental and physical de- 
velopmental level at each age period. Another thing 
is the relative values of different games, as well as, ob- 
viously, a great variety of games. The first two points 
will be discussed below. For directions as to how to 
help children construct their own toys and find new 
occupations the following books will be found of value, 
as also some given in the Bibliographies.

discovers delightful niches and cubby holes into which 
he will crawl with manifest pleasure. By three or four, 
children may see the value of forming an enclosure with 
chairs, and show every evidence of contentment at 
sitting safely esconced within. The tent of the pendant 
tablecloth, the shelter of rugs or sheets hung on the 
laundry line, the empty crate, the dog kennel, have 
irresistible charms for the smaller children. After five 
or six, the boys are more active in constructing their 
habitation. As observed in the kindergarten, about 
four boys to one girl will work persistently in erecting a 
play house. Problems of openings for doorways and 
windows, even of hoists and elevators engross the men 
of the future, while the women wait aloof. When all is 
finished, however, it is the latter who will promptly 
move in with their doll family, and realize the need for 
cook-stoves, beds, and curtains at the windows. 
This difference in interest is maintained during the 
next few years. It is the girls who modify the boys’ 
effects by decorative ventures in roof line and color 
scheme. After the age of eight or so, each sex follows 
its respective bent separately, unless it be for very 
temporary purposes in the hay mow, the sand heap, the 
snow fort, or the wood pile. Little girls’ outdoor re- 
treats are frequently simply a secluded spot under the 
bushes, in the area way, in an angle of the rocks. Ona 
bare surface sometimes the walls are merely marked 
out by lines, and the edifice left to the imagination; 
but furnishings will somehow be found, and perhaps a 
“garden” will be added, made with stones, leaves, col- 
ored fragments of glass and china. Boys will prefer to 
build, using any material handy. In the woods a wigwam 
will make its appearance; on the hillside a scooped-out 
cave. On the city lot old tins hammered out flat, odds 
and ends of tar paper, linoleum, matting and of course 
barrels and boxboards can all be utilized. By ten or

eleven, the shelter is a stronghold or hang-out for the 
group whose password identifies them, and who share 
many joys there together, from simple cooking to thrilling 
narrative. After twelve or thirteen, children lose interest 
in this make-believe house and begin to take pride in 
their real club quarters. Girls soon, and boys later, wish 
to transform their own private rooms at home. By 
seventeen or so, a keen rapture may come from re-furnish- 
ing and decorating the adolescent’s room according to his 
or her own tastes. 
Already at five or six years of age, we may note some 
differences between boys and girls in their choice of play- 
things and play activities. For instance, more girls 
than boys choose painting and crayon work, and are 
content with that occupation longer. More girls draw 
flowers, while boys draw ships and engines. This greater 
interest of girls in aesthetic spacing and in color shows also 
in their large constructive work. It is they who attempt 
decorative effects outside and inside the houses, the 
building of which may have been a project for a mixed 
group of boys and girls. It is the girls, again, who care 
about an artistic arrangement of their collection of leaves 
or pebbles, who delight in ornamenting their handwork 
and sewing, and who thrill to the beauties of the sunset, 
or the mountain view. Meantime their more practical- 
minded brothers have enjoyed carpentering, and many, 
even at six, have glimpsed some of the mechanics’ prob- 
lems involved in their construction work. It is they who 
find it so absorbing to watch industrial processes such 
as concrete mixing and glass blowing; it is they who 
gravitate as naturally as do the older men to where 
excavating or street paving is going on. It is they, too, 
who acquire prodigious stores of information anent the 
makes of cars, or the details of railroad administration; 
and it is they who find out how to set up a wireless 
— receiving set.

Certain Age 
Changes in 
Play 
Interests 
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
Another sex difference in play interest is that the joy 
of violent running about, of scrimmage and crowd fight, 
wanes considerably for girls as they pass out of middle 
childhood; but it waxes, if anything, for boys who at 
nineteen find nothing too hazardous or too“arduous, and 
who welcome even extreme fatigue in pursuit of pleasure. 
A third difference, more apparent in the adolescent 
period than earlier, is that girls retain their interest in a 
wide variety of games, whereas boys run rather to a 
specialty and to a narrower range of continued play 
activity. Adolescent girls are more attracted to card 
and table games than are boys, and seem more addicted to 
games of chance. 
A fourth difference is of course the greater and more 
permanent interest of girls in dolls. Round them a whole 
imaginative life is built up, whether they are big dolls, 
doll-house. size or the two dimensional paper doll. Boys, 
on the other hand, seldom care much for toy animals or 
toy people after six or seven years old, with the possible 
exception of tin soldiers and the puppet show. Even so, 
it is the mraneuvers of the battle or the manipulation of 
the puppets that is the most attractive part of the play. 
A fifth difference is the greater frequency with which 
boys go tramping, fishing and hunting, fashioning weapons 
for the chase, slingshot, rod and line, or—joy of joys— 
managing to handle a real gun. Girls roam about less, and 
apparently are not impelled to the hunter’s life so urgently. 
The fantastic fancy of the pre-school-age child shows 
in the frequent creation of an imaginary companion, as 
well as in his enjoyment of pretending he is a horse, a 
squirrel, or a jumping frog. At eight or nine the drama- 
tization of pirates and bandits requires far more realistic 
stage properties and costumes. By eleven the language 
the characters use assumes a special importance; by 
fifteen the plot’s the thing, with incipient appreciation of 
character drawing as such.
-P-A-G-E-79
  
  His ActIivE NATURE AND NEEDS 
Doll play reflects these changes in imagination, too. 
The smaller children copy what they have seen their 
elders do. The dolls are talked to, scolded, dressed, put 
to bed, fed, rolled in a baby carriage, and fondled. By 
eight or nine, When the doll interest is at its height, the 
accessories of tea sets, laundry equipment, furniture in 
the dolls’ houses have assumed great importance. The 
more the miniature article faithfully imitates the real 
one the more the little girls are pleased. By ten, doll. 
dressmaking may show no little constructive skill and 
aesthetic interest. Now, too, is the time for more com- 
plex forms of dramatic procedure in which the dolls may 
take part. Between eleven and twelve, the interest in 
dolls is rapidly lessening and after twelve, most girls cease 
to care for them, though occasionally we find sporadic 
cases of interest lingering for another year or two.. 
Traditional plays with a semi-dramatic element are 
enjoyed in the seven-to-twelve-year period. It is difficult 
to say whether the fun in the contest involved does not 
obscure the original significance of phrases used in such 
games as old witch, fox and geese, and hare and 
hounds. 
Curiosity, the love of-puzzles, and language interest 
find satisfaction in numerous guessing games. Some of 
these turn on descriptions of objects, such as “‘twenty 
questions,” “person and thing’’; others involve puns and 
conundrums. Some demand language building such as 
“my ship comes home,” “I go to the grocer,” “how, 
when and where,” and word and spelling competitions. 
Many of them are beyond the powers of the seven or 
eight-year-old, but are increasingly absorbing as mental 
development and school achievement proceed. 
C. E. Johnson points out as the most prominent 
feature in each age period, for the child under three,

play, with crude construction work; until nine, traditional

  analyzed for the elements contained. The figures on the 
left represent the percentage of boys (heavy line) and 
girls (dotted line) mentioning a play in which the element 
in question is prominent. Not only age differences, but 
sex differences also are well brought out in these diagrams. 
The gradual development of group consciousness is 
reflected very well in the social type of play in which 
children engage at different ages. At first the play is 
exclusively individualistic,—child, toy, and spectator, or 
simply child, toy, and imagination, being all that is 
needed. This is followed by the play of several children 
together with similar toys. The group is small but in- 
definite in number; moreover, the play is not a game in the 
sense of an activity with fixed rules, limited participation, 
a deliberate goal, and an ending point. Imagination plays 
a great part in directing the play of the group. The life

The Regular 
Team Game THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
fireman, the motorman, the mother, the doctor, are acted 
out with great fidelity at this stage. Characters from 
stories are also portrayed, though not at so early an age 
as those from real life. Very little in the way of stage 
properties is required, the transformation taking place 
chiefly in the child’s own fancy. 
Rhythmic movement and singing games are enjoyed 
in group formation, and here we note the transition to the 
next form of social consciousness as the group begins to 
divide, and opposition commences to be part of the game 
itself rather than a hindrance to it. Thus, in “cat and 
mouse,” or ‘drop the handkerchief,’’ the pursuer and 
pursued are in opposition at least, while those in the ring 
may present obstacles to either successful flight or cap- 
ture. From this point the element of competition enters 
increasingly and develops by way of such games as 
“London Bridge,” with its final tug of war between the 
two completed sides, into the double group game proper. 
There, sides are chosen at the beginning, and the group 
as such acts against the maneuvers of the opposite 
group. “Hare and hounds,” “prisoner’s base,” most 
forms of relay races, exhibit this growing group solidarity, 
as well as group rivalry. | 
Coincident with the double group the game for two or 
four develops. Here the game is very definitely a contest, 
the aim being to win over one’s opponent. ‘‘Naughts and 
crosses” is an early form of this, checkers a later form, 
both of a quiet nature, just as tennis is a more violently 
active form of this pair or double pair type. In any case 
the game has very definite rules, whether few or many, 
and has a method of scoring which marks its close. 
These elements of definiteness carry forward into the 
next type, that of the regular zeam game, the most highly 
developed of all from the standpoint of social conscious- 
ness. It is like the third type in that two groups are 
contending, but unlike it and more advanced in that each 
66
-P-A-G-E-83
  
His ActrvE NATURE AND NEEDS 
group is organized. The numbers on each side are limited, 
and each member of the team has special duties and 
special positions on the field. Because of this, individual 
interests and desires to star must constantly be controlled 
by the relationship of the individual’s activity to the good 
of the team as a whole—a consideration that enters very 
scantily into the mere double group type of game. It is 
seldom that we find a genuine team game before the teen 
age. It is true that in imitation of admired heroes of the 
diamond, the small boys’ gang will play at baseball; but a 
careful spectator, or perhaps auditor, will see and hear 
undoubted evidences of lack of genuine codperation and an 
abundance of individual striving for honor. The group 
is an aggregate of units rather than an organism with 
differentiated functions. 
Now, in this progression from the individualistic play 
of the little child to the team game of the near-adult the 
pleasure of the earlier forms is not lost. The eighteen- 
year-old and the adult may enjoy all five forms of play, 
but the four-year-old may enjoy only the first. Picture 
the summer hotel amusements. The smallest children 
pick up the quoits, stand anywhere, throw anyhow, in no 
order, just for the fun of throwing. At six or seven a small 
group of them will be taking turns in pitching. Then 
come arguments as to how far off to stand, and how to 
count the score, and whose turn it is to pitch. By ten or 
eleven, a larger group will have evolved more rules, and 
are likely to pick sides before beginning, and to count, 
not each individual’s score, but the total of each opposing 
group. The adolescents are almost sure to do this, and 
to go on to arrange for a tournament. This particular 
game hardly lends itself to development into the real 
fifth type; but there will be shown a consciousness of the 
value of handicaps, of a scorekeeper, and of an umpire. 
The well-meaning adult who would insist upon the rules 
of scoring for the little children, or the tournament for the 
67
-P-A-G-E-84
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
nine-year-olds, would be forcing growth into adult stand- 
ards prematurely. 
Educative Since “we learn by doing”’ it would seem that the more 
made: passive a child is in his play the less he is likely to learn. 
Throicy So again the fact is emphasized that the plaything at 
which he is amused, but which does not stimulate him by 
further action with it, is not the best choice. Again, end- 
less unvarying repetition of the same activity after skill 
has been acquired is not educative. Therefore, unless it 
is enjoyed as a hygienic relaxation for muscles, or provides 
an emotional outlet for harassed nerves, we might be 
justified in seeking to introduce some form of play more 
conducive to progress. 
However, passivity must not be confused with bodily 
quiet. Outwardly a child may be passive when he is 
watching moving pictures or reading a book; but the 
activity of the mind may be very great, and therein, of 
course, lies the educative value. 
In brief, any play through which a child is led to 
acquire information, to develop skill, to exercise aesthetic 
judgment or to gain practice in solving problems may be 
said to be educative—to the degree that the facts learned, 
or the power produced, have values in themselves. 
Moral Let us consider the opportunity for learning moral 
Seeres lessonsin play. The five-year-old’s biggest social problem 
Turns is that of adapting himself to the necessity of taking turns. 
This has two aspects, first, that of waiting for his own 
turn, second, that of quitting a pleasant occupation so 
that someone else may have a turn. If these enormously 
important lessons are not well learned at the start there 
will be endless trouble in the next five or six years, to say 
nothing of a possible twist in the wrong direction all 
through life. When difficulties arise, adult suggestion is 
of greater help than reprimand or a sudden interference. 
When a veritable hair-pulling contest occurs as two small 
people simultaneously desire to use the same toy, it is 
68
-P-A-G-E-85
His ActiIvE NATURE AND NEEDS 
easy to see how ineffective a mere authoritative judgment 
may be. It only introduces a third angle into the situa- 
tion instead of helping the mutual adjustment of the two 
combatants. Consequently, the solution is many times 
simply deferred, while resentment smoulders, or a sly child 
watches for a chance to obtain what he wants by a trick. 
The friendly coéperation of the adult is what is needed, 
in order to find the reasonable way to act when personal 
desires conflict. 
Another type of moral lesson comes when the eight- 
year-old finds his friends jeering at cowardice, and in- 
credulous of bluff. He finds he can win regard by deeds 
rather than words, by meeting demands for stunts, by 
never refusing a dare, by making good a boast. The 
cowardice of the sneak and the telltale meets with such 
open disapproval by the rest of the crowd that the earlier 
tendency to run to mamma with grief and grievances is 
soon checked. A boy learns that he must adjust differ- 
ences within the group, without a weak leaning on outside 
authority. He learns, too, that he must stand up for his 
own rights or be despised as a weakling. 
As free play is superseded by the game, the necessity 
of rules awakens a consciousness of what playing fair 
means. ‘To prevent others from taking advantage, each 
child must watch the other player to prevent cheating. 
In turn, his own selfish desires are held in check by the 
knowledge that his playmates are just as watchful lest he 
transgress the rules. What an immense amount of argu- 
ment and squabbling can be heard as children are learning 
this lesson of fair play. 
By ten or eleven a boy, at least, is learning lessons of 
group loyalty, how to stand by the others in trouble, how 
to share his good things with the rest, how to plan with 
them for added enjoyment. The girl, somehow, learns 
this less thoroughly, or shall we say, with greater diffi- 
culty and more slowly. Certain petty jealousies remain

as a divisive force, hindering the coéperation of the girls’ 
group asa unit. Tendencies to snub the others, to retain 
ideas of caste and clique persist into adolescence, when 
girls find it so much more difficult than boys do to play 
the team game heartily. Where the play director succeeds 
in coaching a girl team it has been against heavy odds, 
and has required much continued stimulation. Even so, 
fewer girls than boys engage in team games; and 
when they do, the self conscious talk about the team is in 
marked contrast to the spontaneous enthusiasms of their 
brothers. 
A moral lesson all may learn is that of admiration for 
honest effort as well as for brilliant results. Important 
lessons for the teen age are those of generosity to oppon- 
ents in the hour of triumph over them, and of contest 
without bitterness of spirit. 
How we could wish that these lessons, learnable in 
play, might be carried over into business, industrial and 
national relationships. 
Such motor control tests as exist and have been stand- 
ardized are either of the laboratory “performance” kind, 
or gymnasium tests of strength and steadiness; they are 
not very suggestive in a concrete way as to what to expect 
from children in the way of ordinary tasks. A beginning 
has been made, with children under four, to specify what 
physical skills are normal. In general, motor control 
begins with the larger, older, fundamental muscles, so 
that fine coérdinations cannot be made by young children. 
Much awkwardness at different ages is due to the 
irregularities of growth. Increase in size is not uniform, 
it proceeds by alternate spurts and resting periods. All 
parts of the body follow this law; spurts in one part do not 
parallel spurts in another, so that children are constantly 
readjusting their habits of motor control. 
Play life shows a hunger for physical activity suitable 
for the stage of growth reached. Children need space and

His ActTIvVE NATURE AND NEEDS 
time to play, as well as equipment over which they can 
exercise control. They also need play companions and 
opportune guidance to higher levels of development. 
Boys are consistently more interested in mechanics 
and large constructive activities, in roaming and hunting, 
and, in the adolescent period, tend to specialize on a few 
violent team games and sports. Girls are more drawn to 
decorative constructive work, to dolls, to a greater variety 
of games, and are less violently active in the teens. 
Imaginative play shows marked age differences, as does 
the interest in languages. The most significant age change 
is in the progressive socialization from the individualistic 
play of the three-year-old to the team game of the sixteen- 
year-old. Educational values of getting information and 
exercising aesthetic judgment are involved in play, as 
well as the obvious values in hygiene and acquisition of 
physical skill. Moral values include the development of 
physical courage, but chiefly a recognition of the rights of 
others, as shown by taking turns, giving up, playing fair, 
appreciating others’ efforts, being a good loser and a 
generous winner.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTELLECT IN CHILDHOOD 
AND YOUTH 
N THE traditional descriptions of the development of 
the intellect, it has been usual to describe first the 
development of the senses, then the development of 
perception, of memory, of association, imitation, imagi- 
nation, conception, judgment, and reasoning. In so 
describing these various aspects of mental development, 
the development of the mind as a whole has frequently 
not been clearly envisaged. In the simplest and earliest 
of childhood experiences and even in one and the same 
experience, all of these phases of mental activity may be 
involved. Further, such descriptions often gave the 
impression that we had to do with quite different processes 
in these various activities, whereas in perception and 
reasoning, for example, the same elementary processes 
occur; it is a difference of degree and complexity rather 
than of kind of process. 
Even in the current descriptions of the ‘“‘perceptual’’, 
“ideational” and “rational” levels or stages of the develop- 
ment of the intellect, the continuity of these processes and 
the common elements involved are sometimes lost sight 
of. Ifa parent should wish to gauge the development of 
his child he might note that in various respects, as in 
sensory discrimination, as of colors and sounds, in his 
forming of concepts, in his acquirement of speech, and in 
the growth of his vocabulary, the child was the equal of, 
or was superior or inferior to the children described in the 
literature treating of the matter, but he might still remain 
in doubt as to whether on the whole (and that is what he 
72 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
    
THE DEVELOPMENT OF His INTELLECT 
usually would wish to know) the child’s development 
should be considered normal (or average), retarded or 
accelerated. This unsatisfactory condition, from the 
standpoint of the parents’ inquiry, may be attributed in 
part to the fact above emphasized that the literature had 
dealt with special phases of development rather than with 
development as a whole, and in part to another condition,— 
namely, that existing studies were seldom based on a 
sufficient number of children of different ages to make it 
possible to decide as to what was normal or what excep- 
tional in a child of a given age. 
Our knowledge in both of these respects has been 
greatly extended in recent years as a result of the initial 
contributions of the French psychologist, Alfred Binet, 
and of his collaborator, Th. Simon, and their many dis- 
ciples, through the construction and application of tests 
of general intelligence. In order that this advance in our 
knowledge may be fairly appraised we shall need to review 
briefly the problems which confronted the psychologist 
in his earlier attempts at the measurement of intelligence. 
It may be well to note, in the first place, that, in 
attempting to estimate or measure differences in intelli- 
gence, and to separate human beings into different groups, 
we meet in a new form, a very common difficulty. Clean- 
cut division between people has been the goal in many 
fields of testing. Dr. MacFie Campbell reminds us that 
“fon one historical occasion a speech test was relied on 
as an infallible diagnostic criterion and that whoever 
could not pronounce the word ‘shibboleth’ satisfactorily 
was deemed an Ephraimite and was slain at the passage 
of the Jordan.” And as Dr. Campbell adds: ‘The 
victorious men of Gilead probably worried little over the 
fact that diagnostic mistakes may have occurred; the test 
gave much satisfaction, because it was easy to apply, took 
up little time, and gave a clean-cut answer which did not 
require further thinking.”

for Tests of 
General In- 
telligence
-P-A-G-E-92
    The Contri- 
butions of 
Binet and 
Simon THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
Similar merits—easy to apply, take little time, and 
give a clean-cut answer—have been long sought for in 
mental tests. At one time it was thought that tests of 
the acuity of the senses would do, since all intellectual 
life must depend ultimately on some sensory experience. 
But it was soon found that individuals might have very 
defective sense organs, or, as in the case of Laura Bridg- 
man and Helen Keller, be bereft of the chief avenues of 
sense and still give evidence of a very considerable de- 
velopment of intelligence. 
Similarly since all thought and intellectual activity 
eventually results in action, it was and is still believed by 
many that tests of motor skill, of the precision and accu- 
racy of movement, would give the desired differentiation. 
But some of the most intellectual of men are notoriously 
clumsy and awkward, if one confines attention to gross 
bodily movements or even to such fine adjustments as 
are involved, for example, in handwriting. 
The next attempt was to devise tests of what seemed 
more distinctly intellectual processes,—the quickness of 
reactions, the speed, wealth and quality of associations, 
the extent and quality of memory, and the presence or 
absence or the degree of success in reasoning in concrete 
and so-calied abstract situations. Here again it was found 
that an individual might have, for example, a very good 
memory, at least for some things, and in other respects be 
adjudged feeble-minded. 
In a word, in the long history of mental testing no 
single infallible test or ‘“‘shibboleth” had been found. In 
the last two decades, however, a marked change has been 
made in the situation, due to the genius of the two French- 
men named below. As not infrequently happens, the 
discoveries—for such they are—seem so simple that one 
wonders that they had not been thought of before, and 
their importance is at first minimized. Two important 
changes were introduced by Binet and Simon. The first 
74 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
THE DEVELOPMENT OF His INTELLECT 
and more obvious was that, since no single test was suffi- 
cient, a combination of a number of tests or problem 
situations might be used, the average of which would 
give a more representative value than any one test alone. 
Up to the time of Binet, then, it is fair to say that the 
psychologist had followed the same method in his attempts 
at measuring intelligence as he had previously followed 
in his descriptions of intellectual development. Binet, 
however, recognized that the memory, for example, could 
not be tested apart from the senses, or association without 
involving attention and he gave up the attempt to sepa- 
rate the intellectual processes involved., He chose instead 
situations at first simple, then of~ncreasing complexity 
and difficulty, but still within the possible range of the 
experience of the individual, in the meeting or solving of 
which his general mental development might be tested. 
This was Binet’s general plan. Some of his tests, as, for 
example, the tests of rote memory differed, it is true, but 
little, if at all, from the earlier proposals for the testing of 
single capacities, and in other tests, as, for example, the 
arranging of five wooden cubes of the same size but differ- 
ing in weight, in the order of their weight, a single capacity 
such as the sensory discrimination required, may seem to 
be the more important element involved. It was, there- 
fore, not simply the sort of test which he applied, but his 
idea of combining or averaging the results of these single 
tests and problem situations as a measure of the growth 
of the individual which was the primary reason for the 
success of his method. 
_ The usefulness of this method was greatly enhanced 
by a second ‘and also very practical proposal: that com- 
parison of individuals could be made in terms of the 
average development or attainment of children of various 
ages, the now familiar concept of mental age: that, for 
example, a boy of ten who can only pass mental tests 
which the general run of seven-year-old children can pass 
75

What the 
Tests Test 
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
may be said to have a mental age of seven and give evi- 
dence of possibly three years of retardation in mental 
development. 
In order to establish such mental age norms it was 
necessary to test large numbers of children of all ages. 
This has now been done in nearly all the civilized countries 
of the globe so that for the first time the psychologist is 
in a position to say what is normal and what is excep- 
tional in the matters at least which the tests evaluate. 
Even with this “battery” of tests which Binet and 
those who have revised and extended his series of tests 
have produced, some phases or specializations of mental 
development may be missed in the case of exceptional 
individuals. Before, however, speaking of such limita- 
tions which still exist in these attempts to determine 
intellectual development, we shall need to examine the 
tests of various age levels in order better to appraise the 
positive contributions which have resulted from their use. 
We must first have clearly in mind what the tests are 
designed to measure. They are not really tests of native 
intelligence as distinct from learning but are used to 
estimate the native intelligence by seeing how much has 
been acquired from the ordinary experiences of the indi- 
vidual as apart from special training. ‘‘Theoretically”’, 
to quote from a recently published statement of the 
writer, “it would follow that measurement of the actual 
progress of representative learning would furnish the best 
test of intelligence. For practical reasons most tests now 
in common use are not tests of the capacity to learn, but 
are tests of what has been learned. The assumption is 
made that if one samples the results of learning in matters 
where all the individuals tested have had an equal chance 
at learning, he may arrive at an estimate of the capacity 
to learn. But since it is difficult to find even simple 
experiences which are common to all individuals of a 
given age period, actually, again, one tries by sampling

THE DEVELOPMENT OF His INTELLECT 
a large range of fairly common experiences to strike an 
‘average’ which, despite the fact that a given individual 
may have missed this or that experience, will still be 
representative of the individual’s learning.” 
With these considerations in mind a description of 
the tests at certain mental age levels will illustrate the 
means by which the intellectual development of the indi- 
vidual is gauged. Our examples will be taken from Kuhl- 
mann’s and Terman’s Revisions and Extensions of the 
Binet-Simon tests. 
Kuhlmann has standardized tests for the ages of three 
months, six months, twelve months, eighteen months, 
and two years. The following are the tests for the third 
month:—1. Carrying hand or object to mouth. A small 
block or other object is placed in the infant’s hand. 
The question is: Has the infant sufficient motor coérdi- 
nation and control to carry the block (or his hand) to the 
mouth more or less at will and not merely through random 
or chance movements? 2. Reaction to sudden sounds. 
Does the infant “start” or wink when a telegraph snapper 
is sounded within a few inches of his ear, or when the 
examiner claps his hands behind the infant’s head? 
3. Binocular coordination. Can the infant follow with its 
eyes a bright light, such as an electric light, which is 
moved to and fro or up and down a few feet away from 
its eyes, and without showing especial incoérdination 
even when the eyes are turned to extreme position? 
4. Turning eyes to object in marginal field of vision. Will 
the child turn its eyes (or head) toward a bright light 
which is moved in the marginal field of vision? 5. Wink- 
ing at an object threatening the eyes. Does the infant 
wink when a large object such as a hat, or the flat side 
of a book is “passed’”’ suddenly toward his eyes? 
The tests for the age of twelve months are as follows: 
1. Sitting and standing. Can the infant sit unsupported 
for two or three minutes or stand unsupported for five

seconds or more? 2. Speech. Can the infant say, “‘ba,”’ 
“dada’”’, “nana’’, “mama’’, “papa’’, or other combina- 
tions of two or three syllables, or will it try to repeat 
such syllables: or words when they are spoken to it. 
3. Imitation of movements. If a rattle is shaken in front 
of the infant and then placed in its hand, or if its hand is 
shaken while holding the rattle, will the infant repeat the 
movement or are there any other movements such as 
nodding the head, pursing the lips which it can be brought 
toimitate? 4. Marking with pencil. Will the infant try to 
mark on paper if given a pencil and paper, especially 
after seeing the examiner mark on the paper? Or, if the 
examiner takes the infant’s hand and makes some marks 
with the pencil, will the infant then try to make more 
marks? 5. Recognition of objects. If several objects, such 
as a ball, rattle, bell, or blocks are placed before the 
infant, will it reach for any one of them? On repeated 
trials does it show a preference for any one thing rather 
than another? The test is passed on satisfactory evidence 
that the infant discriminates objects, gives undoubtable 
signs of the recognition of persons or shows preferences 
in its choice of playthings. 
The tests for age five are, according to Terman’s 
revision, as follows: 1. Comparison of weights. Can the 
child tell which is the heavier of two weights of 3 and 15 
grams respectively? 2. Naming colors. Can the child 
recognize and name the four primary colors, red, yellow, 
blue and green? 3. Aesthetic Comparison. Can the child 
tell which is the prettier of two pictures, one depicting an 
ugly and the other a pretty face? 4. Definitions, in terms 
of use or better. When asked what is a chair, what is a 
fork, what is a doll, is he able to define these words at 
least in terms of use, e.g., ‘‘a chair is to sit on’, “a fork 
is to eat with’’, etc. 5. The game of patience. Prepare 
two rectangular cards and divide one of them into two 
triangles by cutting it along one of its diagonals. The 
78
-P-A-G-E-97
THE DEVELOPMENT OF His INTELLECT 
test consists in seeing if the child can put the triangles 
together so as to match the rectangular card. 6. Three 
convmissions. If the child is told to “put a key on the 
chair, to shut a door and bring a box to the examiner’, 
is he able to execute these commissions? 
The tests of the ninth year are as follows: 1. Giving 
the date—the week, month, day of month and year. 
2. Arranging five weights, identical in appearance and size 
and weighing 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 grams, in order from the 
lightest to heaviest. 3. Making change. For example, 
‘if I were to buy 4 cents worth of candy and should give 
the store keeper 1o cents, how much money would I get 
back”? 4. Repeating four digits backwards—6-5-2-8. 
5. Using three words in a sentence, e.g., make a sentence 
which has the words “boy”, “ball” and “‘river’’ in it. 
6. Finding rhymes. Three rhymes for each word (a) day, 
(b) mill, (c) spring. 
The last two tests of year nine depend in good part 
on the individual’s facility in the use of language. Simi- 
larly, among the tests of the higher ages are tests of the 
subject’s vocabulary, of his knowledge of abstract words, 
of the fluency of his verbal associations, of his ability 
to read and report on what he has read, of his ability to 
understand fables. There is, thus, little question but 
that the linguistic abilities of the subject are given a 
little too much weight in the general estimate of the 
individual’s development, especially in the upper ages 
of the revisions of the Binet tests. Children from homes 
where a foreign language is spoken, or from homes of 
certain social levels where there is little interest in reading 
or where even conversation is very limited in scope are 
at a disadvantage in these tests. The development of 
their intellectual abilities may, however, be considerable, 
only it has taken a quite different course. This is one of 
the limitations of this series of tests. For this reason, 
other tests (of skill in performance, of practical ingenuity,

etc.) are being proposed in which linguistic and, in general, 
scholastic training does not play so large a part. Even 
a child brought up in a cultivated home may sometimes 
show a surprising slowness in the development of some 
single ability, and it is always necessary before coming to 
conclusions about his mental development to take cogni- 
zance of other balancing factors. A perfectly normal 
child may occasionally be a year or more behind the 
average of his age in learning to speak. This sometimes 
happens in the case of an only child who is brought up 
with adults, and has had little acquaintance with other 
children. Such a retardation may be made up for by 
subsequent acceleration when the child finally essays 
speech. Before this occurs his development may be 
better gauged by his greater skill in using his hands, in his 
recognition of color and form, by his knowledge of direc- 
tion and locality, in his appreciation of the niceties of 
dress, in his social behavior, etc., etc. 
Such observations simply show the need of extending 
in practice the fundamental ideas of Binet which have 
been set forth, We may now turn to some of the 
findings and conclusions in regard to intellectual develop- 
ment which have resulted from the use of these and 
similar tests. 
Although the tests themselves do not supply con- 
clusive evidence in the matter it has been customary to 
assume that development is more rapid in the early years, 
say up to the age of five, and that the increments are 
decreasingly less up to the time of maturity when the 
influence of growth, as a factor more or less separate from 
training, ceases. The growth curve of the average indi- 
vidual may be pictured by the continuous line of Fig. 
I, p. 81, although there is perhaps just as good reason 
for representing it by the straight dotted line. In either 
case the first really important finding of the tests is that 
the majority of individuals tend to follow the same 
80
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE DEVELOPMENT OF His INTELLECT 
general course of development as this average. This 
may be illustrated by the growth curves of a superior, a 
normal and an inferior individual Fig. 2 p. 82, So far as 
the tests can determine, the superior individual is superior 
to start with and the inferior individual inferior at the 
start. This is indicated on the chart by a small space “~

separating the beginning of the curves. The inferior 
individual develops at a slower rate and reaches the 
period of the cessation of growth at a-somewhat earlier 
age than the average; the superior individual develops 
at a more rapid rate than the average and continues his 
development for a somewhat longer time. The character- 
istics and training of inferior and of superior children are 
discussed in detail in Chapters XIII and XIV.

It is a mooted question as to when intellectual develop- 
ment ceases on the average. By our present tests the 
increments are not measurable in the case of the average 
individual long after the age of fourteen or fifteen. This 
finding has led to much misunderstanding and contro- 
versy, and is indeed not easy to interpret. We have been ~%& 2 96

accustomed to think of the individual as developing 
until at least the infirmities of old age become apparent. 
And it is true that there may be a continuing increase in 
knowledge and in breadth of experience, but it appears 
that when the average adult is faced with numerous 
situations as new to him as to the fifteen-year-old, in 
which he has not had special training and experience, 
(and he cannot have had extended acquaintance in all the 
82
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE DEVELOPMENT OF His INTELLECT 
possible specializations of human knowledge and experi- 
ence) the general level of his performance is no better 
than the fourteen or fifteen-year-old. However this 
may be, it is sufficient for the purposes of the present 
discussion to note that the feeble-minded do not reach the 
average of fourteen or fifteen years, while presumably 
the specially gifted or endowed may continue to develop 
intellectually much beyond the average period. 
These differences in development are now commonly 
expressed in terms of the ratio of the chronological age 
to the mental age of the individual, the so-called “‘intelli- 
gence quotient,’ which is obtained by dividing the 
mental age by the chronological age of the individual, 
as explained further in Chapters XIII and XIV. A child 
of 10 with a mental age of ro has an intelligence quotient 
(or IQ) of too, a second child of the same chronological 
age but a mental age of 12 has an intelligence quotient 
of 120; a third child of age 10 and mental age 8 has an IQ 
of 80. Repeated tests of the same individuals have shown 
that the intelligence quotient tends to remain constant 
during the greater part of the period of growth. The 
special importance of this finding lies in the fact that 
one may predict the probable curve of development 
when the test is made in the early years of life. An IQ 
of 100 means that a child is likely to continue to grow at 
the average rate, one of 120 that his growth will be 20% 
more rapid, and an IQ of 80, 20% less rapid than the 
average. 
Similar facts have been discovered in regard to physical 
development. Repeated measurements of the same 
individuals have shown that the boy or girl who is taller 
than the average at five years of age is likely to remain 
taller, and the one who is shorter is likely to remain 
shorter than the average until at least the adolescent 
period. At the latter period in the case of growth in 
stature there may be a considerable shifting in these

‘relations. In how far this is true of mental development 
has not yet been determined. It must be noted that 
there are also individual exceptions to this general rule 
of the constancy of the intelligence quotient during the 
earlier years of growth. In these individuals the course 
of development is irregular and uneven. The reasons 
for these individual variations have not been sufficiently 
studied. Severe illness and social isolation may some- 
times account for retarded development; a process of 
“hot housing” which is sometimes resorted to by over 
ambitious parents—may produce at least temporary 
acceleration in development. In others the cause appears 
to be inherent. As Cyril Burt has said in speaking of 
children whose growth has been retarded,— “Such 
children are creatures of deferred maturity. Their 
development is not arrested; it has been postponed. 
Although upon a lower plane, their mental growth runs 
parallel with that of many cleverer children, in whom the 
phenomenon is more familiar. There is many a sharp 
child whose cycle of growth is like that of the mulberry 
tree, presenting first a long delay, and then a sudden 
yield of flower and fruit together. Their existence is 
recognized in the double scholarship examination. In 
London at the age of thirteen a second examination has 
been instituted specifically for those who in the current 
phrase ‘bloom late’, and whose anticipated powers, 
therefore, do not ripen by the age of ten. In like fashion, 
among the classes for defectives, time and due season will 
here and there disclose a sporadic ‘school autumnal’.” 
In how far these peculiarities in mental development 
may depend on corresponding changes in the general 
physical or physiological development is a question, 
the answer to which must probably await a study of a 
sufficient number of individuals by means of both physical 
and mental tests repeated at regular intervals throughout 
the whole period of growth.

  THE DEVELOPMENT OF His INTELLECT 
Such a comprehensive investigation was begun a 
year ago at Harvard University by the writer with the 
aid of a subvention of the Commonwealth Fund. Over 
3000 first-grade children were examined with a series of 
mental, physical and scholastic tests with the intention 
of repeating these measurements annually on the same 
children or as many of them as remain in school over a 
period of ten or twelve years. The physical measures 
include height and weight and bodily proportions, 
dentition and ossification as shown by X-ray photographs 
of the carpal bones. 
“Our present opinion”’, to quote from a recent state- 
ment of the present writer, “which may or may not be 
substantiated, but which is based on repeated obser- 
vations on a relatively small number of individuals, is 
that we shall find . . . the following conditions: 
A child somewhat backward in mental development, 
whose yearly increments in mental age have been small 
and who on repeated examination proves to be corre- 
spondingly backward in general physiological develop- 
ment, may frequently make up for his slow start before 
he reaches maturity. The prognosis in his case would be 
better than in the case of a child of the same early mental 
level but who, at the same time, is found to be physiologi- 
cally well along in the course of development. The fact 
that he has come on so well in general physical develop- 
ment in the early years without corresponding mental 
growth would make his prospects less hopeful. Similarly, 
some of our much heralded prodigies, who have rather 
petered out in later years, may prove to have maintained 
their relative superiority for a few years because of early 
maturing, supplemented by a kind of hot-housing.”’ 
The basis of the above expressed opinion may be 
illustrated by reviewing briefly the observations and 
test findings of two or three children whom the writer 
has recently described elsewhere. 
85 Illustrative 
Cases
-P-A-G-E-104
  
An 
Interesting 
Case. 
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
Among the cases observed in which slow or average 
development in the early years has been followed by 
rapid physical and mental development later on in the 
period of growth is that of a girl who at the age of 9 
years and 11 months had a mental age, as determined by 
the intelligence tests, of g years and 10 months, and an 
intelligence quotient of 99. Three years later she attained 
in the tests a mental age of 17 years and 8 months and an 
intelligence quotient of 136,—a gain of 37 points. At 
the time of the first examination she was at about the 
68th percentile in physical height of girls of her own age; 
at the end of the three years she was at the 87th percentile. 
The acceleration in mental development was thus accom- 
panied by a somewhat corresponding acceleration in 
physical growth. 
A girl who entered school at the age of six had, as a 
result of systematic instruction which her parents had 
begun when she was three years old, covered the regular 
work of the first four or five grades of school. She 
secured on examination with the general intelligence tests 
a mental age of between 11 and 12 years and an intelli- 
gence quotient well over 160. Ina series of performance 
tests for which this previous coaching had not prepared 
her, she did but little better than children of her own age. 
Although physically weak, of slender build and frequently 
ill, there was some evidence of a certain physiological 
development in advance of her age which may have been 
in part the result of the intensive training and _hot- 
housing to which she had been subjected. Her present 
superiority in the mental and scholastic tests would 
appear to be due in good part to these factors. If this 
is the case, the following are some of the possibilities in 
her subsequent development: (1) she ‘‘may continue her 
unbalanced development with a resulting freakish intel- 
lect or genius within very narrow limits; (2) the physiologi- 
cal changes of adolescence may be completely unsettling, 
86
-P-A-G-E-105
  CHE DEVELOPMENT OF His INTELLECT 
with a nervous breakdown and the development of 
psychopathic traits; (3) the demands of general somatic 
development may become such that the initial acceleration 
in development proves purely temporary and the child 
settles back to the general level of mediocrity.” 
‘“‘A different result is indicated in the case of a boy 
first examined in 1918 at the age of five years and nine 
months. In four successive annual examinations his 
intelligence quotient has closely approximated 100. His 
parents are both of exceptional abilities, and, because of 
the child’s general health and some suspicions of defective 
heart action, they have let nature take its course in the 
child’s development. His present mental status is, it 
is believed, due chiefly to his native intelligence. Physical 
and physiological measurements and indices, including 
dentition and ossification, indicate slow development— 
a condition which may by the time of the pubertal accelera- 
tion lead to his passing well above the general average 
of hisage. The prognosis is one which repeated measure- 
ments can alone, at present, test.”’ 
The above cases illustrate the possibilities in the 
current investigations of development. A further analysis 
of the relative influence of native endowment, physio- 
logical maturity, health and environment,—the last to 
include the effects of special training,—by means of 
repeated tests and observations of the same individuals, 
offers the promise of a better understanding than we now 
have of some of the persistent problems in the develop- 
ment of the intellect in childhood and youth. 
The above account of the development of the intellect 
in childhood and youth does not attempt to describe the 
many variations which may appear, nor to do justice to 
the complex of factors which affect the growth of the 
intellect. One individual may be characterized by an 
extraordinary plasticity or strength of memory, another 
be conspicuous for rare powers of imagination, and a

third for an unimaginative but acutely logical mind. 
Further specialization of abilities may be found within 
these general divisions of the mind: one person’s memory 
may be much better for some things than for others; 
another may reason well in mathematics and poorly in 
finance. These differences cannot be neglected in de- 
scribing the intellectual development of any given 
individual; yet the fact remains that the most important 
recent advance in our knowledge of the growth of the 
intellect has come about through a method which obscures 
these differences by striking a balance or average of the 
individual’s abilities to find a measure of his general 
intelligence. This chapter has dealt chiefly with the 
more significant findings as well as limitations of this 
method. 
The chief advantage of the method is that it offers a 
means of viewing the intellectual development as a whole. 
The need of a correlative study of physical and physio- 
logical development has been pointed out above, and for 
many practical purposes, the study of the more strictly 
intellectual development must also be supplemented by 
and interpreted in terms of knowledge in regard to the 
emotional and volitional life of the individual, such as 
is given in other chapters of this book. It thus appears 
that although one’s immediate concern be with the growth 
of the intellect, the subject is but a chapter in the study 
of the individual organism as a whole.

THE Curttp’s MorAt EQUIPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT 
as the best diet for a normal child of given age, 
our study would hardly have to take account of 
much else. We could decide upon the proper food for 
the child without considering other facts about him. 
But the case is quite different when we are concerned 
with moral development. The moral nature is not 
something which can be understood apart from other 
life-problems. On the contrary, it is most intimately 
bound up with all that the child feels and does and 
thinks in every one of the many inter-related fields of his 
life. | 
In this respect, the child is no different from his 
elders. There was a time, for example, when scholars 
singled out for special study the tendency to imitate; 
and they told us that character was largely a matter of 
imitation. Yet why do we grown-ups imitate people 
who are unworthy of the compliment? Many answers 
can be given—we have never been taught any better, 
or we are indifferent, or we are the victims of our habits. 
All these reasons are bound up with others which have no 
distinctly moral significance. For instance, a weak will 
may be largely the result of poor health. But the same 
is true of the child. All sorts of conditions play their 
part in shaping his character. 
Fortunately, these influences are more or less capable 
of control and wise direction.: One such influence we 
may designate by the general term “knowledge”. Some- 
times children go wrong because the better way is un- : OUR problem here were such a simple matter

known tothem. Or even when they do know, they forget. 
But in recent years, the psychologists have had to remind 
us that it is also necessary to have the right disposition. 
Unless a child really wants to become the splendid type 
of man or woman we hope, all our holding up of heroes 
to admire will be of little avail. If the child does 
not genuinely care for the better things, it is because 
there are other wants which are stronger. Which 
desires, therefore, are more likely to be carried out? 
Plainly the right of way will be taken by those desires 
which the child is most in the habit of expressing. Hence 
neither feeling alone nor knowledge, but habit and 
practice have much to do with moral behavior. Habit 
alone, however, is insufficient; because bad habits must 
be broken; and in order to get the better ones started, 
there must be some sufficiently powerful incentive. 
Nor must we leave out of sight the influence exercised 
by the condition of the child’s health. Like their parents 
and teachers, children are less apt to be amiable and 
self-controlled when they are fatigued; and now the best 
schools and homes take every precaution to avoid un- 
necessary strain. Or sometimes we call a child lazy 
when his chief trouble may be that he is undernourished. 
It is a good thing that in our best juvenile courts to-day, 
there are psychiatrists who keep us from pronouncing 
the old final verdict of “bad’’ upon children who need 
neither a court nor punishment, but the attention of a 
physician and a nerve specialist. When we consider how 
difficulties in the way, for example, of a proper sex 
hygiene and sex morality, may be met by a careful study 
of the child’s general health, his food, his clothing, his 
sleeping, his sports, the state of his nerves, we see how 
mistaken it is to look upon the moral nature as a single 
faculty sharply separated from the rest of life. There is 
no such thing as a distinct training in character apart 
from the rest of the child’s development. 
90
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE CHILD’s MORAL DEVELOPMENT 
Our problem, therefore, is to be worked out in general 
along these three lines: (1) Any experiences at all which 
arouse distaste for what is vile and love for what is 
admirable, make it likely that the child will choose more 
wisely among the courses of conduct open to him. (2) 
Any knowledge which increases his understanding of 
human life offers a help to a sound choice. (3) Any 
training in persistent, resolute, efficient carrying out of 
sensible purposes increases the likelihood that the child’s 
life as a whole will be effectively self-directed. 
Before considering what resources his elders can bring 
to bear upon this development, let us look first at what 
the child brings on his own account. The old-fashioned 
training assumed that morality could be imposed from 
without. This was a mistake. We can force an external 
obedience; but a genuine character is always the outcome 
of what the child himself wishes at heart to do and to be. 
At a very early stage he already shows that he has likes, 
dislikes, impulses, propensities of his own. In recent 
years these have received close study; and thanks to the 
writings of such men as Hall, Barnes, Dewey, Thorndike, 
Freud and others, we know that, troublesome as these 
impulses are, they are also our best allies. Our cue is to 
try as far as we can not to antagonize them, but to turn 
them into fruitful directions. For example, many boys 
love to hunt squirrels or birds. A wise training will not 
stop with telling them that it is cruel to take life for sport 
but will direct the hunting tendency into a desire to get a 
good photograph of the wild creature, or to come close 
enough to make an accurate drawing, or to give a correct 
description at the meeting of the Scouts or the Wood- 
crafters. The mention of these groups suggests how 
another propensity, the gang spirit, instead of being 
combated, can be turned into the pride of membership 
in a club or other association where the groups work and 
. play together in a wholesome way.

Desire for 
Fellowship THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
Here are some of the normal desires of the young which 
we can harness in the interests of moral growth: 
1. Desire for strength: For example, a boy may not 
quit smoking for other reasons, but he may do so when 
convinced that the habit will interfere with his athletic 
achievements. 
2. Desire to earn a living: This is bound up with the 
self-respect and the pride in self-reliance to which many 
an appeal must be made. 
3. Hero worship: The child’s first heroes are the 
people who perform the striking, dramatic, physical 
exploits. Their admiration for firemen, policemen, chauf- 
feurs, baseball stars, can be used in the interests of 
courage, persistence, self-control. As they grow older, 
we must enrich their acquaintance with admirable 
types in worth-while biographies. At every stage, how- 
ever, the strongest influence will be exerted by the living 
examples of friends, parents, teachers. It is well for 
parents to have frequently as their guests at home men 
and women of many different careers in order that the 
children may the better be able to choose their own 
careers and personalities. 
4. Desire for fellowship: Jane Addams tells how a 
group of boys had infected one another with the drug 
habit. At the institution to which they were sent, it 
was at first proposed that the lads be segregated from 
one another; but a wiser counsel was followed, and the 
group spirit which had led them astray was enlisted to 
encourage them to work together for their cure. The 
love of fellowship is intertwined with many other desires. 
It shows itself, for example, in family pride, which may 
lead to the conceit of caste or, on the other hand, to a 
strong incentive to make good for the honor of the family 
name. School spirit is a familiar resource which every 
wise teacher employs. It should in time widen out into 
community spirit and into patriotism. The sacrifices

which people are willing to make for their country indi- 
cates how useful a contribution to moral nurture can 
be reaped from the social impulses.

with the desire to be a member of a group like all other Pis*etion 
members, there is also the wish to stand out and to be Pendence 
one’s own master. The athlete not only wants his school 
to excel, but he desires to be known as the one to make 
this possible. Individual praise is a familiar enough 
incentive. So is the wish to be master of one’s own life. 
Our cue is to get the child to understand as early as 
possible that if we allow him freedom, it is with the 
expectation that he can be trusted to guide himself; 
wisely. Teachers of history and civics have a splendid 
opportunity to bring home to young people the thought 
that freedom is good only to the extent that people use 
it to liberate in themselves what is most deserving of 
such freedom. The best kind of liberty for anyone of us 
is that which encourages and promotes the liberation 
of the highest life in our fellow-beings. 
6. Desire for leadership: This is closely related Desire for 
to the preceding. It is good to gratify it by such “ership 
methods as having the children take turns in leading 
games, occupying executive positions in the school- 
government or in otherwise directing their groups. 
The timid gain self-confidence; and the aggressive get 
the chance to work off their bullying tendencies con- 
structively.

setting up of artificial obstacles for the sheer fun of ‘ P°W* 
getting the better of them, as we see in the working out 
of puzzles or in tennis. This propensity to make a game 
out of difficulties can be used to get children to do useful 
things that would otherwise be distasteful. It has long 
been used in the kindergarten. Experience there has 
shown that wisely directed play is the best beginning for

serious study. In recent years the principle has been 
extended into the grades. 
We must beware, however, of misapplying this 
modern educational doctrine of Interest. It is good to 
have children make a game of the things they dislike to 
do. This does not mean, however, that they should do 
only the easy tasks or drop the harder ones the moment 
the latter become distasteful. Instead, we should use 
every possible means to have children go at the hard 
things with a hearty desire not to let the difficulty frighten 
them, but on the contrary, to let it serve as a challenge 
to the will to power. Otherwise, we shall run the danger 
of having them grow up morally flabby. 
We have already seen how the will to power shows 
itself in the desire for leadership. Children can under- 
stand that to deserve to be leaders, they must train 
themselves. 
The “combative instinct”—another expression of this 
tendency—should be directed into siding with causes 
which are just but which are as yet unpopular. 
8. Desire for justice: Most people are willing to 
observe fair play when once they see clearly enough 
wherein it consists. Here, too, the earliest beginnings 
are laid in children’s games. Normally, they appreciate 
readily enough what it means not to take an advantage 
denied to others. It is our part to cultivate still finer 
practices and finer understandings of just dealing. 
Pupil participation in the government of the school, for 
example, is an indispensable resource for civic training. 
9. Benevolent impulses: Few people are born without 
desires to show kindness and mercy. It is good practice 
to get the children to begin young with the habit of 
considering the needs of those less fortunate than them- 
selves. To make sure that their charities represent a 
genuine feeling, the objects must be people whom the 
children actually know to be in want. We must be on

THE CHILD’s MoRAL DEVELOPMENT 
our guard against arousing these feelings too frequently 
without giving the children a chance to express them in 
acts of honest helpfulness. Otherwise we run the danger 
of encouraging sentimentalism. 
1o. Sex impulses: Capable of doing endless mischief, 
these are also capable, when rightly trained and directed, 
of contributing much to the development of character. 
Chivalry is a single instance. The subject is dealt with 
elsewhere in this volume.! 
11. Religious impulses: Where the religious beliefs 
of the parents and the teachers are sincere, there can be 
no question of the stimulus they offer to worthy conduct. 
The same is true of the children. Search deeply enough, 
and at the roots of every strong character we find rever- 
ence. Whether, however, religious instruction should 
be given in public schools is another matter. Private 
institutions are free to do as they wish. But in our 
public schools it would seem wiser to avoid reviving the 
sectarian antagonisms which are likely to be aroused 
whenever questions of religion are broached. It is better 
to have all the best influences in school and community 
unite upon those moral teachings to which all our citizen- 
ship can subscribe with whole-hearted, unified effective- 
ness. The churches can make their offerings through 
the home, because there they are free to emphasize to the 
full whatever beliefs and practices they regard as most 
distinctive and precious. They can also reach the child 
through the inspiration they afford to the teachers and 
through their efforts, as power-houses of idealism, to 
encourage every spiritual influence at work in the com- 
munity anywhere. The church can contribute largely 
in this way to worthy conduct. Set ar 
All these impulses and tendencies are so intertwined 
that it is impossible to give a complete list which would 
satisfy everybody. Some educators would want us to

include the parental instinct, the instinct of workman- 
ship, self-respect, the “‘combative”’ instinct, etc. In one 
form or another, however, these propensities are men- 
tioned in the list we have given. _It is difficult to make 
a complete list. ° 
Some tendencies, it is evident, represent a higher level 
than others. For example, it is better for a child to do 
things because he is convinced that they are right, than 
simply because he is praised by the teacher. There 
need, however, be no conflict here. Wise teachers will 
use the child’s affection in order the better to cultivate 
his moral judgments. “Do it for my sake” is a useful 
appeal where the higher fails to evoke response. But 
it is unwise to keep the child long upon the level where 
this is the only incentive he accepts. 
In general we must beware of two extremes. One is 
not to direct our appeal too high above the children’s 
heads. A child of seven cannot understand the injunction 
to return good for evil. To insist upon such a teaching 
at this stage, is to encourage him to become a hypocrite. 
We can be satisfied if we get the child, instead of doing 
injury, to drain off his impulses to anger in some harmless 
direction. Hyprocrisy and cant are by all means to be 
avoided. 
The other danger is that we may so frequently appeal 
to only the lower motives that the better ones get little 
chance to grow. It may be necessary for the teacher to 
say that the cheat will be punished if he is caught; but 
if the fear of punishment is the only influence upon which 
he calls, there is little likelihood that the child will ever 
grow into a being who can be trusted where punishment 
is not likely. We get men of honor when we treat boys 
as candidates for such trust. If we find that the higher 
appeal fails, then we must fall back for the time being 
on the lower. But we must never lose sight of the need
-P-A-G-E-115
THe CurILtp’s MorAL DEVELOPMENT 
to get the growth which comes only when the higher 
powers are given real chance for exercise. Trustworthiness 
grows by being trusted. 
What resources from without can we bring to aid in 
the development of these inner tendencies? 
Our leading help must be the providing of oppor- 
tunities for practice. The chief influence in the forming 
of character is what the children themselves do. The 
way to learn perseverance, regularity, promptness, 
justice, kindness, team-spirit, initiative, responsibility, 
is to begin early to practice these essentials. The 
exercise must be secured in as large a variety of fields as 
possible. Promptness in attendance at school, for 
example, is no guarantee in itself that the child will be 
prompt in meeting all his engagements. Habits are in 
the main specific. Sometimes a habit of concentration 
in analyzing sentences may spread over into the work of 
arithmetic; but we can not always be sure that this will 
happen. Self-reliance in studying the textbook will 
not transform itself of its own accord into a habit of 
self-reliant willingness to side with an unpopular minority. 
Obviously we must try to get as much practice as possible 
in the latter case as well. In general, to instil needed 
habits, the familiar formula of William James will be 
found useful: (a) get a good start in a strong motive, 
(b) allow no lapses, (c) seize every favorable chance for 
practice, (d) do not rely on “‘don’ts” but offer a substitute 
for the habit to be displaced. 
In the cities, our schools and homes are now obliged 
to make provision for the forming of habits which the 
old-fashioned life was more likely to encourage without 
special thought upon the matter. In the old village 
days, boys and girls were expected to make things for 
themselves instead of buying them, to take part—and a 
quite responsible part—in the work about the fields,

the barn, the kitchen and the shop. Opportunities to 
start important things in this way and to gain the moral 
growth in holding themselves accountable for the out- 
come are far less open to children in cities to-day, and 
lamentably few for the dwellers in crowded tenements. 
It is for this reason that our schools, instead of confining 
themselves as of old to the teaching of the three R’s, are 
more and more providing occasion through workshops, 
cooking classes, school-gardens, dramatic clubs, etc., for 
that real practice which alone can inculcate the habits 
needed for the building up of strong wills. 
Industry, punctuality, obedience and temperance, 
however, are not the only kinds of habit required. Multi- 
tudes of people with these habits make the quite con- 
tented vassals of self-seeking politicians. Hence, as 
Professor Dewey has been telling us, the future citizens 
of our democracy must be trained in habits of intelligent 
initiative and of intelligent, free codperation. Obedience, 
for example, is a virtue only when the child realizes that 
under certan conditions (e. g. a fire drill) instant, implicit 
response to orders is the best thing for himself and for his 
group. But a sturdy character requires that such 
obedience be intelligent in order that the child may not 
respond unthinkingly to any boss who happens to give 
him orders. Capacity for voluntary team-work is also 
needed. 
For these reasons, it is quite fair to demand that the 
school make every effort to train its pupils in initiative 
and self-directed choice and responsibility. Children 
must have every wise opportunity to plan their own 
courses of action and to hold themselves to account for 
carrying these decisions out from the beginning to the 
end. Because they get such chances in their games, by 
organizing teams, for instance, accepting the responsi- 
bility for the success of their activities, deciding for them- 
selves who is to play at this post or that, what challenges 
98
-P-A-G-E-117
THE CHILD’s MorRAL DEVELOPMENT 
to take or decline, they get a training in will which is not 
only as serviceable as that derived from obeying the 
school’s rules to be punctual but is often more necessary. 
Teachers and parents will do well to study the modern 
“project”? method for the occasions it affords for such 
exercise in self-direction. 
Fathers and mothers know that one of the most 
promising moments in a child’s life comes when he begs 
to be permitted to go on a far errand and pleads that he 
can be trusted. Parents find also that a steady allow- 
ance of spending money with the responsibility for its 
use vested in the boys and girls themselves is a better 
training in self-mastery than for father or mother to 
decide at every step whether they should buy things or 
not. It is easy to see why young folks reared in the 
strictest homes so often go wild when parental control is 
lifted. Untrained in the use of freedom, they abuse it 
when it comes later. 
Along with the training in free self-direction, there 
must be practice in team-work. The best preparation 
for the character required for democratic citizenship is 
that which trains the child to take a free and real share in 
the responsibilities of the groups to which he belongs. 
This is why participation in the government of the school 
should be encouraged as far as possible. Even more 
valuable in some respects are the opportunities offered 
in collective enterprises whose success or failure depends 
entirely (as the running of the school does not) upon the 
children themselves. The best way to learn responsi- 
bility as a member of a group is to share in an enterprise 
which may go to pieces entirely unless all the members 
do their part. A school newspaper or a dramatic per- 
formance or any other such project, willed and put through 
by the children themselves, is an invaluable chance to 
learn how real is the responsibility of a group member to 
his group. Encourage

The Best

Constructive Tue CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
If character is to grow, the necessary practices must 
be guided by an understanding of their meaning. This 
requires an education in two directions—an increasing 
light upon the nature of one’s choices, and a stock of 
ideals to inspire still better choices. We have already 
seen that hard tasks, otherwise disagreeable, are attacked 
the more cheerfully when the child appreciates what 
sense there is in doing them. Hence the value of an 
earnest, skilful, moral instruction designed to broaden 
and deepen the child’s understanding of the excellence 
of right conduct. 
Any suggestions we thus offer must be concrete. 
We never act out ideas of general “goodness” but always 
ideas of specific good deeds. “Be a good citizen at 
home” has a better chance of being carried into practice 
when the child knows that this can be translated speci- 
fically into “Go on errands for your mother cheerfully” 
or “Help your brother in his school-work.” 
Positive suggestions are better than negative. Better 
than “Don’t giggle’ is the advice “Grit your teeth”’. 
Instead of “Don’t strike’, recommend, ‘‘When you are 
angry, breathe deeply’. The younger the children are, 
the more danger there is that holding up “horrible 
examples” may induce them to do the very things we are 
trying to prevent. 
One of the chief obstacles to the child’s accepting of. 
moral instruction is his idea that morality is a life of 
“don’ts’”. The emphasis should therefore be put on the 
fact that the moral life is a way to reach those objects 
which at heart the child most deeply desires. Instead 
of emphasizing the harm, for example, in lying, it is 
better to put the chief stress on the fact that the truthful 
person is the one who is trusted and that he is also, in 
contrast with the liar, strong and brave. Moreover, 
emphasis upon things to avoid is likely to lead to the 
kind of character which does nothing more than conform 
100
-P-A-G-E-119
  Y THE CHILD’s MORAL DEVELOPMENT 
to external regulation. The growing character which of 
its own accord does the sturdy, noble acts, is more likely 
to be developed by its loves than by its fears. 
Suggestions come best from those who are admired 
or respected. ‘The weak teacher who says that he expects 
his boys to behave like gentlemen is likely to be regarded 
as only coaxing them. A teacher who is respected will 
convey such a suggestion with much greater weight. The 
best moral teaching fails to impress unless the teacher is 
already held in high regard. 
The effectiveness of any moral teaching depends in a 
large degree upon the atmosphere at the time. Mothers, 
for example, find the quiet bed-time talks with their 
children an influence for good because at this moment 
there is less need for their words to struggle against the 
array of hostile ideas with which the mind is apt to 
bristle at other times. For similar reasons, the music 
and the address in the school assembly before the day’s 
work begins, the church service, the atmosphere of 
ceremony on great occasions, all make it easier for moral 
teachings to be taken to heart. 
Modern psychologists tell us that indirect suggestions 
imparted in moments of mental quiet are often more 
influential than the most skilful direct exhortations. Say 
openly to a boy who is a confirmed smoker that he ought 
to reduce the number of his cigarettes, and it is quite 
probable that he will allow the counsel no admittance. 
Suppose, however, that he is in the workshop with his 
attention focussed upon the joint which he is framing. 
Now our chance of persuading him is better. A hint or 
two about the smoking while he is busy in this way may 
often be found to-carry its point as if it had come from 
the lad himself instead of from outside. 
The many successes that are credited to the power of 
auto-suggestion in dealing with adults remind us that 
children too are more likely to work for their own better-

ment when they are encouraged to believe that such 
betterment is within their power to achieve. It is far 
better in the main to treat children with a loving trust 
in their better selves than to act as if we expected nothing 
from them but misbehavior. Trust in the better nature 
is absolutely essential to calling it out. Trust begets 
trustworthiness. 
Should moral instruction receive a definite place in 
the school. curriculum? The answer depends upon the 
teacher. Moral instruction is of the greatest usefulness 
where the teachers are in earnest, where they possess the 
necessary skill, where they see that moral instruction is 
only one item in the general program of moral education, 
and where all the moral forces in the school are called 
into play together. The advantages of scheduled moral 
instruction are: (a) the subject is given importance by 
having special time set aside for it; (b) it permits the 
teacher to bring together the results of the children’s 
experiences and thinking in other fields; (c) it offers the 
chance to cultivate habits of moral thoughtfulness and to 
acquire standards of conduct of a higher kind than those 
which are merely customary. 
There are dangers which must be carefully guarded 
against. The subject must not be permitted to become 
tedious. If it is bad for children to think of science or 
literature with dislike because of poor teaching, it is 
worse for them to have such a feeling with respect to an 
ethical life. Wholesale introduction of courses in moral 
instruction everywhere is therefore not to be recom- 
mended. It is better to put the work into the hands of 
only those teachers who possess the necessary competence 
and enthusiasm. Much work is still to be done in our 
normal schools to train future teachers in this necessary 
field. In the meantime, great as the need is for moral in- 
struction, it is better not to spoil things by poor handling. 
102
-P-A-G-E-121
THe CHILp’s MorAL DEVELOPMENT 
Every subject when it is properly taught, offers 
something of moral value for the simple reason, mentioned 
at the beginning, that character is nothing isolated but 
the expression of all that we are. From this viewpoint, 
there is moral value, for example, in arithmetic in so far 
as sound character requires business-like methods. Let 
us glance here, however, at the specific contributions 
which each subject can offer to enlightening the moral 
judgments, elevating moral ideals and infusing them with 
power. Literature, history, civics, geography, science 
are especially fitted to give much. 
Science is a tool by means of which the human race 
has attempted a better mastery over its physical sur- 
roundings. We should try to have our young people 
appreciate their debt to those who have made today’s 
advantages possible. We should also want them to 
cultivate in their own lives the qualities of disinterested, 
persistent, truth-loving investigation by which the 
greatest scientists have been animated. Especially should 
we try to have them understand that science is only a 
tool (it may be misused and work deadly harm) and that 
its efforts must be constantly guided toward the elevation 
and the ennobling of human life. 
History and civics and geography are full of moral 
values when they open the eyes of the children to im- 
portant facts in the problem of how human beings should 
work out the task of living together upon this planet of 
ours. History is a record of certain successes in this 
direction and of many tragic failures. Both the triumphs 
and defeats should serve as inspiration to the better 
citizenship needed everywhere in the world to-day. It is 
obvious that this requires, among other things, such 
personal qualities as fairness, bravery, tolerance, respect 
for divergent excellence, codperative spirit; and many 
opportunities to talk over these needs will present them-

selves to the teacher who keeps in mind the best of the 
reasons for teaching the subjects at all. 
Literature is invaluable because it deals with problems 
of human life in a highly interesting and beautiful manner. 
Sometimes characters in novels or plays are as real to 
young people as the actual persons whom they meet. 
To be as chivalrous as Gareth or Ivanhoe is often the 
unconscious wish of many a lad to whom the poem or the 
story appeals for its own sake as nothing more than an 
interesting tale. The cue for the teacher is to talk over 
these ideals in such a way that the pupils are stimulated 
to put their admiration into practices of theirown. The 
old-fashioned methods made literature something to be 
studied, dissected, memorized. The new methods regard 
literature as something first of all to be loved. Otherwise 
any hope of spiritual value from it is quite futile. 
Eliciting the moral values in the various subjects 
must not be understood here as a substitute for scheduled 
moral instruction, except in those schools where teachers 
are as yet unprepared for the latter work. To inform 
and elevate the children’s ideals, every possible agency 
should be enlisted. 
Much should be made of biographies. Nothing so 
quickens life as contact with life in the great souls of 
the race. Every subject in the curriculum has been 
made possible because human beings in the past have 
handed on these acquisitions of the human spirit. The 
lives of the greatest among these benefactors, in the 
sciences, in art, in the social and moral life of the race, 
should be known and reverenced. Respect for the past 
need not be a bar to progress. On the contrary, the 
truest moral progress will always be found to have its 
roots in a reverent appreciation of the gifts made possible 
by those who have gone before. We have already men- 
tioned what the spirit of hero worship contributes to the 
forming of ideals.

    THe CurItp’s Mora DEVELOPMENT 
The whole process of moral growth is shot through Feelings 
with feeling. Ideals are not matters of cold-blooded ee : 
calculation. They are the suggestions which come out of 
the depths where knowledge and warm feeling are one. 
Hence the need for school and home and community to 
provide those experiences which touch the springs of 
feeling. Patriotic celebrations are outstanding instances 
of the way in which the heart is won over to the side of 
certain civic ideals. Other ideals can be stimulated in 
like manner. 
On this point we may quote the following from a _ Festivals 
pamphlet by Percival Chubb, issued by the Ethical ®4 cere 
Culture School of New York: ‘‘We plead for the incor- 
poration of the festival in the regular activities of the 
school on the general ground that it is important to keep 
alive in the child those feelings of joy and gratitude, of 
admiration and awe, of which the festival has at all times 
been the expression. It is important that the child 
should have an imaginative sense of the great rhythms of 
life and the mighty presence and potencies of Earth the 
mother, Earth the sustainer of his life, Earth the august 
home of his labors. We should preserve in him, if we 
can, something of the child-man’s responsive glow in the 
presence of the changes of nature—Christmas and New 
Year, with their returning light and length of day’s; 
Candlemas, the old mid-winter feast; Easter, with its 
tribute to Flora; Thanksgiving and Harvest Home, with 
their grateful load of winter store. It is more important 
still that the child should recall continually on birthdays 
and death-days the great heroes and martyrs and sages 
to whom the race owes its priceless gifts of liberty and 
humanity; its inventors and voyagers and toilers, its 
singers and artists; as well as the great historical anni- 
versaries and centennials which mark turning-points in 
man’s advance along the centuries. It is by these com- 
memorations as by nothing else that we can feed in the

young those emotions of admiration, reverence, and love 
which are the fundamental forces in educatior as in life. 
It is thus that we can develop—unconsciously, of course— 
that underlying consciousness of kind, of human solidarity, 
of codperative unity, which may offset the crude and 
narrow individualism that everywhere menaces us.” 
In general the findings of modern study offer us both 
a caution and an encouragement. They warn us not to 
try to hurry matters by expecting of children a moral 
understanding beyond their years. Respect the child’s 
stage of growth. Do not force matters. Ask instead 
whether the traits which we are tempted to root out 
immediately may not have something valuable to offer 
to the child’s entire development and whether the worse 
expressions may not normally be outgrown with the 
years. A related caution is to beware of trusting the 
child’s moral development to any one device or resource. 
Character, let it be repeated, cannot be separated from 
everything that the child feels, does, thinks. 
The encouragement to be drawn from modern psycho- 
logic study is that the number of those who can be 
counted morally hopeless is relatively small. Even those 
impulses which so frequently lead to mischief offer instead 
a hope. They are currents of energy which we can allow 
to be harnessed either for good purposes or for bad. The 
child is neither an angel nor a demon but a being with all 
sorts of native propensities whose outcome is shaped by 
the direction in which we guide them. It is just as 
natural for a child’s hand to shape a work of beauty or to 
extend a cup of blessing as to scratch and tear and maim. 
Everything depends upon the practice which the child 
receives in doing the better things, upon the inspirations 
he can be brought to accept, and upon the growing ethical 
understanding with which his mind can be enriched.

VI 
THE SOCIAL TRAITS OF CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH 
\HE term Social will be used in two senses in this 
oe chapter. It will be used to designate the primi- 
tive, crude beginnings of social consciousness and 
also the more fully developed trait which includes social 
consciousness of a high order involving altruism, morality, 
true citizenship and religion. The popular mind thinks 
of social generally in the more primitive sense. It is 
often assumed that when people are in groups or acting in 
organizations that there is always social codperation. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. There may be 
large groups massed together as in the case of flocks of 
birds, herds of buffaloes, or tribes of savages, where there 
is mere aggregation but little of group codperation. 
Such groups have doubtless assembled because of the 
primitive social instinct, gregariousness, but true social 
codperation may be very remote. ‘This primitive type 
of social trait—gregariousness—is manifested by all animal 
life. Children are no exception. 
In this discussion a very broad definition of instinct 
is assumed. By instinct is meant the innate tendency 
of the individual to react in certain ways toward environ- 
ment. Instincts are contrasted with behavior that is 
learned by the individual through his own experiences. 
Just where the one ends and the other begins is difficult 
todetermine. Instinct as here used is almost synonymous 
with heredity. It consists of the fund of inborn potenti- 
alities or tendencies with which the individual starts life 
as a fund of capital. To be classed as instinctive, it is 
not necessary that actions manifest themselves at birth.

Many of the most important instinctive tendencies like 
those of sex, morality, religion, etc., are deferred for a 
long time after birth. The child possesses at birth a 
fund of tendencies toward social reactions. These are 
manifested at varying times as the organism becomes 
mature. 
Gregarious- There is a very. striking tendency among animals to 
nee Se herd or band together. Note the familiar expressions 
which characterize the habits of many animals—herds of 
cattle, bands of sheep, herds of buffaloes, flocks of geese, 
swarms of bees, and nests of ants. When animals 
become separated from the accustomed group they give 
evidence of lonesomeness, even distress and grief. The 
way in which animals follow a leader is also well known. 
Among buffaloes some conqueror is always at the head of 
the herd, sheep follow the bell-wether, geese and 
ducks in their migrations are always piloted by the 
strongest gander, bees follow absolutely the queen bee, 
etc. Sir John Lubbock regards the action of ants, bees 
and wasps which are often combined to effect a definite 
result as examples of true social codperation and involving 
some sort of means of communication.!. Romanes cites 
instances among ants in which they carry codperation 
to a high degree and says, “it is evident that they must 
have some means of communication. This is especially 
true of the Ecitons, which so strangely mimic the tactics 
of military organizations.” He says they have officers, 
outposts, and scouts, besides the main armies and all 
actin unison. “In these mining operations the ants work 
with an extraordinary display of organized codperation— 
the work seems to be performed by intelligent codéper- 
ation amongst a host of eager little creatures.’’? Romanes 
says that the lowest animals with definite social emotions 
and which recognize offspring are the hymenoptera,   
  lLord Avebury, Anis, Bees and Wasps.

His SocrtaL TRAITS 
including ants, bees, and wasps. He says there even is 
“evidence of parental affection in the care which spiders, 
earwigs, and sundry other insects take of their eggs and 
broods.’ Jealousy, anger, and play are evident among 
fish. Sympathy seems to be displayed by the hymen- 
optera. Emulation, pride, resentment, love of ornament 
seem to occur among birds. Romanes believes that 
grief, hate, cruelty, and benevolence are displayed by 
cats. Revenge, resentment, and rage he ascribes to 
elephants and some of the monkeys. The highest social 
emotions manifested by animals below man are shame, 
remorse, deceit, and a sense of the ludicrous as displayed 
by dogs.’” 
Gregariousness rather than true social unity character- 
izes primitive groups of men. The tribe lives in com- 
munities largely unorganized. The laws and regulations 
are mainly monarch-made and do not represent the 
deliberations and contributions of the several individuals 
or of concerted group action. True, the group bands 
together for mutual protection and individual property 
scarcely exists. On the other hand, true communism is 
lacking because group effort is not exerted in property 
gaining and holding for the benefit of all. Naturally the 
mutual protection against enemies develops before 
organized community efforts to promote the welfare of all 
concerned.® 
Similar traits are displayed by youthful gangs. 
Shielding and protecting are manifested before the 
promotion of welfare. Likewise in various labor organi- 
zations the idea of the protection of its members from 
predatory interests stands out prominently while the 
development of high standards of efficiency and service 
of its members and the organization as a whole is tardy in 
appearance. It is natural that these should be the first

stages. But they are only the beginning and it should be 
understood that they are the embryonic stages out of 
which the highest social traits may be unfolded. 
Solitude is feared and shunned by all human beings. 
Miss Whitley has written. ‘This desire for the presence 
of others shows itself in babies. Being left alone in the 
room will often call from the baby a cry of distress, and 
the adult human being seems to afford the greatest 
comfort tohim. After babyhood, the instinct shows itself 
more particularly in desire for companions of the same 
age, though at adolescence there may be a desire for 
association with those older. It is true also that an 
adult, if left alone in a house, finds comfort in the presence 
of a child.”” With this tendency (gregariousness) as the 
foundation, together with the food-getting, hunting, and 
fighting instincts, it is easy to see how codéperation is 
developed; but without the gregarious instincts bringing 
individuals together, making their presence a satisfaction 
and their absence a discomfort, it is probable that the 
so-called social interests would have been very slow to 
develop. 
The gregariousness of childhood is accentuated in 
youth. At this time they begin to seek their own crowd. 
They are eager for parties, dances, picnics, hikes, and 
they contrive all sorts of schemes for bringing about these 
occasions. Oftentimes the desire to pick their own 
crowds leads to clandestine meetings and they frequently 
run away from home to escape from the restraints that 
seem out of harmony with their ideals of good times and 
agreeable crowds. As Pringle has noted:? “It isa time 
when the adolescent feels that he and his group under- 
stand more fully and know better all that is essential to 
life and conduct than older people, who, as it seems to 
him, have lost step with the times; hence, there is a

tendency for a time to be fundamentally impervious to 
adult influences. Fortunate is the adolescent who is 
surrounded by boys and girls of his age who are whole- 
some, enthusiastic, and right minded; when this is the 
case, he is quite safe, and his environment is his salvation.” 
Dr. Thomas Arkle Clark, Dean of Men at the Univer- 
sity of Illinois, says:' ‘“‘Men, young and old, are social 
animals. All of us like to join things. It is as difficult 
for me to refuse an invitation to become a member of a 
club or a fraternity or an organization as it is to resist 
the seductive talk of a book agent when he spreads his 
attractive wares before my eyes. I feel like a hero if I 
can summon the courage to turn him down. We joined 
church or Democratic party, I have no doubt, not so 
much from any strong religious or political convictions as 
from the fact that we were asked; we found it difficult to 
resist a chance to join, and we yielded. Iam not arguing, 
however, that there is always profit in joining. Boys feel 
very much about joining things as men do. When they 
go into a high school fraternity, they are but imitating 
their fathers or their older brothers in college each of 
whom, no doubt, has his club or his fraternity.”’ 
It was formerly taught by psychologists and is still 
believed by the popular mind that imitation is a mark of 
immaturity, a characteristic of children and the feeble- 
minded. We often hear the expression “‘mere imitation,” 
describing a particularly unintelligent action. A newer 
view, however, regards imitation, as one of the most 
important modes of learning on the part of intelligent 
adults as well as of immature children. The one who can 
not imitate is uneducable; and the more imitative the 
more highly educable is doubtless a more correct psycho- 
logical view. Childish imitation is apt to be uncritical 
while the trained adult’s imitation is selective. The

important matter is to select things worthy of imitation. 
Some of us are apt to imitate ignoble things or things not | 
worth while. 
The first apparent imitations of the babe are largely 
reflex movements and not conscious or purposive imi- 
tations. Tanner says,! ‘In the sixth or seventh month 
there are some clear cases of imitation, but even then they 
are relatively few, while from the ninth month on, the 
baby imitates all sorts of movements and sounds— 
combing his hair, shaving himself, sweeping, and other 
household tasks. By two-and-a-half years the child is 
into everything, imitating his elders and wanting to help 
in every way.” Kirkpatrick says,? ‘Everything, from 
the crowing of the chickens to the whistle of a locomotive, 
from the wriggling of a snake to the preaching of a sermon, 
is imitated. Nothing in his environment, physical or 
social, escapes the child.” 
“To get an idea of imitation among adolescents, one 
needs only to observe any adolescent boys or girls with 
whom he may come in contact—their behavior in general, 
in school, their manner of reciting in the classroom, their 
actions on the street, in the home, at church, at a party, in 
any situation where groups are thrown together. I have 
frequently watched a group of high school pupils on their 
way to school, and have noted the same fashions in dress, 
in wearing the hair, and in slang expressions. If one 
wears an overcoat, it may be because the rest do, not 
because it is necessary; if one carries an umbrella, all 
must do so. Sometimes all ride in the street car; at 
other times every one walks and one would scorn to ride. 
Just now all carry their lunches in a crumpled paper sack 
folded in an approved fashion and carried in a certain way. 
One would stay out of school rather than carry a neat 
lunch box. The songs they sing, the phrases they use,

His SoctAL TRAITS 
the movies they attend, the shows they praise or taboo, 
the popular football heroes they acclaim, the things they 
approve or decry, all are largely the product of unstudied 
imitation which they have caught from the crowd. 
It is usually believed that children imitate their 
elders, but a moment’s consideration shows this to be a 
superficial observation. Whom do the high-schoolers 
imitate in their dress, their speech, their attitudes, and 
their prejudices? Whom do the college freshman copy? 
There is certainly a wide distance between the dress of the 
freshman and that of the professor. In the ideals 
espoused, the conduct followed, who are their patterns? 
One who knows a college campus or classroom is not 
misled into the wrong answer. The youth’s everyday 
associates are the ones that slowly but surely determine 
his actions, his habits, his ideals.’”! 
Language has been developed solely because man is a 
social being. Necessity arose for communicating and 
understanding one another and language was invented 
under the stress of social necessity. No other index is so 
accurate of the child’s social environment as his use of 
language. If entirely isolated from companionship, the 
child’s language would be rudimentary and inarticulate, 
and many doubt whether it would develop at all. Under 
the stimulus of the group the child without set lessons, 
in an apparently haphazard, chaotic fashion acquires an 
astonishingly large vocabulary in a short space of time. 
Popular opinion greatly underrates children’s vocabularies 
and even adults’. Even renowned scholars have made 
under-estimations of vocabularies, alike of children and 
of mature persons. 
We know, of course, that the business of communi- 
cation of ordinary mortals is transacted with comparative- 
ly small coin. From all sides we hear a single adjective

describing every object and occurrence. A fad or craze 
often dictates the particular one. The words “nice,” 
“lovely” or “beautiful” often do duty in the description 
of a book, a dress, a lecture or a sermon, a trip to the 
mountains, a picture, a character, or a piece of pie. Most 
people are not very discriminating in their use of modi- 
fiers. But even granting this to be true, their vocabularies 
are not so dwarfed as is often asserted. Their stock of 
substantives is frequently very much richer than we 
might suspect. But it is only because their stock of words 
is relatively small that they have been thought so insig- 
nificant. I was first led to question the current statements, 
relating to the extent of various persons’ vocabularies, 
through a study of the language of children. I tabulated 
the vocabulary of a boy of three years and found that 
the number of words spontaneously used, and in a 
comparatively restricted environment, aggregated over 
twelve hundred. 
This social desire for communication can be used 
advantageously not only in childhood but especially 
in adolescence when the desire to be impressive is so 
dominant. 
The discussion of this important instinct as a means 
of utilizing other social instincts will not be developed 
here because of its treatmentin Chapter II. Suffice it to 
say that it is one of the earliest manifested of the social 
traits and is by far the most important means of securing 
spontaneous expression and development of the other 
traits. It should be constantly in the mind of the parent 
and teacher in dealing with children from the kinder- 
garten to the university. 
Very early in the child’s life he is sensitive to the 
approval of those around him. Sometimes there is a 
bravado attitude but underneath it all approval brings 
intense satisfaction and disapproval stings and haunts, 
114
-P-A-G-E-133
  His SocraL TRAITS 
ofttimes even produces illness. How children hate to be 
blamed! And how radiant they become when com- 
mended! In early childhood it is the approval of the 
parent, the teacher, and other grown-ups whose praise is 
sought and whose blame is dreaded. Gradually, however, 
the sanctions of the group to which‘a boy or girl belongs 
come to be the powerful sources of motivation. ‘‘What 
mama and papa told me to do or not to do”’ is at first 
the inviolable law, but gradually even parents are ques- 
tioned or disobeyed because of the mandates of the group. 
Take, for example, the code of children and youth with 
regard to informing on others in their group. Many a boy 
would sooner have his right hand cut off than be dubbed a 
“tattletale, tattletale!”” The public opinion of the boy’s 
or girl’s world comes to be as binding as the laws of the 
Medes and Persians. 
Miss Whitley has said,! ‘“Man’s attitude toward 
approval and scorn is part of his original equipment. 
By nature he is satisfied and made happy by approving 
looks, smiles, hand-touches of those about him felt to be 
equal or superior, or the admiring glances of inferiors, 
and he is made uncomfortable by scowls, frowns, derisive 
looks, and jeers. Love, respect, or admiration for those 
administering the approval or the disapproval, of course, 
intensifies its effects.”’ 
Arthur Brisbane writes in the morning paper that 
“Edith Schlenker, fourteen years old, tall for her age, was 
teased by smaller children in her school class. She stayed 
away from school, and her father, with good intentions, 
of course, scolded her severely. She jumped from the roof 
and killed herself. She was an only child. That short 
story reminds parents that it is difficult to realize the 
intense sensitiveness of young children.” 
Robinson Crusoe on a desert island had no motive for 
outdoing other people. His whole thought naturally

  Spontaneous 
Rivalry

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
concerned himself. How to exist there temporarily and 
how to escape were his sole incentives. Man normally 
surrounded by his fellows, however, is stimulated to do 
things that others have accomplished and then to exult 
in outdoing them in a variety of ways. In childhood this 
impulse to rival and outdo others certainly is not from 
altruistic motives. It is sociable, but not social. Desire 
for praise, for satisfaction in others’ discomfiture, domi- 
nate at first and may remain throughout life unless brought 
up to higher levels. 
Rivalry is observable in children’s games, in 
youthful contests such as baseball, shinny, skating, foot- 
ball, and various other sports. The same spirit may be 
utilized in ‘‘spelling down,” in arithmetic games, learning 
geographical facts, and countless other schoolroom activi- 
ties. Often youngsters will even overwork in their 
effort to outdo somebody else who may have been held 
up as a model. 
Much exaggeration and even lying among children 
come from the desire to be superlative. Children feel that 
they must say that they can jump farther, run faster than 
their playmates, that their fathers are bigger, smarter, 
and richer than other children’s. If necessary in order to 
be different and distinguished they can even have 
measles, or mortgages on their homes! 
This desire to excel can be used to great educational 
advantage. A little judicious commendation, the ar- 
rangement of competitive games, plays, and forms of 
work will lend zest to their activities and yield fruitful 
accomplishment. Desire to excel may come to mean 
desire to be of most service, to carry the greatest hap- 
piness, to do the most good in the world. Self-feeling may 
disappear, except for the egoistic satisfaction of serving 
others. 
Through imitation standards of conduct are developed 
116

His SocrtaL TRAITS 
  and spread in childhood and youth. William Dean 
Howells! has observed this with keen psychological insight 
and has related his observations in a highly entertaining 
manner. He says, ‘‘Everywhere and always the world of 
boys is outside of the laws that govern grown-up com- 
munities, and it has its unwritten usages, which are handed 
down from old to young, and perpetuated on the same 
level of years, and are lived into and lived out of, but are 
binding, through all personal vicissitudes, upon the great 
body of boys between six and twelve years old. No boy 
can violate them without losing his standing among the 
other boys .. .. and he cannot enter into their world 
without coming under them. He must do this, and must 
not do that; he obeys, but he does not know why, any 
more than the far-off savages from whom his customs 
seem mostly to have come... . 
“There were some things so base that a boy could not 
do them; and what happened out of doors, and strictly 
within the boy’s world, had to be kept sacredly secret 
among the boys. For instance, if you had been beguiled, 
as a little boy, into being the last in the game of snap-the- 
whip, and the snap sent you rolling head over heels on 
the hard ground, and skinned your nose and tore your 
trousers, you could cry from the pain without disgrace, 
and some of the fellows would come up and try to comfort 
you; but you were bound in honor not to appeal to the 
teacher, and you were expected to use every device to get 
the blood off you before you went in, and to hide the tear 
in your trousers. Of course, the tear and the blood could 
not be kept from the anxious eyes at home, but even there 
you were expected not to say just what boys did it.” 
Early in the teens boys congregate in groups. They 
may organize a game like marbles, baseball, football, or 
shinny, or may put off to the depot, or “the ol’ swimmin’ 
hole;”’ or they may go to the back alley or behind the

barn to swap stories or to have their first smoke. Many 
recent writers on the psychology of youth have paid their 
respects to the boy’s gang. Sheldon made a searching 
study of boys’ spontaneous organizations. He found that 
1,139 boys had 934 societies. Similarly 911 organizations 
were found among 1,145 girls. Forbush reported 862 
societies among 1022 boys and Puffer who made a study 
of the Lyman Industrial School for Boys found that 128 
of the 146 studied belonged to gangs. The morning 
paper chronicling some youthful depredation is most 
certain to mention a gang or band to which an erring boy 
belonged. Often the gang becomes a predatory society, 
but even more often athletic clubs are organized. The 
writer remembers a boxing club to which he belonged. It 
met nightly in a back alley shanty during an entire winter. 
It was organized because boxing had been forbidden at 
school. | 
Swift says! “Gangs are the expression of primitive 
tendencies. An environment incapable of draining off 
these instincts into channels which make for social growth 
perpetuates the racial impulses of early man. 
The acts in which gangs engage always have a whe! 
content. A group may be large or small, but if the boys 
have a common purpose which binds them together for 
exploits and mutual protection they constitute a gang. 
In the case of small boys, however, the bond of union often 
breaks when they are caught. . . . Thenamesofsome 
of the gangs among the inmates of the Lyman School are 
suggestive of the aims and life of the lads. ‘The Eggmen’ 
(because they robbed farmers), “The Wharf Rats’ (because 
their meeting place was a wharf), ‘Liners,’ and ‘Crooks’ 
are among those mentioned by Puffer.’”’ Sometimes the 
name, however, is much more terrible than the activities 
of the organization. The writer watched for many years 
“The Dirty Dozen” which consisted of a dozen boys who

  His Socrat TRAITS 
stuck together from the grammar school through high 
school; and now even in college and business life, about 
half of them still stick together. During the life of the 
organization the members did not smoke, swear, or 
commit any depredations. Every Sunday evening they 
went to the same church where they had fitted up a room, 
equipped it with cooking utensils and had their supper 
together, then went to the services, often appearing 
inattentive or irreverent, and waited for the girls at the 
steps. Every one later voluntarily shouldered a rifle or 
assumed some responsibility in the World War, two of 
them paying the supreme sacrifice while in the service of 
their country. 
One of the social qualities much desired by youth and 
adults and admired by all, even by children, is that of 
leadership. It is possessed by different individuals in very 
different degrees. Even in childhood some _ possess 
natural qualities which mark them out as leaders—even 
in mischief. The great majority of human beings are 
really followers; which is a social trait and implies leaders 
and recognition of leadership. Doubtless most men might 
be leaders in something were the germs of leadership 
developed at the proper period. 
Hero worship is very strong in children from ten to 
sixteen or eighteen, when they will do almost anything 
commended by leaders. Howells tells us' that the boys in 
“A Boy’s Town’ even looked up to not only the Whig 
politicians of the town, but also to some ‘‘dandies, whom 
their splendor in dress had given a public importance,” to 
“certain genteel loafers, young men of good families, who 
hung about the principal hotel, and whom the boys 
believed to be fighters of singular prowess.” They also 
even admired some professional drunkards “whom the 
boys regarded as the keystones, if not the cornerstones, of 
the social edifice.’ oe

  Doll Play 
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
Swift has shown convincingly how it is possible to 
utilize the gang spirit of boys, and the same could be said 
of girls, in developing real leadership and the finest of 
loyalty to the leaders and mandates of the group. Puffer! 
has shown that leaders, even in the gang, excel in truth- 
fulness, perseverance, bravery, reason, shrewdness, and 
independence. Mrs. Jacob A. Riis says she found that it 
was easy to convert the gang by first enlisting the fealty 
of the leader. Many a wise teacher had also discovered 
that disciplinary problems disappear when leaders in 
mischief are induced to array themselves on the side of 
the teacher. 
Undoubtedly one of the earliest manifestations of the 
parental instinct is in doll play. At an early age both 
girls and boys play constantly with dolls. Boys give up 
this play earlier than girls because of traditional attitudes. 
of those around them toward doll play. Sully? writes 
that boys “‘not infrequently go through a stage of doll 
love also, and are hardly less devoted than girls.”” Accord- 
ing to Miss Tanner* “The love of dolls appears to reach 
its height in the ninth year although strong from the 
third year to the twelfth. Many girls play with dolls 
until they go into long dresses and are ridiculed for their 
love of it; and not a few ladies confess to the existence of 
the passion.” Dr. Hall believes that doll play is not 
wholly an evidence of the parental instinct but partly due to 
fetishism and religion. Sir John Lubbock also says* that 
the doll is ‘fa hybrid between the baby and the’ fetish.”’ 
‘Hall has said* in his classic study of dolls: ‘‘The educa- 
tional valueofdollsisenormous. . . . It educates the 
heart and will, even more than the intellect, and to learn 
how to control and apply doll play will be to discover a 
new instrument in education of the very highest potency.

uals at all should study the doll habits of each child, now 
discouraging and repressing, now stimulating by hint or 
suggestion.” 
Gradually the parental instinct develops and shows 
itself in the care for children, although in boys it appears 
to be almost entirely suppressed during the years when 
they are most influenced by the gang spirit. With the 
onset of adolescence the sex instinct matures with aston- 
ishing rapidity, becoming often an almost overmastering 
passion of the lower animal type. Sometimes gradually, 
sometimes almost in a flash the emotion of love for the 
other sex appears, and if there is fortunate choice in the 
object of affection the emotion becomes one of the tenderest 
and most altruistic in human life. King! in referring to 
this characteristic as a part of the adolescent “birth of a 
new self,” has selected an apt quotation from Margaret 
Deland, which is here reproduced: 
“Elizabeth’s long braids had been always attractive 
to the masculine eye; they had suggested jokes about 
pigtails, and much of that peculiar humor so pleasing to 
the young male; but the summer she ‘put up her hair,’ 
the puppies, so to speak, got their eyes open. When the 
boys saw those soft plaits, no longer hanging within easy 
reach of a rude and teasing hand, but folded around her 
head behind her little ears; when they saw the small curls 
breaking over and through the brown braids of spun silk, 
clustering in the nape of her neck; when David and Blair 
saw these things . . . something below the artless bru- 
tality of the boys’ sense of humor was touched. They took 
abruptly their first perilous step out of boyhood. Of course 
they did not knowit. . . . The significant moment 
came one afternoon when they all went out to the toll- 
houseforice cream. . . . Astheysat eating their cream 
together, Blair suddenly saw the sunshine sparkle in

Elizabeth’s hair and his spoon paused midway to his lips. 
‘Oh, say, isn’t Elizabeth’s hair nice?’ he said. David 
turned and looked at it, ‘I’ve seen lots of girls with hair 
like that,’ he said; but he sighed and scratched his left 
ankle with his right foot. Blair, smiling to himself, put 
out a hesitating finger and touched a shimmering cur]; 
upon which Elizabeth ducked and laughed, and dancing 
over to the old tin pan of a piano pounded out ‘Shoo fly’ 
with one finger. Blair, watching the lovely color in her 
cheek, said in honest delight, ‘When your face gets red 
like that you are awfully good looking, Elizabeth.’ 
““*Good looking;’ that was a new idea to the four 
friends. Nannie gaped; Elizabeth giggled; David ‘got 
red’ on his own account and muttered under his breath. 
But into Blair’s face had come, suddenly, a new expression; 
his eyes smiled vaguely; he came sidling over to Eliza- 
beth and stood beside her, sighing deeply: ‘Elizabeth, you 
are an awful nice girl.’ Elizabeth shrieked with laughter, 
‘Listen to Blair, he’s spoony’ 
“Instantly Blair was angry; ‘spooniness’ vanished in 
a flash; he did not speak for fully five minutes.” 
They presently started home, ‘‘but,” says Mrs. Deland, 
with keen insight into the nature of youth, “childhood for 
all of them ended that afternoon.” 
The great objective in sex education should be parent- 
hood and family life in its highest and holiest relations. 
In general the higher the sex development, judged from 
the standpoint of true social or altruistic traits, the more 
the lower sex instincts have been brought under control 
and removed from consciousness. Irradiation of the 
lower into the higher channels of love, altruism, religion, 
etc., are the important objectives. The attention should 
be drawn away from direct sex emotions by activities, 
physical and mental, that shall develop what appear to 
be unrelated to sex, but in reality are intimately related to

  sex attraction and survival. The development of athletic 
prowess, bravery, chivalry, pride in dress, adornment, 
care of young, pride in family, skill in music and art, care 
for the weak or unfortunate, missionary zeal, religion, 
all are part of the psychic urge to develop and perpetuate 
one’s own idealized life. They are all direct outgrowths 
of the parental instinct which in turn is directly related to 
Sex. | 
John Fiske!’ has called attention to the fact the parental 
instinct is the basis of all morality. With the increased 
length of human infancy due to the helplessness of human 
young, parental care and solicitude became necessary. 
Even among the higher animals “the period of infancy is 
correlated with the feelings of parental affection, some- 
times confined to the mother, but often shared by the 
father, as in the case of animals which mate. Where, as 
among the lower animals, there is no infancy, there is no 
parental affection. Where the infancy is very short, the 
parental feeling, though intense while it lasts, presently 
disappears and the offspring cease to be distinguished from 
strangersofthesamespecies. . . . Theprolonged help- 
lessness of the offspring must keep the parents together for 
longer and longer periods in successive epochs; and when 
at last the association is so long kept up that the older 
children are growing mature while the younger ones need 
protection, the family relations begin to become perma- 
nent.””? Out of this germinal social consciousness there 
gradually develop sympathy, love, and altruism extending 
beyond the family to the tribe or clan, to the village, 
city, state, nation—all humanity. 
In addition to the belief in and reverence for a supreme 
being and wonder regarding origins and ends, religion is 
fundamentally social. It involves a love for one’s fellows 
and a desire to be of service to them. Religious awaken- 
ing is not characteristic of the little child. The child

is ego-centric. His love is more apparent than real. He 
may be affectionate for the purpose of receiving some- 
thing in return. We know the traditional story of the 
little boy “‘so very good, just before Christmas!” 
But with the onset of adolescence the germs of true 
religious life evidence an awakening. Starbuck! has shown 
by a survey of thousands of cases that the great majority 
of religious conversions take place during the ages from 
fourteen to twenty. A few occur earlier and a few later 
but adolescence is the great birthday of religious emotions. 
These find expression not only in various forms of worship, 
including song, prayer, ceremony but also in the expres- 
sion of love toward other persons, missionary zeal, and 
altruism toward all mankind. If not then exercised they 
are liable to become stunted and dwarfed. If properly 
encouraged in the normal individual there is the succession 
of “first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the 
ear.”’ It is well to teach the young to “Remember thy 
Creator in the days of thy youth.” 
To prepare for the responsibilities of adult citizenship 
the child and the youth must have opportunity to learn 
through actual participation in some of the activities of 
citizenship. These should not be make-believe activities 
nor exercises devised as practice courses. They should 
be natural activities arising out of every-day situations in 
connection with the youth’s world. There are all sorts of 
real work that occur in connection with the home, the 
school, the church, and civic enterprises. The most 
important of these in which group action can be employed 
are obviously in the school. 
The most fundamental fact the child can be taught 
in the school—more important than arithmetic, Latin or 
book-keeping—is that he is a part owner of the school 
and that he is not only to share in its benefits and privileges, 
but more significant, in its responsibilities. He must be

led to a feeling of responsibility through being given an 
opportunity to exercise his instinct for ownership through 
participation. The machinery of student government is 
unimportant, sometimes even a hindrance—the spirit, 
the attitude is everything. The opportunity for participa- 
tion should include codéperation in the management 
of the school paper, the various forms of athletic organi- 
zations, the literary society, the school play, the debating 
club, school parties and picnics and numerous other forms 
of recreation and amusement. These are forms of co- 
operative organization into which the pupils easily enter 
and participate. They pertain directly to youthful 
interests and enterprises. But these should be only the 
beginning. Through these they may be enlisted in group 
participation in activities more directly related to the 
welfare of the school. Out of the development thus 
secured and the training in coéperation gained they will 
have acquired confidence and strength for wider enter- 
prises. They need to be helped to understand their 
relations to an organization in which the personal benefits 
are not quite so readily understood. This is the next step 
toward understanding their relation to the city, State 
nation—the world. 
Dewey has exemplified this in his exposition of the 
idea that ‘‘Education is life!’ He deplores school activi- 
ties arranged purely as school exercises. Every activity 
in the school should have real significance in the child’s 
own life.’ 
While group activity should be encouraged a caution 
should be suggested. Many pupils become helpless 
because others stand ready to do all their thinking for 
them. Some become lazy because they find they can 
shift all their work to others who readily shoulder all 
responsibilities. It is just as in adult communities and 
organizations; the few who can and will do the work and

shoulder responsibility are allowed to do it. Still others 
use the group as a crutch to lean on. They become 
dependent and never tackle a thing independently and 
vigorously. To be able to work in solitude without props 
or crutches for the purpose of mastery and for the ultimate 
welfare of the group is just as important in adult society 
as is group participation. The good citizen must learn 
to do his part whether it be destroying weeds in his own 
fence corners or participation in a plumed parade where 
the multitudes will applaud. Is there not a serious lack 
in citizenship of this very quality of keeping one’s own 
back yard clear of weeds? Neumann says,! ‘‘Codéperation 
in itself is not necessarily ethical. Everything depends 
upon its objectives. School life should be organized 
around the idea, not that each student is to do his utmost 
to get a better mark than his neighbor, but that all are 
expected to make a free offering of their best to the prog- 
ress of the class and the school as a whole and, through 
these, of the larger community.’”’ Bearing this in mind, 
let us consider a few typical instances of the resources at 
our command. 
Judge Lindsay has succeeded to a wonderful degree in 
utilizing the gang spirit in the development of better 
citizenship in the youth of the slums. He says,” “In a, 
certain suburb of Denver, where the smelters are located 
and there are a great many cheap saloons selling bad 
liquor and tobacco to children, two celebrated gangs 
brought to the juvenile court for dangerous forms of 
rowdyism and lawlessness not only completely suppressed 
every serious objectionable feature among themselves, 
but also went after the men who were selling liquor and 
tobacco to boys. They prosecuted and sent several to 
jail, and did more to stop the use of tobacco and liquor 
among boys in that neighborhood than the police depart- 
ment or civil authorities had done in the history of the

town.” Swift adds:! ‘““The members of the same gangs 
also prosecuted men for selling firearms to children, for 
purchasing stolen property, and for circulating obscene 
literature. Yet these were the lads who had been making 
the trouble in that neighborhood, who had been stealing 
the property which the junk dealers bought, and who 
were among the customers for the firearms and immoral 
literature. 
If a gang can be made to suppress its own lawlessness 
and become the protectors of those upon whom it has been 
preying, what limit is there to the utilization of its 
enthusiasm and its spirit? This suppression of lawlessness, 
however, was not accomplished by violating the ethics of 
the gang, but rather by giving to these impulses a more 
universal social outlet. And this, after all, is what 
constitutes moral training. The gang is a close social 
corporation. The action of its members toward one 
another is often exemplary. Kindness, truthfulness, and 
helpfulness would leave little to be desired, if these 
virtues were not so narrowly restricted in their application. 
But outsiders are not included among the beneficiaries. 
Now, it is the extension of the point of view of the gang— 
the enlargement of its membership to include the greater 
social group which has been shut out and classed among 
its enemies—that is the first task of those engaged in 
training boys. When this is accomplished a large propor- 
tion of the school troubles disappear because they have 
originated in the traditional opposition of the school- 
master to the impulses which have all the sanction of 
racial passion.” 
In one public school in New York, the pupils contribute 
their help in the following ways?

multigraphing, typing reports, act as secretaries to 
grade advisers and chairmen. Serve as messengers. Do

says, “In our plan of training for citizenship, we enlist all 
school activities. We do not favor the school city nor any 
artificial self-government plan. We hold that the best 
form of student self-government is the government of 
each pupil by himself. To this end we are opposed to all 
rules for rules’ sake. That is, we believe that no rule 
should ever be promulgated unless at the same time with 
the rule the reason therefor is also announced, the only 
valid reason being the possibility of better living con- 
ditions for the student himself. We favor the develop- 
ment of qualities of leadership, of the ability to govern 
others, of the creation of a codperative spirit through the 
delegation to service squads and kindred organizations of 
actual tasks which need to be performed. With the task 
we delegate the authority needed for the performance of 
the task.

creation of a right attitude?—the government of each

‘IT have known a school in which on the first day of the

disorder anywhere in the building! Is this successful 
training for citizenship? 
*‘A civics teacher in Brooklyn noticed that the trees 
in the Bay Ridge section were in danger of destruction 
from bagworms. A crusade against these worms was insti- 
tuted among her pupils. Over 50,000 worms were brought

Over 9,000 pupils are acting as block captains, codperating

“*Two winters ago, during the Christmas vacation, at a 
time of heavy snowfall, several hundred of our high 
school boys, as a civic service, shovelled snow for several 
days and did far more work than the regular force—and 
so I might multiply examples. 
“Seemingly we are realizing our aim, the creation of a 
state of mind. The question we can not answer yet is as 
to its abiding nature. 
“A citizenship which shall save the State needs for 
most people what is almost a regeneration, a more en- 
lightened self-interest, a habit of surveying problems, as 
something objective to one’s self, of seeing with eyes 
undimmed by self-interest. The task is too great, too 
large to be accomplished in one generation. But in 
my judgment it is incumbent upon us school men to 
undertake the task, to carry on and leave the issue with 
the gods. The State is endangered. Only the schools 
can save it, and they by conscious, intelligent effort.” 
The term “social” is used in two senses (a) meaning 
sociable or gregarious, and (b) meaning altruistic or 
concerned for the welfare of others. Even the lower 
129 Summary
-P-A-G-E-148
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
animals and savages are gregarious in their habits. Chil- 
dren have instinctive tendencies toward the manifestation 
of social traits. These tendencies appear at first in the 
cruder form and only rather late in adolescence develop 
into the higher states. To join organizations, if only a 
gang, is perfectly natural and should be utilized as the 
starting point in the development of altruism. 
Imitation, formerly thought to be a mark of im- 
maturity, is one of the most important means of acquiring 
the ways of the group. The child should be helped to 
imitate the best in social groups and in literature, instead 
of that which lowers and degrades. The most important 
period of imitation is adolescence. Language is the 
common bond of the group, and would never have devel- 
oped but for the social traits. Play is a fundamental 
instinct and furnishes the incentive to the acquisition 
of all that is deemed worth while by childhood. Through 
imitation and play the child comes to value the affection 
of his elders and those in his own group. Approbation 
and disapprobation are powerful factors in determining 
conduct. Howells in A Boy’s Town has analyzed this 
social trait keenly and portrayed it strikingly. Rivalry 
is instinctive and should be used purposively in stimulat- 
ing to desirable effort and achievement. 
The gang, so naturally formed, may be made the 
nucleus of the finest kind of social codperation. Leader- 
ship here, as everywhere, is admired and followed. The 
gang may be used to develop desirable leadership and also 
to secure codperation in worthy enterprises. Gangs 
frequently excel in and praise loyalty, perseverance, 
courage, bravery, generosity, truthfulness, shrewdness, 
as well as some qualities less desirable. Enlist the leaders 
in worthy enterprises and the gang will follow. 
The higher forms of altruism, love, care for the weak 
and unfortunate, morality, reverence, religion, all have 
sprung from the social instinct of parenthood. Fiske 
130 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  His SoctAL TRAITS 
says, “Even civilization would have been impossible 
without the development of the family.” 
To secure the fullest fruition of the social traits, it is 
necessary to understand their instinctive beginnings, to 
recognize their periods of nascency, and then to develop 
them through actual participation in enterprises that are 
founded upon expression of the most worth-while instincts. 
Such opportunities are abundant in the home, the school, 
the church, and in real life.

THE CHILD’s MASTERY OF THE ARTS OF EXPRESSION— 
LANGUAGE, DRAWING, AND Music 
N | AN is a changing organism. In a machine, if 
two wheels are connected by belt or cogs, when 
one turns, the other turns. In man, two nerve 
centers that are not connected in their action in any way, 
become connected, if they are active together or in 
immediate succession. A child may hear a gun many 
times, and at other times see it, without there being any 
connection between the two experiences, but if he sees 
a gun as it is fired, then ever afterward the sound of a gun 
will make him think of its looks, or the sight of it will 
make him recall the sound it makes. The visual cells 
concerned in seeing the gun are now excited by the audi- 
tory cells concerned in hearing it, as surely as one wheel 
moves another with which it is connected by a belt. 
All learning depends upon this fundamental truth—that 
brain processes that occur together tend to excite each 
other. From birth till old age such connections are being 
formed, and thus memory, learning, and acquired motor 
skill are possible. Infinite numbers of connections are 
formed in the first few years of life. 
Many of these connections are repeated countless 
times, and the more times any two sets of nerve cells are 
excited together or one excites the other, the more close 
and sure is the connection. This is the law of frequency. 
The first connection of the two processes has the greatest 
effect. This the law of primacy. If only a short time 
elapses between repetitions, the connection remains 
strong. This is the Jaw of recency. If the processes are 
132 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  LANGUAGE — DRAWING — MUSIC 
intense and concentrated, the effect of repetition is 
greater. This is the law of intensity. 
If the results of the last of the two processes are 
pleasureable, this process will again readily be excited 
by the first, but if unsatisfactory it will be replaced by 
some other. A cat that jumps for some meat and gets it, 
repeats the act, but the one that does not get it and gets 
slapped, runs away. This is the Jaw of satisfaction and 
dissatisfaction. 
Upon these laws depend all the law and the prophets of 
learning and education. The certainty with which the 
sound of the word “‘dog’’ will call up the visual image of 
the written or printed word, “‘dog,”’ depends upon the 
frequency with which the processes of hearing and seeing 
them have occurred together or in succession, the intensity 
of the processes, their recency, the accuracy of their first 
association (e. g. the sound ‘‘dog” unconfused with 
similar sounds such as “‘log,” ‘“‘bog,” “fog,’’) and finally 
the satisfactoriness of the results in the way of feelings of 
success, approval, etc. Of all these laws the most funda- 
mental is that of frequency or number of repetitions, 
hence the value and universality of drill exercises. Yet 
the best teacher is the one who economizes time and 
- energy by substituting intensity of activity and satis- 
factoriness of results in a few repetitions, for the many 
repetitions of the unskilled teacher, utilizing only the law 
of repetition. 
The connections between processes or ideas are 
formed in accordance with the previous laws but this is 
not the whole story. The processes being connected are 
themselves becoming different. Often they are at first 
indefinite and mingled with other processes, but gradually 
become more and more definite and precise. The sound 
of o is the more prominent when the child first hears the 
word “dog.” Later the g and d sounds are distinguished 
and discriminated as different from other consonant

sounds. In a similar way the visual word “dog,” short in 
length and with the first part above and the last going 
below the middle, is more precisely seen as a word com- 
posed of three letters, each of a special form, different 
from any other letters. As the oral and visual words 
become more firmly associated, the processes of hearing 
and seeing them become more and more definite and 
clearly different from similar processes concerned with the 
other words. Learning is, therefore, not merely a con- 
necting of processes in accordance with the laws previously 
stated, but it frequently involves very great changes in the 
processes that are being linked together by frequent 
repetitions so that they take place more quickly and 
accurately. 
Three Stages There are three stages in the process of learning and 
" oe habit formation. The first stage is that of learning, in the 
sa a sense of getting the processes to become prominent 
enough to be recognized and to make repetitions possible. 
The second stage is that of making the processes more 
definite and getting them more closely linked with each 
other. The third stage is that of habit fixing in which there 
are no longer changes in the way in which the processes 
take place, but only an increasing certainty that when 
one takes place, the other will follow and that the activi- 
ties will always be performed in the way in which they 
have been most practiced. 
These stages are partly indicated in the curves of 
learning showing the results of experiments in learning by 
men and animals. The curves usually go up sharply at 
first, then more gradually and if the practice is continued 
long enough, improvement ceases, as indicated by the 
curve becoming horizontal. 
The increase in speed is accounted for by (a) elimina- 
tion of short pauses between; (b) omitting useless move- 
ment and finding better methods; (c) imaging less 
completely what is to be done; (d) overlapping of

processes, as in reading, when the eyes are several words 
ahead of the tongue; (e) some increase in speed of move- 
ments. The limit of speed at first is usually the rate at 
which one can think how to do the thing, while in the last 
stage it is the rate at which the motions can be executed. 
When the rate and accuracy cease changing, the mode 
of doing varies but little and further practice fixes it and 
makes it so mechanical that it is difficult to change the 
way of doing and only by constant effort can greater speed 
and accuracy be secured, even temporarily. This fixing 
may take place long before the best methods and highest 
135 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  Speed 
Versus 
Accuracy THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
possible skill have been developed. The closer to the 
limit of possible improvement, the harder it is to fix the 
habit at that stage, for as soon as less conscious effort is 
made, there is a drop in performance. For practical 
purposes it is therefore often best not to try to push speed 
and accuracy to the highest limit, while for artistic 
purposes the effort to improve should never cease. 
In practice, after the stage of learning how has been 
passed, there is always more than zero ability at the 
beginning. The one who has had the most practice of a 
similar kind or is most fortunate in hitting on a good 
method of procedure, will do better at first but may not 
end better, than one who starts with a poorer record. 
Children and beginners in any line generally improve 
faster than those who have had a moderate amount of 
practice, because they are in an earlier stage of learning. 
Sometimes there are plateaus or even declines in the 
curves of learning—times when the individual seems to 
make no progress forward and may even go backward. 
This is often seen when a new and better method is tried, 
as when one advances in typewriting or telegraphy from 
writing by letters to writing by words, or from writing by 
words to writing by clauses or sentences, or a tennis 
player tries a new form of service. The change may be a 
good one, but efficiency may be less till better control is 
obtained. 
Irregularity when one has nearly reached his limit is 
often due to variations in conscious effort and to the 
coming on of fatigue. 
In experiments in learning, several other truths have 
been discovered. If timing and records of amount done, 
lead all to try for speed, then all gain in speed, but many 
decline in accuracy. When told that only perfect work 
will be counted, all try for accuracy or perfection of form 
and improve in that respect, but for a time fall off in 
speed. This shows that the mental attitude while prac- 
136
-P-A-G-E-155
  LANGUAGE — DRAWING — MusIc 
ticing determines the kind of an improvement made. 
An experiment in learning to typewrite showed that 
when one division of a class practiced for speed at first 
and the other for accuracy, the first students gained 
rapidly in speed but soon reached their limit because of 
errors, while the others gained in accuracy first, then 
continued to gain speed till they were ahead of the other 
division in both respects. This gives the general rule that 
in all learning, speed should be sought, if at all, after the 
correct and accurate way of doing has been assured. 
Some recent experiments have shown that if a class is 
divided into two sections, and section A is informed of the 
score made each time, while section B is not, the first 
section improves much more rapidly. If a change is 
made and pupils of section B are given their score while 
pupils of section A are kept ignorant of their score, then 
section B gains in speed while section A becomes slower. 
This is probably due in part to the fact that knowledge 
of improvement causes satisfaction and thus increases the 
effect of the repetitions. It is therefore very important 
that children should be given some means of seeing their 
own improvement in whatever they are learning. Praise 
or a teacher’s marking is a partial but not complete 
substitute for one’s own perception of success. 
This has been very clearly shown in a code experiment 
by asking a class when they had about finished the second 
stage of learning a set of number symbols, to use them in 
working a problem in multiplication instead of merely 
writing the symbols in order as they had been doing. 
It was found that very little improvement in using the 
code had come from writing it in order, since some who 
had practiced it only a few minutes in order could use it in 
the problem as well as those who had practiced it in order 
twenty-five minutes. From this it was learned that one 
improves in doing what he practices, chiefly in doing it in 
the same way and under the same conditions, and only

slightly, in doing the same or similar things in similar ways 
or under similar conditions. 
It was decided that most practice should consist of 
doing what is practiced in the way in which one is going 
to use it and under the same conditions. If the thing 
being learned, however, is complex and difficult, then it 
will pay to practice it in the easiest way until it can be 
done properly. Much time is often wasted in school by 
practicing things for long periods of time in a different 
way from that in which they are to be used, e.g., practicing 
tables in addition and multiplication, instead of using the 
knowledge of combinations, as soon as a few are learned, 
in working problems. 
When one tries to solve a puzzle, such as tracing a 
maze, or putting cut-out forms together, or tracing a star 
seen in the mirror, or reducing five squares to three in the 
following diagram by removing only three of the fifteen 
matches, he is likely to make a great many trial move- 
ments or images of movements before succeeding. The 
same is true in trying to learn the pronunciation of a 
new sounding word. If one can hear another pronounce 
the word he can learn with fewer trials. Directions as 
to how to do a new thing also help in shortening the 
time of learning, provided the right directions are given 
at the right time. 
Extensive observation and experiment show that 
trial movements resulting sooner or later in success, and 
attempted repetition of the satisfactory movement is the 
most universal method of procedure in the first stage of the 
learning process.

A cat confined in a box from which he can escape by 
turning a button in the door, scratches and pushes in 
various places till the button is turned and he gets out. 
When put in again he is likely to do most of his scratching 
near the button and gets out with fewer motions. After 
a number of experiences he omits all the movements save 
those that turn the button and he gets out at once. Ina 
similar way, a turtle, a pigeon, a rat, a dog, or a man 
learns to find his way through a maze in which there are 
many blind alleys. Most animals have no other way of 
learning new things. A cat is not at all helped by seeing 
another cat get out of a box. In other words it cannot 
learn how to get out by watching another animal turn the 
button. A child or man learns much more rapidly when 
he has such a chance to imitate. 
It is also possible to give directions to persons as to 
how to get out or to find their way over a new route, and 
they can often learn by this ideational method without 
trial and error practice, but no animal can be taught 
anything new by the ideational method. In the case of 
man, movements involving new codrdinations may be 
learned, in the sense of gaining an idea of how they should 
be made, by imitation and direction, but skill in execution 
is gained only by trial and increased approximation to 
accuracy. By hearing instructions as to how to stand, 
grasp the club, swing it, and so forth, and by watching 
others do it, one can begin the first stage of learning to 
play golf, but to complete that stage and pass well into 
the second stage of accuracy in driving, requires the use of 
the trial and success method. The same is true of skill 
in every accomplishment. Receiving directions and 
having opportunities to imitate, make fewer trials neces- 
sary but cannot bring success without some use of the 
more fundamental method of becoming accurate by a 
series of approximating trials. In the course of these 
trials one is guided usually by visual or auditory images

but success is not reached until one gets the muscular feel 
of the correct movements. 
Language and other forms of expression are learned 
by processes similar to those already described. In all 
of them, while being acquired, motor coédrdinations are 
important. Consciousness of how movements are being 
made is necessary but good training results in making 
purely mechanical the movements used in expressing 
ideas. 
Since only the English language will here be considered, 
it may seem as if this title were wrong, but it isnot. The 
child who learns English only, has four languages to 
acquire. (1) He has to learn to distinguish the sounds 
and to understand the meaning of oral words. (2) He 
has to learn to move his vocal organs so as to say oral 
words. (3) He learns in school to distinguish visual 
words and usually also to associate the visual forms with 
the oral forms and with the ideas for which they stand. 
(4) He has to learn to control his hand in producing visual 
words similar to, but not the same as, those he has learned 
in reading, and to use the conventional signs such as 
capitals, periods, question marks, commas, etc. These 
four languages are distinct, but are nearly always learned 
in pairs—one and two, and three and four being acquired 
at about the same time. | 
The first of each pair is concerned with understanding 
other people and the second of each pair involves motor 
acts producing words understood by others. All four 
languages become closely associated so that it is easy to 
translate one language into the other and often difficult 
not to do so; so that, when reading, many persons have 
a strong tendency to think and say the corresponding 
oral words. 
This language is learned before the child goes to 
school. The discrimination of oral words develops first, 
followed and accompanied by learning the movements 
140
-P-A-G-E-159
  LANGUAGE — DRAWING — MusIc 
necessary in speaking them. Some children successfully 
perceive and learn to imitate them before they know their 
significance. Such children sometimes become as skilful 
as parrots in imitating words and phrases and with no 
more idea of their meaning. Other children learn the 
significance of words as soon as they distinguish them, but 
it may be a long time before they are able to control their 
vocal organs in uttering the words. 
Various factors enter into this process of learning to 
control the organs of speech. The child starts life with 
(a) a few instinctively produced sounds; (b) he makes 
many others by more or less chance movements; (c) he 
repeats many of these sounds in a playful way (uses his 
vocal organs as playthings, sometimes as early as at 
the sixth month); (d) he imitates (at nine to fifteen 
months) various sounds including words, in a more or less 
playful way; (e) he voluntarily repeats words that he 
hears, at twelve to twenty months, usually with the 
purpose, then or later, of expressing his wants; (f) he 
learns to group these words more or less correctly into 
phrases, clauses, and sentences, usually omitting those 
that are to him unimportant. 
At two years of age most children have acquired the 
art of vocal expression or, as is usually said, “have 
learned to talk.’ Some at this age use scarcely a score 
of words intelligently and intelligibly, while others control 
a vocabulary of ten or twelve hundred words. A vocab- 
ulary of from two to four hundred words is usual. 
The pronunciation of these words remains more or less 
childish till three or four years of age. If there is little 
variation in the pronunciation of words which the child 
hears during the first ten years, his style of pronun- 
ciation becomes pretty well fixed and radical changes are 
not easily made later, although up until the age of twenty, 
some differences will result if a Westerner moves East, or 
a Southerner moves North and stays for a few years.

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
Even if he does not know it, his friends will notice a 
change when he returns home. A foreign language 
learned after the age of twenty is practically always 
spoken with an accent. Children of foreign parentage 
often speak much better English if their parents do not 
speak English at all, than when they do. The child who 
hears good English in school and no English at home will 
speak much more correctly than one who hears poor 
English at home. No matter how well he may be taught 
the correct sounds, his habits will be influenced by the 
pronunciation that he hears most frequently. 
Even in the homes of native Americans, a child 
sometimes acquires habits of incorrect speech because 
of hasty clipping of words and indistinctness of articula- 
tion by adults. The child is often worse than the parent, 
not only because, like the parent, he is hasty and careless, 
but because he has never learned to distinguish the 
correct sounds of words; e.g., a boy of twelve in a cultured 
home had not distinguished between the oral words 
“coal” and ‘‘cold”’ and used the latter to indicate what 
is burned in a furnace. 
One who is interested in developing good pronuncia- 
tion in a child must bear in mind the general principles of 
learning previously stated and carefully distinguish the 
stage of learning that the child has reached in pronouncing 
any word. In the first stage the child should learn what 
the exact sound of a word is, but he often practices the 
word before he knows just what its sounds are. During 
this period great care in pronouncing words in the presence 
of the child should be exercised that he may learn the 
right sounds. After he has the correct idea of the sounds, 
his early attempts to speak words will be more or less 
variable, as is always the case during the habit-forming 
stage. So long as the pronunciation varies and approx- 
imates the correct sound, there is no need for worry; but 
when the pronunciation begins to become uniform, the 
142
-P-A-G-E-161
  LANGUAGE — DRAWING — MusIc 
habit-fixing stage is being entered, and if the sounds are 
not uttered correctly, pains should be taken to induce 
closer approximation to the right form. If, after this, 
the child hears a good deal of wrong pronunciation, 
care must be taken that the habit of correct pronuncia- 
tion is kept fixed. This is less difficult if he hears words 
pronounced in various incorrect ways than if he hears one 
wrong pronunciation more frequently than any other. 
The value of phonics consists in giving the child a 
clearer idea of the real sounds in words he is learning to 
use. The habits of pronouncing words are formed and 
fixed by speaking words as wholes and not by practicing 
the separate sounds, because the speaking of sounds in 
word combinations is an entirely different motor process 
from uttering them separately, e.g., ‘‘Three tall, slick, 
slim saplings’ is difficult of utterance, not because the 
various phonetic elements are hard, but because this 
combination of them is difficult to pronounce. 
Many changes in methods of teaching writing have 
taken place. A hundred years ago it was taught more 
as a fine art than as a means of visual expression, and 
artistic flourishes and shadings were much used. Later 
the idea of writing legibly and rapidly became more 
prominent. A half century ago the method of learning to 
write by special practice was carried to an extreme. The 
practice was also not so much to acquire a certain kind 
of movement as to secure the making of certain forms. In 
the Spencerian system there were only seven distinctly 
different elements,—straight line, right curve, left curve, 
loop, oval, reversed oval, and capital stem,—and there 
was much separate practice of each of these at a certain 
angle. So strongly was it believed that practice of these 
separate elements would make good writers that less than 
forty years ago a superintendent stated in an educational 
magazine that he would have a pupil practice one of 
these elements for a year, if that were necessary in order 
143 . Learning

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
to get him to make it perfectly. Few teachers were so 
extreme as this, but it took a good while for teachers to 
learn that the codrdination of movements involved in 
making the elements separately is quite different from 
those involved in making them when combined into words. 
Most of the time spent in this separate practice was 
wasted. A few minutes of it helped in the first stage 
of getting a more perfect idea of letter forms, but further 
practice was of no value in learning to combine writing 
movements as required in writing words. 
About this time it was discovered that the position 
of paper and body were important conditions favoring 
good writing, and vertical writing had considerable vogue. 
Later other systems were developed and the chief emphasis 
was placed upon the kind of movements made. Children 
were not allowed (during the writing lesson) to use whole 
arm or finger movements. This gaining of free, easy 
forearm movements is now given most attention in 
penmanship lessons. Great improvement has been made 
in the teaching of writing under the direction of special 
teachers, but the results are still unsatisfactory. Some of 
the reasons are as follows: (1) The forearm movement, 
although the best writing movement, is not as easy to 
acquire as the finger movement, especially if accuracy in 
writing is demanded at the same time. (2) It is difficult 
and often impossible to use it freely and successfully when 
the desk, chair, and position are not exactly right. (3) 
It is hard, after gaining freedom and skill in doing exercises 
with the forearm movement to keep the same movement 
and make small letters in various combinations, with 
sufficient accuracy. (4) Outside of the penmanship les- 
sons, conditions are often very unfavorable for using the 
forearm movement, so that unless more care is taken by 
teachers than is usual, the majority of children will 
actually write in a different position and use a different 
movement, with the result that they get an entirely 
144
-P-A-G-E-163
  
LANGUAGE — DRAWING — MusIc 
  different sort of practice from that taught them in their 
lessons. 
This is the reason why children often become poorer 
writers in the seventh and eighth grade than they were in 
the fourth or fifth. Many never acquire the mechanics 
of writing so as to be able to write a decent hand without 
giving special attention to the process. High school 
pupils often write what they have to say with no regard to 
penmanship, then copy what they have written, giving 
attention to penmanship. 
There is no doubt that the forearm movement is the 
best for persons who write many hours a day under 
favorable conditions of seating and posture, but it is 
doubtful if it is wise to try to make all children acquire 
it when most of them will do but little writing and that 
under conditions unfavorable to the use of the forearm 
movement. Most teachers of writing, however, believe 
that the “‘muscular movement” should be taught because, 
even if not used later, it secures greater freedom of finger 
movements. 
Whether this is a correct view or not, it is clear that 
much more care must be given to combination practice 
in the habit-learning and habit-fixing stage of learning 
penmanship. The freedom and accuracy of movement 
gained inthe special practice in making “‘ovals’’, “‘m’s’’, and 
so forth, must be developed in making all sorts of letter 
combinations where the comparatively easy rhythm is 
lacking, and then such movements must be used in all 
writing and not merely during the penmanship lesson. When 
pupils are to spell, take dictation, or do any writing they 
should be required to assume proper position and practice 
correct movements for a moment. During the writing, 
if many of them change to other positions and movements 
the teacher should again have them assume proper 
position and practice free correct movements for a minute 
or two. Only in this way can the special movement

Methods of 
Teaching   
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
training be made to carry over into all writing and result 
in proper habit-forming and habit-fixing so that one can 
write whenever he wants to without thinking about how 
he is doing it. 
There are two fundamentally different methods of 
teaching writing and other forms of motor skill. These are 
(1) by separate practice exercises and (2) by combined 
practice and use. The first method is best adapted to 
class teaching and the second to individual teaching, and 
each needs to be combined to some extent with the other 
to secure the best results. 
The most effective way of using the first method is 
briefly as follows: After a child has passed through the 
first stage of learning how letters look and the position 
and movements used in making them, he is ready to 
practice for accuracy and speed. His attention may then 
be directed toward better formed letters and when this 
aim has been approximated, part of the attention may be 
given to better size or spacing or slant, but with enough 
attention to form to prevent deterioration. When both 
these qualities are secured, a third purpose may be made 
prominent, but with some attention to the other two 
qualities. By this time the first quality is being produced 
in a fair degree as a habit that with a little further practice 
can be maintained without conscious attention. Thus, 
one purpose should be made prominent in all practice 
while other purposes are kept in mind only as much as is 
necessary to insure further practice of sufficient accuracy. 
When all the qualities of good writing are secured in a 
fair degree and can be produced at a reasonable rate, the 
child should practice writing for expressing thought at 
the already attained standard of accuracy and speed. 
If this policy is persistently followed, the style of 
writing will gradually become fixed and will be used under 
all circumstances with little or ne’attention to the writing 
process. The mind will be free to occupy itself with 
146   
 
-P-A-G-E-165
LANGUAGE — DRAWING — MuUsIc 
other things while writing legibly at a fair speed. This 
is a result far more desirable for most people than the 
ability to write well only by diverting part of the attention 
from the thought being expressed. The above outline 
of method is well adapted to class teaching where many 
are practicing under the direction of a teacher. 
An individual child may learn to write successfully 
by doing the whole process as well as he can at once, under 
the usual writing conditions. Many children have begun 
writing words or sentences with only a very slight knowl- 
edge of script. This is quite possible if a child has before 
him copies of all the letters which he can look at when 
necessary. Not only may he copy print sentences in 
script but he may write sentences of his own, as in writing 
a letter to his absent father. In this case he will need 
some help in spelling. This method has the advantage 
of making the first practice more like the complex act 
that it must be in actual use. 
If the child practices in this way he is sure to develop a 
habit of writing that will require no attention as to the 
mere mechanics of writing. 
There is danger, however, that bad habits in one or 
several ways will be formed that will be difficult to 
overcome. If a child can have intelligent individual 
teaching he may be kept improving in all respects until 
a sufficient degree of perfection is reached. Even with a 
very intelligent teacher, however, it is hard to handle a 
large class by this method. No two children will need 
exactly the same directions and the teacher will not have 
time to see that each child practices in the way that will 
be most helpful to him. 
The chief fault of both class and individual teaching 
is calling attention to errors. The teacher must see what 
is wrong in the results but must make the child think of 
the kind of movement which will give better results. 
Negative directions always do more harm than good.

The less the child attends to wrong forms and wrong 
movements the better. Only by attention to correct 
forms and correct movements while practicing can im- 
provement be made. 
A standard scale of handwriting with which children 
may compare their writing from time to time may be of 
great help. They thus gain better standards, learn to 
judge of their own work, and are stimulated to further 
effort by their success. After pupils can write an even, 
legible hand, tests of speed should be made occasionally 
to discover whether improvement in that respect can be 
made without decline in form. Rhythmical music while 
practicing penmanship is a great aid whichever method is 
used. 
For many years drawing was regarded as a fine art, 
analogous to painting. The use of drawing in engineering 
industries, on the one hand, and the study of children 
on the other, have emphasized the usefulness of drawing 
as a means of expression in the field of form. Only a 
highly endowed and trained individual can use drawing 
successfully as a means of expressing ideas of beauty. 
However, everyone can acquire sufficient facility in 
drawing to make it a useful means of expressing ideas of 
objects and of their relations to each other. A training 
in the making of lines, sufficient to give facility in doing 
this, should be provided in the elementary schools, but 
no attempt should be made to secure artistic drawing from 
most children. Artistic expression should be provided 
for all, but this may be done much more satisfactorily in 
painting and by designing, using cut-out forms, or trac- 
ings, than by means of graceful, accurate lines in drawing. 
This is true, not alone because only a high degree of 
skill can produce beauty by means of lines but because, 
in acquiring such skill, the child is inevitably retarded by 
the unsatisfactoriness of the results that he secures. 
His perceptions and ideas of beauty are always so much 
148 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  LANGUAGE — DRAWING — Music 
in advance of his motor ability that he continually has 
the dissatisfaction of failure. In writing, where accuracy 
only is required, this is not so inevitable. 
In all these subjects but especially in drawing, teachers 
have usually taught in ways that increased critical 
perceptive judgment faster than motor skill. The effect 
has been most unfortunate in drawing, sometimes even 
when accuracy of representation rather than beauty was 
emphasized. This is evidenced by the fact that young 
children are generally willing to try to draw almost 
anything, while the older they get, the more shy they 
become in trying to draw any but the simplest objects. 
Nearly all kindergarten children, if requested, will try 
to draw the portrait of a man or a woman, while older 
children can scarcely be induced to make such an attempt. 
Lines in drawing are used by a small child to stand for 
ideas in his mind, and it is not necessary that they should 
look just the same as the object represented. Crooked 
lines may indicate the stomach or other internal organs 
that the child has never seen, and be included in his 
drawing of a man as standing for what he regards as one 
essential of a human being. In drawing a house, a 
child makes lines or dots for whatever seems to him to be 
interesting and important, either the stove inside the 
house, or the wind that is making the windows rattle, 
regardless of what may be seen from any one point of 
view. So long as he is not impressed with the absolute 
necessity of showing things just as they look, he considers 
himself successful if his lines are so made or related to 
each other that he and others will know what he means. 
This is all that drawing as a means of expression demands, 
and this should be made the chief purpose in the teaching 
of the subject to most children. When this is done, 
drawing will always have meaning and will generally 
bring success, provided that care is taken in selecting the 
facts to be represented by means of drawing. Almost -

any four-year-old child can draw a square or a circle so 
that everybody will know what is intended. He can 
draw a birch and an apple tree, so that one can tell which 
is the apple tree, or a potato and a turnip so that one can 
tell the potato. Such drawings, however crude, are 
successful and give the child the satisfactory stimulus 
of accomplishing his purpose. Improvement in motor 
skill will come naturally if the ideas to be expressed by 
the drawing are gradually made increasingly difficult. 
Only after considerable motor skill has been developed 
and some knowledge gained of the way perspective is 
represented, can a child draw a picture of a box so that 
one can tell where he was sitting when he drew it. 
If drawing is taught like language, as a means of 
expression, then the first essential is not beauty but 
understandability and every line drawn must be for the 
purpose of making the idea to be expressed more promi- 
nent. After success in this respect has been secured, it 
may be well to try to express the same idea with equal 
clearness and more beauty, but this purpose should be 
subordinate except for gifted and advanced pupils. If 
the purpose of making drawing a convenient means of 
expression to supplement or to be substituted for oral 
and written words were made the dominant one in teach- 
ing drawing, it would doubtless be one of the most popular 
subjects, and the pleasure and success of many adults 
would be greatly increased. When any other aim is made 
dominant, failure will be so frequent that little improve- 
ment will be made except by the few, and the typical 
child will leave school with less readiness to use drawing 
as a means of expression than when he entered. 
On the purely motor side, the problems of developing 
accuracy, speed, and grace are very much the same as in 
other forms of motor training. The first guide is the 
visual image of what is to be made and that is compared 
with what is made; while a secondary guide is the motor — 
150 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
LANGUAGE — DRAWING — MusIc 
feeling of free, correct movements of various kinds. 
Whether the special-practice method or the combined- 
practice-with-use method shall be made most prominent 
in training pupils to draw, is pretty much the same 
problem as in all motor training. In teaching a class, 
the first has advantages while the combined method may 
be used with little danger and many advantages as a 
rule in individual teaching. 
In using the special-practice method, attention should 
be given to ways of using pencil, crayon, chalk, or pen 
and immediately after practicing special lines, there 
should be a drawing exercise in which, by means of such 
lines, some concrete fact is expressed. 
In using the combined method, the teacher should 
look for the most prominent defect in the way in which 
pupils are trying to make the necessary lines and, without 
saying anything about the defect, should have the pupils 
watch her draw those lines by a better movement, then 
have them draw something requiring similar lines. She 
should not say anything about wrong ways of drawing 
and not so much about the right way as to divert the 
children from their main purpose of expressing something 
by means of the lines they are drawing and endeavoring 
to draw more easily, surely, and quickly. The best way 
of securing improvement, especially in the case of younger 
children, is by showing, rather than by telling. 
Musical skill, whether in the use of vocal organs or of 
arm, hand, or fingers in playing an instrument, is acquired 
in ways similar to those used in other forms of learning. 
There is always a stage of learning what is to be done, 
and something of the ow it is to be done, followed by 
a habit-forming stage in which there is a gradual approxi- 
mation to accuracy, followed by a habit-fixing stage, as 
the same movements are repeated in a uniform manner. 
Learning to sing differs from learning to talk chiefly in 
accuracy and in the number of muscles that must be

codrdinated. The breathing muscles must be much more 
continuously and accurately correlated with those of the 
vocal organs, and the vocal cords must be more specifically 
and accurately controlled, while the tongue and lips 
mould the sounds. ‘The ear reports the results of these 
combined movements and serves as the chief guide in 
perfecting and codrdinating them, although visual 
imitation of another singer helps and motor sensations 
of muscular tension play a considerable part in the 
attainment of skill. 
No matter how highly one may be endowed with a 
vocal apparatus he cannot under ordinary circumstances 
become a successful singer, unless he has also a “good 
ear” for music. His accuracy of muscular adjustment 
cannot become finer than his ear perceptions of the 
sounds he makes. Professor Seashore, of the State 
University of Iowa, has shown that the limit of improve- 
ment in perception of fine differences in pitch is reached 
after rather a small amount of practice. It follows 
from this that in judging the possibility of improvement 
in singing ability, not only must the vocal organs be 
considered but also the fineness of the organs for dis- 
criminating pitch. The construction of the vocal cords 
determines how high or how low notes may be sung, but 
the control of the sounds within those limits depends on 
the development of coérdination of all the muscles con- 
cerned, under the guidance of pitch perception. Pro- 
fessor Seashore has invented a machine which makes it 
possible for a singer to see a vibrating marker that shows 
just how nearly he is producing the sound vibrations 
corresponding to each pure tone. In this way a visual 
perception and image are substituted for the oral im- 
pression in guiding the muscular action. Some singers 
can, by using this apparatus, improve more rapidly and 
reach a higher degree of accuracy of pitch, than when 
they depend upon their sound sensations and images to 
152
-P-A-G-E-171
  LANGUAGE — DRAWING — MuUsICc 
guide them. Qualities of voice other than accuracy of 
pitch must be guided by the ear. 
The problem of getting the muscles of breathing and 
the vocal cords, tongue and lips codrdinated under the 
guidance of the ear, is the same as when in writing, 
muscles are coérdinated under the direction of the eye. 
In both cases the muscular ‘“‘feel’’ of the right movements 
is also a guide as one attains skill. 
In teaching singing as in teaching writing, either of 
two contrasted methods may be used,—(1) special 
practice for special ability in breathing, pitch, smooth- 
ness, etc., or, (2) practice in singing songs with only 
occasional attention to notes, scales, breathing, etc. A 
pupil with good vocal organs and a good ear can, by 
individual instruction succeed very well by the second 
method, but it is less surely successful than the first 
method in the case of class teaching of pupils of varying 
ability. Many teachers, however, using the special- 
practice method dwell too long on special exercises, 
instead of teaching songs with one excellency and then 
another made prominent. 
In learning to play such an instrument as a violin, the 
process is much the same as in learning to sing, except 
that accuracy of tone is secured by movements of arm 
and fingers instead of those of the throat and chest. 
The ear is the primary guide to the accuracy of tone, 
supplemented by the muscular “‘feel’’ of the right move- 
ments. One who has not a good ear should never attempt 
to be a violinist. In the case of wind instruments the 
muscles involved are different but the ear remains the 
chief guide. 
In playing a piano the situation is quite different, 
since accuracy of tone depends upon the structure and 
tuning of the instrument itself. Hence a person with 
little or no perception of pitch could learn to play a 
piano, being guided by the visual score as to what keys

to strike. To secure other qualities than the orderly 
sounding of pure tones, a good ear for those qualities 
is needed as a guide. Images of how to move the hands 
may be gained from watching another pianist play, but 
the success of one’s own efforts is judged primarily by 
the ear and secondarily by the “feel” of the hand and 
finger movements. 
Some teachers of the piano use the first method, 
having a great deal of practice of separate exercises, 
while others approximate the second method of trying to 
do everything at once, but with special attention to 
improving now in one respect and now in another. When 
the pupil is intelligent and the teacher skilful, the latter 
method gives good results relatively quickly; but when 
these are lacking, the former method is surer. When 
there is difficulty in securing correct and free move- 
ments of fingers and wrists, it may be worth while to 
have a child practice the movements in a soundless 
way, while watching the hands of a good pianist, till he 
gains the “‘feel”’ of the right movements. Next, he may 
practice the movements alone, then try to keep the same 
“feel” as he practices a musical score which he has 
memorized, and finally to keep the same, as he practices 
a less familiar score at which he looks. 
There is much similarity in all learning. New con- 
nections are formed between nerve centers and muscles 
concerned in native and acquired activities, in accordance 
with the laws of repetition, recency, intensity, primacy, 
and satisfaction and dissatisfaction. 
The process is one of increasing adjustment and 
coérdination of the parts concerned in speaking, writing, 
drawing, singing, playing, etc. 
The first stage of learning is initiated and directed by 
conscious ideas stimulated by the performance of an act by 
another and descriptive of the essential elements of the 
act and the way in which they may best be combined.

  LANGUAGE — DRAWING — Music 
The second stage is one of practice in doing, resulting 
in fixing ways of doing and increasing accuracy and 
speed, with decreasing conscious attention. 
The third is the habit stage in which the acts are 
performed almost automatically, with nearly uniform 
speed and accuracy under the conditions prevailing dur- 
ing practice, except when fatigue brings decrease, or 
conscious effort increase, in one or the other. 
Any change of ways of doing or conditions requires 
conscious effort and further practice before the act can 
be done speedily, accurately, and automatically. 
In practice, accuracy should be sought before speed. 
Some practice in doing things in easy ways or under 
special conditions may be justified where the acts are 
complex and likely to be performed in the wrong way, 
by many of those being taught; but such practice must 
not be long continued. The most efficient method 
consists in doing the act in the way that it should be 
done and under the conditions of its most frequent use, 
when such practice does not produce errors in ways of 
working that must be corrected by special practice. 
The more completely the various arts of expression 
are made automatic processes that will function quickly 
and accurately wherever conditions and consciousness 
give them their cue, the better has been the training. 
Only then can the mind be freed from hampering details 
and the person become an efficient executive with sub- 
ordinates in the form of habits to carry out with little or 
no supervision whatever he commands.

There is nothing in all the world 
so important as children, nothing so 
interesting. If ever you wish to go 
in for philanthropy, if ever you wish 
to be of real use in the world, do 
something for children. If ever you 
yearn to be wise, study children. If 
the great army of philanthropists ever 
exterminate sin and pestilence, ever 
work out our race salvation, it will be 
because a little child has led.

BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD 
WELL-BEING AND OUR CARE OF THE YOUNG 
LL the higher animals care for their young. Some 
A animals, low in the scale of life, desert the offspring 
as soon as born. A few birds lay their eggs in 
other birds’ nests and have no further care. But for 
the most part, all warm blooded animals care for their 
young. Even some fish prepare a nest and carefully 
guard the eggs until hatched. The common sunfish 
may be seen standing guard over its dish-like depression 
in the gravelly bottom, or chasing away any intruder. 
The human offspring has the longest period of infancy 
and immaturity of any in the animal series; consequently 
it has the longest period during which it must be cared 
for. Human life is motivated by two great fundamental 
instincts—that of self-preservation and the preservation 
of the species. Both these instincts focus upon the child, 
for on the one hand the child is a part of the parent self; 
on the other hand, he is the new member of the species 
—the hope of the future. Thus the end and aim of life 
is the care of the young. It is true that this aim is 
_ sometimes perverted, but it is important to note that 
when this is not the aim of life, it 7s a perversion. 
It is of course true that many men and women have 
no children, but the majority of such people are never- 
theless living and working for the children of others. 
The kind and quality of care given to the youth varies 
over a wide range: all the way from the simplest instinctive 
interest of the ignorant moron or imbecile, up to the 
intelligent care of the most highly developed individuals.

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
While the former group is never disturbed by its ignorance 
of the problems involved, many of the latter group are 
perpetually conscious of their own ignorance of what is 
really best for the child. They are constantly seeking 
knowledge that shall enable them to give their children 
the kind of care that shall most completely fit them to 
best represent their parents and most efficiently serve 
and promote the welfare of the race itself. Between 
these two extremes there are all gradations, and the 
average is disturbingly low. 
While the most intellectual parents may be said to be 
using all the knowledge that the race has acquired in 
the care of its offspring, the masses are not beginning to 
use the information that is available. Thus it happens 
that in the group as a whole, the gap between our knowl- 
edge of child well-being and our actual care of the child, 
is enormous. ‘That this gap must be bridged is evident 
on all sides. It is the purpose of this chapter to marshal 
the evidences of this need. 
If the care of our youth were intelligent and efficient, 
we should expect to find each successive generation 
becoming more and more free from the problems, difh- 
culties, and annoyances that previous generations had 
to contend with. Instead of this being the case, many 
of the most serious problems are increasing in magnitude 
and complexity. Crime, for instance, is decidedly on 
the increase if we are to judge from the increased number 
of inmates in our prisons and penitentiaries, the increase 
in cost of courts for the trial and conviction of the per- 
petrators of crime—and this in spite of the efforts of an 
army of workers who are trying to improve prison con- 
ditions and make the treatment of criminals more efficient. 
Some there are who claim that this increase is because 
of the work of these sentimentalists (as they are some- 
times styled), but that this is not true is pretty clearly 
shown by the fact that our institutions for the care of 
160 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
PRESENT-DAY KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD WELL-BEING 
juvenile delinquents, from whom most of the criminals 
come, are also on the increase. 
In one State (Ohio) the need for accommodations for 
juvenile delinquents is so great that although the law 
states that a child committed to the Industrial School 
must remain until he is 21 years of age, unless earlier 
reformed, the officials have been obliged to establish a 
fiction whereby each child is reformed in twelve months. 
The two institutions, the one for the boys and the other 
for the girls, are thus regularly emptied every twelve 
months, in order to make room for the new cases that 
must be provided for. 
The statistics show that fifteen thousand murders and 
homicides are committed each year, and the number is 
increasing in proportion faster than the increase of 
population. It costs the Government of the United 
States, six hundred thousand dollars annually to guard 
the mail sacks. There is four thousand million (4 billion) 
dollars worth of property stolen in the United States 
each year. 
Nor is the situation any better if we consider the 
problem of the insane. In most states we are either 
building larger institutions or more of them, for the care 
of this class of persons. One hundred and forty thousand 
cases of dementia preecox alone, between the ages of ten 
and thirty, are admitted to the insane hospitals each year. 
Finally, hoodlumism and sexual immorality are 
believed to be increasing enormously. 
If it is true that “as the twig is bent the tree is in- 
clined,” we have a right to attribute most of this intel- 
lectual, social, and moral irregularity to our faulty care 
of the young. We have not succeeded in bridging the 
gap. Not only have we not bridged the gap, but we have 
not even located the difficulty or, I should say, the 
causes of the difficulty. The way in which we have 
attempted to solve these problems and produce a better

condition by changing situations which are mere in- 
cidents to the problem and in no way causal does not 
speak well for our boasted intelligence and progressive 
civilization. 
One group of persons has laid all our troubles to 
alcohol. Another group lays it to the movies; and we 
spend large sums to censor the pictures. We pass laws 
prohibiting the exhibition of prize fight pictures, and 
the depicting of criminal acts. But with no effect upon 
the situation. 
Another group attributes the trouble to the Sunday 
School, and points out the small proportion of children 
who are receiving moral instruction in the churches. 
Another group thinks the automobile is the most per- 
nicious influence that has come into modern society. 
Still others declare the fault is with the schools, both 
public and private—that they teach too much literature, 
history, and science, and not enough morality. 
All this is very childish and superficial. It is just 
as rational and intelligent as it would be to attribute an 
epidemic of typhoid fever to alcohol, automobiles, 
movies, Sunday School, public schools, or any other 
agency which was merely an accidental agent in spread- 
ing the infection, and in no way the cause of the trouble, 
which a few people might be intelligent enough to diag- 
nose as due to an infected water or milk supply. But 
these intelligent people would be regarded as cranks 
by the masses, and no concerted action could be obtained 
to purify the water or stop the dairymen from distribut- 
ing infected milk. Consequently the people would 
continue to die. This is a close analogy to the situation 
that we have been discussing. 
The analogy holds in another direction. Time was 
when we knew nothing about disease germs and their 
transmission through water or milk. We have been 
similarly ignorant until lately of the diversified natures 
162

PRESENT-DAY KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD WELL-BEING 
of children and the consequent necessity for different 
kinds of care for different types of children. Even now 
these facts are known to relatively few, and the great 
problem of to-day is to get the general public to under- 
stand these facts, and to apply them in the care of the 
young. We will now examine the situation from this 
standpoint. 
The first important fact to be considered, as bearing 
upon this problem, is the differences in intelligence. 
Until recently we have assumed and have acted upon the 
assumption, that all children had approximately equal 
capacity, and we explained the fact that they did not 
show equal accomplishment by the theory that they 
were either wicked or lazy; and the time that should 
have been spent in intelligent care of them was devoted 
to prodding and punishing them. Our views on this 
subject have been best summarized by Henry Fairfield 
Osborne, who says, “The true spirit of American democ- 
racy, that all men are born with equal rights and duties, 
has been confused with the political sophistry that all 
men are born with equal character and ability to govern 
themselves and others, and with the educational sophistry, 
that education and environment will offset the handicap 
of heredity.”” We now know not only that there are 
the widest differences in capacity, but we know approxi- 
mately the proportion of children in any particular 
group that will have each grade of intelligence; and 
moreover we are able by our methods of examination 
to determine who they are. In other words, it is now 
possible to ascertain what is the capacity of each indi- 
vidual child. We know, for example, that approximately 
5% of a group of children will develop the highest in- 
telligence, and show marked ability; that 9% more will 
be almost as good; that 16% will be a little above average; 
that 25% will have what we have termed “average in- 
telligence’”’; that 20% will fall a grade below this; that

15% more will never be able to do more than about 
fifth grade work, and finally, that 10% will have low 
intelligence, stopping at the fourth grade or lower. 
Now, any large school graded only on the yearly pro- 
motion plan, will divide up approximately according 
to those figures; and any class in such a school will 
tend also to show the same range of intelligence. 
We have a most excellent public school system. It 
has been evolved empirically by trial and error. We 
have found out, for example, what subjects can be 
mastered by third grade children, fourth grade children, 
fifth grade, and so on. And on that basis we have built 
our curricula. Now, it is evident that such an experi- 
mental procedure has taken account of the average child, 
but every teacher should know that in each room there 
are those who can do the work in half the time of the 
main group. There are others who can not do it at all. 
It is a liberal allowance to consider that the middle fifty 
per cent are well cared for by the existent course of 
study. We are not now speaking of the question of 
whether the subjects taught in each grade are the most 
valuable that could be taught, but only of the fact that 
such subjects as are taught are rightly placed and well 
adapted to fifty per cent of the class. It follows, then, 
that the other fifty per cent are not well cared for. Ap- 
proximately half of these will find the work too hard, 
and the other half will find it too easy. 
The progressive, thinking educators of the country 
are satisfied that the dull group are better off in classes 
by themselves, than in the class with the average child. 
Therefore, they are advocating and are securing in many 
places special classes for the slow, backward, dull, and 
stupid children. Then the question arises,—What shall 
we do with these children after we have segregated them 
in special classes? The evolution of thought along this 
line is interesting. At the outset we thought it was only 
164
-P-A-G-E-183
PRESENT-DAY KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD WELL-BEING 
necessary to allow dull pupils a longer time in which to 
do the work, and so we prescribed the same studies as 
for the bright children, but allowed the dull ones longer 
time. Gradually, we realized that either they could not 
do the work at all, or they could not do enough of it ever 
to become sufficiently proficient to make practical use 
of what they learned. Then, taking our cue from the 
institutions for the feeble-minded, we decided to give 
them part time in manual training. This worked well, 
and gradually the time has been extended until, in those 
communities where the parents are intelligent enough 
to understand the situation, there is given to these 
children little else than manual and industrial training. 
In other words, we have learned to care for these children 
in a way that is adapted to their natures. But as yet no 
community has provided enough of these special classes 
and special curricula to care properly for all of the 
children, and many communities have taken no step at 
all in this direction. 
At this point, it is easy to see why alcohol, movies, 
automobiles, etc., were thought to be the causes of delin- 
quency and anti-social conduct. It is because children 
of low mentality, often coming as they do from homes 
where the parents have equally low mentality, can not 
adjust themselves properly to such situations as the 
movies give rise to, and as a consequence their deficiency 
becomes manifest. Thus the movies are found to be not 
the cause of the condition, but the detector of it. The same 
is true of alcohol; it is now generally accepted by thought- 
ful students that the person who abuses the use of alcoholic 
beverages, is a person of weak mind; or, as has been 
expressed, people are alcoholic because they are feeble- 
minded, rather than being feeble-minded because they are 
alcoholic. The average child in the public school is not 
injured by the movies. Up to three years ago, of the 
more than four hundred delinquent boys and girls 
165 Are Movies

Delin- 
quency?
-P-A-G-E-184
A Concrete 
Illustration Tue CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
examined at the Bureau of Juvenile Research of Ohio, 
not one ever claimed that his delinquency was the result 
of attending the movies, or that the misdemeanor he had 
committed had been suggested by the movies. Since 
that time, there has been so much discussion of the evil 
effect of the movies, that the children have discovered 
that it is a good alibi, and it is consequently given more 
frequently. 
The evils of the old system of caring for these dull 
children in the same way that we have cared for the 
child of average intelligence were many. Space will 
not permit us to elaborate upon this topic; it will be 
considered at length in Chapter XIII. Suffice it to say 
here, that the attempt to make these children do the 
school work which they have not the capacity to do, has 
resulted in discouragement for them. And a discouraged 
person, whether man or child, is a dangerous person. He 
is ready for anything. Besides that, such procedure sent 
the child from school (when the time came to leave school) 
without his having been taught anything that he could 
use, either to earn a livelihood or to occupy his time. He 
was, therefore, an idle person, and the old proverb tells 
of the dangers of idleness. 
Just as an example of what happens in such cases, the 
following instance may be cited: Of eighty delinquents 
examined in a clinic in St. Louis recently, of whom all 
but one were over thirteen years of age when they left 
school, four had been in the ungraded class; four were in 
the second grade when they left school (remember they 
were thirteen years or older and in the second grade); 
four left in the third grade; five in the fourth; eleven in 
the fifth; nineteen in the sixth; fourteen in the seventh 
(at thirteen all of them should have been in the seventh 
grade at least); of the rest, eighteen were in the eighth 
grade, and one was in the first year high school. Of 
another group of a hundred and forty-five delinquent 
166
-P-A-G-E-185
PRESENT-DAY KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD WELL-BEING 
children in regular grades in the schools, two per cent 
were classified four grades above their actual mental 
ability. That is to say, they had been carried along, 
dragged from grade to grade in spite of the fact that they 
had no capacity for doing the work. Another four per 
cent were classified three grades above their ability; 
eight per cent were classified two grades above and 
twenty-two per cent one grade above their ability. 
These figures are typical of what is being found wherever 
such cases are being examined, and will be found to exist 
all over the country. In other words, we are not caring 
for these children as well as we know how todo. Surely 
it is necessary that the gap be bridged. 
Let us turn now to the other end of the scale. We 
have noted that 25% of the children in any class in a 
public school are so much brighter than the majority of 
the class that they do their work in something like half 
the time that it takes most of the children to do it. 
What about these bright pupils? The public school is 
an institution for the care of children during certain 
hours of the day, and it is intended to promote their 
highest welfare by keeping them wisely occupied during 
all their time in school. If the work assigned for the 
class as a whole keeps a particular boy busy only half 
the time, then for the other half he is uncared for. In 
those circumstances, what happens? Experience tells 
us that one of two things happens: either the child uses 
his imagination and ingenuity to keep himself employed, 
in which case it is perhaps as likely to be useless or evil 
employment as good; or else, second, he falls into the 
habit of doing nothing, and thereby becomes lazy. 
In either case the school is not giving him the care that 
he needs. This is not the place for a long discussion 
of this problem; the answer is clear and definite: we 
need special classes for these bright children as well as 
for the dull.

The treatment of gifted children will be discussed 
in detail in Chapter XIV, so that it will suffice to say 
here that the movement to give gifted children proper 
training has started and in a few places classes are in 
operation. The proof of the statement that there is a 
tendency for these children to grow lazy, is found in 
the fact that in more than one instance, such classes 
when formed are for the first two or three months almost 
impossible to handle because of the pupils’ laziness 
which they learn back in the grades where they do not 
have to work. However, in due course, when they 
discover that there is really something worth-while to 
do, they wake up and from that time on their progress 
is rapid and their achievements surprising. Since we 
have begun to apply what we know about the mentality 
of school children, many a child has been saved and 
started on the path toward a higher usefulness by trans- 
ferring him to a grade that was adapted to his intelligence. 
A fourteen-year-old boy was recently examined. He 
had been expelled from one school and was in great 
danger of having the same experience at another. When 
examined it was found that his intelligence was three 
years ahead of his age; and during all his school life 
he had been in grades and had been given work that was 
far too easy for him, so that he had developed a con- 
tempt for the work assigned and incidentally for the 
teachers and school authorities who assigned it. This is 
likely to be the effect of failing to care for these children 
in accordance with their needs. 
Here we may note the facts about the rest of the one 
hundred and forty-five delinquent children referred to 
above. Only 27% were correctly classified; but 20% 
were in a class one grade below their ability, 7% were 
two years below, 4% were three years below, 2% were 
four years below; and one child was classified jive years 
below the grade where he should have been working. No

    PRESENT-DAY KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD WELL-BEING 
wonder that in our schools we develop laziness, indolence, 
idleness, contempt for authority, and other attributes 
out of which grow our misdemeanants and criminals. 
The gap must be bridged. We must apply what we 
know and train the young in accordance with their 
mental capacity. 
When we referred before to the condition of the 
insane, undoubtedly some of our readers said to them- 
selves, ‘‘What has the training of youth to do with 
insanity?” Formerly that might have been an un- 
answerable question. But to-day, we are in possession 
of information that makes the answer easy. It is doubt- 
ful if insanity is any more hereditary than tuberculosis; 
but as in the case of tuberculosis, so with insanity, the 
child may inherit a constitution upon which insanity 
easily grows. We now know that we have in our schools 
many children of a highly nervous temperament, and 
we also know that the wrong kind of care for these 
children may produce insanity, where the right kind of 
care would save them from it. Fortunately, the prac- 
tice of disciplining the young through fear has largely 
passed out, and we should speed the day when the last 
trace of it is gone. 
Appealing to the motive of fear, is one of the most 
dangerous procedures in the case of a nervous child. 
And there is no question that many of the patients in our 
hospitals to-day had the foundation for their insanity 
laid in school. Not only is that true, but it is also true 
that we can detect what might be called incipient insanity 
in many of the children in attendance at the public 
schools. We do not call it insanity, but psychopathy, 
instability, or mild mental disturbance. In this group, 
as in those already described, we are bridging the gap by 
‘recognizing these children and by giving them the kind 
of care that their mental condition requires. Such 
children are easily recognized in most cases by the well-

trained teacher. ‘They have peculiarities that mark them 
off at once as not quite normal. They are not always 
known as particularly nervous children, but they show 
in other ways that in reality their nervous systems are 
not functioning properly. 
Such children are usually more or less solitary. They 
do not get along well with other children of the same 
mental level. They are apt to prefer adults to people 
of their own age. Their games may have a queer monot- 
ony which makes them seem peculiar, even in their own 
family. They have unusual and strong likes and dislikes 
in regard to food. They are frequently destructive, are 
apt to have violent tempers and their parents will fre- 
quently say that they have been recognized as peculiar 
from the time they were babies. They may be moody 
and they are rather easily depressed. Contrary to the 
feeble-minded who usually have a good memory and 
poor reasoning power, these children are poor in memory 
and better in reasoning. This results in their doing 
poor work in school in those subjects that require memory, 
such as spelling and geography and also it results in their 
being frequently very shrewd, cunning, and original in 
devising and planning pranks and other disturbances. 
They are the children upon whom the teacher can not 
rely, and concerning whose misbehaviors she is always 
worried, for they are different and the regular punish- 
ments do not fit them. No amount of punishment does 
any good. They promise well but fail to perform up to 
their promises. They are frequently cruel, sometimes 
kleptomaniacal, often guilty of lying, and sometimes of 
sex perversities. It is not necessary for any one unstable 
individual to show all of these symptoms, but any child 
manifesting several out of this group should receive a 
careful examination by an expert who understands the 
problem. 
Some persons declare that it is the business of the 
170 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  PRESENT-DAY KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD WELL-BEING 
school to teach the subjects of study as they have been 
doing while it is the business of the home to attend to the 
morals of the young. This is a conservative attitude, 
and conservatism is frequently useful. But we are 
gradually breaking away from the old conservatism, and 
with satisfactory results. The appointment of school 
physicians was strenuously objected to originally on the 
ground that this was paternalism; critics said it was the 
parents’ business to look after the health of their children. 
School lunches were even more strenuously objected to, 
but they have come to be quite general and are now 
recognized as of the greatest value. The story is told ofa 
certain boy who needed a bath. The teacher sent him 
home at night with a note to his mother, asking that he be 
given a bath, saying that he did not smell clean. The 
mother replied, that she sent Johnny to school “to be 
teached not to be smelled’. Nevertheless, she ulti- 
mately accepted the point of view, and a few days later 
sent him back with a note saying, ‘‘Smell Johnny now.” 
From a larger point of view, it may be asked, “‘What 
really should be the function of the school?” Someone 
has said, “It is the transmission of racial experience and 
the development of the individual psyche.” The first 
impression is that this expresses it very well, but the 
more we analyze it, the more we see that it is inadequate. 
There are many of the experiences of the race that it is 
not necessary to transmit to the child. If they are worth 
keeping, they are in the records and can be referred to 
as needed. As to the development of the psyche, it 
may very well be questioned whether we have any power 
to develop the psyche, or whether our work is not rather 
to guide it in a somewhat more useful direction than it 
would naturally go. The hackneyed phrase of making a 
good citizen out of the child is much nearer the truth, if 
only we understand what is involved, and if we have at 
hand all the knowledge that has been attained of child

welfare and if we do bridge the gap and put it into 
practice in our child training. 
It is clearly demonstrated now that the child is a 
bundle of impulses which have developed in the race, 
in order to enable him to cope with the environment in 
which he is placed. And if the environment of to-day 
and the requirements of the future were the same as 
those of the long past ages through which man has 
traveled, the problem of education would be fairly 
simple. 
As a matter of fact, the environment has changed 
very radically, and with the result that many of the 
primitive inpulses which we have inherited lead to 
conduct which is intolerable in the present social group. 
This being the case, it_should be our aim to develop in 
the young the power to adjust themselves to new. condi- 
tions, and to acquire the power of self-control.. For exam- 
ple, we now know that the instinct of self-preservation 
leads directly to the appropriation to one’s own use of 
whatever he comes across that he conceives may be 
useful to him; and it leads also to the concealing of his 
own plans and purposes by deceiving others as much 
as possible. The instinct for the perpetuation of the 
race leads to uncontrolled sexual indulgence. In the 
times when men lived much apart and to themselves, 
all these were virtues. The hoarding instinct was basic 
in providing for the future; the deceiving instinct led to 
withholding from others information that might be used 
against the individual, and the sex impulse led to the 
production of many offspring to fight for the safety and 
welfare of the family. 
In the modern world, we live close together and in 
a codperative society. We have divided up the work of 
life, so that we are each dependent upon all the rest. 
Under these conditions, the instinct to hoard and ac- 
cumulate becomes stealing. The instinct to deceive 
172

becomes lying, and unlimited sex activity becomes sex 
immorality. 
Our problem, then, is so to care for the child that he The Problem 
shall come to modify his natural instincts thoroughly Fe 
in the interest of the group as a whole. No one will 
deny that this is vastly more important than transmit- 
ting the history of the race or even the ability to speak 
and write correctly. It does not require, usually, that 
these latter arts must necessarily be given up, but it 
does require that whatever else is done, this trans- 
formation should be brought about. But in order to 
bring it about, each of the groups of children already 
described should have a different kind of care. The very 
dull child can not learn anything as a matter of abstract 
morality. His training must be concrete and definite. 
As already intimated, the bright child, if not properly 
cared for, may develop a contempt for the advice of 
his elders, and therefore not try to adapt himself to the 
rules of the group. And finally, the psychopathic child 
has a special difficulty in making the necessary trans- 
formation. Only the healthy child with sound nerves 
passes through this transformation without something 
of a shock. ‘Therefore, the psychopath must be handled 
with the greatest care if his nerves are not to be more 
completely shattered, and he later to become an inmate 
of an asylum. 
There are many things yet to be learned about child Much Yet 
welfare. There is much about the child’s physical ‘*™ 
nature that we do not know; and also the details of 
his mental makeup and growth, and the effect of the 
many and diverse new influences in the environment. 
But we will gain knowledge of these in time. Mean- 
while, the necessity for applying what we do know to 
giving the child the best possible care is paramount.

is futile to graduate our children from school with high 
grades, if we are not at the same time doing much to 
prevent crime, insanity, and the whole long list of anti- 
social activivies. 
-Man’s greatest interest is in children. As usual it 
is hard to put in practice what we know. 
However, something radical must be done because 
as a group we are losing ground. ‘The anti-social element 
is increasing and the burden of the insane and feeble- 
minded is becoming heavier. 
The explanation of all this is that we have mistaken 
symptoms for causes. The cause of crime, insanity, and 
delinquency is not anything so simple as the movies, 
alcohol or any of the other numerous supposed causes. 
The cause is to be sought and found in man’s in- 
herited tendencies, which do not fit his present world, 
and we have not tried efficiently to modify them. 
We now know better than ever before the nature of 
the child, the wide range of capacities in children and 
the necessity of adapting the training to the nature and 
ability of the individual child. 
We have roughly four groups: the normal or average 
child for whom our methods and school curricula are 
pretty well adapted; the subnormal or feeble-minded 
child who can be made useful but only by special meth- 
ods; the super-normal child who also is not well cared for 
in the regular school—he has gifts that should be cher- 
ished and cultivated. Lastly we have the sick child— 
the psychopath or unstable child. We are often making 
him worse and thereby filling our hospitals for the insane. 
The schools must play the chief rdle in training the 
young because the home can not do so effectively. The 
school must not lose sight of the fact that the making 
of good citizens is accomplished more successfully by 
teaching children to control the natural tendency to 
steal and lie, than by teaching them to read and write.

Nutrition 
and Mental 
Development 
Defined IX 
RELATION OF NUTRITION TO MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
N CONSIDERING the relation of nutrition to men- 
tal development, let us first of all define what we 
mean by the term “nutrition” and also by the term 
“mind.” 
The use of the word “nutrition” to express two 
quite distinct meanings has given rise to much confusion. 
Instead of being merely equivalent to “nourishment”’ or 
“food,” a better and broader definition is, ‘“The process 
by which animals and plants take in and utilize food 
substances.” This larger meaning includes not only the 
food itself, but also those factors which have to do with 
the assimilation of food and its utilization in promoting 
the growth and repair of the body. It is in this sense 
that we shall use the term in the discussion of its relation 
to mental development. 
Still greater confusion exists in regard to the definition 
of what we call “mind.” For many years, unfortunately, 
the mind has been considered as something quite apart 
from the body, but we are now coming to understand 
that it is a function of that part of the body called the 
nervous system, of which the brain is the chief organ. 
So then, considering mind in its relation to the entire 
body, and especially to that part called the nervous 
system, we study it in much the same way that we 
study other functions in their relation to the special 
parts of the body through which their behavior is 
observed. 
Using the brain as a symbol for the physical basis of 
mental activity, we recognize that the better the body, 
176
-P-A-G-E-195
NUTRITION AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
the better the brain, and its power to function as mind 
is determined by the quality of its tissue, its blood supply, 
and other physical conditions. Therefore, the child 
needs a well developed and well nourished nervous 
system for mental efficiency, just as he needs well 
developed and well nourished organs in other parts of 
his body for physical efficiency. 
When attention is thus turned to what the mind 
does, rather than to the more abstract problem of what 
it is, the whole subject of mental development becomes 
more clear. In a recent discussion Robinson! states 
the new trend of opinion as follows: 
“Man is an integral part of the natural order; he 
and his environment are constantly interacting. Such 
well-tried old terms as the will, consciousness, selfish- 
ness, the instincts, etc., when reinspected in the light 
of our ancestral background and embryological begin- 
nings, all look very different from what they once did. 
‘Mind and matter can no longer be divorced, but 
must be studied as different phases of a single vital and 
incredibly complicated situation. Mind is still in the 
making. An historical consideration of human intelli- 
gence, taking into account its animal and prehistoric 
foundations, its development in historic times, and the 
decisive childhood experiences through which each of 
us individually must pass—all these combine to reveal 
previously neglected elements in our minds, and untold 
possibilities in their future growth.” 
The relation between nutrition and mental develop- 
ment is shown in its simplest form in infancy. The 
well nourished baby crows and laughs; he eats, sleeps, 
and takes interest in the life about him, offering no 
difficulty in his relations with others beyond the effort 
to get what he wants. The poorly nourished infant is 
fretful, irritable, nervous; his sleep is disturbed, and

everyone associated with him suffers because of his 
condition. Such an infant is rightly considered a sick 
child, and is treated accordingly. He needs mental 
treatment in the way of training and control, but this 
is futile without physical treatment to bring him into a 
normal state of nutrition. 
Unless this malnutrition is promptly removed, further 
mental effects appear as the child grows older. Instead of 
a natural reaching out into the various forms of activity 
that are essential to his well-being, there appears an 
attitude of defence and a desire to be let alone which are 
fatal to normal social relationships. ‘The child’s interests 
are narrowed, and his whole attitude becomes negative. 
Unfortunate personality traits develop, such as self- 
centeredness, shyness, lack of confidence, selfishness, 
jealousy, fearfulness, depression, day-dreaming, and 
unusual attachments. As the sentiments and emotions 
develop, the situation grows more and more complex, 
and it is difficult to separate cause and effect and say 
how much the child’s physical condition affects his 
mind, or to what degree his mental condition affects 
his body. 
The close parallel existing between physical and mental 
development was recognized by Bowditch as early as 
1891, and the work of later investigators has served to 
emphasize his conclusions. In 1893, as a result of a 
study of St. Louis school children, Porter’ reported that 
the brighter children were definitely heavier, and the 
dull children lighter, than the average child of the same 
age. A similar observation is made by Baldwin,” who 
has summarized with the results of his own researches 
data gathered by many other investigators both in this 
country and in Europe in a series of studies extending 
from 1836 to 1913.

of Science (St. Louis) "Transactions, 1893, v. 6, pp. 263-80. ‘“‘The Growth of St. Louis

NUTRITION AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
The following statements from his report are significant 
as representing a practically unanimous opinion on this 
subject :! 
“Dull children are shorter, than precocious children 
of the same age, or average children.” (p. 145.) 
“Successful pupils are taller than unsuccessful, and 
the rate of growth is quicker than in the unsuccessful.” 
(p. 145.) 
“Dull children are lighter than precocious children.” 
(p. 148.) 
“The lung capacity was found to be much greater in 
children whose standing in school is high, and distinctly 
inferior in a school for laggards.” (p. 148.) 
“The tall, heavy boys and girls, with good lung 
capacity are older physiologically, and further along in 
their stages toward mental maturity, as evidenced by 
school progress, than are the short, light boys and girls.” 
(p. 96.) 
The same correlation between school progress and the 
nutrition of the child, as represented by the weight-height 
index, is shown in a more recent study made in Detroit 
covering 80,662 children, which reports a clear tendency 
toward an increase in percentage of underweight in 
proportion to the years of retardation in school work, 
while an equally consistent trend in the opposite direction 
accompanies each half-yearly step of acceleration in 
school work.? 
It has been argued in this connection that these 
studies merely show that mental superiority accompanies 
physical superiority, without proving that the physically 
inferior child, if brought up to normal, would show a 
corresponding improvement in mental development. At 
the present time, it is true, we cannot say how much

of physical condition. As the child grows, every advance in inches calls for a corresponding 
advance in pounds.

NUTRITION AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
rather than an increase in native ability that we look for 
in bringing about improved nutrition. 
Clinically, the physical changes that take place in the 
malnourished infant or older child as he returns to a 
normal physical condition are often remarkable, so great 
that the child can hardly be recognized. The mental 
transformation that accompanies physical recovery is 
frequently as great, so that it is a customary comment 
of parents and teachers,—“He is a different boy. His 
whole mental attitude has changed. You would not 
know him.” 
One of the common fallacies met with in discussions 
of the relation between mental and physical growth is 
due to the tenacity with which we hold to some exceptional 
case, as, for example, the weak or delicate child who despite 
physical handicaps has made striking progress in school. 
That this is not a typical experience, however, is shown 
by Whipple’s! study of “gifted” children, in which 
he reports that of 128 students observed, go per cent 
were healthy themselves, and 83 per cent had healthy 
parents. 
During the first year of life, the child’s needs may 
appear to be met by attention to the physical essentials of 
health, namely, proper food, rest, air, and exercise; yet 
mental hygiene is also needed even in the first few weeks 
to ensure both mental and physical growth. 
The first requisite is the teaching of obedience. The 
child’s instinctive desires are expressed by crying if he 
does not immediately get what he wants, and if this 
method is successful, chaos soon reigns in the home, with 
the forming of habits that directly interfere with growth. 
Self-control through obedience is the foundation for all 
training. 
A second need of the child is mothering, or love, which 
brings with it trust, happiness, and contentment. It is

States,’ Mother and Child, September, 1923, Supplement.

common knowledge that it is undesirable to keep an 
‘infant too long in a hospital, however perfect the hygienic 
conditions may be. Mothering is necessary for growth. 
A third factor is regularity, which has to do with habit 
formation, and gives the child a sense of order and 
security. 
As he grows older, he needs to be taught responsibility, 
which gives him self-respect and self-confidence. 
All these factors in mental training are best brought 
to bear on the child’s development in the environment 
of a good home, where by the force of example as well as 
by training, the child develops proper habits of work and 
play, learns to have consideration for others, and finds 
out how to adjust himself to parents, servants, neighbors, 
and other children. 
Our greatest accomplishment in child welfare thus far 
has been in standardizing a program for infant care. 
This is one of the notable medical achievements of our 
era, and has resulted in a greatly reduced infant mortality. 
But when the period of infancy is passed, our record is 
not so creditable, and the pre-school years have come to 
be known as the most neglected period of life. In fact, 
most children pass through the whole growing period 
without the kind of examination that is needed to deter- 
mine whether they are developing properly, mentally and 
physically. 
The opportunity afforded for the spread of infection 
by the massing of great numbers of children in our public 
schools has led to a certain degree of care with regard to 
contagious diseases, and we salve our consciences by a 
formal inspection of children in a hurrying line. But 
this sort of school examination, with children fully dressed, 
reveals little about their general nutrition, and anything 
like a thorough physical examination is almost unknown 
until the child becomes acutely ill. A beginning has 
been made in the wider adoption of the practice of weigh- 
182 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  
NUTRITION AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
ing and measuring school children, but it should be 
followed by the incorporation of a broad nutrition 
program in the school system. 
In a recent report of an orphan asylum, five pages were 
_ devoted to the subject of mental tests, while two lines 
were considered sufficient to sum up the results of the 
health inspection. Yet in this institution more than a 
third of the children were suffering from malnutrition. 
The mental examiners, it is true, call for a physical 
examination to rule out physical defect before they 
diagnose defects as mental, but there has been little 
attempt to see that the physical examination is adequate. 
Conduct and various mental qualities are graded and 
marked, but both in the school and in the home the 
physical condition of the growing child is treated with 
less intelligence than the farmer applies to his livestock, 
or the dog fancier to his puppies. 
The result is that a third or more of all the children 
of this country are underweight, undernourished, mal- 
nourished; physically, and, therefore, mentally unfit. 
This neglected third is unrecognized in the home, the 
school, and the community, and we may well be startled 
by the significant fact that the major part of our dis- 
cussions and conclusions concerning normal children is 
based upon observations of this group. 
A clear distinction between the well and the sick would 
clear the way to a better understanding of individual 
differences and possibilities. A malnourished child who 
is toxic from focal infection, fatigue, bad air, imperfect 
digestion or assimilation, or any other cause, is a. sick 
child, and his mental reactions are different from those of 
a child in normal health. Were this more generally 
understood, we should be the better able to cope with his 
difficulties. 
These are the children who congest our clinics. They 
gain a place in open air schools, and remain there, with

little progress, until the age limit removes them. Teachers 
and principals spend profitless hours each year on a 
discussion of their promotion or demotion. More re- 
cently they have come to be a problem in industry when a 
working certificate is required. They appear in large 
numbers in the juvenile courts, and charity organizations 
know them through generation after generation. 
In a prominent country day school it was found, after 
weighing and measuring all the children, that with one 
exception every problem of promotion and of discipline 
was in the underweight group. 
Much time has been spent in discussing the respective 
influence of heredity and environment in both mental 
and physical development. We know little about hered- 
ity, for even when there seems to be tangible evidence 
as to the appearance of certain traits in successive gen- 
erations, we are unable to state what might have been 
the development of the ancestor in question had he been 
placed in a more favorable environment. This is par- 
ticularly true in the case of malnutrition. Time and 
again, when a certain child has seemed predestined to be 
thin because of his unmistakable resemblance to a thin 
forbear, we have seen him attain normal weight and 
maintain it, with a decided improvement in physical 
and mental condition. A practical attitude toward 
this important question is well stated by Kirkpatrick, 
as follows: 
“From the individual standpoint, heredity should 
neither be ignored as of no importance, nor yielded to 
as inevitably fixing one’s destiny. Instinctive and 
hereditary tendencies are the roots from which the 
physical, mental, and moral life develops. Some in- 
dividuals develop more readily, and to a greater degree 
than others. All are of the same human characteristics, 
but each may make the most of his environment. Some 
184 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
NUTRITION AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
cannot go as far as others in certain directions, nor as 
easily, but no one has exhausted his possibilities of 
development. The practical problem is to expend our 
efforts upon the useful characteristics which we possess 
in the greatest degree.”’ 
Whatever be the child’s heredity, he needs the best 
possible environment to promote the mental, moral, and 
physical growth which his inheritance affords. 
The question is often asked as to the extent of per- 
manent damage done by malnutrition, and the degree of 
recovery and compensation possible after the causes 
have been removed. Animal experiments by Mendel 
and by Stuart and Jackson show that the organism has 
wonderful powers of recuperation, and remarkable 
ability to make adaptation in cases in which recovery is 
limited; yet if malnutrition continues throughout the 
normal period of growth there results an actual stunting, 
the vital organs remain undersized, and the length of 
the body lessened. In children who remain under- 
nourished throughout the whole period of growth there 
is little evidence that they ever attain their own normal 
degree of development; while, on the other hand, under- 
nourished children who are made ‘“‘free to gain” and 
put on a good nutrition program respond promptly 
by an accelerated gain both in weight and in height. 
During the World War opportunity was afforded for 
the observation of malnutrition on a large scale, and 
Blanton! has reported a study made in Trier, Germany, 
with special consideration of its effect upon mental 
development. Some of his conclusions are: 
1. At least forty per cent of the children in the 
Volkschulen are suffering from malnutrition to such 
a degree as to cause a loss of nervous energy. 
2. While the percentage of stuttering, stammering, 
and other speech defects did not increase, there was

a marked increase in poor, lisping, slurring speech 
due to retardation or interference of the fine co6r- 
dinations necessary for good speech. 
3. Failure to pass grades increased from a pre- 
war average of 8 per cent to 15 per cent in 1917 
and 1918. Itis estimated that half of this retardation 
is due to malnutrition, and half to war conditions. 
4. A similar lowering of the whole standard of 
school work, due in part to the same two causes, is 
noted. Half the children who in pre-war times did 
superior work now do average work, and the percent- 
age of children who do inferior work has increased 
from 20 to more than 30 per cent. 
5. Specific changes noted are: a lack of nervous 
and physical energy; inattention during school hours; 
poor and slow comprehension; poor memory; a general 
nervous restlessness while in school. 
6. While children of good nervous stock, or superior 
intelligence, seem to withstand a serious degree of 
malnutrition extending over more than two years 
without greater impairment than a lack of nervous 
energy, children of poor nervous stock of inferior 
intelligence sufter a general, and sometimes a perma- 
nent, lowering of the whole intelligence level from 
even a moderate degree of malnutrition. 
The problem of correcting malnutrition in children 
is in many instances a simple one, but in others it is one 
of the most difficult in all medicine. 
Beginning work on this special problem in 1908, it 
was not until 1918 that I was able to demonstrate that 
every child in an entire group could be brought up to 
normal. Since then we have been able practically to 
eliminate malnutrition from ten orphan asylums and in 
the year 1923 nutrition work carried on according to 
our program in Rochester, N. Y., demonstrated that 
approximately 1ooo of the most undernourished children 
of that city could be made to gain at the rate of 343%

in their own homes without seriously interfering with 
their school work. Similar results have been secured 
in other cities. 
This was accomplished by ascertaining the causes of 
their malnutrition and removing them in nutrition 
classes by uniting the forces that control the child’s 
health.' 
It is of interest to note that the five chief causes of 
physical malnutrition, as observed in many thousands of 
cases, are also fundamental causes of mental unfitness. 
Taken in order of their importance, they are: 
(1) Physical defects, or inflammatory processes, 
such as adenoids and diseased tonsils. ‘This cause 
affects the mental condition by toxemias, clouding 
the mind, bringing about early fatigue, producing 
lack of concentration, poor memory, restlessness, and 
unstable nervous reactions. 
(2) Lack of home control. While this cause is 
essentially mental, its physical results are so con- 
spicuous that we list it second in the causes of mal- 
nutrition. 
(3) Overfatigue. This cause is perhaps the one 
most generally overlooked, although its effects are 
both physical and mental. The constantly increas- 
ing activities and interests of present-day life have 
added to the burden of the growing child, and when 
he begins to fall behind in school, there is a tendency 
to increase the pressure by longer hours and home 
work. 
(4) Faulty food habits and improper food. Aside 
from disturbed digestion and other functions, this

cause affects the nervous system at its source, and 
is reflected in every form of mental activity. 
(5) Faulty health habits include all those factors 
commonly included under the term “personal hy- 
giene,”’ without which the child cannot thrive either 
physically or mentally. 
It will be seen, therefore, that most of the features 
of a program for dealing with mental unfitness are based 
upon removal of the causes which are associated with 
malnutrition. In fact, after working on the problem 
from the standpoint of physical unfitness, I found that 
the removal of these causes brought about mental 
changes in the child which corresponded with the aims 
of the mental hygiene workers. The parallel is some- 
times less evident because abnormal conditions caused 
by sickness often persist after recovery from the original 
cause. These are the situations in which mental hygiene 
by itself is especially effective, but it is not effective when 
applied by itself as a cure for children suffering from such 
toxic conditions as listed above unless the basic cause is 
first removed. On the other hand, abnormal mental 
and social reactions, brought about by the child’s physi- 
cal condition, frequently disappear without special 
training when nutrition becomes normal. 
(See illustrations on two pages following page 190.) 
Another instance is that of a boy concerning whom it 
was not clear to either a psychiatrist or myself whether he 
was suffering from mental deficiency, retardation, or 
mental perversion due to abnormal physical and social 
conditions. It was evident that his mother was unable 
to grapple with the situation. He knew he could get his 
own way with her and did not hesitate to use both fists 
and feet in accomplishing his ends. 
A good home school was chosen, where the boy for 
the first time in his life met with standards of living

NUTRITION AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
which did not bend to his whims and fancies. He soon 
recovered from the first shock and proved to be an 
example of the depth of inferior behavior to which an 
intelligent child can sink through indulgence and lack of 
training. Within a few weeks he had attained average 
weight, learned self-control and proved that he possessed 
normal intelligence. His teachers reported him to be a 
“nerfect little gentleman.”’ 
In any group of malnourished children we find lack of 
home control a factor in a surprisingly large proportion of 
cases, although its effect may be so conspicuously evident 
in improper food and health habits, chronic overfatigue, 
or the failure to have physical defects removed that the 
child’s condition may seem to be due to one of these 
other causes. These are not only the children from 
homes which have become disorganized by tuberculosis, 
by the death or separation of the parents, or where the 
mother is the bread winner and cannot properly supervise 
the children’s activities; but also in even greater numbers 
they are the “only child” or “‘spoiled child” types from 
well-to-do families or homes of wealth, where the children 
are over-indulged or left to the care of indifferent servants. 
We can discover which of the causes of malnutrition 
are operating in any given case only by complete social, 
physical growth, and mental examinations. Each of the 
three is essential. 
The social examination has been almost unknown in 
the past, yet it has to do with the child’s interests, 
activities, and occupations, and is directly related to the 
factors of home control, overfatigue, and food and health 
habits. This record also includes the family history and 
the child’s own health history, which may have valuable 
information bearing on his present condition. 
The mental examination is given to determine mental 
defect, mental retardation or acceleration, and personality. 
The physical growth examination must be thorough,

not only to answer the question, ‘‘Has the child any 
physical evidence of disease?” but also the further 
question, “Is he growing properly?” The first step in 
this examination is weighing and measuring because we 
have as yet found no other single item of information 
that affords so much help in determining the child’s 
nutrition. We are accustomed to follow the weight 
chart of an infant as an index of his condition, but the 
older child’s weight line is an almost equally sensitive 
indicator of the effects of over fatigue, loss of sleep, slight 
indigestion, school tension, or any of the thousand 
incidents in his daily life. 
Having through this series of examinations ascertained 
the causes of physical unfitness, the nutrition class brings 
together the home, the school, medical care, and the 
child’s own interest, thus codrdinating the various 
forces that safeguard health, namely, the home, the 
school, medical care, and the child’s own interest. Weekly 
meetings are held, at which the attendance of the parents 
and the physician are essential. Home and school which 
have been ‘‘unhappily divorced,” as Campbell puts it, 
are thus united, and the child’s own interest is aroused 
through competition and coéperation. The class method 
gives the child a health objective. He has his individual 
weight chart which visualizes his physical condition, 
so that the mere mention of a habit that interferes with 
his gaining is often sufficient for its correction. 
In scores of communities from Labrador to the 
Hawaiian Islands these classes are in operation; in the 
city of Rochester there are some fifteen hundred children 
enrolled at all times during the schovl year. As fast as 
one comes up to average weight and “graduates,”’ another 
takes his place, and it is found that 70 per cent of the 
children maintain their new status after leaving the class. 
Holt has characterized the class or group method as 
epochal in the treatment of children. It is a most

The Case of Dorothea. 
Dorothea, aged eleven, became tired on slight exertion, so tired that it took 
her nearly an hour to dress in the morning. She would sit and dream, rarely 
smiled, and her face looked distressed. She passed the school medical inspec- 
tion, but was given a tonic by her family physician. The hospital diagnosis 
was “No Disease.” The nutrition diagnosis was: underweight 21%; naso- 
pharyngeal obstruction; cervical adenitis; carious teeth; spinal curvature; 
fatigue posture. Nutrition class treatment was begun with the resulting trans- 
formation in both mental and physical condition shown above. 
These “before”’ and “‘after” pictures and the two following are those of a girl and a boy who 
illustrate very strikingly the physical and mental changes accompanying a return to normal 
condition from a state of serious underweight. These pictures are by the courtesy of The Woman 's

NUTRITION AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
effective method of health education, and humanizes 
our child welfare work. It is based on the century-old 
maxim, mens sana in sano corpore, providing instruction 
as well as treatment, and appealing to the sympathies 
and affections as well as to the intellect. When a child 
has come up to the average weight line the improvement 
he has made is mental as well as physical. During the 
period in which he has faithfully followed the program 
of rest periods, diet, and general hygiene he has not only 
received a health education of the highest value but in 
the process there has been developed in him something 
called character. 
Nutrition is not synonymous with nourishment or 
food but includes all the factors which have to do with 
the assimilation of food and its utilization in promoting 
the growth and repair of the body. The mind is a 
function of the body and our practical concern is with 
what it does rather than with what it is. 
Well nourished infants offer few problems. The in- 
fant that is ill nourished is fretful, irritable, nervous, 
and is rightly treated as a sick child. Continued mal- 
nutrition narrows a child’s interests, develops in him un- 
fortunate personality traits and induces a negative 
attitude toward life. : 
Bowditch, Porter, and Baldwin have shown that 
brighter children are taller and heavier and dull children 
shorter and lighter than the average child of the same 
age. A Detroit study shows close correlation between 
retardation in school and underweight for height. 
Improved nutrition brings greater power of mind 
into operation. Malnutrition lowers the possibility of 
using mental processes. Whipple reports that “gifted” 
children are healthy themselves and come from healthy 
parents. 
The physical essentials of health are proper food, 
rest, fresh air, and exercise, but mental hygiene is needed

even in the first few weeks including training in obedience, 
mothering or love, and regularity. All these operate 
best in a good home. 
Our present standardized program for infant care is 
one of the most notable medical achievements of all time 
but the remainder of the growing period is still neg- 
lected. So-called “medical” inspection in schools is | 
a misnomer and is inadequate. The result of this 
neglect is that a third or more of the children in the 
pre-school and school periods are underweight, under- 
nourished, and malnourished. ‘These are sick children 
and should be treated as such. They congest clinics and 
open air schools, make up the greater part of the retarded 
and disciplinary groups in schools, and present a serious 
problem in industry. They compel undue attention and 
our standards of health and achievement are too largely 
determined by them. 
Blanton reports that school children in Germany 
whom he studied showed the following results of mal- 
nutrition: a lack of nervous and physical energy; inat- 
tention during school hours; poor and slow comprehen- 
sion; poor memory; a general nervous restlessness while 
in school. 
The chief causes of malnutrition in the order of their 
importance are: physical defects, especially naso-pha- 
ryngeal obstructions; lack of home control or mental 
hygiene; over fatigue; faulty food habits and improper 
food; faulty health habits. Both physical and mental 
needs must be provided for in order to overcome this 
condition. 
In order to determine the cause of any given case of 
malnutrition it is necessary to make a complete social, 
mental, and physical growth examination. The first 
gives a record of his history, interests, and activities. 
The second determines mental defect, mental retardation 
or acceleration, and personality. The third reveals

physical evidence of disease and shows whether or not 
he is growing properly. 
Any child who is habitually under average weight 
for his height is in need of a special nutrition program 
to bring him up to normal condition. His weight line is 
a sensitive indicator of the various factors in accom- 
plishing or in retarding growth. The nutrition class, 
centering in the weight chart, codrdinates the four 
forces which are essential in safeguarding physical 
and mental health: the home, the school, medical care, 
and the child’s own interest.

NERVOUS AND MENTAL HYGIENE AMONG CHILDREN 
IN PRESENT-DAY LIFE 
HEN we talk of the mental hygiene of child- 
hood we must of necessity address those who 
have the care and control, direction and edu- 
cation of the child in hand. We can hardly address 
ourselves to the child so we must speak to the adults 
who have his interests at heart. If, therefore, we are 
forced, by the necessity of the situation, to address the 
adults our first task must be to interpret the child to 
them. This might seem a strange statement at first 
but if we look back over the years and see with what 
cruelty children have been treated, murdered, sold into 
prostitution and slavery, deliberately deformed to use 
as beggars and mountebanks, abandoned, beaten and 
starved, we may realize to some extent the abyss which, 
in the past, has separated child and adult and we may 
safely assume, I think, that this abyss was created and 
maintained, partly at least, if not largely, as a result of 
ignorance. In proof of this contention is the growing 
realization that children are the greatest asset of which 
any society can boast, for does not its further possibilities 
all depend upon the possibilities of their future? And 
therefore is not a nation’s fate dependent upon what its 
children are and become? 
The main fact to bear in mind in order to bridge this 
abyss between the adult and the child and to come to 
some understanding of the child mind is to realize that 
the child thinks differently from the adult. Thinking is 
a highly complicated process and has developed in us 
194 
   
-P-A-G-E-217
  NERVOUS AND MENTAL HYGIENE 
from the simplest beginnings. We have come a long 
way on the road of development from the child who 
reaches out its hand and thinks it can grasp the moon. 
Children are not just small adults. To be sure they 
are aduits in the making but they are at a stage of develop- 
ment which so far removes them from adulthood that 
child and adult are, for the most part, strangers to one 
another. It is essential therefore that the adult should 
realize this and at least make an effort to understand the 
child by realizing the fundamental fact that the child’s 
ways of thinking and feeling are just as understandable 
as ours if only we know on what they are based. The 
child who is afraid of all doctors because once he was hurt 
by a doctor has simply not yet learned to differentiate 
different persons and different sets of circumstances as 
we have and its fear is a perfectly natural outcome of this 
inability and confusion. 
Again the adult constantly makes the mistake of 
supposing that what the child cannot understand will 
not be attended to and so will create no impression. As 
a matter of fact the child is exquisitely alert to all that 
goes on about it and if it does not understand in the adult 
sense that does not prevent it from coming to its own con- 
clusions as to what is meant, and that is just what it does. 
Then again the child is not an isolated being. It is 
linked to the past by heredity; it is actively and con- 
stantly engaged in trying to relate itself in a satisfactory 
manner with the present in the form of its immediate 
surroundings and to that end is exceedingly alive to all 
aspects of its environment; and depending upon the 
nature of its inherited tendencies and upon its success 
with the present is its promise for the future. The child 
is not something that is formed and stationary; it is 
living, growing, developing and in the process it is plastic 
and there is considerable leeway as to the form and 
character it will ultimately assume.

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
It is because the child is plastic, capable within limits 
of being moulded by circumstances, that childhood is the 
most important period of life and the golden period for 
mental hygiene. It depends upon how the developmental 
period of the first few years is negotiated what the future 
has to offer. Success or failure at this time means health 
and the possibility of happiness or illness and suffering. 
What the child brings with it into the world in the way 
of hereditary characteristics is the material which cannot 
be changed and is the stuff with which we and the child 
must work in the future. We may profitably think of 
the child as starting with a certain equipment, and life, 
in the processes of education and development, as pre- 
senting the possibilities and opportunities to this raw 
material for its unfoldment. This is a very different 
conception from that, now only beginning to be exten- 
sively given up, namely, that the child should be pressed, 
beaten if necessary, into the form that its elders think it 
should assume. It is a concept which concedes much 
more to the individual while not forgetting, however, 
the claims of society for a reasonable degree of conformity. 
The whole developmental period of childhood has these 
two aims, the maximum unfoldment of the individual 
possibilities consistent with the necessary degree of 
conformity to social standards. 
Into this two-way stream is projected the child who 
must learn to adapt itself on the one hand to the world of 
reality about it, consisting of the persons and things in 
its environment, particularly the parents and those who 
stand in similar relation to it, and the background of 
authority represented by these elders. These are what 
Miller’ aptly refers to as the barrier of reality and the 
barrier of authority at which life demands a certain 
practical adjustment as the means of progress. I shall 
suggest briefly certain difficulties which ensue when these 
barriers can not be surmounted.

NERVOUS AND MENTAL HYGIENE 
Many parents act as if they owned their children 
instead of being, as is implied in what has already been 
said, the trustees of their childhood for future generations. 
They but hold their children’s lives in trust for the future 
and more and more the parent is being held accountable 
for how that life turns out. It is being appreciated as 
fundamental that juvenile delinquency in a very large 
number of instances is traceable to home influences, more 
particularly those of the parents. The past abuses of 
children, already referred to, were based upon the theory 
of parental ownership. If a parent needed money he 
sold or bound out his child to service in order to obtain 
it. The theory of ownership was obvious. 
The barrier of reality may be impregnable. Juvenile 
delinquents come from situations where reality is over- 
whelming, where circumstances are destructive and un- 
conquerable, and so the child tries every means to escape, 
including the anti-social. 
If authority is too powerful and arbitrary it may 
crush out all initiative and capacity for individual develop- 
ment in the child. On the other hand, if the child cannot 
be so easily subdued, it may make of him a rebel, an 
iconoclast, a sceptic, incapable of conforming to any 
authority. The object of education as regards this aspect 
of authority is well put by Miller’: “It must be our aim, 
therefore, to bring up children so that they respect all 
racial experience, and at the same time learn, in due 
course, to challenge all authority. Authority must not 
be regarded as ultimately binding, nor must it be dis- 
regarded without respectful consideration.” 
Now, on the other hand if reality is overwhelming, 
the short cut is by the pathway of phantasy, day-dream- 
ing, creating an imaginary world in which wishes come 
true to replace the real world in which they do not. 
If on the other hand authority is too weak, if the 
parent, the representation of the racial traditions and of a

conformity, is too weak then the instinctive forces of the 
child are not sufficiently restrained; they run wild and 
lead to serious results. More of this later. If reality is 
made too easy, by inherited wealth for example, or by 
wealthy and indulgent parents, the same results may 
follow. The instinctive tendencies are not brought 
gradually under control and direction in the course of 
growth and development. Strength of character, just 
like muscular strength, is developed by overcoming 
difficulties, not by following the path of least resistance. 
All of these considerations spell certain conclusions as 
to what should be the relation of the parent to the child. 
The parent, as the responsible trustee of the child’s 
possibilities, needs to set the stage, so far as in him the 
power lies, in such a way as will insure the maximum 
opportunities for the unfoldment of the child’s personality 
along the necessary lines of social conformity. Two 
things are necessary. The first, and least important, is 
the ordering of the environment in such manner as will 
insure a reasonable amount of success to the child’s 
efforts and thus provide stimuli for further endeavor. 
Nothing discourages more or is better calculated to 
destroy all initiative than an impossible task. Secondly, 
the parent needs to be a good example, a good model for 
the child to copy and try to emulate. This is, of course, 
especially true of the parent of the same sex as the child. 
The relation of the parent to the child is such that quite 
instinctively the child desires to be like the parent. The 
parent is the first model and it is very important that it 
should not fail. When neither parent is a worthy model 
and the two parents are at war with one another the 
child has nothing to hitch to and often becomes hopelessly 
confused, helpless, and impotent when he undertakes life 
as an adult. He has never had any training in one 
direction. He has lacked a model and cannot develop 
one on the instant. , —

Nervous AND MENTAL HYGIENE 
In this matter of the influence of the parent upon the 
child, what the parents ave is much more significant for 
the child than what they do. The child reads truly the 
deeper meanings that lie behind ‘their conduct and the 
effect of their treatment upon him depends more upon 
their real feeling for him than upon what particularly 
they may do.. If, for example, the parent is unable to 
see with the eyes of his child and is really patronizing 
and lacking in respect for his efforts, then no matter what 
words he may utter, his underlying attitude will get 
through and the effort will be to make for a feeling of 
inferiority in the child and for a lack of affection for the 
parent, which will remove him from the position of a 
desirable model. 
So much for the present—for the child’s environment, 
personal, parental and material. The persons and objects 
of the environment either hinder or facilitate the child 
on his developmental pathway. What are the forces 
within him that drive him forward? These are the 
instinctive drives of self-preservation and race-preser- 
vation. They are fundamental, primitive, asocial and 
amoral, and it is only as a result of the refining forces 
of education that they can function in a socially accept- 
able way. The crude instincts are never permitted open 
expression after the early period of infancy. They must 
find progressively more and more refined ways of ex- 
pression as the child becomes older and begins to take a 
place in the social group. 
The crude, undirected instincts come out in open 
expression in infancy and if they are not adequately 
directed by education, example, and precept they may 
continue to do so. If they are too severely repressed 
by a system of bringing up that stresses the repressive 
feature by a continuous and uncompromising system 
of “don’ts” they may be snowed under, so to speak, 
only to short circuit in undesirable ways. The concept

of unfolding of the personality in the pathway of control 
and direction is an essential concept to guide all edu- 
cational procedures. 
The tendency of parents and teachers is to attempt 
to mold the personality of the child in the form that 
they think is the right one. This tendency is almost 
sure to be a wrong one because the personality make-up, 
that is, the components that go into the making of a 
personality and their relation, is altogether a too complex 
affair to warrant anyone in attempting the application 
of any hard and fast rules. The impetus and initiative 
must come from within the child and it should be the 
function of parent and teacher alike to attempt to find 
out what it is that is seeking expression and help the 
child in the unfolding and development of these ten- 
dencies. Ernest Jones' has well compared this situation 
to the similar situation in the case of the poet. The 
inspiration of the true artist must come from within 
and any suggestions from outside are of no avail unless, 
perchance, they happen to coincide with what he feels as 
a spontaneous impulse of his own. 
“~~ The various forms of nervousness and mental illness 
have as one of their most important components the 
failure, on the part of the individual, to develop in that 
orderly manner which presupposes the gaining of con- 
trol of the instincts and their practical guidance in forms 
of activity that are both personally acceptable and 
socially useful and at the same time offer adequate 
forms of expression. 
This process, or what is generally termed sublimation, 
begins very early in life, and failures that become mani- 
fest in adulthood are dependent upon disturbances in 
the orderly sequence of events during childhood; so that 
the period of childhood is of ‘the first importance for 
mental hygiene, that is, for all those efforts that are 
calculated to prevent the subsequent development of   
iPapers on Psycho-Analysis, Chapter xxxvi. The Child’s Unconscious.

nervous and mental illnesses. Education does not con- 
cern childhood alone, nor even the school and college 
period; but is a process that goes on throughout life, for 
when it stops we but mark time until the end. There- 
fore, the earlier that wholesome efforts at helpfulness 
and guidance can be initiated the better, and the longer 
wrong ways of thinking and feeling hold sway the more 
serious the results and the greater the difficulty of un- 
doing what has been done before new ways can be 
initiated. 
If the unfolding of the individual does not go on 
smoothly; if, because of native equipment or of uneven 
emphasis during the early years an unbalanced type of 
personality comes to adulthood, there are many, in 
fact innumerable signs that make it manifest and indi- 
cate the nature of the difficulties from which the indi- 
vidual is suffering and which must be overcome in order 
to make a reasonably adequate adjustment and success 
of his life. These disturbances may occur in either of 
two directions, corresponding to the two great funda- 
mental instincts, namely the self-preservative or ego- 
instinct, and the race-preservative, or sex instinct. In 
other words, the disturbance may manifest itself in the 
love life or in the nature of and working out of the ego- 
ideal. In many instances the disturbance is widespread 
enough to involve both realms. 
Every exaggerated character trait is evidence of an 
unbalanced personality make-up and is evidence also of 
the existence of the opposite trait. Between these two 
extremes the individual is forced to vibrate without ever 
the possibility of coming to rest. For example: the vain, 
proud, strutting personality is obviously out of balance 
and, too, he is distraught because he must everlastingly 
vibrate between this feeling of vanity and a realization 
of its emptiness and his real lack of qualities that justify 
it. He is never able to gain a true estimate of his worth

Inferiority

and regulate his life in accordance with his real assets 
and liabilities, but must always proceed upon a false 
evaluation and so he frequently fails. 
The feeling of inferiority is perhaps the best illustra- 
tion of an unbalanced personality for our purposes. This 
feeling of inferiority may have many roots. The child 
who is persistently undervalued, whose opinions, re- 
marks, and queries are always laughed at, whose efforts 
are invariably criticized for their shortcomings rather 
than praised for what they accomplish—all these serve 
to rob the child of any basis for self-confidence, of any 
feeling of self-respect. They deprive him of the sense 
of the joy of accomplishment and of success, and they 
imprison him behind a wall of relatives who repel his 
love. All of these results become exaggerated in the 
case of the “unwanted child,’ the fundamental an- 
tagonisms of its environment are so deeply grounded. 
A sense of inferiority may be fed also by the circum- 
stances that result from physical deformity or lack of 
comeliness. The cripples and the “ugly ducklings” 
have a hard road to travel. The other children are 
cruel and teasing and in every direction they are forced 
to a recognition of their inadequacy to meet the more 
favored individuals on common ground. 
The number and character of neurotic symptoms and 
traits of character is legion, but perhaps none is more 
common than the feeling of inferiority. Almost every 
neurotic has, this feeling, a deep sense of inadequacy, 
which is developed beyond the warrant of the facts and 
leads to a self-depreciation which is in reality an under- 
valuation which may be sufficient to paralyze all effort; 
and in any case it is the basis of much unhappiness and 
dissatisfaction and too, much failure, because the indi- 
vidual is conquered by the difficulties of a task often be- 
fore he undertakes it. 
This feeling of inferiority is a part of that depen- 
202 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  NERVOUS AND MENTAL HYGIENE 
dence upon the parents which is the lot of all children at 
first but which should gradually grow less and less as 
age and strength and knowledge prepare the child for 
independence. 
These feelings of inferiority and dependence are 
fostered and fixed by faulty attitudes of the parents and 
other adult members of the household and by wrong 
traditions in the family, which not infrequently have 
been handed down from the previous generation so that 
the parents repeat the mistakes of the grandparents. 
Just as the feeling of inferiority is fed by failing to 
realize the necessity of providing opportunities for suc- 
cess and by treating the child’s efforts with that lack 
of respect and consideration which implies that they are 
considered of no moment, so the state of dependency is 
prolonged beyond the safety point by over-anxious 
parents who will not let their child take any risks what- 
ever, unmindful of the fact that life itself is a great 
adventure, in its very nature full of risks, and that 
strength of character can never be developed by removing 
difficulties but only by overcoming them. 
To guide the infant and child through the formative 
period of life is a most delicate task. The idea that 
anyone is equipped to do it by instinct just because she 
happens to be of the female sex is absurd. This period 
of life is charged with the greatest possibilities and 
fraught with the most imminent dangers; and the most 
consummate skill is needed to develop the former best 
and to avoid the latter successfully. 
There is probably good warrant for the belief that 
civilization would be impossible without altruism, and 
that the maternal instinct is the basis of altruism. But 
it must not be forgotten that altruism and the maternal 
instinct did not come into the world ready-made and in 
full flower, but that they have had a long and painful 
history. In their beginnings they were but feeble

sparks and there still seems to be danger that they may 
be snuffed out. If one doubts this he needs only to read 
the history of infanticide to have all his doubts van- 
quished. For example, Frazer says of the Polynesians! 
that they ‘‘seem regularly to have killed two-thirds of 
their children. In some parts of East Africa the pro- 
portion of infants massacred at birth is said to be the 
same. Only children born in certain presentations are 
allowed to live. The Jagas, a conquering tribe in Angola, 
are reported to have put to death all their children, with- 
out exception, in order that the women might not be 
encumbered with babies on the march.... Among 
the Mbaya Indians of South America, the women used 
to murder all their children except the last,. . . .” China 
has been the country where infanticide has proverbially 
been practiced on a large scale. Numerous edicts have 
been published against it from the seventeenth century 
on until the reign of Koang Siu which began in 1875, 
and during which there were many proclamations and 
warnings to the people to take their children to the 
orphan asylums rather than throw them in the river.” 
An instinct that is as liable to go so far astray as this 
is surely not to be blindly trusted. 
The nicety of adjustment that has to be effected 
cannot be left to instinct but must be guided by intelli- 
gence. If the child’s life is made too easy it will not 
develop sufficient robustness with which to meet life 
adequately when it grows up: if its life is made too hard 
it will lack the stimulus of success and fail to develop 
initiative and a sufficient optimism and self-confidence. 
If either too much or too little emphasis is placed on any 
tendency there is the danger of an unbalanced personality. 
If the parents lack desirable traits or possess undesirable 
ones they are to that extent bad models for the child. 
Besides all these, social conditions altogether outside the

family may be controlling as regards certain factors, such 
as the prevalent scale of. wages, the ability to get food in 
sufficient quantity, local conditions of sanitation, etc. 
The most important single factor for the child is the 
quality of the love of his parents. Parents need to have 
that rare quality of love which is single-minded in its 
desire for the welfare of the beloved. If it has a selfish 
component such as a sense of ownership, or the desire to 
have the child take up a certain career as a matter of 
parental pride, or later to make a certain type of match 
that will further the social ambitions of the parent, then 
the love has certain qualifying characteristics which may 
make for an unbalanced type of personality on the part 
of the child. Without going to further length in the 
setting forth of principles I will present briefly a few 
examples of distortions and corrections to give some idea 
of how personality distortions actually occur. Take, 
for example, a girl cited by Miss Jessie Taft? whose 
physical ugliness was the basis of a crippling sense of 
inferiority. The case runs as follows, in her words: 
“T have in mind a girl whose physical make-up was 
fairly adequate but as a very little child she was clumsy, 
pigeon-toed, and inclined to be afraid to use her body. 
Her parents laughed at her attempts to walk and run 
and her frequent falls. This exaggerated her timidity 
and encouraged her not to try any unusual physical 
feats. There was no gymnasium work in the schools 
she attended. She grew very rapidly and at twelve was 
far too large and heavy for her age. Children called her 
“Fatty.” ee mother said that great big girls should not 
run about ‘like tomboys, but sit still and be ladylike. 
Her consciousness of her physical ineptitude increased 
' to a painful extent. She took part in no sports or games 
that would betray her weakness. She was in deadly fear 
of walks, because there might be fences to climb. She

dreaded the simple feat of climbing in and out of wagons. 
This lack of confidence extended to every part of her life. 
She was sure no man could ever care about her. She 
compensated in an over-development of intellectual 
interests but even here she had not the confidence that 
her ability warranted. Middle age finds this girl just 
beginning, through analysis of her own behavior, to get a 
legitimate self-confidence, intellectually and socially, as 
well as the free use of her body.” Such a case needs 
little comment. To her natural handicaps the parents 
added ridicule which prevented her from making those 
efforts which might have, in part at least, overcome them. 
The radiation of her lack of confidence in her bodily 
adjustments to her intellectual sphere is very illuminating 
as is also the effort at compensating for a physical defect 
by mental development. The case also shows the 
characteristic neurotic under-valuation. She really pos- 
sessed much greater ability than she felt she did. 
Another case showing how a sense of inferiority may 
produce serious symptoms is that of an intelligent boy of 
thirteen, who having lost his parents, was living with his 
sister and her husband. In this home he not only missed 
the affection of his parents, but he was scolded and 
punished by his brother-in-law for doing things, or not 
doing them, quite natural to a boy of hisage. By nature 
he was not aggressive, was easily discouraged and rather 
shy and reserved. With this make-up and his particular 
home situation to deal with, his reactions threatened to 
become abnormal. He began to steal, for two reasons: 
in order to obtain money with which to buy candy, etc., 
and also to cover up a growing feeling of inferiority. He 
thought it smart to be able to steal. By far the worst 
effect was on his disposition. He became sullen and 
insolent, resented any criticism, and cried very easily. 
Placed in a different environment, this boy responded 
quickly to encouragement and praise, though he was also 
206 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  NERVOUS AND MENTAL HYGIENE 
taught to receive adverse criticism. He lost all his 
sullenness, became contented, a willing worker, and eager 
to please. This case shows how an anti-social act like 
stealing may be resorted to to overcome a sense of in- 
feriority. It also illustrates the possibilities for curative 
treatment which possibilities are relatively very great in 
the early years. 
Physical handicaps and a resulting sense of inferiority 
may be compensated for by an over-development of the 
tendency to day-dream, to phantasy as is shown by a 
boy eleven years of age, born with physical disabilities 
and having had several severe illnesses during his life. 
He had no roof to his mouth, had a cleft palate and 
marked speech defect. ‘To compensate for these draw- 
backs he turned his energies inward, until he became 
highly imaginative even to the point of having hallucina- 
tions. He imagined himself doing things which he wanted 
to, but could not. He also developed other traits. He 
became cunning and crafty, dishonest, and untruthful. 
Here we see the child dreaming of the things he wants 
to such an extent that he is beginning to lose touch 
with reality and is no longer able to tell the difference 
between the real world and his phantasies (hallucinations). 
This method of compensating for misfortune is very 
common and in fact is perpetuated in many of the well- 
known fairy tales. Quite frequently the hero of the 
fairy story is the poor, often simple-minded, son of a 
woodman or the unhappy, disappointed younger sister 
(Cinderella). 
The following case is self explanatory. It illustrates 
how, what seems to be incorrigibility may sometimes 
yield to simple common sense efforts if real attention is 
paid to the child for the purpose of finding out the mean- 
ing of his conduct. This is the case of a boy nearly 
fifteen years of age, but rating in the intelligence scale 
four years below that. It was thought, however, that 
207 Phantasy

bility

Early Ex- 
periences THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
his emotional difficulties did much to cause his retarda- 
tion. This boy had a flashily-dressed mother, who 
worked away from the home all day and took no interest 
in making a real home for her children, in consequence of 
which they had to be placed out. This boy was put in 
one home after another and he became difficult to control. 
He paid no attention to work or school. He was said 
to be untruthful and unreliable, dishonest, and an habitual 
runaway. He also assaulted a little girl. As to his 
emotional life, he was idealizing his mother, having been 
separated from her for some time, building phantasies of 
her. Once the reason for his running away was to seek 
relatives in the vain search for a home of his own. He 
had dreams of death. If he shut his eyes he hallucinated 
easily. When thirteen he joined a church, prayed night 
and morning and always after stealing—to ask for for- 
giveness. 
Finally, having been placed in an institution, where 
his conduct remained the same, it was decided to use, as a 
motive for good behavior, his greatest desire, to live at 
home with his mother (which could then be arranged). 
A marked improvement began almost at once. He did 
better in all his studies, had no more bad dreams or 
hallucinations, was smiling, and said he felt much 
happier. 
The following case shows well how an experience in 
early life may condition late conduct in a thoroughly 
incomprehensible way unless the early experience can 
be disclosed in explanation. 
A boy thirteen years of age, measuring eighteen years 
in the intelligence scale, was said to be giving trouble by 
stealing right and left, irrespective of any object’s value 
or use to himself. Many things he afterwards gave away. 
By analysis, an episode was unearthed which occurred 
when he was four years of age. At that time he knew a 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  NERVOUS AND MENTAL HYGIENE 
little girl, and the two became mutually curious on sex 
matters. In order to get excuses to see her he would 
take anything at hand in the house to show her. In 
later years, when his adolescent sex feelings were develop- 
ing, he found he could get a feeling of relief by simply 
stealing something. He had no interest in girls and in 
fact had a positive dislike for them. When he was gotten 
to see the connection between the episode when he was 
four years old and his present habit of stealing he entirely 
lost his desire to steal and did sono more. This boy had 
quite a talent for inventing things and later patented an 
invention for some automobile appliance from the 
royalties of which he supported his family. His interest 
in the opposite sex was awakened through a transference! 
to a young woman worker. 
The next case shows well how easy it may be to acquire 
a bad habit that would seriously handicap the whole of 
the later life, and, too, how easy it may be to prevent this 
untoward result by the use of common sense. 
A little girl four years of age, rather sensitive and 
impressionable, and of the type who early began to show 
talent in the artistic line.—For some time her mother 
had noticed that one of her boy playmates had the trick 
of obtaining what he wanted from his parents by scream- 
ing spells. As she had been expecting, her little daughter 
flew into the house one day screaming in much the same 
manner as the boy, and demanding some trivial thing. 
She was told to stop at once, that her mother knew exactly 
what she was up to. The child stopped instantly and 
looked at her mother in amazement. She was told that 
_if she tried to do it again her mother would punish her. 
Two days later she repeated her trick and she received the 
promised punishment, which put an end to the child’s 
experiment. By wrong treatment this might easily have 
developed into a bad habit formation.

Summary THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
The closing admonition of this chapter, and perhaps 
the most important thing that can be said to parents, is, 
that whenever there is a neurotic or delinquent child in a 
family the most likely place to find the explanation is in 
the parents. Parents should take to themselves this 
lesson and when their child shows signs of nervousness 
not look exclusively for the explanation in the child and 
try to correct it by changing the diet, the school, etc., etc., 
but look first to themselves. Examine honestly their 
attitude and feeling for the child and see if therein may 
not lie the cause. Quite usually the parents have not 
the slighest idea of what is really the matter but the 
psychiatric social worker and the psychiatrist have 
learned where to look for the trouble and now it is time 
that parents should realize, at least, that the trouble 
may be with them. 
And finally, that the child should not be considered 
solely as an adult in preparation, that his right to con- 
sideration are not based solely upon the fact that he is an 
adult in the making but that he has rights of his own as 
a child and the best way to insure that he will become a 
healthy adult is to respect those rights. 
The purpose of this chapter has been to set forth 
certain fundamentals which must be taken into con- 
sideration if the problem of the child in its various ramifi- 
cations is to be adequately dealt with, and like all such 
fundamentals the results will be measurable largely in 
terms of the degree in which they are made conscious and 
subjected to conscious critical intellectual control and 
direction. Briefly these fundamentals are as follows: 
I. The child is not just a small adult, but in his 
processes of thinking he is distinctly different from the 
adult, so that he is as little easy to understand by the 
adult as is the adult by the child. This necessitates that 
the child should be interpreted to the adult. Figuratively 
speaking, the child’s language has to be translated into 
210
-P-A-G-E-235
  a a i En i i a so 
NERVOUS AND MENTAL HYGIENE 
the language of the adult, before it can be understood. 
It is this basic fact that constitutes the most potent factor 
in the ignorance which has hitherto surrounded the 
subject of childhood. It is the factor to which the term 
ignorance is ordinarily applied when ignorance of children 
is referred to and is therefore basic in any intelligent 
program. 
II. The child stands at the parting of the ways 
between the past and the future. It comes into the 
world with certain tendencies represented in its hereditary 
make-up that are unmodifiable. It presents other 
factors during its early years that are dependent largely 
upon environmental influences and which are capable of 
large modification. All children are not alike. Each 
differs from the other in the nature of these inherited 
tendencies and the quality of these acquired tendencies. 
It is therefore obvious that the same rule will not neces- 
sarily apply to any two children. 
III. . The function of education in the broad sense of 
the influence of the environment, including the home, 
the school and social institutions, is to deal in the first 
place with the inherited group of assets and liabilities 
with which the child comes into the world and to so 
influence it as to bring about by an unfoldment the 
maximum development of the assets and to minimize, as 
far as possible, the handicaps and the liabilities. “This 
means more intelligent parenthood, more intelligent 
educational systems with greater stress upon the in- 
dividual problem and as free as possible access to all the 
possibilities of the social environment as opportunities. 
IV. ‘The various forms of nervous and mental illness 
displayed by children are an expression of a lack of 
balance in this complicated process of adjustment re- 
ferred to above. Here, as elsewhere, in the field of 
medicine, the best treatment is prevention, and pre- 
vention can only be exercised on the basis of a reasonable 
211

survey of the individual child and a reasonable capacity 
for favorably controlling the factors that influence him. 
If man is ever going to learn to manipulate his human 
environment with anything like the success with which 
he manipulates the rest of his environment, and it 
would seem that the destiny of civilization may easily 
be involved in this condition, then are the questions that 
center around the child, the incarnation of the future of 
the race, fundamental.

THE PREVALENCE AND TREATMENT OF SENSE DEFECTS 
HE human body has been aptly and properly 
described as a “‘living machine’’. Like the lifeless 
machines in our factories it is made up of a great 
many parts which work together for a common end. 
Like them it takes a constant supply of power or energy 
to keep it running—in the case of the lifeless machine, 
electrical or mechanical power—in the case of the body, 
the energy derived from food. Both kinds of machines 
are subject to the same broad and fundamental laws of 
chemistry and physics. If they are well built and care- 
fully operated and protected from injury they work 
smoothly and well; and when the human body works in 
this way we are accustomed to say that it is in good 
health. 
The human machine is of course far more complex in 
its construction than the roaring looms in a cotton mill 
or the delicate machines which take a bit of shapeless 
metal and turn it out in the form of a screw or a knife- 
blade or a gun barrel. At every-step we make, scores of 
muscles must contract and scores of nerves must send 
out their messages to keep the movements in perfect 
mutual harmony. Day and night, the heart and the 
blood vessels must drive the blood to all parts of the 
body and regulate exactly the amount delivered to each 
tissue. Hour by hour the breathing mechanism must 
operate; and behind all these obvious activities the 
marvellous chemical processes of digestion and assimila- 
tion keep up the supply of necessary energy and make 
good the constant wastage of living tissue which con- 
stitutes the very essence of the whole life process.

Our first impulse as we consider the workings of this 
living machine is to wonder at its complexity and effective- 
ness; and such a feeling of wonder is fully justified. The 
human body is indeed a marvelous mechanism, but it is 
by no means a perfect one. If it were, it would be a 
miracle and not a manifestation of the laws of nature. 
No man ever lived whose body was at all times and in all 
its organs in perfect health; and the majority of us fall 
very far short of that ideal of health expressed by William 
James when he said, ‘‘Simply to live, move and breathe, 
should be a delight.”’ 
When our young men were examined for military 
service in 1917 and 1918, there was brought home to us 
all a very forcible realization of our shortcomings as a 
nation from the standpoint of physical effectiveness. 
More than forty per cent of the drafted men, presumably 
at the age of maximum vigor, showed physical short- 
comings of a more or less considerable nature and above 
six per cent were so seriously defective as to be wholly 
incapable of military service. This was no peculiar or 
unique condition. Our Civil War examinations revealed 
the same general situation and so did the military records 
of all the countries which took part in the World War. 
It is merely an illustration of the fundamental truth that 
the human body is generally a somewhat imperfect 
machine and sometimes a highly defective one. 
Ill health is due to many and various causes—to 
inherited weaknesses, to bad hygienic habits which ~ 
overtax even the powers of a normal constitution, and to 
accidental violence or the attacks of microbic enemies. 
We are not concerned here with the results of accident or 
with acute attacks of germ disease. These conditions 
are serious enough in themselves and they often leave 
behind them as after effects more or less permanent 
physical impairments. Accidents and acute illness are, 
however, obvious conditions which force themselves

upon our notice. It is the physical handicaps of those 
who are “up and about” and apparently well, with which 
we must deal in the present discussion. It is such defects 
that are likely to be overlooked; and when unnoticed and 
uncorrected they lay upon the child of the present and 
the adult of the future a burden of lowered vitality and 
inefficiency which it would be difficult to overestimate. 
The regular and systematic examinations of school 
children by school physicians and school nurses, which 
have been made with increasing frequency and care since 
the plan was first introduced in the United States in 1894, 
have given us a clear idea of the prevalence of physical 
defects among children of school age and have shown us 
exactly what types of defects should be looked for by 
parents and teachers. There are differences between the 
results reported from various states and cities, as might 
be expected. Absolute perfection in any organ of the 
body, as has been pointed out, is rare; and the extent of 
deviation from the normal which shall be classed as a 
definite defect must depend to some extent upon the 
judgment of the physician. In some cities the school 
doctors set a high standard and class as defective a child 
who might in another school system be regarded as 
normal. By striking a mean between the high and the 
low figures recorded for a number of cities which have a 
good school medical organization, it is easy to obtain 
figures which give us a fair average for the actual incidence 
of more or less serious physical impairments. 
The commonest defects of school children are those 
which appear in the form of decayed teeth. If we set a 
really high standard, competent dentists tell us that 85 
per cent of American school children have dental defects; 
but even if we include, as most school physicians do, 
only the most serious dental defects we shall still find 20 
to 40 per cent of our children with teeth in urgent need 
of dental care. Defects of vision come next, affecting 
215
-P-A-G-E-242
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
from 15 to 30 per cent of all school children to a serious 
degree. Abnormal tonsils and adenoids will appear in 
10 to 20 per cent of any average group of school children. 
Malnutrition is much harder to define than the local 
defects mentioned above, and here, there is a particularly 
wide difference between the results reported from various 
cities. The figures for the proportion of undernourished 
children vary from 2 to 20 per cent according to the 
standards set. Defective hearing is found in 1 to 2 per 
cent of our school children; grave orthopedic defects in 
more than 1 per cent, and heart disease in a slightly 
smaller proportion. These are the principal problems 
which we must consider in seeking to remove the handi- 
caps of physical insufficiency from the growing genera- 
tion." 
Remediable Before proceeding to consider these various types of 
MPocical physical defect in greater detail, it is important to em- 
Defects phasize the fact that our purpose in calling them to the 
attention of the parents of the nation is a very practical 
and constructive one. By taking thought, a man cannot 
add a cubit to his stature; but he can add pounds to his 
child’s weight, and he can secure the removal of the 
greater part of the burden imposed by uncorrected 
physical defects. In nearly all the sorts of handicap 
which have been catalogued, prompt medical care and 
the observance of the rules of personal hygiene will 
restore an affected organ to normal condition or so supple- 
ment it that further damage is prevented and comfort 
and efficiency secured. Physical defects are indeed 
common; but they are also correctible. 
In the city of Providence, for example, where the 
medical examination of school children is carried out 
under one of the most efficient health officials this country 
has produced, Dr. Charles V. Chapin, it was possible to 
obtain the following results during the school year 1921- 
  1The figures given are much lower than the estimates of Cornell and other authorities; 
but the author has preferred to err on the side of conservatism. 
216

1922: Of cases of carious and decayed teeth found by the 
school inspectors, 88 per cent were adequately treated; 
of cases of defective vision, 80 per cent were corrected 
by the prescription of proper glasses; of cases of enlarged 
adenoids and tonsils, 56 per cent were relieved by surgical 
treatment; of cases of malnutrition, 80 per cent were 
remedied by proper diet and hygienic care. 
An excellent illustration of what may be accomplished 
by a systematic attempt to relieve the physical defects 
of school children is furnished by the records of the 
Department of Schools of the city of Boston. Statistics 
for examination of eyes and ears go back to 1907 and 
show that in that year 31.5 per cent of the children had 
defects of vision, and 8.1 per cent defects of hearing. 
By 1916 these figures had been reduced to 12.9 per cent and 
2.8 per cent, respectively; and the continued progress 
made in reducing these and other abnormalities during 
the following five years is indicated in tabular form below:

The striking results which can be attained by the 
correction of the physical defects of school children is 
nowhere better illustrated than in relation to the problem 
of defective eyesight. 
The eye is one of the most complex and beautiful 
mechanisms in the human body. Its main essential 
217 Defects of 
Vision
-P-A-G-E-244
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
parts are three—the lens in front which forms upon the 
retina behind a picture of objects at which one looks; 
the retina itself, a sensitive surface in which the light 
rays set up chemical changes corresponding to the parts 
of the picture formed by the lens; and the nerve con- 
nections which in a still mysterious way transmute 
these chemical changes into sensations of vision. In 
addition to these fundamentals, however, there are most 
complex arrangements for regulating the amount of 
light admitted to the eye by enlarging and contracting 
the pupil and for changing the shape of the lens (which is 
not rigid like the glass lens in a camera) so as to focus on 
objects far off or near at hand. 
In only rare cases is this delicate machinery perfectly 
adjusted to the various uses to which the eyes are put in 
the course of civilized life—uses far more taxing than 
those to which the eyes of primitive man were ever sub- 
jected. If the lens is curved too little or is too close to 
the retina there is difficulty in seeing objects near at hand. 
If the lens is curved too much or is too far from the retina 
we get the opposite condition—near-sightedness. If the 
lens or the transparent cornea in front of it is irregular 
in shape the light rays will be bent so that they will not 
come to a clear focus thus producing the defect known as 
astigmatism. 
Physical and Defects of vision are insignificant among very young 
eee children; but they increase steadily during the period of 
de school life under the strain of the demands which our 
educational system must necessarily make upon eyesight. 
The results of such defects upon the health, happiness, and 
school standing of a child are serious and far-reaching. 
.Aching and smarting in the eyes themselves, headache, 
abnormal fatigue, train sickness, and other types of

flamed and laden with crusts. The stooping and strained 
position adopted by the sufferer in the effort to see clearly | 
produces definite abnormalities of posture in many cases. 
Stress produced upon the nervous system leads to ner- 
vousness and irritability and in some cases to definite and 
severe affections of the central nervous system. 
The influence of defective vision upon success in 
school and in the general social life of the child is 
sufficiently obvious. Medical inspectors and teachers 
are very familiar with cases in which the correction of 
visual defects has resulted in a complete revolution in 
the relation of a child to its work and its play; and the 
pathetic thing is that the child with poor eyesight has 
frequently no conception of its deprivation, but struggles 
to see the blackboard or pores over the dancing pages of 
a book in the belief that the world has the same blurred 
appearance to all his fellows. The same sort of handicap 
prevents participation in many sports and games, and 
robs the child of the normal pleasures of country life, the 
recognition of birds and flowers, and their subtle and 
appealing differences. 
The detection of certain of the commoner defects of 
eyesight is exceedingly simple. Thus difficulty in distant 
vision may be tested by the standard letters in Figure 1 
opposite page 214 and lack of clear vision of near objects 
by noting the ease with which fine print can be read. 
Other defects of vision are more subtle; and every child 
who has habitually ‘‘sore eyes,” inflamed eyes or eyelids, 
who squints or blinks, whose eyes are painful in strong 
light, who suffers from headaches, who cannot read 
writing on the blackboard easily, who must hold a book 
less than one foot or more than fifteen inches from the 
face, or who must hold the head in an abnormal position 
when reading should be promptly examined by a com- 
petent oculist (not an optician). The prescription of 
properly adjusted eyeglasses is such a simple remedy

  Defects of

for the complex evils which flow from eyestrain that it 
is quite inexcusable not to apply it. 
Whether glasses are worn or not, it is important to 
observe certain simple rules of hygiene in regard to the 
“ use of the eyes—to avoid reading or sewing or other fine 
work with insufficient light or with glare directly in the 
eyes, with flickering or unsteady light (as in moving 
trains) or when one is in a reclining position. 
Defects of hearing are less common than defects of 
vision but are obviously of peculiar importance in relation 
to school work and demand immediate and serious con- 
sideration on account of the acute nature of the trouble 
which is frequently involved. 
The symptoms of abnormal conditions of the organs 
of hearing are, on the one hand, earache or discharges 
from the ear, and on the other hand, defective hearing. 
The simplest test for the latter condition is made by the 
watch test. The eyes should be closed and one ear 
stopped with a finger and under such conditions the tick 
of the average watch should be clearly audible at a 
distance of two feet. The existence of defective hearing 
is often suggested to teacher or parent by habitual 
inattention, an expressionless voice, or imperfect artic- 
ulation. | 
The cause of defective hearing may sometimes be an 
extremely simple one, such as the presence of hardened 
ear wax in the outer ear, which should be removed by 
a physician. The more serious types of defective hear- 
ing, with earaches and discharging ears, are generally due 
to conditions of inflammation in “‘the middle ear,” a 
chamber behind the ear drum which is connected to the 
back of the throat by a passage known as “the Eustachian 
tube.” Inflammation of the middle ear is usually due to 
infection with bacteria which have passed up through the 
Eustachian tube from the nose and throat and is therefore 
closely connected with respiratory diseases and with 
220
-P-A-G-E-247
  SENSE DEFECTS 
abnormal conditions of the tonsils and adenoids. Such 
infections are dangerous in the highest degree and may 
even prove fatal. Severe earache or any earache which 
persists for more than twelve hours should be referred to a 
physician for treatment. 
The problems of tonsil and adenoid development offer 
an excellent illustration of what has been said in an 
earlier section in regard to the imperfections of the living 
machine. The tonsils are roundish organs which lie on 
each side of the throat in the general position indicated 
in Figure 2 opposite page 214. The adenoids (shown in 
the same figure) are finger-like, spongy growths which 
develop in the back of the throat where the passages 
from the nose open into it. There must probably have 
been some reason why these organs were developed in 
the course of evolution but they are evidently not of 
essential importance now, since their removal is often 
so highly beneficial; and they are peculiarly lable to 
abnormal development and to disease. When the ade- 
noids become too large they obstruct the passage of air 
from the nose to the throat and children thus affected 
become “mouth breathers” and are apt to develop a 
narrow jaw and a peculiar strained expression. ‘They 
sleep badly, frequently wake up crying, and are likely 
to be irritable and cross and backward in their studies. 
Adenoid growths greatly increase susceptibility to colds 
and infections of the middle ear. 
Normal tonsils are not visible at all as projections at 
the side of the throat when one looks into the mouth, 
but in many children they have become so swollen as to 
be obvious even to the layman as swollen obstructions 
extending far out behind the back of the tongue. The 
character of the tissue of the tonsils is quite as important 
as their size. A small tonsil with irregular or “ragged” 
surface, providing a favorable breeding ground for 
bacteria, may be more dangerous than a larger one. The 
221

  _ THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
particular reason why enlarged or unhealthy tonsils are 
so dangerous is that they furnish a gateway for the entry 
of disease bacteria. A marked susceptibility to local 
infection (tonsillitis) is the direct result, and repeated 
attacks of tonsillitis offer a reasonably certain indication 
that the tonsils require medical care. Unfortunately, 
however, the danger does not stop with the tonsils them- 
selves. The germs which enter at this point may find 
their way to other organs of the body. Gland infections 
and ear infections are commonly associated with tonsillar 
disease; and heart disease in children is very frequently, 
perhaps most frequently, due to this cause. There are 
few more serious menaces to the general health of a child 
than seriously diseased tonsils. 
The remedy for enlarged or diseased tonsils and 
adenoids is a simple surgical operation; and when a 
condition of this sort is suspected on account of any of 
the symptoms described above, the opinion of a competent 
specialist on nose and throat diseases should be obtained 
as to whether such an operation is or is not desirable. In 
young children it is often best to wait and see if adenoid 
growths will not disappear of their own accord. The 
judgment of the physician must decide in any given case. 
Of all the organs of the body, none are perhaps more 
liable to disease than the teeth. If bitter experience had 
not taught us otherwise, we should probably have sup- 
posed these hard, shining, ivory-like structures to be 
among the most resistant portions of our anatomy; yet 
they yield with peculiar readiness to the decaying influence 
of microbic life. When a cavity is formed in the enamel, 
or hard protective outer coating of the teeth, the softer 
dentine underneath is rapidly attacked and ultimately 
an abscess may be formed at the root. The final result 
of such a decay (known as “dental caries’) may be 
exceedingly serious since the bacteria from a tooth abscess 
are likely to pass on to the general circulation and cause 
222
-P-A-G-E-249
    
SENSE DEFECTS 
rheumatism, heart disease, and other grave conditions. 
Abscesses of this kind are not always painful and may 
exist and work marked damage to the general health 
without a suspicion on the part of the victim as to the 
real cause of the trouble. Similar effects may be produced 
by inflammation of the membrane which surrounds the 
roots of the teeth beneath the gums (pyorrhea). 
Nutrition experts and dentists are agreed that the 
prevalence of dental decay is very largely due to faulty 
diet. Among certain peoples who live under primitive 
agricultural conditions dental decay is practically un- 
known in spite of the fact that toothbrushes and dentists 
are also absent; while it is said that the teeth of such 
peoples rapidly break down under the artificial condi- 
tions of American city life. Attention to the principles 
of nutrition, to be discussed in a later paragraph, will, 
therefore, go far to reduce the danger of dental decay. 
The next step in the care of the teeth is of course the 
maintenance of the greatest possible cleanliness in the 
mouth by the use of the tooth brush, at least twice daily, 
supplemented by dental floss when necessary. The brush 
should be used with a rotary or an up-and-down motion, 
and not horizontally, so as to detach food particles from 
the spaces between the teeth where decay generally starts. 
Most important of all, however, is the systematic 
examination of the teeth by a competent dentist, and 
their thorough cleansing by the dentist himself or by his 
assistant, the dental hygienist. In no field of hygiene is 
the superiority of prevention to cure more manifest than 
in the care of the teeth. Every child should have his 
teeth thus examined and cleansed every six months. 
If this be systematically done, cavities can be filled 
on their first appearance, there will be no pain, and 
no danger of serious decay; and the total expense will 
be only a fraction of what it is sure to be if the teeth 
are neglected until toothache indicates that the de-

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
struction of dentine has gone so far as to reach a nerve. 
The first set of temporary teeth should be safeguarded 
with the same care as the permanent teeth. Above all, 
the first permanent molar, which appears at the age of 
six years, is of very special importance since its size, 
position and early appearance help to guide the other 
permanent teeth into proper position. 
This question of the general development of the teeth 
as a whole suggests the fact that regular dental examina- 
tions are of great value for other purposes than the treat- 
ment of dental decay and pyorrhea. For various reasons, 
the teeth often develop so that they are crowded together 
in an irregular manner which interferes with their efficient 
action in chewing and makes it hard to keep the spaces 
between them clean and free from decay. Sometimes 
(often as a result of adenoid growths) the palate becomes 
narrow and arched. These abnormal developments of 
the teeth and palate may often be corrected by special 
methods of dental treatment with marked improvement 
in appearance and benefit to health. 
Among the important points which we consider in 
estimating the physical condition of a child is posture, or 
the way in which the bony framework of the body is held 
in position. In standing, the head, body and legs should 
be poised one above the other so that a line dropped from 
the front of the ear falls within the forward half of the foot. 
The shoulder blades should be flat across the back and the 
feet should be directed straight forward. In sitting, the 
body should be bent only at knees and hips and the head, 
neck and trunk should be kept in one straight line. The 
healthy normal foot should have a well-marked arch 
under the instep and its toes should be freely developed, 
not cramped together, and free from corns. Examples 
of posture, Figure 3, opposite page 214. 
The commonest defects of posture are (a) stoop 
shoulders and flat chest, (b) lateral curvature of the spine 
224 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
    
SENSE DEFECTS 
(c) bowlegs and knock-knees (d) lameness and (e) flat 
foot (or broken arches). These conditions may often be 
present in only slight degree and may seem to be of 
little moment from the standpoint of general health. 
We must constantly remind ourselves of the complex 
inter-relationships which exist between the different parts 
of the living machine in order to realize how far-reaching 
the effects of faulty posture may prove to be. A flat 
chest limits the functioning of the lungs and favors the 
development of tuberculosis. Lateral curvature if un- 
checked may lead to grave deformity. The tilting of the 
foot in a slightly abnormal fashion may produce stresses 
on the nerves of the back of a most painful character 
and recurrent lumbago is often cured by the addition 
of a sixteenth of an inch to one side of the heel of a shoe. 
The causes of such defects as those cited are as a rule 
to be found either in defective nutrition, microbic in- 
fection, or bad postural habits. Bowlegs, and knock- 
knees, for example, are commonly symptoms of lack of 
certain elements in the diet of the infant. Most cases of 
hip disease, hunchback, and paralysis are due to bacterial 
invasion. On the other hand, round shoulders, and 
lateral curvatures are very largely the result of bad 
habits,—habits, however, which may have been fostered 
and developed by badly arranged seats and desks. The 
fact that poor vision frequently leads to a stoop-shouldered 
habit is an interesting example of the way in which one 
physical defect may be the cause of another. | 
It is of vital importance that the shoes of a child 
should be of a hygienic kind, everywhere as broad as the 
sole of the foot and wide enough in front to permit the 
toes to move freely. The inner edge of the shoe should be 
straight, so that a line drawn back from the middle of the 
great toe will touch the heel and the heel of the shoe itself 
should be low and broad. If a child is given proper shoes 
and a proper seat and desk he should not develop new

postural defects; and those which already exist can, in 
large measure, be corrected by the use of special exercises 
prescribed by a specialist in orthopedic surgery. 
In addition to the common defects of school children 
which have been discussed before, mention must be made 
of such prevalent conditions as swollen or sensitive glands 
in the neck, speech defects, various forms of nervous 
instability, and heart disease. Enlarged or swollen glands 
may be of no serious significance or they may indicate 
the development of tuberculosis. They should be prompt- 
ly referred to a physician for examination. Defects _ of 
speech are generally associated with deafness, adenoid 
growths, or mental conditions. Such defects are largely 
“Temediable, particularly in the case of stammering. — 
“Among the common signs of mental instability are 
restlessness, purposeless motions, difficulty in controlling 
the muscles, quick, involuntary, spasmodic movements, 
nervous exhaustion, and undue emotional excitability. 
Medical supervision and above all the enforcement of a 
correct hygienic régime as to diet, sleep, fresh air, and the 
evacuation of the bowels will often bring about a radical 
change in the psychology of the child. 
Finally, a special word should be said in regard to 
heart disease, fortunately rarer among children than 
most of the conditions heretofore mentioned but of 
unique importance on account of its grave significance 
in after life. Exactly the same general principle which has 
been emphasized in connection with other physical defects 
holds in regard to heart disease,—the principle embodied 
in our homely phrase, “‘a stitch in time saves nine.” 
Heart disease in children is generally the result either of 
a previous attack of acute communicable disease or of 
infection from decayed teeth or diseased tonsils. When 
the primary cause has been removed, the heart, like any 
other organ of the body, will to a large extent repair 
itself under hygienic treatment. Where such a condition 
226 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
a is found there is, therefore, no reason for undue apprehen- 
sion. Under the systematic supervision of a cardiac 
clinic, such as have been organized in most of our large 
cities, the child with incipient heart disease should show 
material improvement and frequently complete recovery. 
The problem of nutrition is, when all is said and done, 
the most fundamental of all problems in the upbringing 
of a child. The chief business of a child is to grow,—to 
grow in mind and in character, but above all to grow in 
strength of body, since intellect and behavior are both 
closely knit up with physical well-being. This subject 
must naturally therefore be discussed in other chapters 
of this book especially in Chapter IX; but some reference 
must be made to it in even the briefest survey of the 
physical defects of children. 
In the organized efforts made during the past five 
years for the improvement of child health, much stress 
has been laid upon malnutrition and particularly upon 
underweight as an index of undernourishment. Plans 
have been worked out in many schools for the systematic 
weighing and measuring of children and the comparison 
of the results with a standard scale indicating the normal 
weight for a child of a given age and height. This move- 
ment has been a most useful one in bringing home to the 
individual child and the individual parent the importance 
of good hygienic habits. It has been made clear, however, 
in recent years that underweight is only a very rough test 
of undernourishment. Different races have quite different 
normal weights for the same age and height; and the 
rate of growth is different at different seasons of the year. 
A substantial proportion. of children who are considerably 
underweight are really in a perfectly normal condition as 
regards nutrition; while on the other hand children who 
are really undernourished may have a normal weight 
for. height and age. ‘The physician’s examination must

Require- 
ments for 
Proper 
Nutrition 
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
Of the frequency and the seriousness of real mal- 
nutrition there can, however, be no doubt. Rickets, for 
example, which is a very common disease of young 
children is the direct result of the lack of certain specific 
elements in the diet. It is believed on good grounds that 
defective teeth are largely due to deficient diet. The 
part played by undernourishment in lowering resistance 
to tuberculosis is among the most familiar phenomena 
in medical science. Yet in spite of these facts, under- 
nourished children are by no means confined to famine- 
stricken Russia or the suffering nations of Central Europe. 
A recent study of the actual diets of several thousand 
children in Gary, Ind., a typical American industrial 
community, showed that only ten per cent of these chil- 
dren were receiving completely adequate nourishment. 
The diet of the child must not only supply the total 
energy for the life and growth of the body but also the 
particular kinds of substances necessary for the constant 
rebuilding of living tissue,—proteins, salts and vitamines. 
If a single one of these substances be insufficient in 
amount disaster will follow. The foods which are of 
particular importance in supplying the common deficien- 
cies of a child’s diet are fruits, leafy vegetables (such as 
lettuce, spinach, beet greens, and the like) and, above all, 
milk. A growing child should have a quart of milk a day. 
If a child is undernourished it is obviously either 
because the right kinds of food are not set before him or 
because he has formed bad habits of eating and refuses 
certain necessary foods. The first condition can be con- 
trolled by intelligent planning of the dietary with the 
advice of a physician, a public health nurse or expert in 
nutrition. In order to obtain a well-balanced diet at a 
minimum cost, it has been estimated that, of the total 
amount of money spent in a given week for food of all 
kinds, one quarter should be spent for milk, one quarter 
for vegetables and fruits, about fifteen per cent for bread, 
228 
 
-P-A-G-E-255

cereals and other grain products, about ten per cent for 
meat, fish and poultry, ten per cent for butter and other 
fats, five per cent for eggs and the remaining ten per cent 
for sugar, cheese, and other miscellaneous foodstuffs. 
If such a diet as this be set before a child and if the child 
be taught to drink milk and to eat green vegetables and 
fruits, there will be little chance of malnutrition. 
The responsibility of the school for the health of the 
child is a threefold one. In the first place it should provide 
as a regular part of the curriculum for systematic instruc- 
tion in the basic principles of physiology and hygiene so 
that the child may understand something of the wonders 
of the body-machine for which he is responsible, of the 
dangers which threaten him and of the ways in which he 
can be kept in a condition of maximum health and vigor. 
In the second place, the school should supply opportunities 
for the actual practice of health habits and particularly 
for supervised physical exercise and play. Finally, it 
should provide for the systematic medical examination 
of all school children so that diseases and physical defects 
of all kinds may be promptly detected and, so far as pos- 
sible, cured. 
The teacher, the school nurse and the school physician 
all play a part in the performance of this latter task. The 
teacher should be constantly on the lookout for the symp- 
toms of communicable disease (coughing, running nose, 
inflamed eyes, rashes, and the like) and for such signs of 
physical defect as have been discussed in the preceding 
pages. The school nurse should see daily all such children 
as may be referred to her by the teacher and should pass 
on to the physician those who are in need of his attention. 
In addition to such emergency examinations the school 
physician, with such aid as he may desire from school 
nurse and teacher, should make a complete and exhaustive 
examination of every child, at least three times during 
his school life for the detection of physical defects and

deficiencies. It is the duty of the school nurse to follow 
into the home each case needing attention, to give advice 
in regard to the hygiene of childhood, and to persuade 
the parents to have any physical defects which have been 
found promptly and completely remedied; and there 
should be school clinics maintained at public expense for 
the correction of such defects as will not otherwise re- 
ceive attention. It is the poorest sort of economy to 
spend money on the education of a child so handicapped 
by physical ill health that he cannot profit by the oppor- 
tunities which are placed before him. 
Finally, what is the message of medical science to the 
parent, in regard to the responsibility which rests upon 
him for the physical well-being of his child? It can be 
summarized in a very few words. 
The human body is a marvellous machine but by no 
means a perfect one. It is subject to manifold diseases 
and defects and many children are seriously handicapped 
and endangered by such diseases and defects,—often 
without the knowledge of themselves or their parents that 
anything is wrong. If the conditions in question are 
promptly discovered they can generally be remedied by 
appropriate medical treatment or change in hygienic 
habits, or both, often with astonishing improvement in the 
health, happiness and mental and moral progress of the 
child. 
If you who are reading these lines live in a city where 
there is a good system of school health sypervision, it 
will only be necessary for you to follow the counsel of the 
school doctor and the school nurse in order to insure the 
best results which medical knowledge can produce. If 
there is no such system in your schools, or if your child 
is below school age, the responsibility must rest with you; 
and it is important to remember that a large proportion 
of the serious physical and mental handicaps of child- 
hood have their origin in the pre-school period.

obviously that the layman can hear them; so the only

Your child should be examined by a physician, well or

message of modern medicine,—that the doctor should be 
used as an agent of prevention and not merely for the

THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF DELINQUENCY 
HE first nice discrimination to be made in the 
i nee of delinquency in childhood, if we are to 
act intelligently, is whether and how much the 
child is to be treated and whether and how much environ- 
mental conditions are to be treated. It is curious and 
interesting to observe how opinions range, in the family 
circle or in the juvenile court room, all the way from 
doing everything for the child to doing everything, by 
way of discipline, fo him. To strike the balance that 
fair-mindedness and effective action call for requires 
more earnest consideration than most people give the 
matter. 
How poorly founded are off-hand opinions about the 
treatment of delinquency is seen both in the fact of the 
wide divergence of views concerning it and in the poor 
results so frequently obtained. It seems to be much the 
same as the treatment of ill health before the days of 
modern medicine. 
The way to treat bad behavior in children say, in 
substance, some men and an occasional woman, is to knock 
it out of them. Even a clergyman argues, “The rod is 
good. I’m thankful to the old-fashioned school teacher 
who used it on me. Boys have too much deviltry in their 
make-up to be successfully treated in any other way.” 
Or perhaps some judge proclaims that the law of the adult 
courts calculated to make the individual feel the con- 
sequences of his acts is to a very considerable extent what 
is needed in the treatment of juveniles. These are typical 
utterances and attitudes. 
232 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
On the other hand, one hears from some mothers, 
fathers, yes and I have heard it, too, from employers who 
have lost considerable sums through some child’s stealing, 
that the circumstances were such, the temptations so 
great, or the suggestions of companions so strong that 
really the delinquent should be excused. Their idea is 
that, above all things, one must be charitable in the face 
of such a situation. “TI don’t think he will do it again,” 
or “You can’t expect young people to have much sense 
about such things” are what these people say. 
Now the answer to both is the fact of the large number 
of failures resulting from each method. Anybody who 
has had considerable experience knows of instances where 
children have been beaten and beaten for misbehavior, 
without any essential change in conduct; the main results 
often being development of sneakiness, of self-defense 
lying, a hardening of character, a hatred of those in 
authority. Autobiographies of some habitual criminals 
give much evidence of a bitter reaction to early punish- 
ment. And we definitely discover children who are not 
self-conscious or self-analytical enough to attribute the 
source of their tendencies to it, nevertheless developing 
their most undesirable traits simultaneously with severe 
punishment inflicted. 
But then, the predictions of success for the opposite 
let-alone form of treatment often do not come true. The 
child may persist in going out with bad companions or in 
pilfering at home. The employer perhaps finds to his 
chagrin that the excused young employee accepts new 
chances to take goods or money. Many such instances 
are to be found in our recorded cases. 
Of course, there is a measure of success in each method. 
The clergyman may have been right about his own case, 
and about success with some others. The forgiving 
employer is, on occasion, rewarded by seeing reformation 
follow his kindness. Undoubtedly there are good out-

comes subsequent to other off-hand kinds of treatment 
or non-treatment. No one can deny this any more than 
he can deny the fact that some patients get well of fevers 
in spite of anything that is done or not done. But we 
cannot logically attribute so much to either their moral 
or medical treatments as proponents of various set theories 
would have us attribute. 
A better statement of fact would be that some young 
people have it in them to recover moral health rapidly. 
Perhaps there is less inner urge toward delinquency, per- 
haps there is better characterial fibre than in some others, 
perhaps there is less stress from the outside. Anyhow, 
some children do right themselves quickly without being 
steered by others morally and proceed in conduct ways 
on a steady keel. If it were not so this would be a sorry 
world; many offenses are committed and not repeated, 
many of us have been secretly delinquent and have 
recovered. For the sake of all—and sometimes mothers 
and fathers have to be told this by way of encouragement 
—it is well to think of the power of recovery in the moral 
world as one thinks of the healing power of nature in the 
world of physical health and disease. 
The foregoing is by way of introduction. After all, 
the aim in this chapter is to consider ways of effectually 
treating delinquency which is not so slight and self-curable 
that it needs no treatment. And of course these ways 
must be better directed than are the off-hand undertak- 
ings of those who have only one narrow point of view. 
We must turn to what there is of a science of treat- 
ment of delinquency and build from the materials we 
find there. 
We can carry the analogy of the development of 
medical science still further. The handling of cases of 
disease in earlier times was according to ill-founded theory, 
or by following tradition or old wives’ sayings. And then 
there came the new era of studying the causes of disease, 
234
-P-A-G-E-261
  PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
and following soon upon the heels of this came new meth- 
ods of therapy which our generation has seen one by one 
develop to conquer age-old ills. With regard to delin- 
quency we are just now opening the era of the study of 
causation, with already most encouraging results from 
therapeutic endeavors based on better knowledge of the 
particular and immediate origin of the tendency to 
misbehavior. 
And exactly as modern medicine has shown from a 
scientific basis that in many instances of ill-health both 
the individual and the environment have to be treated in 
order to restore good physical condition, so even more 
frequently one finds that these two phases of the situation 
have to be met in handling a case of delinquency upon 
the basis of what is fundamentally wrong. But the 
analogy stops here with generalities. One has rarely in 
medical practice, for instance, to deal with other persons 
as causes of a continuing trouble. But in studying delin- 
quents we frequently find that the attitudes of others than 
the delinquent himself make strongly for or against his 
delinquency; other people form a part of his world that 
requires treatment. 
So we have (a) the child himself, sometimes in body 
but always on the mental side, if we count the character 
aspects of his mental life; (b) the physical features of his 
environment, as when he lives under or frequents con- 
ditions that are inimical to his moral health; (c) the people 
about him, the company he keeps, and unfortunately 
sometimes his own family. Any or all of these may be 
factors in the production of the delinquency; and we can 
deal wisely with any factor, even with the child himself, 
only after we have come to some well-founded conclusion 
regarding his part in the problem of misconduct. This 
makes necessary a careful inquiry into the whole situation 
if well-calculated curative work is to be done, and I would 
warn against starting this inquiry from preconceived 
235 Three Fac-

Personality THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
notions concerning the sources of trouble that may be 
unearthed. 
We may very naturally and very practically begin by 
considering the young delinquent himself. First, perhaps, 
is there anything peculiar about him from the physical 
standpoint that stands in the way of his doing better,— 
anything important to be noted about the physical founda- 
tions of his personality? Pertinent are the following as 
some of the main points for inquiry: 
Is the child weak physically or easily fatigued, so that 
the exigencies of life as met in school or at work, on the 
play-field or in home duties, bear too hard? (Of course 
mere smallness of size or of musculature means nothing; 
plenty of small people have really very superior physical 
qualities.) The point for us is whether there is any sort 
of bodily weakness that causes an “easier way” to be 
sought in sneakiness, unfairness, dishonesty, withdrawal 
from moral realities. Are the standards of accomplish- 
ment set so high anywhere for this given physical organism 
that the reaction against them is in the direction of 
getting desired ends by less arduous and by perhaps 
illegitimate means? 
Localized ailments and defects may also be thought 
of as possibly reacting upon the whole organism, body 
and mind, so that there results a condition favorable to 
the development of delinquency. Thus, pathological 
growth of adenoids and tonsils, chronic infection of ears 
or teeth, serious obstruction in the air passages, to name 
some of the commoner ailments of children, can very 
readily bring about states of general ill-health which form 
a poor background for the development of good character 
traits, or of even normal powers of resistance to external 
suggestions and temptations. 
Of course, none of these defective bodily states directly 
produce delinquency. Many, many children have these 
troubles and do not become delinquent. Perhaps the 
236 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
    
PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
growth of a tendency towards misconduct proceeds by a 
path as roundabout as that we have observed in a number 
of instances of delinquent children with heart disease 
where excuses have been made by nurses, parents, and the 
child himself for not conforming to school and other 
discipline. One school physician forbade a boy to come to 
school because he would have to climb a lot of stairs. But 
this very boy, through knocking about the streets in his 
authorized idleness, became the leading spirit in an active 
gang of young burglars; he himself, in spite of the school 
doctor, doing the climbing over the transoms and other 
places. 
It is very important to note the open avenues to 
delinquency for a child whose time is not well occupied 
in school or in other ways. We have known whole careers 
of misconduct to date from even temporary exclusion from 
school for sickness or for other reasons, provision for 
occupying the children’s time not being made by either 
school or family. Perhaps the best source of help in 
prevention of delinquency here will be developing the new 
profession of “school visitor.” 
There is another type of physical trouble which affords 
a foundation for the growth of misbehavior trends,— the 
sort of ailment which produces irritability in the child. 
Perhaps the trouble cannot be made clear by the child 
himself—we find many young people very vague about 
even such a matter as headaches; perhaps the irritability 
is not recognized as such; perhaps they are only partly 
conscious of the difficulty. Relief from the headaches and 
discomforts of eyestrain makes a great change in feelings, 
as also from chronic ear troubles or from variously local- 
ized abnormality of structure or function. 
However indirect defective physical conditions may be 
as causes of delinquency, when they are found in the 
person of the delinquent there should be no cavilling over 
the point that the child’s chance for overcoming his

undesirable tendencies is enhanced by his being in good 
physical condition. And it is in recognition of this, rather 
than through belief in the direct physical cause of delin- 
quency that has mainly led juvenile courts to be anxious 
about the health of the delinquents who come before them. 
The newspaper quip about Johnny’s coming before the 
judge for throwing stones at windows and being sentenced 
to have his tonsils removed alludes to that modern con- 
sideration for the offender himself which has its rationale 
in the effort to obtain a sound physical basis for refor- 
mation. 
Some day we may know much more than is at present 
known about the glands of internal secretion, the thyroid, 
pituitary, thymus, suprarenal, and other glands, which 
unquestionably condition many features of our physical, — 
intellectual, and emotional life. At present the best 
authorities insist that much of what is stated popularly 
concerning the relationship of the activity of these glands 
to conduct trends is either very weakly founded or has no 
basis at all in known fact. Commercial interest has led to 
exploitation of the subject. We shall have to wait for much 
more scientific research before we can be well on the way 
in this method of control of human behavior tendencies. 
Of all physical ailments, nervous troubles stand in the 
most direct relationship to delinquency when they involve 
instability of personality so that the individual is more 
liable to be beset by impulsions or obsessions and is more 
prone to be unduly suggestible. Notably, chorea is likely 
to leave in its train a tendency toward irregular behavior; 
so also some other organic diseases of the central nervous 
system. Sometimes an accident involving even slight 
concussion of the brain or where fright is one of the main 
effects may bring about abnormal lack of inhibitions, 
even in the sphere of social behavior. 
Lately we have been studying the case of a boy who, 
previously normal morally, began a downhill path of 
238
-P-A-G-E-265
    PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
misbehavior almost immediately following an accident 
with internal injuries and severe fright. He has become a 
truant because the confines and tasks of the school room 
are too irksome; he has given way to impulses toward 
mischief and rebellion; he has readily fallen in with sug- 
gestions toward delinquency. His father confesses he 
endeavors to correct the boy by the only treatment he 
knows anything about, the rod, and the school people 
have apparently made no careful study whatever of the 
situation. The treatment that is necessary in this case— 
quiet life, perhaps in the country, removal from compan- 
ions, a school régime with frequent change of occupation, 
recreations away from the excitement of city streets and 
night life—really belongs to the realm of mental hygiene. 
Indeed, the boy himself tells us soberly, ‘“There’s some- 
thing come over me. I’m different. I don’t want to get 
in wrong, but I can’t endure sitting there in the school 
room so long. I ought to go away somewhere where it’s 
quiet. I want to get my mind right again.” 
While this is an unusual case, the fact that boys and 
girls are able to size up the situation with regard to them- 
selves very well has been observed by us many times. 
The atmosphere of a sympathetic inquiry is very apt to 
permeate a young delinquent’s own mind and quicken his 
own powers of analysis, with the result that not a little 
light is thrown upon the possibilities of rational treatment. 
Indeed, the treatment itself often begins with such an 
inquiry. 
But in considering possible physical bases for miscon- 
duct we must not make the mistake of believing that they 
are all on the side of physical weakness. Superabundant 
energy, general physical over-development, premature 
general and sex development are all recognizable in some 
instances as very specific foundations for misbehavior.

stress and urge of the chemistry of the blood of youth, 
the invitations of the world extended to the prematurely 
ripened young person, so often grown in body before there 
is corresponding growth of will or of world experience,— 
all of these are very real phenomena to be intelligently 
recognized and appropriately met by curative adjustments. 
With all of these points in mind as explanatory, the 
guardian of a young person who shows tendencies to 
delinquency should never sink into easy satisfaction with 
mere explanation. That is an attitude only too prone to 
be taken by those who are attracted to somewhat fatalistic 
biological or social theories concerning the basis of 
delinquency. There is much to be done about the individ- 
ual case, not only from the standpoint of whatever 
physical treatment is possible and whatever social 
adjustment seems advisable, but also through aiding and 
insisting on self-discipline and self-mastery. The adviser 
will do well to aim at this by getting the child to see him- 
self in his relationships to the world, by straight-forward 
presentation of facts and socratic drawing forth of reason- 
able conclusions from him. That there is a physical 
handicap may well be a challenge to manly achievement. 
The respect and reward of the world for the handicapped 
winner, paid to a Steinmetz, victorious over a half-sized, 
mis-shapen body, is a point well worth thorough presenta- 
tion to all of that class of young delinquents we are now 
considering. That to run from a bad start and still win 
in the race of life is profitable and glorious, is an idea and 
argument which most will listen to. And, after all, the 
delinquent must be helped to see the pleasurable returns 
of self-discipline and right doing. 
Nor does the existence of any sort of physical basis for 
delinquency necessarily deny the wisdom and value of 
discipline from without. But such discipline must be in 
accord with the needs of the given child and adapted to 
his temperamental traits.
-P-A-G-E-267
  
PREVENTING DELINQUENCY ’ 
Coming now to the mind of the child, we may say at 
once that several aspects of mental life are vastly more 
important to be understood in relation to delinquency 
than are physical conditions. This is because conduct of 
all sorts and at all times is the direct expression of mental 
life. Our acts are immediately the results of mental 
activity. There is no one fact that I would counsel every 
one interested in delinquency to keep so well before him as 
this inescapable relationship between mental life and 
conduct. 
Are illustrations necessary? If a boy pilfers, he does 
so because he has in his mind the idea of taking things. If 
a girl not previously intending to steal suddenly ap- 
propriates something in a shop, she does so with such an 
idea in mind as, “It’s pretty, I’d like it.” Or, when 
mischief is afoot with a crowd, the idea of pleasurable 
excitement is there, the fun of the chase, or satisfying some 
grudge; or perhaps the thought of the stigma of being 
called ‘“‘yellow,” if suggestion of misdeeds comes from 
companions. The reader would do well to consider other 
situations involving delinquency within his experience 
and carefully study the factor that mental life, immediate 
or remote, is in the production of delinquency. It is all 
the more important to know well this fundamental fact 
for the explanation of conduct, because accurate knowl- 
edge of the specific part played by mental life in the given 
case offers by far the best chance for direct curative 
attack upon the cause of the trouble. 
Much has been made in recent years, as everybody 
knows, of the discovery by intelligence tests that among 
delinquents in juvenile courts or in correctional institu- 
tions there is a very much greater proportion of the feeble- 
minded than in the general population. But here again 
it is not the bare fact of feeble-mindedness which causes 
the delinquency—there are many mentally defective 
persons with good character traits. The army intelligence

tests showed clearly that plenty of people with intellectual 
capacity far enough below the average to be denominated 
mentally defective can be thoroughly good citizens. Case 
studies by any of us who have had large experience prove 
the same point. 
Even in the mentally defective it is some specific idea 
or picture in the mind that leads to the misconduct. We 
might instance, perhaps, the remembrance of pleasure to 
be derived from the possession of money or other things 
as inciting the feeble-minded boy or girl to steal. Without 
such thoughts developed there is no stealing. Or truancy, 
or running away from home, or indulgence in bad sex 
practices—typical delinquencies of the feeble-minded— 
what are these but response to some mental picture or 
idea of pleasurable returns? 
That the feeble-minded, especially the morons, those 
who belong to the highest group of defectives, are found 
with relative frequency among delinquents is simply due 
to their poor inhibitory powers, specifically, their lack of 
capacity for checking undesirable ideas, just such as spring 
up in the minds of many other children who do check 
them—this and their being prone to form simple habits 
easily, mental and physical, good or bad. With their less 
active ideational world it is no wonder that they easily 
accept into their mental life suggestions from without 
and fail to check undesirable inner mental associations 
by better thoughts. ‘When I go by the market, it always 
makes me think of taking stuff there and then I go and do 
it,” said one defective boy to me. 
The problem of the treatment of the mentally defective 
delinquents is often more simple than the treatment of the 
bright delinquent. The feeble-minded are satisfied with 
simpler pleasurable returns, with less complicated recrea- 
tions and occupations. There is no doubt that a large 
share of defectives who are regarded as delinquents could 
be placed safely in country homes or colonized, some of 
242
-P-A-G-E-269
PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
them first needing proper institutional training. The 
good results of work in this direction are nowadays being 
published. The more difficult can be made largely self- 
sustaining in institutions. And some of them are controll- 
able in their own families if the environment is suitable. 
But all such hopeful treatment must be undertaken before 
there is long-standing formation of the habit of delin- 
quency. Our experience in tracing the development of 
criminal careers leads us to give the deepest warning to 
parents and public authorities in this matter. Allowing 
the mentally defective child to crystallize his own charac- 
ter in a bad mold through habitual delinquent ideation 
and delinquent reaction to his environment represents 
social and moral neglect that often brings dire results to 
the individual and to society. No inconsiderable number 
of chronic thieves, vagrants, and even more desperate 
criminals were defective children whose amenability at 
an earlier age should have been utilized to their own and 
to society’s advantage. 
While discussing delinquent children who are not quite 
normal mentally, we must include an important group 
other than the defectives. Not that we would exaggerate 
the size of this second group; in numbers it is relatively 
small. Nor do we want, either, to over-emphasize the 
relationship of delinquency to mental abnormality as a 
whole—in studying misconduct problems in children one 
finds those who are normal outweighing heavily in number 
the abnormal. 
This second principal group consists of those who show 
evidences of poorly balanced mental processes. The 
trouble is not due to original mental defect, but to erratic 
mental functioning which may develop rapidly or be a 
matter of slow growth. To name the principal conditions 
which are to be noted, there is inability to control ideas, 
association processes, impulses; there is liability to form 
false judgments, to have false memories; there is the 
243 Erratic 
Mental 
Processes

quency
-P-A-G-E-270
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
tendency in all cases for the individual, on account of 
malfunctioning of his mental life, to be out of line with 
the world about him. 
We cannot say that all children are mentally diseased 
who show any such manifestations; as a matter of techni- 
cal classification, these erratic aspects of mental life 
range all the way from definite mental disease (psychosis) 
to aberration that is quite minor and temporary, such as 
may occur with chorea, head injuries, brain diseases, and 
disorders of some glands of internal secretion. During 
adolescence some children show exhibitions of peculiar 
mental behavior that is nothing short of aberrational 
although it may be merely a passing phase of their lives. 
And then there is a sub-group composed of individuals, 
who show just a moderate lack of good mental balance 
beginning in childhood and lasting perhaps all their lives, 
with particular difficulties arising during periods of 
physiological and other stress. These persons we cannot 
denominate psychopathic personalities simply because 
their mental processes show in miniature or on occasion 
some of the phenomena which are characteristic of mental 
disease. Such individuals are frequently very far from 
being defective; indeed they may be brilliant from a purely 
intellectual standpoint. Their trouble, as in all cases in 
this group, has to do with maintaining good mental 
balance; there is weakness in control or in coérdination 
of various departments of mental life. It is quite obvious 
that conduct difficulties may arise through the confusions 
and erroneous judgments and lack of control over im- 
pulses and ideas which characterize these faulty mental 
functionings. 
The treatment of delinquency in any members of this 
group should be based on competent diagnosis, determin- 
ing whether or not the child belongs properly in this 
category of those with poor mental balance, and second- 
arily, whether or not there is anything much that can 
244
-P-A-G-E-271
PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
be done in the way of medical therapy. In only a few 
such cases, we regret to acknowledge, will our present 
medical knowledge help us to effect a cure. But the 
healing power of nature itself will in some instances lead 
to self-therapy, as in cases of adolescent mental disturb- 
ance which we have witnessed recover without medical 
assistance. 
The classification of the somewhat erratic individuals 
into types of personalities, such as is the fashion to-day 
in many psychiatric clinics, without study of their back- 
ground in experiences, upbringing, and other features of 
environment, is a very inadequate procedure from the 
standpoint of treatment. The particular features of a 
given individual’s environment that lead him into 
misconduct is perhaps the main point to be known. If we 
study him with common-sense thoroughness we frequently 
find that certain members of the family, certain compan- 
ions or neighborhood allurements, certain school classes 
or special teachers, arouse a tendency to bad behavior 
which is not at all shown under other conditions. I 
could give hundreds of illustrations of this. For the 
treatment, if we decide, as in most cases we have to 
decide, that the individual’s own personality is not 
immediately alterable, we must try to place him under 
environmental conditions where his undesirable behavior 
trends will be least likely to be brought out. 
Here again I do not want to be misunderstood as 
believing that there is little value in discipline. On the 
contrary, I think discipline that is educative, that includes 
self-discipline, is of more value in most of these cases 
than anything else. With some psychopathic personali- 
ties the steady regime of a really good juvenile correctional 
institution over a prolonged period offers the best chance 
for beneficial treatment. 
In our work we have seen many children who in one set 
of circumstances, with nagging parents, with an excitable

portant

family, with a teasing or otherwise irritating relative, 
or living under poor conditions for sleeping, and so on, 
have shown markedly psychopathic personality traits and 
yet who under quieter and better conditions have seemed 
entirely different individuals. One boy’s eccentric be- 
havior was largely in response to his brother’s nasty talk, 
some of it in undertones at the meal table when it actually 
turned him against his food. The real instigator was 
accounted the good boy and the victim was regarded as 
delinquent because he ran away and stole either to get 
away or to get amusements outside his home. The proof 
of the value of analysis of the case is in the fact that our 
boy showed no delinquencies when placed in another 
family. After a time he grew more stable and was quite 
able to do well at home, the brother in the meantime 
having been persuaded to change his mode of thought and 
conversation. 
So it may be confidently asserted that the person with 
moderately erratic tendencies, who is guided into good 
habits of mind and body, perhaps if necessary placed in 
another home environment, is often able to get along well. 
Thus, the social aspects of a case are by no means the 
least or last consideration either for discovering the causes 
of trouble or for curing the trouble. One finds, unfortu- 
nately, however, that meeting the family upon a common- 
sense level of reconstructive effort is in many cases not so 
easy, not even when one is dealing with intelligent parents. 
A very good mother of a very unstable and badly behaved 
(and, because of her neurotic condition), utterly spoiled 
child, said, ““Then you tell me that I who have done so 
much for my child am not the proper person to bring her 
up. That’s too hard to believe.” 
Nor do we always get codperation from teachers and 
principals who either have preconceived notions of what a 
child needs, particularly in the way of dsicipline, or who 
feel that the school system cannot be disrupted to give 
246
-P-A-G-E-273
PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
special privileges to a child who is not physically crippled. 
In fact it sometimes is much worse than that, for the 
personality of the teacher may be at fault, and a mutual 
dislike based on prior experiences may be at the root of 
personal attitudes which are no small obstacle to better 
behavior on the part of the child. How often have we 
heard, ‘““‘That crazy teacher, how I hate her!” “That 
hard-faced teacher, it makes me nervous every day to be 
in her room!” “That sarcastic teacher, you can never 
do anything to please her!” Imagine a sensitive child 
being obliged every day to face a situation which is so 
distasteful. With all the admiration which I have for the 
teaching profession and for most members of it whom I 
know, I sometimes am compelled to believe that the 
greatest requisite for good teaching is the fine personal 
influence that can come only through understanding the 
natural history of the child, and this must include ap- 
preciation of the needs and responses of the overly 
sensitive, the unstable, the psychopathic personality. 
After all of the foregoing we must assert again at 
this point that most people who are confronted by the 
problem of treating of delinquency in children have to do 
with mentally normal offenders. It is perhaps not strange, 
in the light of the overstatements which have been made 
in recent years concerning the relationship between 
delinquency and mental abnormality, particularly mental 
defect, that relatives sometimes bring a thoroughly normal 
child for examination and begin by asking whether or not 
he is normal mentally. This is much as it was a little 
earlier when there was considerable newspaper talk about 
delinquency being caused by some pressure of the skull 
on the brain. Parents used to convince themselves that 
they knew what particular knock on the head did it in the 
same fashion as some parents nowadays come to a clinic 
attributing a paralysis or other ailment to some fall or head 
accident which could not possibly have caused the trouble.

Now, a great deal already stated in this chapter about 
the inner mental life, educating to self discipline, change 
of environment, etc., for delinquents who are not normal 
mentally, can be applied just as well in a discussion of the 
treatment of those who are quite normal mentally. And, 
also, not a little that one may say about misconduct in the 
mentally normal applies equally well to those who are 
abnormal. 
For the purposes of this chapter, which must neces- 
sarily deal with the subject in brief and cannot possibly 
include many items which a more professional monograph 
would require, I shall attempt to give some generalizations 
which will embody fundamentals. Earlier in the chapter 
I insisted that I knew of nothing which was more essential 
to sound procedure in the treatment of a delinquent than 
getting at the particular ideational life which leads to 
delinquency. The first of the generalizations, then, may 
well be the statement that of all the inquiries which one 
can make concerning the delinquent and of all the ques- 
tions which one can put directly or indirectly to the 
delinquent himself, nothing is so important as those 
which have to deal with how the ideas of delinquency 
gained entrance into his mind. In thinking of any special 
thoughts or special ideas which may possibly stand in the 
most immediate relationship to delinquency, as cause to 
effect, it is knowledge of their origin which will be most 
likely to give us an understanding of what they are. And 
without understanding this feature of the background in 
origins one is quite apt entirely to miss the dynamic 
center of the whole situation and to make a botch of the 
treatment. In order to illustrate this and a number of 
other points in the treatment of delinquency, I offer an 
illustrative case study. 
A young man of twenty-one has lived for years in a city 
in New York State, where he has hadalltheadvantages that 
a particularly wholesome environment offers. My infor- 
248
-P-A-G-E-275
  PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
mation comes from the intelligent father and mother and 
from a friend, the family physician. All these and other 
relatives have attempted to check this boy’s tendencies 
toward delinquency, but without avail. After lapses into 
dishonesty for a dozen years, he has recently been in a very 
serious affair involving, through forging and misrepre- 
sentation, the bank account of a relative. Quick settlement 
with the bank prevented the matter from coming to court, 
but the parents are now in desperation. It is the old 
story: early misrepresentations and pilfering leading on to 
larger stealing; much lying at first in obvious self defense, 
later larger fabrications. 
And yet one finds that the delinquent presents a pleas- 
ing personality, having good looks, good bodily structure, 
good address, and mentality in many respects considerably 
above the average. Morover, he is much concerned about 
himself and readily acknowledges his own weaknesses and 
transgressions. Indeed, this has been characteristic of 
him all along. Naturally, one is interested to know what 
sort of treatment such an apparently rational and respon- 
sive individual has received. Early he was reasoned with 
and punished by deprivations and whippings; more 
recently there have been the usual mother’s tears and 
pleadings and the father’s stern admonitions, with more 
deprivations which the boy has always accepted in 
stoical fashion. The physician and others have gone with 
him into the question of his habits and his companion- 
ships, and have unearthed various details, the boy always 
manfully maintaining that the trouble was with himself 
and not with his companions, and nothing came of it 
all. It should be added that there has been harmony in

however, to the extent that the mother has always been 
made acquainted with the extent of her boy’s misdeeds.

these parents when they learned the true facts of the case,

so easy for us to ascertain, it would do much to enforce 
the value of this chapter. The mother, an unusually 
intelligent woman, said, ‘‘How can it be that parents can 
be blind in their working toward an end at which they 
have so earnestly aimed. Why aren’t we better educated 
concerning causes and about what goes to make conduct. 
If years ago we had only known more!” 
Not one of those who had tried to take a hand in the 
guidance of this boy seems to have made the sort of 
rational inquiry that investigation into any other natural 
phenomenon would surely involve. During the long 
years of his delinquent career, and this has been true in 
many another case we have seen, no one obtained from 
the boy the story of beginnings, learning under what 
circumstances and through what incentives he began his 
lying and stealing. And yet these facts concerning 
origins are very often just what are necessary to a correct 
understanding of a case and to formulating rational plans 
of treatment. 
No doubt the question was oftentimes asked the boy, 
“What makes you do such things?” Or even, “How did 
you get such ideas into your head?”’ And the answer to 
this type of question practically always is, “I don’t 
know.” Nor in the consulting room is there any better 
response to such direct questionings. In fact, the delin- 
quent very seldom reasons out the basis of his own 
conduct well enough to be able to state causes. His 
delinquent tendency is a fact to him, perhaps a distressing 
fact, one that stands in the way of larger pleasures and 
successes; and yet to himself it is not altogether explicable. 
Moreover, one finds sometimes that the child all along 
has an underlying feeling that he is not understood. 
‘“‘They don’t know what I’ve been up against,”’ is the sort 
of comment on parental treatment that I have heard over 
and over again. To have continually in the background 
of consciousness unfortunate ideas which have not been 
250 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  
PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
shared with advisers often produces a perniciously active 
and continuing source of energy making for misconduct. 
It may not always be clear just why this is so, why what 
is hidden is so dynamic, so urgent, and yet the history 
of many cases proves that it is a fact. 
In the case I am relating one felt it useless directly 
to inquire about the source of the trouble or advisable to 
ask who had influenced the delinquent for the bad; indeed 
the young man quickly said he had been going with a 
“bunch of boys and girls that were not too good, and yet 
weren’t so bad either.” He added, “I’ve always told my 
father he needn’t blame anybody else for anything I did.” 
Now that is an attitude that is frequently taken in the 
first statement toward companions, perhaps logically, 
perhaps manfully or generously, or in evidence of desire 
not to be considered foolishly weak willed. 
But approaching the matter by a different method, 
historically, as one might say, and more impersonally, and 
inquiring about incidents and interests and companions 
at this or that age, and about what sort of children the 
various companions were and what were the activities en- 
gaged in with them, we may, and oftentimes do, get a very 
clear statement ofessentials. Our young man suddenly said, 
after we had him placed in memory amid a little group of 
children when he was five to seven years of age and in the 
town where he then lived, and talking about their play- 
times and other features of their comradeship, “‘I’ll tell 
you, doctor, that’s where it began, right there. I began 
lying so they wouldn’t know when that boy and girl came 
over to my house when my mother had gone out in the 
afternoon. I learned to lie and to steal right there. I 
remember the bag of candies I bought with the first money 
I took from my mother’s purse.”’ He told how that sort 
of thing with the little group of three went on for some 
time and that he lied much so that his mother should not 
know that the others had come to their house. There was

more to it of course; the group had spoken together of 
some bad things and engaged in some bad sex practices. 
And what he now remembered as his peculiar emotional 
reaction to the affair was his discomfiture and shame and 
feeling of inferiority at so breaking with family confidences 
and standards of honesty, however indefinite his ap- 
preciation of such things may have been at that early age. 
- Now, whatever the outcome will be in this case, after 
all these years of habit formation and whatever there may 
be in the way of peculiar personality traits on the part of 
this young man which has led him towards misconduct, 
back at the beginning was the golden moment when his 
parents might have learned much and prevented much. 
That is the point to be stressed here. They did discover 
something of his lying and pilfering tendencies then, even 
though they knew nothing of the source or extent of it. 
They merely punished him for it and he at once became 
cowardly about the punishments, he says, and lied all the 
more. Thus the treatment was not at all directed at the 
cause of the trouble. 
At the time when a child is first detected in delin- 
quency, even in lying, then is the time to dig deep into 
every possible motivation or into every association or 
source from which the idea of the specific misconduct may 
have been gained. In most cases, I find, it is some personal 
association or experience which is at the source or root 
of the misbehavior and the child is not going to tell what 
has happened unless confronted by the specific and de- 
tailed but sympathetic inquiry which he can respond to 
without damage to his sense of childish propriety, whether 
that be loyalty to comrades, shame about the affair, 
unnecessary exposure of himself to punishment, and so on. 
But too much suggestion which might elicit false ac- 
cusations or false confessions must be avoided; tactful 
indirectness is required. 
By way of a second generalization I would stress the 
202 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
    PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
value for treatment of considering the matter of delin- 
quency inits chronological aspects. During what weeks, 
on what days, at what hours are the tendencies to mis- 
conduct displayed? In few cases is there continuous 
exhibition of bad behavior. All study of a case is 
designed, of course, to dig out the relation of cause to 
effect. Does it take place, this misconduct, on special 
occasions or at special hours, and if so, why? 
Today a father comes in with his little boy who has 
been pilfering from his pockets and money drawer, having 
taken probably over a hundred dollars during the last half 
year. The boy knows now when the stealing has been 
done—always in the early morning. The father has 
lectured and whipped the boy, remaining bound to the 
idea that he would not lock up all the household cash,—it 
was too disgraceful and troublesome. But he has never 
put two and two together in time relationships, although 
in answering questions about the boy’s habit he tells how 
early he wakes up. The boy, in turn, under simple 
questioning tells of a companion who likewise steals and 
how they share this as a great secret, how the early 
waking hours are filled for him with wishing half-dreams 
and how he then plans getting out quietly before the 
others are awake to get at his father’s pockets or purse. 
Indeed this boy of nine years goes on to say that he does 
really want to do very differently and that he is sure he can 
if he can keep away from the other boy of eleven, which is 
easy enough to accomplish. He says especially that if he 
can keep from having these morning wishes and tempta- 
tions he can do differently—he never has them for a 
minute at any other time. And this second problem 
seems easy enough to solve, for the boy goes to bed at 
seven and goes right to sleep; he is all slept out long 
before the others are awake. 
It is just by such a change in habits and management 
of a child that we have seen many a case cured. A boy

returns from school glum, defiant, hateful, mean to the 
pet animals on some days. The question is not what is 
wrong in general, but what is there specifically behind the 
time relationships? We have in mind a boy who was 
studied on account of such behavior from a general 
medical standpoint by very good physicians but without 
any beneficial result. It proved to be a companionship 
affair on certain days when there was exchange of obscene 
conversation which the boy hardly understood but hated 
himself for; and to this dissatisfaction with himself he 
reacted, as many people do, by taking it out on his 
surroundings. 
And other cases, where at intervals and only occasion- 
ally there are outbreaks of misconduct of any kind,—do 
these come after some certain visit or special experiences, 
or as related to some holiday or hours of idleness? One 
could bring many case studies to bear on these matters of 
time connection in delinquencies. But the time feature 
of a case (this is a point that must not be forgotten) 
should be related to the possibility of special inner as well 
as outer experiences that are contributing factors in 
causing delinquency. 
Very much delinquency has its inception during hours 
of idleness, in bed as well as out of bed, and during times 
when pernicious day-dreaming is possible. (Of course, 
day-dreaming may be of fine ambitions and wishes.) To 
trace misconduct to this inner source and to these times 
is to do more toward getting a clue to rational and ef- 
ficient treatment than almost anything else which may be 
done. It is possible to safeguard the young individual by 
preventing the occurrence of such times and seasons when 
delinquent thoughts develop much more easily than it is 
possible to prevent opportunity for the delinquent acts 
themselves to follow. 
And this naturally leads us to consider another point 
which is important enough to be made a generalization: 
254 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
It is of great importance for treatment to understand the 
special conditions or circumstances under which a boy or 
girl develops any recurrent idea of delinquency. Is it in 
relationship to any locality or companionship, to any 
school, or playground, or home situation, to any recrea- 
tion or place of recreation, or any employment? One 
may often get at this through studying time relationships. 
But again, the special condition often involves mostly 
the inner mental life. Those who have studied our 
published case histories will be familiar with the various 
aspects of the life of the mind that have to do with reviv- 
ing an idea of delinquency. The phenomena are, for the 
most part, based on the laws of mental association; one 
idea follows another because they were earlier linked 
together. Vivid instances occur. One little girl, when she 
read the name George, especially in school, thought of 
what George her schoolmate had said that was bad, and 
one thought would lead to another till she would be 
spurred on to the actual misconduct, stealing, that they 
had talked about. And the thought of certain pictures 
seen at the time of definite suggestions toward delin- 
quency, or of tabooed words (obscene or related to sex), 
because these had been uttered by others at the time of 
delinquent acts, may arouse chains of thought that end 
in the performance of misconduct. 
These special conditions may be met by way of treat- 
ment not only by vigorous, wholesome, constructive 
measures, but also by learning of and breaking up old 
associational thought processes by the formation of newand 
better chains of association. This requires skill, but it is 
entirely possible and by the use of common-sense methods. 
Nothing that needs change in the outer circumstances 
of the child is more difficult to achieve than breaking 
up of bad neighborhood companionships. Under the 
ordinary conditions of life, it is asking a great deal, some- 
times too much, to have a child utterly refuse to associate

with the other children who live near him. Nor is it 
usually effective for anyone to attempt to reform the 
crowd as such unless the children have a great deal of 
time and oversight given them. A single child or a group 
of children will need new interests to command them either 
through change of residence or change in recreational or 
other activities in connection with which the delinquency 
has developed. We find ourselves in this matter drawing 
particularly on the following conception of possibilities: 
change of family residence or placing the child with 
relatives; putting him in touch with entirely new centers 
or features of recreational life; ‘‘placing out” for a longer 
or shorter time by child-helping agencies; change of 
schools or of teachers or of the curriculum to fit the child’s 
special abilities, disabilities, interests, or needs; attacking 
the problem of group misconduct by the appeal of pro- 
bation officers or others to guardians of a child’s wayward 
companions, or through juvenile court action; and finally, 
change of various living conditions or habits if these 
appear to play some part in developing delinquent 
tedencies. 
The reader can see running all through these sugges- 
tions that the attack is really always upon (a) those outer 
conditions which may be influencing the child’s mental 
life by directly suggesting ideas of misconduct, or (b) upon 
those conditions which afford an opportunity for the 
child of himself to cherish, or consciously or subscon- 
sciously to re-awaken, the ideation or imagery that creates 
the impulse to misconduct. 
A case comes to mind as I write these last paragraphs— 
a boy brought for study from a country home in another 
State, a “‘placed out” boy, eight years old, who is showing 
some peculiarly vicious tendencies towards cruelty, 
obscenity, and sex habits (although the little fellow is 
reported in many ways to have good traits and he is 
intelligent and truthful). With very little effort it was 
256
-P-A-G-E-283
PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
found that his troubles are always secondary to his 
thoughts and that these are awakened by very definite 
opportunities and external associations, always when he is 
alone, generally when he is in the barn, and then only 
when he begins to think of his cousins, now in an in- 
stitution, who taught him much of this when he was not 
more than five years old, and about whose misdeeds he 
has heard much from the other boys. Can there be any 
doubt, in the light of what we have said heretofore, about 
how to go ahead in the treatment of this case? 
Since so much has been made in preceding paragraphs 
of the mental life, there should be some enumeration of the 
measures for treatment that directly influence such 
thought processes of the child as tend to produce delin- 
quent conduct. With both the normal and the defective, 
if any special abilities are discovered one may well con- 
sider giving healthier satisfactions and new interests 
through chances for developing activities which may 
command the child’s vigorous attention. And in this 
attempt at forming new adjustments we should aim to 
develop in the child a better feeling of his being somebody 
of worth in the world, counteracting in every way possible 
the inferiority feeling which is so frequently discovered 
among delinquents. And then there is the matter of 
confidences with parents. These should be rated very 
high as influencing the child’s mental life, but they should 
not be carried to the extent of allowing the psychopathic 
young individual to over-exploit his feelings and desires 
for recognition—there is some strength in mental reserve. 
Incentives toward better conduct undoubtedly may be 
received through good reading—have we not all exper- 
ienced this?—or by bedtime or other appropriate 
suggestions. And need we say anything about the high 
value of religious and ethical instruction, although we are 
rather afraid of preachment to those who are already 
delinquent, because we have so frequently seen cases

where the religious approach was unavailing on account 
of the underlying facts not being understood. Then we 
frequently advise meeting the child on the level of his 
perplexity concerning tabooed words, setting him right 
about them and particularly about his sex ideas, making 
plain the biological truth and the essential purity of sex 
relations. Other measures that have to do with the 
modification of the thought life have been hinted at here- 
tofore, but again we would insist upon this whole matter 
not being taken in too general a sense but that there be 
realization that what is most required is special help at 
special times. 
No part of this chapter is to be construed as argument 
against either discipline or punishment, which, to my 
mind, play a part in every well-ordered life of old or 
young. The discipline of work, of doing right, and of 
many other necessities in adult life, as well as the dis- 
cipline of education and right conduct in childhood are 
very real. Punishments in various forms come to adults 
who fail to play the game of life well, and the child needs 
to realize this so that he will not think that he alone is 
subject to guidance, obedience, and retribution. ° 
But every bit of the regulation of a child’s life should 
be aimed at the development of the power of self-dis- 
cipline. Even punishment well administered has this 
as its end. If punishment of any kind, particularly 
corporal punishment, is poorly adapted so that a bad 
spirit in the child is engendered, then it defeats its own 
best end. We find that delay in the procedure of punish- 
ment, whether in family life, as when it is promised that 
the father will whip the child when he comes home at 
night or returns from a trip in a few days, or when de- 
linquents are held in a court detention home, encourages 
the growth of an entirely pernicious spirit, whether of 
fear or of vindictiveness in the child. I earnestly counsel 
258
-P-A-G-E-285
PREVENTING DELINQUENCY 
the adoption of measures of discipline carefully cal- 
culated so that no bad spirit on the part of the child, 
whether developed from his own inner feelings or from the 
suggestions of others concerning the discipline which he 
should have, will be permitted or encouraged to develop. 
Just exactly what forms punishment should take is 
beyond the province of this chapter to discuss, because 
such immense variations are advisable according to the 
habits and customs of the community, of the institution 
in which the child may be, and of the school and the 
home. What has a good influence on one child may turn 
out badly with another, not only on account of variation 
in innate emotional response, but also in the ideas which 
the individual has imbibed from his environment. What 
is perniciously humbling to some children may not be so 
to others; while rabid vindictiveness may be aroused 
in one child by some form of discipline that another has 
been accustomed to take without notice. We may go to 
novels as well as to real life for stories that bear this out. 
Again, this is a matter of adaptation of measures of 
treatment to the child’s peculiarly personal needs. 
In the treatment of delinquency both the child and the 
environment have to be considered. 
The best method of procedure is always through 
getting at a fundamental understanding of the trouble. 
There are various physical defects and ailments which 
may be conceived of as needing treatment in the delin- 
quent child, but mainly from the standpoint of offering 
the best possible basis for reformation rather than as 
directly causing delinquency. 
The mental life of the child is the most important for 
consideration; delinquency arises directly from the char- 
acter of the child’s ideas. 
Mental defect is a matter that has to be considered, 
and also lack of good mental balance, whether as actual 
259 Individual-

    THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
mental disease or as showing itself through a psychopathic 
personality. All these form well-known, immediate back- 
grounds of delinquency. 
But the vast majority of delinquent children are 
quite normal mentally. With these the most direct ap- 
proach to the whole problem of delinquency is through 
their ideational life—(a) the origin of their delinquent 
ideas, (b) the special times and periods when these 
especially recur, and (c) the essential conditions or cir- 
cumstances under which delinquent ideas recur. The 
investigation of these points gives a most valuable short- 
cut to the treatment of any case, and indeed sometimes 
is an absolute requisite to the cure of the delinquent 
trends. 
There are many suggestions for the treatment of 
external circumstances and of mental life that should 
come through common-sense observation and reading, 
but no feature of the situation should be left out of 
account. 
Disciplines and punishments are frequently advisable 
and sometimes necessary, but they should be very well 
directed so that they may not influence the individual in 
any unfortunate way. They must be well considered and 
well adapted to the personal needs of the child.
-P-A-G-E-287
  XIII 
THE CARE OF INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR CHILDREN 
HE exact scope of the problem indicated by the 
title of this chapter is difficult to define. There 
is no universally accepted official definition even 
of the term “‘mental deficiency.’”? Some would broaden 
this term sufficiently to include merely backward and 
retarded children. It is not our purpose, however, to 
discuss the problem of the merely dull child, who is 
laggard in school but who gives promise of becoming an 
altogether normal, self-supporting, self-controlling adult. 
We shall use the term in its more restricted meaning 
to apply to those children who, because of subnormal 
mental endowment, will not be able to adapt themselves 
to an ordinary environment or to maintain existence 
independently of some external support and guidance. 
We shall, however, lay special emphasis upon that group 
of mentally deficient children who approximate the 
normal in their general capacities and outlook, because 
it is this group which is most numerous and, in many 
respects, most important both from the social and the 
educational point of view. 
For purposes of clearness, it is necessary, however, 
to recognize at the outset that there are different degrees 
of mental deficiency just as there are different degrees of 
normal and superior intelligence. Many classifications 
have been proposed to differentiate and describe these 
varying degrees of mental deficiency but in many respects 
the most satisfactory classification is that contained in 
the Mental Deficiency Law of England. This law 
defines idiots as “persons so deeply defective in mind

from birth, or from an early age, as to be unable to guard 
themselves against common physical dangers.” 
Imbeciles are defined as ‘“‘persons in whose case there 
exists from birth or from an early age mental defectiveness 
not amounting to idiocy, yet so pronounced that they 
are incapable of managing themselves or their affairs, or, 
in the case of children, of being taught to do so.” 
And morons are defined as “‘persons in whose case 
there exists from birth or from an early age mental 
defectiveness not amounting to imbecility, yet so pro- 
nounced that they require care, supervision, and control 
for their own protection, or for the protection of others; 
or, in the case of children, that they, by reason of such 
defectiveness, appear to be permanently incapable of 
receiving proper benefit from the instruction in ordinary 
schools.” 
What is the difference between a dullard and a de- 
ficient child? It may not be altogether scientific to 
make a rigid distinction between them. It has been 
maintained that grades of intelligence fade into each 
other like day, dusk, dark and dawn; and that it is 
arbitrary to draw sharp lines between the grades. For 
practical reasons, however, we insist that a clear-cut 
distinction should be made between the dullard and the 
deficient child. And the distinction should be made in 
favor of the dullard. A dullard is not a very high-grade 
moron; he is not a super-moron. He is to be regarded 
as a definitely normal individual, whose general alertness 
is simply below the average. He is organized along 
normal lines. He may be slow witted; but he is not weak 
witted. He has considerable mental stamina and stability. 
When we describe him psychologically as a low-grade 
normal, we do it in no derogatory sense. He may be 
backward in school; he may be rather obtuse in abstract, 
academic subjects; but in his natural sphere he succeeds. 
He makes his way in the world, because he has enough 
262
-P-A-G-E-289
    INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR CHILDREN 
mother wit todoso. This is more than we can say of the 
moron; for, as Tregold has pointed out, even the highest- 
grade moron is lacking in “‘that essential to independent 
existence, ‘common sense’.”’ 
The above definitions and distinctions are placed 
frankly before the reader in order to avoid undue con- 
fusion. It is very important, however, to caution the 
reader against placing normal children and the mentally 
deficient children in absolutely different categories. The 
mentally deficient child is not a separate and peculiar 
species. He belongs to the human family. His educa- 
tional, if not his developmental psychology, are of the same 
general character as that of the normal child. In many | 
respects he may very closely simulate a normal individual. 
He may need specialized educational procedures, but in 
general he must be approached as though he were a 
normal child with certain limitations and handicaps. 
We do not treat the blind child and the crippled child 
as though they were apart from the human family. We 
ought to acquire a similar attitude and philosophy with 
respect to the mentally deficient child, even if his handicap 
is in the field of intelligence. It may be said that the 
recent developments in the study and treatment of 
mental deficiency have tended to emphasize the normal 
rather than the pathological aspects of mental defect. 
The whole problem appears less forbidding and more 
manageable from every point of view than it did even a 
decade ago. 
At this point we may take a glance at the progress 
which our knowledge has made in this field. Only a 
little more than a century ago, medical writers were still 
confusing the concepts of insanity and idiocy. Esquirol 
made a distinction between these two conditions. The 
progress of modern medicine in the fields of neurology 
and physiology and endocrinology (the study of the 
internal glands) have helped us considerably in under- 
263 Medical

Problem

  Psycho- 
logical 
Studies of 
the Problem THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
standing the physical basis and physical characteristics 
of mentally deficient children. In a relatively few in- 
stances, such as cretinism, this medical knowledge has 
suggested the possibility of curing certain developmental 
types of mental deficiencies. Cretinism, however, is a 
relatively rare form of mental deficiency and it must be 
diagnosed in early infancy if the administration of 
thyroid tablets is to accomplish fully curative results. 
We mention this fact because parents and teachers 
are still too prone to look hopefully toward glandular 
extract thereapy for the cure of mental deficiency. 
Medical knowledge in its present state emphasizes the 
incurability of feeble-mindedness, but it has thrown 
considerable light on various causes of feeble-mindedness 
and indicates how the community, through proper 
preventive measures, may reduce the number of feeble- 
minded in the population. All eugenic measures which 
insure soundness of stock will, in the next generation, 
increase normality and reduce subnormality. There are, 
however, numerous cases of mental deficiency in which 
no hereditary factor is demonstrable and in which the 
causative factor is a disease or damage which curtails 
the development of the brain. All medical and public 
health measures which promote maternal hygiene, which 
improve obstetric and midwife practice, and which 
control infectious diseases will, in the aggregate, materially 
reduce the number of feeble-minded. Moreover, in 
spite of the fact that medical science is unable to cure 
mental deficiency, it must be insisted that the advice 
of the physician is necessary at many points because of 
the physical complications involved. 
Our understanding of the problem of mental deficiency 
has been both broadened and deepened by the develop- 
ment of educational and child psychology, particularly 
during the last fifty years. The child study movement 
which was so prominent in the 1890’s concerned itself 
264 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR CHILDREN 
chiefly with the psychology of normal children but it 
gave an impetus to the study of subnormal and handi- 
capped children. Experimental and educational psy- 
chology likewise made contributions to a better under- 
standing of the limitations and characteristics of 
subnormal minds. In 1896, Lightner Witmer, professor 
of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, estab- 
lished at Philadelphia what is reputed to be the first 
psychological clinic for the diagnosis and treatment of 
mentally exceptional and atypical children. In 1899, 
the Board of Education of the City of Chicago, established 
a department for research into the problems relating to 
educationally exceptional children. In 1808 the Fari- 
bault (Minnesota) School for the Feeble-Minded estab- 
lished a department of research. In 1906 a similar 
research department was established at the Vineland 
Training School, in Vineland, New Jersey. These are a 
few of the early indications of the more scientific interest 
in the problem of the care of mentally deficient children. 
Somewhat more extended mention must be made of 
the work of Alfred Binet, who, in 1904, was appointed 
by the Minister of Public Instruction in France as a 
member of the commission which was charged with the 
study of measures to be taken for insuring the benefits of 
instruction for defective children, and whose services in 
mental measurement were referred to in Chapter VII. 
This eminent psychologist was appointed because of his 
investigations and interest in the general field of child 
study. He had made significant studies of mental 
development in his own children. 
The commission decided that “no child suspect should 
be eliminated from school and admitted into a special 
class without first being submitted to a pedagogical and 
medical examination from which it could be certified that, 
because of his state of intelligence, he was unable to 
profit by the instruction given in the ordinary schools.”

This practical situation revealed to Binet the necessity 
of establishing a more scientific diagnosis of inferior 
states of intelligence. He met the problem by devising 
what he called a measuring scale of intelligence which 
graded children according to their mental age. Binet 
did not pretend that this scale has the accuracy of a 
clinical thermometer, which reads to the tenth of a 
degree, but he called it a scale because it is made up of 
standardized units or tests. Five or six simple tests for 
each age from three to twelve or sixteen years of age 
furnish the basis of measurement. What is normal or 
characteristic of a given age being known, we can 
determine roughly whether a child tests above age, below 
age or at age and we can tell how much he deviates from 
his chronological age. The mental age of mentally 
deficient children, therefore, gives us some idea of their 
retardation. 
Binet’s researches led to a stupendous amount of 
investigation relating to the problems of subnormal 
mentality. Particularly was this true in America where 
hundreds of articles and scores of books indirectly owe 
their inception to the suggestive writings of Alfred Binet. 
In a measure this is true even of the vast psychological 
enterprise of the World War, in which 1,700,000 soldiers 
were tested by graded intelligence scales. 
The psychological investigations in this field, both in 
England and America, have followed closely the con- 
ceptions of Binet. Professor Lewis Terman of Stanford 
University made a revision and extension of the Binet 
Measuring Scale which has come into wide use. This 
version of the Binet Measuring Scale expresses a mental 
rating by means of an “Intelligence Quotient’”’ or IQ., 
which is derived by dividing the ascertained mental age 
by the chronological age. If the numerator (mental age) 
and denominator are equal we have a quotient of 7, or 
expressed on a percentage basis of 100. If the numerator 
266
-P-A-G-E-293
  INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR CHILDREN 
is 2 and the denominator is 3 we have a value below 100; 
if the numerator is 3 and the denominator is 2 we have an 
IQ of 150. It has been suggested that an IQ of 70 or less 
must indicate mental deficiency, but this is not a safe 
rule to follow because there are too many exceptions. 
A large amount of error and confusion has been caused 
by the uncritical use of mental measurements. Still 
the mental age is an objective measure of mentality, and 
as such it is a good point of departure for estimating 
the capacity and educational treatment of a subnormal 
child. 
The convenience and apparent precision of mental 
measurement methods led originally to an exaggerated 
emphasis on the factor of intelligence in the problem of 
the care of mentally deficient children. In many cases 
the classification, and even the training of backward and 
defective children were too exclusively determined by 
mental age ratings. Psychiatrists have called attention 
to the danger of exaggerating the purely intellectual 
factor in‘ the study and treatment of handicapped in- 
dividuals. 
The psychiatrist, by training and professional ex- 
perience, is accustomed to take into account the total 
individuality and to emphasize the significance of person- 
ality traits. Recent literature and practical work in this 
field alike have placed increasing stress on the personality 
factors. Numerous case studies have shown that the 
mental age and IQ of an individual are not all-determining 
with respect to his vocational capacity. In some instances, 
a youth with an intelligence age as low as five years has 
done surprisingly well industrially, because of favorable 
personality endowment. Mental surveys of the after- 
career of mentally deficient pupils discharged from 
special classes and similar surveys of former inmates of 
institutions for the feeble-minded have revealed a rel- 
atively high degree of earning power on the part of 
267 Personality

individuals who had been diagnosed as feeble-minded. 
The experiments of progressive institutions in the colony 
care of the feeble-minded have also revealed in a new 
light the vocational possibility of subnormal individuals. 
The most important investigation and demonstration 
in this direction has been made by Dr. Charles Bernstein, 
superintendent of the State School (for the feeble-minded) 
at Rome, New York. His vision and constructive efforts 
in this work have demonstrated that the higher grade of 
feeble-minded individuals can be trained for productive 
labor in industrial, agricultural, and domestic fields. It 
has also been demonstrated that a small group of forty 
defectives, after preliminary training, can be placed in a 
rented house, presided over by a matron and her husband 
and, with this dormitory serving as a home and recreation 
center, these defectives can go out and do house work, 
farm work and shop work. There are over thirty of these 
extra-institutional vocational colonies in New York and 
they are being operated at a great economical saving to 
the State. 
A recent New Haven experiment to determine the 
vocational possibility of subnormal girls in factory work, 
showed that even a girl of a mental age of six years could 
earn nine dollars a week, under specially favorable con- 
ditions. A boy who was a member of a vocational 
colony for mental defectives in the Adirondacks one year 
received the prize for planting the largest number of 
trees planted by any one person in the United States. 
These successful efforts in the vocational community 
control of mentally deficient individuals are mentioned 
here because such demonstrations have almost revolu- 
tionized our conception of the feeble-minded individual 
and have made our whole attitude toward him more 
constructive and hopeful. Our educational procedure 
with reference to mentally deficient children should take 
into full account their many vocational possibilities. 
268 
   
-P-A-G-E-295
  INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR CHILDREN 
Practically all cases of mental deficiency are recogniz- 
able and become established before the age of six years. 
The adequate training of the deficient child can not, 
therefore, be postponed to the time when he is of school 
age or of wage earning age. His training can not begin 
too early and here, as elsewhere, there is danger in 
ignoring the importance of the pre-school period of his 
development. There is also danger that the deficient 
child will, during this period, be sadly misunderstood and 
even imposed upon. I have seen many instances in 
which a defective child was punished severely because 
he seemed unduly troublesome and unreasonably obstinate. 
Sometimes these situations drift into unconscious forms of 
cruelty to the child and extreme vexation for the parent. 
It is necessary to realize from the outset that the 
deficient child will be slow in his learning and that in no 
way can he be forced beyond the level of his capacity. 
He may even be slow in learning to walk and to talk; 
he may be slow in acquiring habits of cleanliness; but 
within his limits he will yield to judicious discipline and to 
systematic training. This training must, in the beginning, 
concern itself with the very simplest matters, such as 
putting on shoes, buttoning blouse, using the handker- 
chief properly and a multitude of simple acts in the field 
of his every-day life. Great patience and tolerance 
must be exercised in this period when normal children 
develop with such striking speed. 
There can only be vexation and disappointment if the 
child is continually compared with his normal peers, 
but if the parent can assume the courageous and 
scientific attitude of treating the defective child in terms 
of his actual mental maturity the whole situation will 
tend to become more tolerable and more constructive, 
because within his sphere the child has considerable 
learning capacity. It will also make the atmosphere of 
his upbringing more wholesome and reduce the tendency

to nervousness and irritability which sometimes actually 
undermine the health of the mother. The writer has 
seen too much of this whole problem to be blind to the 
disappointment and difficulties involved, but he has 
noted that the parent who is able to take the most 
rational, that is, the most psychological, view of the 
educational problem is most likely to secure results and 
to maintain a wholesome atmosphere in the domestic 
training of the child. 
The ordinary laws of habit formation which are 
discussed in this volume (Chapter VII) apply with equal 
force to the mentally deficient child. A great deal of his 
education must come, as we say, thru the force of habit! 
We can not rely too much on his initiative and personal 
judgment because it is in these directions that he is most 
impoverished. Habit formation, however, does not 
depend altogether upon drilling and repetition. Even a 
mentally deficient child is largely governed by motives 
and emotional considerations, just as you and I are. He 
thrives best in an atmosphere of happiness, and wonders 
can be accomplished thru the liberal use of encouragement 
and praise. In fact it might almost be made an un- 
qualified rule that mentally deficient children, either at 
home or at school, can not be praised too often. To be 
sure, this commendation must be made with certain 
pedagogical skill but the rule should be,—‘‘praise too 
much rather than too little.” Scolding has a very 
small amount of value even when skilfully done. We 
recommend a policy of encouragement with respect to 
the feeble-minded largely because we wish to strengthen 
their own personality sense and to increase their self- 
respect. Many a deficient child behaves more defectively 
than he needs to because he is enmeshed by certain 
feelings of inferiority. The inferiority complexes, so 
called, are by no means limited to normal and psycho- 
neurotic individuals.

INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR CHILDREN 
The chief objective in the home training of the pre- 
school deficient childshould beschoolentrance. Theparent 
should so far as possible train him so that he will adjust 
himself reasonably well to other children. When the 
deficient child should enter school is a question which 
can not be answered arbitrarily. In some instances 
school entrance will be postponed until the age of eight 
or nine years because the child is better adapted to home 
than to school life. On the other hand, there are many 
deficient children who would profit, at least by kinder- 
garten experience, as early as the age of three, four, five 
or six. Other things being equal, it is desirable to give 
the deficient child the benefits of the social training and 
handwork which are characteristic of a modern kinder- 
garten. The kindergarten teacher can not be expected 
to make extreme adjustments in behalf of a deficient 
child, but she will usually be found ready to codperate 
if the child is at all amenable. 
The public school systems of our larger cities have 
established special classes for educationally exceptional 
children. In some instances such classes have been 
created for the blind and semi-blind, deaf and semi-deaf, 
for the speech defectives, and, in New York, even for 
cardiac defectives. In the same spirit, public schools 
have set aside special classes and special teachers for the 
training of mentally handicapped pupils. The intelligent 
parent will ordinarily regard these provisions as in the 
nature of special advantages for the deficient pupil. 
Enrollment in these classes 1s rarely above fifteen, and the 
equipment is usually more expensive than that in ordinary 
class rooms. ‘The special class teacher also has special 
professional training for her work. These favorable 
conditions permit a great deal of individual attention to 
each child. They also make possible a flexible program 
which emphasizes physical and motor and personal 
training as well as the academic subjects. Although the

special class, with all these facilities is unable to accom- 
plish a complete cure, it is able in many instances so to 
organize and stabilize the mentally deficient pupil that 
he has a much greater prospect of happiness and usefulness 
in the world than he otherwise would have. 
Generally speaking, the three R’s are of very secondary 
importance in the educational treatment of the mentally 
deficient pupil. Most high-grade defective children learn 
to write and to read simple letters and they should not be 
denied these accomplishments even if they can put them 
to very little practical use. The three R’s at least have a 
certain cultural value for the mentally deficient child, 
but his educational welfare is prejudiced when a dis- 
proportionate emphasis is placed upon the three R’s. 
In former years it was sometimes argued that a drill in 
arithmetic would have a tendency to strengthen the 
feeble mind; this is faulty psychology. We can only 
strengthen the minds of mentally deficient children by 
organizing their behavior into habits of healthful and 
useful activity. 
All academic work such as drawing, handicraft, 
modeling, weaving, sewing, basketry, woodwork and 
dancing, plays, games and physical education have a 
certain strengthening effect because they increase the 
morale and the personality sense of the mentally deficient 
pupil. These activities, when well conducted, also have 
a certain pre-vocational value. Special class provisions 
in our large cities have helped to define the nature of the 
problem of mental deficiency and incidentally they have 
had a beneficent, liberalizing effect upon the education of 
normal children. These classes have also demonstrated 
to the community the measures which it must take if the 
feeble-minded are to remain with security and comfort 
within its boundaries. 
Moreover, the special class has demonstrated how 
we can meet the needs of the deficient child who can not 
272
-P-A-G-E-299
INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR CHILDREN 
have the benefits of special class instruction. It must be 
admitted that the great majority of mentally deficient 
children are in village and rural schools or in regular 
class rooms where they cannot be assigned to special 
classes. It does not follow, by any means, that the 
deficient child in these circumstances should be either 
excluded from public school or treated as though he 
were an ordinary, normal child. It is always possible, 
whether he is in a crowded class room or in a small rural 
school, to institute some special educational adjustments 
in his behalf. Such an individual program should 
resemble the methods which are used in the special class. 
It will not take an undue amount of the teacher’s time 
or energy to institute such an individual program arrange- 
ment, especially if she enlists the aid of some of her 
brighter pupils or some one in an upper class, and makes 
the work a kind of domestic problem in which the others 
are encouraged to help. Naturally the deficient pupil 
will be permitted to share in the regular school work when 
he is able to do so, but during certain periods of the day 
special forms of activity should be arranged for him. 
The teacher may start with only one special period, but 
gradually she may develop a special program which will 
keep him busy and content during most of the school day. 
The problem of mental deficiency, like a great many 
human problems, finally reduces itself to economic and 
vocational considerations. Chronologically, the feeble- 
minded child matures as quickly as the normal child, but 
once in his teens the question soon arises,—‘‘what can he 
do when he must leave school?’”? Some years ago the 
stock answer to this question was ‘‘send him to an insti- 
tution,” but this answer is little short of absurd, for the 
simple reason that we can not build institutions enough 
to house all of our defectives; and still more because it is 
neither humane nor wise to attempt to send all of them 
to such institutions, even if the provisions were available.

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
The notable work of Dr. Bernstein has shown that a 
large proportion of high-grade mental defectives, under 
the proper safeguard, can be adjusted to community 
and industrial life. The leisure and free time of these 
defectives must be securely protected, particularly in the 
case of girls; but given such protection, it is possible for 
the community to solve a large part of its own problem 
instead of assigning it all to some state institution for 
solution. Dr. Bernstein states the case in these words: 
“‘We are convinced, as result of our experience for four- 
teen years in colony and parole work with boys, and six 
years with girls, that where such boys and girls can render 
themselves self-supporting, even to the extent of paying 
for their own supervision and where girls can earn, as 
many of these girls do, as much as $14.00 to $21.00 a 
week in mills, . . . society has no moral right to deprive 
the individual or community of such opportunity or 
service.” 
The keynote, therefore, of the educational treatment 
of the mentally deficient child should be vocational 
training. Even during the pre-school period, the parent 
should begin to envisage a youth who, although he may 
not be able to compete on equal terms with his fellows, 
may still work side by side with them under favorable 
conditions of guidance and oversight. This is a legitimate 
expectation except, of course, in more pronounced cases 
of deficiency and those higher grade cases which are 
complicated with highly unstable personality traits. But 
for the vast majority of mentally deficient pupils, there is 
a simple vocational outlook of some kind which keeps 
life worth living. Wholesome personal habits, a career 
motive and practical vocational skill constitute the major 
educational objectives in the training of the deficient 
child. 
Once a child has left the protection of the public 
school, he becomes a vocational problem and he is poten- 
274
-P-A-G-E-301
INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR CHILDREN 
tially a social problem. Frequently parents, teachers, 
and relatives can in a large measure solve this problem 
for themselves, thru common sense measures. There is, 
however, abundant room for effort on the part of social 
agencies and welfare organizations. Careful social case 
work pays even with the mentally deficient. The finding 
of proper employment, the safeguarding of conditions of 
employment of a feeble-minded youth, is a constructive 
form of social service. Private individuals, professional 
social workers, local committees, “Big Brothers,” “Big 
Sisters,” have here a concrete field for codperation, ac- 
complishment, and civic inventiveness. We have not 
yet unlocked all the local community resources which will 
really solve the human problem of the feeble-minded but 
we are finding the way in the new kind of education 
which is being provided through special classes and indi- 
vidualized special programs. 
1. Strictly interpreted, the term “‘mental deficiency”’ 
applies only to those children who cannot profit from 
ordinary methods of instruction and who will need a 
certain degree of external guidance and oversight on 
reaching maturity. 
2. Ina medical sense, mental deficiency is incurable; 
but in a psychological sense, it will respond very definitely 
to treatment. All but the lowest grade of mentally de- 
ficient children are educable, trainable, improvable. We 
can not make over a mentally deficient child into a normal 
child, but we can organize and condition his behavior in 
constructive ways. 
3. The education of the deficient child should begin 
in infancy. Training in personal habits is of primary 
importance. -Academic training is of secondary impor- 
tance. 
4. From the beginning he should be trained with 
the hope of ultimately making him happy and useful in 
some employment. A career motive should be developed. 
275 Summary
-P-A-G-E-302
    
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
He should be encouraged whenever possible and be made 
to feel that he is of some importance in the world. 
5. His pre-vocational training should be provided by 
a special class where this is feasible. When it is not pos- 
sible a special program should be planned for. Parents, 
older pupils or sisters or brothers, and teachers can 
codperate in building up such a program for his individ- 
ual benefit. 
6. When he reaches wage earning age, vocational 
guidance becomes of supreme importance. Every effort 
should be made to find a simple job; or to make a part 
time vocational arrangement of some kind which will 
enable him to remain in the community. 
7. Not only social agencies, but relatives and self 
appointed friends can coéperate in maintaining a super- 
vision and guidance which will make his life in the com- 
munity relatively contented and safe.

PROVISIONS FOR INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
T WAS formerly believed, and many people believe it 
| still, that at the beginning of life all children of the 
nation are equally well endowed with capacity for 
learning. In the United States, at the present time, the 
educational philosophy of the people at large takes little 
heed of the form in which human ability is actually dis- 
tributed. The forefathers declared that all men are 
created equal. In what respect this equality prevails 
was not stated, but later generations seem to have as- 
sumed that all were thus declared to be equal in ability. 
Therefore, in regard to penal procedure, political power, 
educational administration, and other important human 
functions, little or no recognition of individual differences 
in ability appears. 
Beginning about 1885, with the efforts of Francis 
_Galton in England, psychologists have been gathering 
measurements of mental capacities. Especially within 
the latest decade, much new knowledge has accumulated, 
showing how greatly human beings differ in mentality. 
The measurements show, also, that these differences 
exist in childhood, and can be determined with a high 
degree of reliability, even by present imperfect methods, 
as early as the sixth year of life. 
It is easiest to think of the facts about individual 
differences at first in terms of physique. Everyone can 
see for himself that a thousand ten-year-olds in a city 
school system vary greatly among themselves in height. 
Furthermore, if these could be grouped along a street 
according to their height, beginning with the shortest and

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
ending with the tallest, it would be easy to see that the 
differences follow certain laws. By far the greatest num- 
ber of the children would be clustered at the center of the 
group. ‘These would be very much like each other,— 
neither very tall nor very short, but medium in height. 
As the children, in the order of arrangement, became 
shorter, they would also be fewer; and the same thing 
would hold, at the opposite extreme, for the tall. We 
should see what experts in measurement call a curve or a 
surface of distribution, with a great many individuals fall- 
ing near a central (median) point, and yet with a few 
children deviating from the central group, toward two 
opposite extremes. 
These facts of distribution hold throughout organic 
nature, and the study of them is called the study of indi- 
. vidual differences. When the traits involved are mental, 
we speak of the psychology of individual differences. It 
is a marvelous principle of biological nature that human 
beings are endlessly diversified in mentalendowment. A 
mental ability is distributed in the same form in which 
height is distributed, though the range is greater in the 
case of mental traits. For instance, no child is two 
hundred times as tall as any other child of his age, in 
terms of any unit; but some children are two hundred 
times as keen in certain mental performances as others 
are, in terms of the units of measurement employed. 
Figure 1, page 279 shows the form which is approxi- 
mated, when a great many children of the same age are 
measured in mental capacity. In order to clarify its 
meaning, we may recall what was said of the distribution 
of height, and we may also look at Figure 2, page 280, 
which shows a familiar instance of these phenomena. 
Birds distribute themselves against the sky in the familiar 
form, when they undergo the test of flight. We wish to 
discuss in this chapter that part of the distribution which

above the average as the so-called feeble-minded are below. 
FIGuRE 2 
Showing how Figure 1 is approximated when birds are subjected to the test of flight 
(Schematic). 
The major part of our discussion will be devoted to 
the generally competent,—those who, as we say, are of 
very superior general intelligence. Psychologists have 
learned that there is a coherence of capacities in persons, 
so that one who is above average in one performance is 
able to surpass the average in most other performances, 
also. It is this fact of human nature which gives rise to 
the term, general intelligence. 
The history of the study of superior as contrasted 
with average individuals is very interesting. It dates 
back into the nineteenth century. As there were then 
no quantitative methods of measuring intelligence, the 
approach was through the study of notable achievement 
in the world’s work. This, of course, limited the study 
to adults, so that the early accounts have little to say 
about childhood. It was ascertained that eminent per- 
sons constitute a definite, small percentage of the popu- 
lation; that they are most often born in cities or on the 
estates of nobles, in long settled countries; that they have 
many more distinguished relatives than people ordi- 
narily have; and that they originate usually in families 
of superior social-economic status. 
Although little of importance has been reported con- 
cerning the childhood of eminent persons, still one stu- 
dent has made this his theme. In 1894, Yoder published 
280 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
a study of the boyhood of great men. Fifty individuals 
are included in this survey, concerning whom it appeared 
that they were, as children, healthy and interested in 
play; that they had been born over a very wide range 
of years in the reproductive life of parents; that many 
of them were ‘“‘only”’ sons; and that a decided majority 
were derived from well-to-do families. 
The methods of mental measurement now make pos- 
sible the identification of superior intelligence, during 
childhood. We can approach the study of competency 
more directly, and at an age when education is doing its 
work. General intelligence in children is classified in 
various terms. Most often, perhaps, this is at present 
done in terms of IQ (intelligence quotient), which is the 
ratio of birthday age to intellectual development, already 
referred to in Chapters IV and XIII. That a child scores 
at an IQ of 100 means that intellectual development is 
that of the average child of the given birthday age. An 
IQ of 100 represents “‘par’”’, as regards intelligence. A 
ratio of less than 100 means some degree of inferiority to 
the average, while a ratio above 100 means some degree 
of superiority. The best one per cent of children, as 
respects intelligence, test at or above 130 IQ, approxi- 
mately. It is in such children that the interest of this 
chapter centers. It is not known just how widely intelli- 
gence can vary in terms of IQ. The most intelligent 
children reported up to this time test between 180 and 
190 IQ, and are, of course, very infrequent. 
Persons who have no organized knowledge about 
children, nevertheless use typical phraseology in speaking 
of the gifted. When we hear repeatedly, from various 
people, that a given child is “‘old for his age,” “‘so reliable,”’ 
“very old-fashioned,” “‘quick to see a joke,” “youngest 
in his class,” or that he has ‘‘an old head on young shoul- 
ders,”’ or “such a long memory,” we usually find him to 
be highly intelligent, by test. The phrases used do not

of the Able THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
necessarily indicate any actual appreciation of the child’s 
quality, but are used merely to describe present perform- 
ances. That the child who is “old for his age’’ stands, 
and will continue throughout life to stand, among the 
highly intelligent of his generation, is not usually in the 
thought of those using the phrase. Also, other important 
symptoms of superior intelligence, such as very early 
interest and success in learning to read, are not popu- 
larly recognized. 
Even teachers, who are no doubt among the best 
judges of children, have very indefinite knowledge of 
what are the important symptoms of intelligence. Very 
often they fail to think of the traits just mentioned as 
significant, and make the mistake of judging as ‘‘most 
intelligent” the children who are doing good school 
work in the grade where they happen to be placed. In 
this way teachers not uncommonly may judge as “‘most 
intelligent” very dull, over-age children, doing good 
work in the lower grades. Thus, for instance, they may 
not realize that being “‘youngest in the class” is an im- 
portant symptom of superior ability. Teachers, of course, 
differ very widely among themselves in the reliability of 
their judgments. It has been shown that they are more 
accurate in their judgments of the stupid than they are 
in their judgments of the bright. 
The methods of mental measurement have demon- 
strated that in this country and abroad certain schools 
have long been segregating bright children, for instruc- 
tion, without explicit recognition of the fact. In England, 
Burt has shown that boys attending a famous preparatory 
school are intellectually gifted above the average of the 
juvenile population. In the United States, children 
attending private schools, where tuition is paid, are 
rather highly selected for mental endowment. Mental 
tests show that in many such schools the pupils have a 
median IQ of near 120, instead of a median at par (100 
282 
 
-P-A-G-E-311
  INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
IQ). These are surprising, rather than expected, findings, 
as it had been inferred that private schools might be 
hospitable to the stupid, in consideration of tuition fees. 
It seems clear that parents who are able to pay tuition 
charges have few dull children to present for schooling; 
so that wherever tuition is paid, immediately a selected 
group is obtained. 
These facts were unrealized by educators until very 
recent years, as was also the fact that pupils who succeed 
in high school are of superior intelligence. These unin- 
- tentional selections of the able are not, however, as 
severely restricted as those which we wish to consider 
here. They include children from the best fifty per cent 
of the juvenile population; whereas we wish to consider 
especially those who constitute the very best one to two 
per cent, i.e., those who test at or above 130 IQ. In terms 
of school work, this means children who are potentially 
able to pass with credit through a first-class college; and 
all who can surpass them in achievement, including those 
capable of winning highest honors in college and in the 
professions. (It is now recognized that to perform college 
work with credit requires a very high degree of intelli- 
gence.) 
How do very bright children compare with unselected 
children, in disposition? Terman has given us the most 
reliable evidence at present available on this point. He 
obtained independent ratings by parents and by teachers, 
of the character traits of bright children in California. 
The rating scale used was in five degrees, so that a rating 
of 3 would be just average, 1 being the highest rating 
possible. Consensus of parents’ opinions gave a rating 
of about 2, while teachers gave an average rating slightly 
higher for the bright children. Thus the intellectually 
able are judged by parents and by teachers to be above 
average in character. The children thus rated were those 
designated by Dr. Terman to be judged for character, 
283 Character 
and 
Tempera- 
ment
-P-A-G-E-312
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
after they had been selected as superior intellectually, 
by test. They were not selected as bright by teachers’ or 
parents’ ratings (though such ratings subsequently made 
showed that teachers and parents judged them to be 
above the average in intellect, also). 
It is of incidental interest that teachers rate bright 
children higher in all respects so far reported than their 
parents do. This is because teachers know a great variety 
of children, including the incompetent; whereas parents 
know well only their own children and those of their own 
friends, constituting usually a very restricted range of 
competency. A parent of a superior child, asked to rate 
the child in any respect, will very often give a rating of 
“average.” When asked why he thinks the child is 
average, the typical reply is, “Because he is just about 
like the rest of the family.”’ 
Expressions of opinion by other special students of 
the gifted are in agreement with Terman’s findings, with 
one exception. Miss Gillingham, of the Ethical Cul- 
ture School, in New York City, studied twenty-five 
bright children, many of whom reached the top intellec- 
tually, and she concluded that they were, on the whole, 
lazy, inaccurate, and otherwise inferior in character. It is 
possible that this group represents a selection on some 
peculiar basis, which would cause it to differ from other 
groups reported; or that the judgments expressed are on 
the basis of some unusual criterion. The only unusual 
feature of selection which appears is that the children 
were almost all Jewish, the attendance at the school 
studied being largely of Semitic origin. However, other 
groups of Jewish children have been studied (see reference 
15 in the bibliography of this Chapter) with conclusions 
which differ from those of Miss Gillingham. 
On the whole, present evidence indicates that superior 
intelligence is accompanied by superior temperament in 
children, and bysuperior stability and stamina of character. 
284

  INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
For about twenty years it has been clear that children 
who do well in school work are larger and stronger than 
those who do poor school work, age for age. This fact 
is susceptible to more than one interpretation. From it 
we might infer that superior physique is a determinant of 
school standing. Or we might infer that the intellectually 
gifted are large and strong, as a group. 
Very recently by the method of mental tests it has been 
established almost certainly that children of superior 
intelligence are commonly large and strong for their age. 
Baldwin measured children in private schools some years 
ago, and found that they exceeded the norms formerly 
secured for children in general. Since that time it has 
been demonstrated that pupils in the schools studied by 
Baldwin are of distinctly superior intelligence. Also, 
superior children in the public schools have been shown 
to be larger and stronger than their schoolmates of equal 
age. 
In New York City, in 1923 (see bibliography for this 
chapter), 45 children, all testing in the highest group for 
intellect, were compared with an equal number of children 
from the middle fifty per cent, and likewise with an 
equal number from the lowest group. Age, race, and sex 
were kept constant in all groups. The medians for the 
three groups ran as follows:

As regards the two extreme groups, the bright are 
3-3 inches taller than the stupid, as a group, and 14.5 
pounds heavier. It should be added that there is nothing 
in such results to indicate that the degree of intelligence 
depends upon the physique, or that either could be altered 
285 Size and 
Strength
-P-A-G-E-314
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
by altering the other. Also, it must be especially stressed 
that the figures pertain to the mid-point of the group, 
in each case, and that there are several individuals among 
the bright who are smaller than the median stupid child. 
These facts of overlapping between the groups preclude 
the feasibility of judging intellect from size, in an indi- 
vidual case. 
The present writer has made measurements of physical 
size on five children, who test above 180 IQ, and who are 
among the most gifted ever reported in the literature of 
child psychology. The measurements are in agreement 
with the trend just cited, and stand as follows: 
Age Height (In.) Weight (Lbs.) 
Yrs.Mo. (Norm)* (Norm)* 
Child I 8-8 52.0 (50.1) 64.7 (55.9) 
Child II 9-4 55:3 | |(g2.0)' || no20. (6118) 
Child III 9-7 53.2 (52.2) 56.5 (62.1) 
Child IV 10-2 64.0 (57.7) 76.0 (82.8) 
Child V 13-4 63.5 (58.2) 162.0 (89.5) 
These five children aggregate 17.8 inches more in 
height than would five representative children of their 
respective ages, chosen from good private schools, and 
109.4 pounds more in weight. 
Measurements of power to grip with the hand show 
that the bright children involved in the above comparisons 
are as strong in the left hand, and stronger in the right 
hand, than children of ordinary intelligence; and that 
they are stronger in both hands than the stupid. 
Figure 3, opposite page 278, illustrates the power to 
coérdinate and use muscles, of Child I, described above, 
in infancy. At the age of 11 months, this child (IQ 187) 
would amuse himself by balancing large, soft balls on his 
feet and on his hands, as he lay in his crib. The physical 
sturdiness of the child, which is typical of the bright, is 
illustrated in Figure 4, opposite page 294, and his physical 
*Baldwin’s norm, to the nearest half year. 
286

  INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
appearance and his play interests, in Figure 5, opposite 
page 294. Such children commonly learn to walk and 
to talk at a conspicuously early age. 
Although children of superior intelligence are usually 
superior in motor ability as well, teachers often rate them 
as “‘below average” in this respect. This illusion is due 
to the fact that the very bright, being youngest in their 
classes, are thus contrasted with older children in motor 
performances. Since codrdination, speed and accuracy 
in movement depend much more closely on physical 
development than they do on mental development, the 
young child appears awkward in contrast with his less 
gifted, but physically more mature, classmates. A seven- 
year-old who stands in the top quarter of seven-year-olds 
in muscular control, will nevertheless stand low among 
eight- or nine-year-olds in penmanship, industrial arts, 
or athletic games. 
As regards health, Terman again furnishes us with 
the most extensive evidence. The bright children rated 
at his request for character, were rated also for health, 
with the result that both parents and teachers rated them 
above average, as a group. 
Does a child who scores high in intellect in the early 
years of life, continue to score high as he grows up? 
There has been a widespread superstition that gifted 
children become dullards, or at most end as mediocre men 
and women, as they mature. 
Psychologists have now re-tested many children of all 
degrees of mental ability, over periods in some cases as 
long as ten years. The outcome of these researches is 
that individuals maintain very nearly the same relative 
positions during mental development, and at maturity. 
The dull remain dull, the average continue to be average, 
and the gifted maintain their superior status, as they 
grow.

  INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
It is possible, even by present imperfect methods, to 
identify at the age of six years those who as adolescents 
will stand in the highest quarter of their group for general 
intelligence. There is every indication that superior 
children grow up to be superior adults. It is the dull 
children who become our adult dullards. 
There is a set of circumstances, incident to selection 
during school life, which creates an illusion of decreasing 
brightness in superior children, as they grow older. In 
the primary grades the whole range of school children 
of an age is present, and the bright seem very bright in 
contrast. As children go on up through the grades, 
however, the dullest are constantly “left back’’; so that 
by the time high school is reached all of the extremely 
dull children have been eliminated from the comparison. 
A child of 130 IQ is a very bright member of his group 
in kindergarten; a rather bright member of his group in 
high school; and but an average member of his group in 
a first-rate college. His intellectual quality does not 
change, but his group of competitors becomes more and 
more highly selected, creating the illusion of retrogression 
on his part. 
As we proceed with this chapter, it becomes increas- 
ingly evident that many popular notions concerning gifted 
children are contrary to scientific fact. The psychologist 
finds often the very opposite condition from that popu- 
larly supposed to exist. This is partly because those 
who have no exact knowledge of a subject always tend 
to found their beliefs on wishes, and partly because popu- 
lar belief is always subject to illusions, like that described 
in the preceding paragraph. 
- Thus, it is the popular belief that the children of 
poor and obscure parents, of manual toilers, and of “the 
lowly” are those in whom great gifts are likely to be 
found. If asked where to search for the most gifted child 
in this country, persons in general would doubtless suggest 
289 Ancestry of

Children

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
that one should look among the offspring of the humble, 
and especially of farmers in the country, sprung from 
poverty. The American idea that the children of the 
humble, and especially of farmers, are likely to become 
eminent, has its origin in the early history of this country. 
From two to three hundred years ago, nearly all children 
in America (including the gifted), were born of farmers, 
and in humble surroundings. The reason for this was that 
there were as yet no cities to exercise a selective influence, 
so that nearly all inhabitants lived perforce ‘“‘in the 
country.” This was still quite true even down to a 
hundred years ago. 
Prolonged studies of the origin of very gifted children 
in this country, born since goo, have been confined largely 
to cities. They have shown repeatedly that the great 
majority of these children originate in families where 
the father is a professional man, an owner or executive in 
business, or a clerical worker. Only a small minority of 
children testing in the highest group for intellect, orig- 
inate among the manual workers in cities, in the United 
States (where the social-economic competition is relatively 
free for all). There are various possible interpretations 
of this fact, but the inference most favored by all sub- 
sidiary facts is that the very intelligent are those who 
rise in the world by competition, and who are also able 
to produce children like themselves. 
In fact, it has been proved again and again that ability 
“runs in families.” There is a marked resemblance 
among brothers and sisters in mental tests, and a still 
more marked resemblance between those who are twins. 
The brothers and sisters, or the siblings, as they are 
sometimes called, of gifted children are themselves very 
superior, as a group. As an illustration of this fact may 
be cited an investigation recently made in New York 
City (see reference 11 in bibliography). The brothers 
and sisters of the bright children, whose physical measure- 
290
-P-A-G-E-319
  INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
ments we have described, were given mental tests. The 
children originally selected by tests had an average IQ 
of 151. Their brothers and sisters yielded an average 
IQ of 128. All but two of them tested above “par,” and 
of those one tested just at “par” (100 IQ), and the other 
close to “par” (96 IQ). This is a very striking result 
when we remember that of unselected children, half of 
the brothers and sisters will fall at or below “‘par’’ in 
mental tests (see Figure 1, p. 279). Mental tests of twenty 
first cousins of these same children yielded an average IQ 
as high as that of the siblings. Their parents, too, have 
met with sagacity the mental tests administered by life, 
as is proved by their excellent social-economic status. 
Furthermore, gifted children have a disproportionately 
large number of eminent persons among their adult 
relatives. For instance, among the close relatives of the 
five children, to whom we have already referred as testing 
above 180 IQ, the writer of this chapter has counted 
forty persons, who were writers, judges, inventors, foun- 
ders of institutions, governors, noted scholars, officers of 
high rank in army or navy, distinguished surgeons, 
priests, or rabbis. The chances are very slight that a child 
picked at random from the population will have even 
one adult relative of the distinction of the forty attached 
to the family trees of these very gifted children. 
It remains to be added that the parents of superior 
children produce very small families. Apparently the 
extremely able will not choose the biological and economic 
burdens of repeated reproduction. This is a psychological 
fact which is interesting for the national future. 
It has been stated that the census of the gifted has so 
far been confined largely to centers of population. We 
do not know to what extent children in the top quarter of 
intellect are to be found on farms in this generation. 
We do know, however, that where rural children have been 
tested at random, in this country, they yield a somewhat 
291
-P-A-G-E-320
  Some 
Individual 
Cases THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
lower average intelligence than city children yield. From 
this fact we should expect that the country now yields 
relatively few very gifted children to the thousand. From 
tests made in the county of Northumberland, in England, 
Thomson concluded that “the highest ability appears to 
be found close to the cities and far away from the cities, 
the intermediate areas having fewer cases of high ability, 
as though they were drained by selection.” 
In order to make our discussion somewhat more con- 
crete at this point, it will be useful to consider a few 
individual examples. The following are cases chosen at 
random from a great many on record: 
A is a little girl ten years of age. Her IQ on repeated 
annual tests has stood at yi 148, 145. Her school work 
has been excellent, from kindergarten onward. At the 
age of five years she entered the first grade on her own 
initiative. Children are expected to be six years old 
before entering first grade, but A, who had entered kinder- 
garten at four years of age, presented herself to the 
teacher of first grade at the opening of the following 
school year, with the statement that she had finished the 
kindergarten. She was taken on trial, and made one of 
the best records in the class during the year. A has always 
gone to private schools. Her father is a university 
professor, and her mother is a college graduate. She has 
one brother, whose school record is superior. 
B is an eight-year-old boy. He has a serious defect of 
the eyes, as a result of which he has never had more than 
a small fraction of normal vision. Parents and teachers 
wondered how he could learn so much when he could 
see so little, and brought him for examination. His IQ 
was found to be 156. Both the mother and the father of 
B are college graduates. His brothers have school records 
which indicate that they are of superior intelligence. 
But none of them has shown the “mental grasp” which 
characterizes B, despite his sual handicap. 
292 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
C is a girl ten years of age, first recognized as bright 
when a survey was being made in a certain school district, 
to discover children of exceptional intelligence. Her IQ 
has stood at 164 on two tests made several years apart. 
Neither of her parents is educated, the father being 
employed in a tailor’s shop. ‘They are immigrants. 
C’s home surroundings are those of a typical tenement, 
in the city slums. Her sister and two brothers all test 
above the average intellectually. This case represents 
the few instances in which an extremely gifted child is 
found with uneducated parents, in a poor home. Such 
children prove that the intellectual ability revealed by 
tests does not come from home surroundings. It is not 
possible to observe the family in this case beyond the 
parents, as other relatives live in Europe. 
D is an eleven-year-old boy, who tests at 167 IQ. 
He is very large for his age, and of exceptional firmness 
and stability of character. His father is an army officer 
of high rank, and his mother is a college graduate. He is 
one of seven children, only one other of whom has had 
mental tests. This sister’s IQ has stood at 189 and 188 
on two tests made a year apart. There are many eminent 
relatives on both sides of D’s family. His parents had not 
thought of him as very exceptional. 
These cases serve to represent the group of gifted chil- 
dren in our schools. Since about one in every 250 children 
is as bright as Child A here described, it is evident that 
among millions of school children there are many of 
this calibre to be found. The higher the intelligence, 
the rarer the child, of course, as may be recalled by 
glancing back at Figure 1, p. 279, in this chapter. Of the 
cases described, A, B, and D are typical of the bright, as 
regards occupation of parents, and other social condi- 
tions. Child C is very exceptional in this respect. 
Child B is exceptional in having a severe visual defect, 
and has been mentioned here especially to show that

intelligence does not depend upon perfection of the 
special senses. 
Experi- For a considerable number of years there have been 
siiebegan consciously attempted selections of the most capable 
ciate? children in our schools, for purposes of education. In 
the oo 1919 Freeman sent a questionnaire to all cities in this 
country of 25,000 population or over, inquiring as to 
special provision for the gifted. He learned that a 
considerable number of school administrators recognized 
the existence of gifted children, and attempted to provide 
for their special needs, usually by establishing special 
classes for rapid advancement. In several instances the 
work was on a sufficiently modern basis, so that mental 
tests were used to select the children. Most recent in- 
formation on this point will be found in the forthcoming 
publication of The National Society for the Study of 
Education (see reference 11, Chapter XIV, Bibliography). 
Among the first of the classes to be selected by mental 
tests was that reported by Race in 1918, from Louisville, 
Kentucky. Here several young children with a median 
IQ of 137 were segregated, and made very rapid progress, 
covering the prescribed curriculum of the elementary 
school at about twice the ordinary rate, without more 
than ordinary effort. Race found them to be healthy, 
well-balanced, and capable of work much beyond the 
average. 
In the years following 1918, several detailed reports 
of similar work appeared, among which those of Whipple, 
of Specht, and of Coy are of particular interest. All of 
these class-room experiments showed that children se- 
lected as very intelligent by mental tests are capable of 
much greater progress in school than is possible for them 
under ordinary conditions. The influence of such studies 
is already felt to some extent, in educational administra- 
tion. For instance, at the Conference on Educational 
Research and Guidance, held at San Jose, California,

  INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
in 1922, Dickson stated that during the year just passed, 
about 11 per cent of children in the elementary schools of 
Berkeley and Oakland had been given special opportunity 
suited to their superior endowment. 
Class-room experimentation with highly endowed chil- 
dren has been reported since 1916 in Germany from 
Berlin, Hamburg, Breslau, Mannheim, Leipsic, Frankfort, 
Charlottenburg, and Géttingen particularly. In Ger- 
many, as in this country, this work has gone forward in 
cities, because it is only in centers of population that a 
sufficient number of the very gifted can be found con- 
veniently located to form special classes. The desirability 
of identifying the gifted who live in rural communities 
has been discussed with urgency in Germany, where the 
need to foster that nation’s mental power is now very 
great. No solution of this administrative problem has 
yet been found. 
After the World War, republican Germany abandoned 
the policy of educating children according to the social- 
economic status of their parents. To find and to train the 
gifted, wherever existing, was seen to be a primary condi- 
tion of national rehabilitation. As there are many 
educational psychologists in Germany, the work of select- 
ing the Hofnungskinder (children of promise) has pro- 
ceeded rapidly and systematically. It is probable that 
to-day Germany is giving more official administrative 
recognition to special education on the basis of innate 
mental endowment than any other country. 
_ In the majority of reports it appears that the selection 
of pupils is made by mental tests, supplemented by 
teachers’ judgments as to strength of character and 
physical stamina. Germany cannot afford special educa- 
tion for those strong in intellect only. The child must 
be strong in every way to warrant the investment. 
Children annually or semi-annually selected thus from 
the Volksschulen, are given a special course of study in

the last years of the elementary school, to articulate with 
the higher schools. Both boys and girls participate in 
these special advantages, but in some cities only half as 
many girls as boys are permitted to be chosen. The 
psychologists, Peter and Stern, have pointed out that 
in the tests used for selection, the girls equal the boys 
in performance, and that this raises questions of policy 
concerning the education of girls, which are, perhaps, 
especially distressing in view of German traditions of 
education. 
Countries abroad other than Germany seem to be 
doing little or no class-room experimentation to find 
the best education for the gifted. At any rate, such ex- 
periments are not reported in their literature. 
It was said previously in this chapter that the multi- 
tude of man’s abilities for performance cohere as regards 
amount; there is no biological law of compensation, 
whereby a person who is gifted in one respect is usually 
inferior in other respects. People like to suppose that 
there may be such a law, because if there were, the 
human idea of fair play in nature would be satisfied. 
Biological nature, however, does not behave according 
to our ideas of justice. The mentally superior person 
tends to be superior in all respects (even in physique, 
as shown in preceding paragraphs in this chapter), but 
there are a few exceptions to this rule of coherence among 
abilities. Psychologists have discovered at least two 
talents which do not seem to have much relation to 
ability in general. These are talent for drawing and 
talent for music. A child stupid in other respects may 
excel in music or in representative drawing, and similarly 
a child who is very bright may be specially defective in 
these respects. Talent in representative drawing appar- 
ently arises from a happy combination of a great many 
variable functions which are specialized. Likewise, 
musical talent arises from a fortunate combination of 
296 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
    
INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
highly specialized abilities, which may occur in children 
otherwise dull, or may be deficient in children of superior 
intelligence. 
Few surveys have been made to show how ability in 
drawing and ability in music are distributed among 
school children. Such as have been undertaken in music 
yield the familiar form (see Figure 1, page 279), and show 
a very great range of musical sensitivity. The most 
extensive work in this field has been done in the State 
of Iowa, by Seashore and his students. 
A few surveys of ability to draw have also been made. 
In Berlin, at the present time, when the semi-annual 
.Begabtenprufung is held, a test of talent in drawing is 
also made, so that children gifted in this special way may 
receive training in the school of design. 
The most conspicuous problem of those interested in 
rational education for exceptionally intelligent children 
is now, perhaps, that of the curriculum. What should 
they be taught? By whom? With what goals in view? 
The problem is no longer one of selection primarily, but 
of instruction. Should all children who test very high 
as regards intellect, be educated for science, for the pro- 
fessions, and for the direction of industry? Should 
society induce some of them to join the manual trades, 
as hand workers? Should unskilled labor be drained by 
educational policy more thoroughly than it now is 
drained by competition, of all first-rate intelligence? 
These are disturbing questions of consequence, which 
affect the educator. 
Questions somewhat more immediate, and less com- 
pletely philosophical in nature, concern the relative 
claims of rapid advancement as against enrichment of 
curriculum for the gifted. These questions are in some 
of their aspects susceptible to experimentation, but they 
have not been so approached as yet. Educational specula- 
tion seems, on the whole, to favor enrichment of the

curriculum, but there is no agreement as to what the 
additional subject matter should be. In 1923 a report 
appeared (see reference 1, bibliography) of the selection 
of a class of young children, organized for the purpose of 
experimenting in the class room with curricular material 
adapted for the needs of the very intelligent. This class 
is being continued at the present time. 
The objection is sometimes raised that special educa- 
tion for the bright is not suitable in a democracy, where 
all are equal. The obvious reply to this is that all are 
not equal in capacity. The biological truth is that all 
are unequal. Schools cannot equalize children; schools 
can only equalize opportunity. It may well be thought 
to be highly undemocratic to provide full opportunity 
for the exercise of their capacities to some, while to 
others the same offering means only partial exercise of 
their powers. It is hard for a psychologist to define 
democracy, but perhaps one acceptable definition might 
be that it is a condition of affairs, in which every human 
being has opportunity to live and work in accordance with 
inborn capacity for achievement. 
For convenience, we may now recapitulate briefly 
the important facts which have been established during 
the past twenty years, concerning intellectually gifted 
children. Mental tests, given to large numbers of un- 
selected children, yield always a few who attain superior 
rank. “In various localities studies have been made of 
those ranking in the highest percentile, that is, of ‘‘the 
one child in a hundred,” by_test. These studies show 
that such children are usually youngest in their classes, 
though still much below the point where they could 
readily function, in the ordinary graded school, They 
learn very rapidly, and progress more than twice as fast 
as average children_can, when they are segregated in 
special classes. They are large and strong for their age, 
as a group, and are superior in character and tempera-

ment. | They maintain their superior status, as they de- 
velop, and do not tend to become mediocre, as has been 
popularly supposed. / The majority of them originate 
(in America, where social-economic competition is rela- 
tively free for all) in families where the fathers are 
professional men, clerical workers, or business executives, 
and they have many more distinguished persons among 
their relatives than chance would allow. Very few ex- 
tremely gifted children originate among manual laborers, 
in cities where investigation has gone forward. 
Educational policy in the United States at present 
gives scant consideration to these children, because the 
current social philosophy of the people denies the existence 
of innate, permanent, hereditary superiority. To them 
are assigned, in general, the same tasks as are assigned 
to average children; with the result that they manage, 
on the whole, to win an occasional extra promotion, though 
practically never to an extent that would permit them 
to work at full capacity. 
As the new knowledge gleaned from mental tests 
becomes gradually diffused, the social philosophy which 
disregards the existence of the superior will undergo 
changes. Already progressive educators here and there 
are applying the new knowledge in educational adminis- 
tration. They are experimenting with new methods of 
teaching the gifted, and are trying to formulate additional 
studies for them,—trying to provide genuine opportunity 
for these children. As a result of such psychological and 
educational research, we shall soon have as much accumu- 
lated knowledge about the gifted as we have about the 
deficient, and shall be in position to do justice to the 
competent as well as to the incompetent.

THE ADOLESCENT PERIOD; ITS PROBLEMS, REGIMEN, 
AND HYGIENE 
HE period of adolescence is the period during 
B pe a child is developed into an adult. This 
period is variable in length and in the age of its 
onset or beginning. Some children manifest the begin- 
nings of adolescence as early as the tenth year, while 
others show no signs of the onset until they reach the 
fifteenth or sixteenth year; but these are extremes. A 
great majority of children show the beginnings of adoles- 
cence at twelve, thirteen or fourteen for girls; or at 
thirteen, fourteen or fifteen for boys. 
There is a marked difference in this matter of the 
time of onset of adolescence in different races. The 
Mediterranean nations show a distinctly earlier beginning 
of adolescence than is found among the Nordic nations. 
For instance, girls of Italy may enter puberty as early as 
nine or ten years of age, and usually begin adolescence 
definitely as early as the eleventh year; while girls of the 
far north in Europe seldom enter adolescence before the 
age of thirteen, and most of them do not become adoles- 
cent before fourteen or fifteen. 
In America there is such a mixing of peoples through 
intermarriage of Nordic and Mediterranean nationalities 
that one is not surprised to find that a large proportion 
of girls the country over enter puberty during the thir- 
teenth year. 
As to boys, there seems to be a similar difference in 
the age at which puberty begins in those of Mediterranean 
as compared with those of Nordic nations. However, 
300 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
  ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
the definite date of beginning of puberty in boys is more 
difficult to determine, because they do not experience 
any definite, easily-apparent function like the menstrual 
period of the girl. 
While Italian, Greek, and Spanish boys become 
adolescent at twelve to fourteen and Scandinavian boys 
at fourteen to sixteen, the mixed nationalities in America 
show an average age of onset of about fourteen, and a 
large proportion of American boys enter puberty during 
the fourteenth year.’ 
In the above paragraphs the terms puberty and 
adolescence have been used apparently interchangeably; 
but while the onset of puberty and adolescence coincide 
in time, the term puberty is properly applied to the period 
of three or four years during which a youth becomes 
thoroughly established in the development and func- 
tioning of the sex apparatus. This period of puberty 
occupies the first three or four years of the adolescent 
period. The terms puberty and adolescence are therefore 
not synonymous. Adolescence is the longer period and 
includes the three-year period of puberty as well as a 
four or five-year post-puberty period. The following 
diagram indicates the age limits of the five “‘ages” or 
periods from birth to maturity:

The post-puberty phase of adolescence is devoted to 
the maturing physical organs and tissues and the training 
of their powers; so that by the time a young man reaches 
twenty-two and a young woman reaches twenty we expect 
them to show full maturity of every organ and of every 
physical and mental power.

Pre- 
Adolescence 
Differences 
between 
Boys and 
Girls THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
It will contribute much to the clearness of our under- 
standing of adolescence if we have a clear picture of the 
boy and girl before they cross the threshold into adoles- 
cence. 
There is a well-defined period or stage of development 
preceding adolescence that is called the pre-adolescent 
or pre-puberty stage of development. The period lasts 
three or four years and extends, roughly speaking, from 
ten to fourteen in boys and from nine to thirteen in girls. 
It seems to be a general law of nature that the transi- 
tion from one stage or phase of life to the next is never a 
sudden one, showing rapid and extreme changes; rather 
nature’s transitions are almost always very gradual. 
We can, therefore, get a clearer picture of the typical 
pre-adolescent by picturing a boy of twelve and a girl of 
eleven than by picturing a boy of fourteen and a girl of 
thirteen, or a boy of ten and a girl of nine. In other 
words, we get the most accurate picture by selecting a 
subject from the middle of the period. 
The boy of twelve is usually not appreciably larger 
than the girl of eleven; and as was demonstrated by 
H. P. Bowditch, of Harvard University Medical School, 
about 34 years ago, the measurements and general appear- 
ance of the boy and girl above mentioned are strikingly 
alike. They are quite apt to be interested in similar sports 
and games and to enter vigorously into them without any 
marked differences between the two as to activity and 
efficiency. The twelve-year-old girl is almost sure to 
be superior to the twelve-year-old boy in active sports 
and larger than he in all her physical measurements. 
However, despite physical and functional similarities 
between the boy and girl of the mid pre-adolescent period, 
there are some interesting temperamental differences. 
Boys are almost sure to be interested in pets;—as rabbits, 
guinea pigs, dogs, goats, ponies, etc. Girls are much less 
interested in live pets; their interest is in dolls. The 
302 
   
-P-A-G-E-333
ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
boys are interested in such activities as scouting, fishing, 
trapping, camping—in short, in woods-lore and water-lore 
in general. Girls of this age are far more interested in 
playing house, “‘going calling” and in giving doll parties. 
One interesting phase of pre-adolescence is that while 
there is a definite sex consciousness there is not a recipro- 
cal sex attraction. The boy thinks of the girl as “girl,” 
but he does not seek close social relations; in fact, both 
boys and girls of this age are very unsocial toward each 
other. If one wishes to spoil a boy’s birthday party just 
invite some ‘‘nice little girls” to come. By the same 
mark, if one wishes to spoil a little girl’s birthday party, 
just ask some “rough, blundering boys” to come. 
Boys of this age are almost sure to exhibit thoughtless 
cruelty, as, for example, pulling the wings from butter- 
flies to see how they can navigate without them, or pulling 
the legs from grasshoppers with a similar object in view, 
or robbing a bird’s nest to add the eggs to their collections. 
Furthermore, boys of this age are very likely to drift 
or to be led easily into vulgarity. As the cruelty of the 
boy is due to his thoughtlessness, similarly his vulgarity 
is due to ignorance. He is not inherently either cruel 
or vulgar; he simply does not think things through. In 
short, the boy is a young barbarian. As to morals, he is 
unmoral, rather than zmmoral. As to social instincts, he 
is unsocial rather than anti-social. 
Having sketched the outlines of a picture of the 
typical pre-adolescent, let us now do the same for the 
adolescent. As there was an advantage found in selecting 
a mid pre-adolescent for our picture, so it will be advan- 
tageous to select a mid-adolescent, say a seventeen-year- 
old youth and a sixteen-year-old maiden. This youth 
and maiden are probably in the third or fourth year at 
high school. Physically, the youth has made a remarkable 
growth in the five years since we last observed him. 
He is perhaps five feet and eight inches in height, broad- 
303 Adolescent

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
shouldered, deep-chested, hard-muscled and fiery-eyed ,— 
a good all-around athlete. He must use a razor at least 
three or four times a week to keep his beard in order. 
He is much more likely than his sister to be interested in 
mechanics, electricity, radio, and in the mechanism and 
running of autos and motor boats, in canoeing and sailing, 
in hunting with gun and dog and in fishing with rod and 
reel. 
He is socially not only quite conscious of the femi- 
ninity of his girl classmate and associate in school, but 
he wishes to associate with her. This wish is evidently 
reciprocated. There is at this age not only sex conscious- 
ness but also reciprocal sex attraction. 
Morally the mid-adolescent youth has experienced an 
awakening; he is no longer unmoral; either he is definitely 
and positively moral and ethical or he is definitely and 
positively immoral and unethical. The reason for this 
moral consciousness is in all probability due to the fact 
that the youth of seventeen is beginning to be thoughtful, 
and in his thinking of things that he observes, he reaches 
logical (or near-logical) conclusions; and he is acquiring 
a tendency to shape his line of action in accordance with 
the conclusion which he has reached. 
The maiden of sixteen is now quite definitely a young 
lady. Her figure is attractive as a rule and she is graceful 
in her movements. Her measurements, as shown in the 
study by Bowditch referred to in a foregoing paragraph, 
and also demonstrated by W. W. Hastings (Manual of 
Physical Measurements, 1902), show a remarkable modi- 
fication. She is perhaps five feet, three inches in height; 
her pelvic measurements are, relative to her other girths 
and diameters, much increased. Also the girth and depth 
of chest at the fifth rib level are greatly increased rela- 
tively because of the development of the breast. Her 
head is adorned with a wealth of glossy hair. 
Mentally, she is likely to be especially interested in 
304
-P-A-G-E-335
ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
music, art, and the domestic arts and crafts. Morally, 
she is likely to have high ideals and altruistic motives. 
Socially, she is sensitively conscious of her femininity 
and the virility and manhood of her young men acquaint- 
ances and friends, and is happy to meet with them socially. 
Contrasting the typical mid pre-adolescent with the 
typical mid-adolescent of each sex, we note that a remark- 
able change has taken place. The boy has become a 
young man, and the girl a young woman. The young 
man is typically man; the young woman is typically 
woman. The young man could father a child, the 
young woman could mother a child. Each one is sexually 
mature. 
What has wrought this remarkable change? 
It has been known for thousands of years that if the 
sex glands be removed from a young male of any of the 
higher mammals, the male so treated does not develop 
the physical and psychical qualities typical of the male. 
In the orient in ancient times, most of the males of the 
domesticated animals were castrated or surgically de- 
prived of the sex glands,—of the testes or gonads. The 
reader is probably familiar with the frequent references 
in history and literature to the eunuch, who is simply 
a male from whom the gonads have been surgically 
removed. 
One would think that in the long ago men would have 
thought the matter through and would have concluded 
that the gonads must produce some substance which, 
absorbed into the system and distributed through it, 
cause the development of the qualities and attributes 
distinctive of virility. Removing the gonads, thus depriv- 
ing the organism of the influence of the glands, would 
profoundly influence development. But if anyone thought 
the matter through he did not make any experiments 
and describe them; for it was not until late in the nine- 
teenth century that it began to dawn upon the minds of 
305 What Has

a Woman

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
biologists and physiologists that glandular tissue prepares, 
not only the external secretion with which everyone is 
familiar, but also a secretion that is poured back into the 
lymph and blood and distributed throughout the body 
to exert an activating and controlling influence upon 
ar development and function. 
It would take us too far afield to detail the epoch- 
making pioneer work of Brown-Sequard! in France, of 
Poehl? and Zoth* in Germany. The best summary of the 
earlier investigations of internal secretions from the gonad 
glands came from the pen of Prof. Francis H. A. Marshall? 
and is entitled the Physiology of Reproduction. 
It was early discovered that there are several glandular 
bodies that prepare internal secretions; for example, the 
thyroids prepare such a substance, early called Jodo- 
Thyrin; the adrenals prepare Adrenalin; the pituitary 
gland prepares Pituitrin. The literature has become 
voluminous and scores of investigators for two decades 
have devoted much of their time and the resources of 
great university laboratories to discover the wonderful 
secrets that lie at the foundation of life. 
Prof. Shaefer,® the English Histo-Physiologist, wrote 
the best summary of these researches that had appeared 
to date (1914). 
We now call these internal secretions Hormones. 
They are thought of as ‘‘Life-ferments”. These Hormones 
are very complex nitrogenous bodies. Poehl’s second 
publication, 1894, gives the composition of Spermin, 
which was thought to be the Hormone of the testes, as 
C; H,, N2; and Dr. G. Stanley Hall® remarked about it in 
1904,—‘‘Spermin is perhaps the most complex of all 
things in the organic world’’; but we have found that 
these Hormones are very much more complex than

Poehl’s formula would suggest. As a matter of fact it 
is now quite certain that Poehl’s method of analysis de- 
composed the Hormone from the testes, and that sper- 
min, as he wrote its formula and as he isolated it from 
testicular extracts, is only a small portion of the real 
Hormone. 
® What does this all mean? Simply, that recent re- 
searches have demonstrated that the gonad glands of 
both male and female prepare a Hormone or “‘Life- 
ferment” that, absorbed into the lymph and blood, dis- 
tributed by the lymph and blood all over the body, causes 
the development of all those physical and psychical quali- 
ties distinctive of virility or femininity, as the case may 
be. This being true, the removal of the gonad glands 
(the testicles or the ovaries) deprives the body of the 
Hormone that is necessary for its typical development and 
we have the fatted steer instead of the fighting bull; 
the plodding gelding instead of the prancing stallion; 
the cringing, flabby-muscled eunuch instead of the 
courageous, hard-muscled man. 
Removal of the ovaries of a young girl causes her to 
fall short pitiably from the development of ideal, typical 
womanhood. The effect of castration of the female is as 
profound and far reaching as in the case of the male. 
Having now determined the cause of the remarkable 
development of the youth or maiden into the typical 
adult, let us note the outstanding features of that develop- 
ment. At the threshold of adolescence, the boy of four- 
teen begins to receive this Hormone above discussed from 
his gonad glands. No one has yet determined the amount 
of the Hormone that is taken into the blood from these 
glands, but certain it is that there is only a small quantity, 
perhaps a drop or two in a twenty-four hour period. We 
have every reason to believe that this Hormone passes 
into the blood continuously, night and day, from the 
onset of the period of adolescence or #he- threshold of 
307 Physical

of the 
Boy

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
puberty to the beginning of senescence or old age. 
The first noticeable result of its influence on the boy’s 
development is conspicuous increase in height. If he has 
been growing, say two inches a year during pre-adoles- 
cence, he is likely to add three or perhaps four inches in 
one year to his stature and an equal amount to his stretch 
of arms. This increase of stature is fairly symmetrical 
and there is a proportional increase in all his skeletal 
dimensions. Similarly, there is a rapid growth notice- 
able in his muscular system. This growth makes itself 
evident in the girth of his arms and legs especially. 
It was discovered some thirty years ago by those who 
were making a careful study of physical growth that this 
growth presents two interesting features. First, the incre- 
ment of growth presents a rhythmic advance; for example, 
the boy who during his fifteenth year adds three inches 
to his growth is practically certain to add a smaller incre- 
ment during his sixteenth year (say two inches) and a 
larger one again during his seventeenth year, perhaps 
another three-inch growth, then to drop to a one or two 
inch addition to his stature during his eighteenth and 
nineteenth years. This rhythmicity of growth was demon- 
strated by the writer in a long series of observations of 
boys of an eastern school, through a number of years, 
taking two measurements a year of the same boys; 
many hundreds of the boys having presented themselves 
for as many as six or eight successive measurements 
during the years of their most rapid development.! 
Another feature that has been discovered is that during 
the period of especially rapid height-growth, there is a 
distinct relative decrease of girth increment. This 
phenomenon was discovered during the study of the 
school boys above referred to. In popular terms, one 
might say that boys shoot up and then spread out, only 
to shoot up a second time and spread out again, there

ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
being two definite waves of growth in both frame and 
muscles during adolescence, the crest of the skeletal wave 
alternating with the crest of the muscle increment wave. 
As a part of the physical development of the adolescent 
youth, there is a proportionate growth of all the internal 
organs and systems of organs, as for example, the lungs 
and respiratory system, the heart and circulatory system, 
the liver, stomach, and digestive system. The rapid 
growth of these internal organs fills the trunk, which 
has naturally greatly increased in all its dimensions. 
In the realm of physical development there is a re- 
markable increase in hair-growth. This manifests itself 
not only in the growth of the beard which, by the way, 
is likely to be in evidence only slightly before the end 
of puberty; but early in puberty the pubic hair as well 
as hair in other localities comes clearly into evidence. 
Another noticeable change that comes at the thresh- 
old of puberty is the change of voice. The high-pitched, 
thin treble of the boy becomes the deep, sonorous 
base or the clear, ringing tenor of the man. 
At the threshold of adolescence, the girl of thirteen 
begins to receive from her gonad glands (ovaries) the 
Hormone distinctive of the human female. Her response 
to the influence of this Hormone that is circulating 
throughout her system is parallel, step by step, to the 
response which the male of the species shows, as described 
above. By the time she is sixteen, we expect her to 
show the physical and psychical characteristics that were 
described above for the mid-adolescent girl. Inthemaiden 
as in the youth, physical development predominates 
during puberty, while psychical development, maturity, 
and training predominate during the post-puberty stage 
of adolescence. By the time the young woman is twenty 
years of age we expect her to be mature in all those 
qualities that are distinctive of typical womanhood.

  Nature’s 
General 
Plan THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
Nature is preparing in the adolescent a home builder. 
She is preparing in the young man an individual who 
can support and protect not only himself but also a 
family. She is preparing in the young woman, one who 
possesses the charm requisite for society and the skill and 
resourcefulness necessary for a wife and mother in a home. 
As a part of nature’s plan, the typical adolescent 
begins early in that period of development to experience 
sex urge—i. e., a strong desire to possess and to mate 
with one of the opposite sex. The purpose of this sex 
urge in the economy of nature is evident. But for sex 
urge the young male of the species would not seek to 
mate with the female and similarly the female of the species 
would not accept the advances of the male or wish to 
mate with him. Apparently, this sex urge is a primor- 
dal necessity and we see it manifested among all higher 
animals, especially in mammals and birds and it may 
exist in lower ranks of animals. 
Now, if the youth and maiden experience sex urge and 
are conscious of this desire years before it will be feasible 
and proper, in our present social structure, to wed and 
start their home-building and family life, how will this 
influence their lives and how will it influence society? 
Manifestly, the youth must from the first control 
this sex urge. Failure to control would lead to unwhole- 
somely early mating or to illicit sex relations out of wed- 
lock, either of which would be sure to lead to unfortunate 
results. It is perfectly evident as we study nature that 
the youth and maiden must control their sex urge. 
They must live in purity and chastity—the continent life. 
This is the ideal condition which we should seek to bring 
about. During unmarried youth the ideal life is conti- 
nent life. 
After maturity is reached the ideal social relationship 
_ of the sexes is monogamous wedlock, to which relationship 
both parties should live in absolute fidelity. 
310 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
Failure to control sex urge has led to what we recog- 
nize as the social evil. Social wrong living may manifest 
itself in various ways. For example, in illicit relations;— 
in libertinism, in prostitution, in adultery, in fornication, 
etc. The result of illicit and promiscuous sex relation- 
ships is a tragic spread of venereal disease which destroys 
the health and efficiency of individuals, chokes the family 
happiness, and leads often to degeneration and death, 
blotting out more families than any other cause of family 
extinction. 
One of the sad results of illicit sex relations is the 
birth of children out of wedlock, which introduces into 
society the problem of the illegitimate child and the un- 
married mother. 
Still another phase of lack of control of sex urge is 
seen in the habit which is widespread especially among 
early adolescents, namely, the habit of sel/-abuse or 
masturbation. ‘This habit, as a matter of fact, is very 
frequently begun in the period of pre-adolescence and not 
a few cases come to the attention of physicians in which 
even little children indulge the act. The writer is led to 
believe from his long study of these problems of child- 
hood and youth that the activating motive of self-abuse 
in the child is quite different from that in the youth. 
The two most prevalent causes of self-abuse in children of 
the pre-adolescent or earlier age are: first, wncleanness of 
the person. Mothers and caretakers of little children 
frequently neglect the proper care and attention that 
should be given to insure the absolute cleanliness of the 
sex apparatus. The male child particularly is not at all 
easily kept in the condition desirable unless he has been 
circumcised. The writer has for many years urged 
parents to circumcise every boy during his infancy. If 
the baby boy is not circumcised, accumulating secretions 
are likely to cause local irritation and discomfort. The 
child instinctively attempts to allay the local discomfort

by rubbing his organs. In that way many boys drift 
into the habit of self-abuse. Little children of both sexes 
must be kept clean and must be taught cleanly habits. 
The second prevalent cause of this unfortunate habit 
is to be found in the deliberate teaching of the habit to 
innocent little children by older associates, either play- 
mates or sometimes nurse girls. The wise mother may 
protect her child against this wrong teaching only through 
a most vigilant watching and supervision of the child’s 
associations and play; and even despite a great vigilance 
it is not at all infrequent for children to be led into the 
habit. 
One element that should be considered in this problem 
is the fact that during pre-adolescence the child is going 
through a period of vulgarity. Vulgarity seems to be a 
part of our heritage from barbarism. The barbarian boy 
seems to be inherently vulgar; or if not precisely that, we 
all must admit that if ever a boy may easily drift into, 
or be easily led into, vulgarity in thought, language, and 
habits, those are the crucial years. It is because of this 
mental attitude more than anything else that the pre- 
adolescent child, perhaps especially the boy, is so ex- 
tremely likely to acquire the habit of self-abuse. The 
writer is convinced from a study of responses to a ques- 
tionnaire which he sent out among college men fifteen 
years ago, that at least go% of the boys from even our 
most careful families indulge for a shorter or longer 
time, perhaps for a few weeks only, in this habit. 
Whether the habit is as prevalent among pre- 
adolescent and early adolescent girls as among boys the 
writer does not know positively from reliable researches; 
but he has been led to believe that it is far less prevalent 
among little girls who live the ordinary, family life, as 
members of a typical home than among boys. However, 
matrons of institutions for girls say that from time to time, 
that is, every few months, or every year or two, the coming 
312
-P-A-G-E-343
  ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
into their circle of a girl who has the habit will lead to a 
rapid acquiring of the habit by several or many of the 
girls of the institution. 
In the adolescent the habit may be started to satisfy 
sex urge, or it may be continued from childhood as a 
habit, in which latter case the hold of the habit is made 
very much firmer by the sex urge of adolescence. 
Those of us who have given years of study and atten- 
tion to these problems of the life of the individual, the 
family, the community and the State, come early in our 
study to be convinced that the social problem—the prob- 
lem of right social relationships between men and women 
in human society—will never be solved and society 
brought back to or brought up to the condition which we 
recognize as ideal until children and young people are 
taught in home and school the sacred truths of life. The 
writer would formulate two general principles that may 
well govern us in this instruction of youth. 
1. The instruction that is to form the basis of habits 
during adolescence and subsequent years must be begun 
in early childhood and in pre-adolescence, and should 
continue during puberty. 
2. The instruction must be positive and constructive; 
—i.e., it must be such that high ideals of life will be firmly 
established. In other words, if nature is to score a great 
success in her preparation of the home-builder and family 
maker, this preparation must begin in early childhood, 
must be continued as a definite unfolding of life lessons, 
and must establish right habits, high ideals, and aspira- 
tions. 
Some of the fundamentals that must be established 
are: 
1. A recognition of the sacredness of life; 
2. Arecognition of the sacredness of motherhood; 
3. A recognition of the sacredness of the family 
circle, and of fatherhood;

_4. A recognition of the sacredness of the body 
as the temple of womanhood or of manhood. 
5. Establishing wholesome thought, habits,— 
modesty in our daughters,—chivalry in our sons; 
6. Establishing hygienic habits which will be 
conducive to the development of perfect physique 
and the maintenance of perfect health. 
The fundamentals above enumerated should be estab- 
lished in the order in which they are written, the first two 
imparted during early childhood, the second two (3 and 
4) during the pre-adolescence period, and the last two 
(5 and 6) during puberty. 
The child of five to seven years is almost sure to go 
to mother with a question about life,—the origin of life, 
asking: ‘“‘Mother where did you get me,—where did I 
come from?” Or, “Mother how did the baby come?” 
The mother must answer it truthfully. Let her tell 
nature’s plan, in a spirit of reverence; and in telling how 
the new life comes, the mother should reveal to the ques- 
tioning child the fact that the mother sacrifices much for 
the new life. The child will be impressed with a feeling 
of the sacredness of life and of motherhood, and will be 
held to mother by a bond of confidence and love. This 
bond between mother and child will insure to the mother 
the leadership of the child during all the years of early 
childhood and pre-adolescence. 
When the child reaches the age of nine or ten, the 
second group of life lessons should be instilled. In the 
ideal family life the mother will instruct her daughter 
and the father will instruct his son. But if the father 
fails to do his duty by the boy the mother should lead 
‘both daughter and son into a knowledge of the origin 
of life. 
As we have seen, the boy goes through the wood-and- 
water-loving period of pre-adolescence; this is the period 
when he is especially interested in scouting, in camping, 
314
-P-A-G-E-345
  ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
in hiking through the woods and along the water courses. 
All these activities are of the out-of-doors and are adapted 
especially to the needs of boys and men; for that reason 
the father and son should be pals and chums for years. 
in their hikes afield the father will have frequent oppor- 
tunities to explain life in its various phases to his son. 
Among the life lessons, the father must explain to his 
son nature’s method of developing manhood in the youth. 
The father should explain how at the threshold of 
puberty the testicles of the boy begin to do two very 
important kinds of work,—they begin to prepare a won- 
derful ‘‘elixir of life’—the Hormone—which is absorbed 
immediately into the blood, is carried to every active 
tissue of the body and causes the development in the 
youth of all those qualities which are distinctive of ideal, 
virile manhood. It should be explained that these quali- 
ties are maintained throughout life, to the beginning of 
old age, by the influence of the “elixir of life’—the 
internal secretion from the testicles—the Hormone from ~ 
the gonad glands. The father also should explain how 
the semen, or seed, begins to develop slowly in the testi- 
cles early in the period of puberty; also that the semen 
is a fluid, possessing wonderful qualities. This highly 
potential semen should not be wasted. The father should, 
in a spirit of reverence, explain nature’s plan for the 
starting of a new life—fatherhood. The boy’s knowledge 
of the life history and family history of pets and domestic 
animals will make this easy to explain. With such in- 
struction the boy will easily acquire high ideals of man- 
hood, of the family, of life, and of life-relationships. 
Having accomplished this, the father can lead his son to 
observe absolutely correct habits in his personal life. 
The boy will certainly have the natural feeling of rever- 
ence for his mother further strengthened and firmly 
established. This attitude toward his mother is destined 
at the threshold of adolescence to form the basis of his 
315
-P-A-G-E-346

Story of 
oman- 
hood 
ee

ainst 
abits THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
attitude toward womankind in general, his attitude of 
chivalry. | 
In a similar way the mother may lead the pre-ado- 
lescent daughter to look forward to life with high ideals 
and unfaltering confidence. Let her teach the little girl 
of ten or eleven that in nature’s plan for her developing 
womanhood she will begin at the threshold of puberty 
to receive into her blood from her ovaries an “‘elixir of 
life”’ a Hormone. This “elixir of life’—this internal 
secretion—carried to all active tissues by the blood will 
cause the development in her of the qualities distinctive 
of ideal womanhood. When the child is so taught she 
acquires high ideals of life and of womanhood. She will 
instinctively feel that her person is sacred to her future 
womanhood, and to her future wifehood and motherhood. 
A girl so instructed by her mother will never acquire 
distorted viewpoints of life, or the unclean personal habits 
referred to above. Girls so mothered naturally become 
modest, idealistic, and above reproach in their thought- 
life and habits. 
After such a course of preliminary instruction during 
early childhood and pre-adolescence, the instruction in 
adolescent hygiene is very simple and certain of the best 
results. 
The principal reason for telling the child of pre-ado- 
lescent age the story of manhood or of womanhood is with 
the definite end in view of impressing the child with the 
feeling of the sacredness of the body so that such an 
unnatural act as self-abuse will seem revolting. If the 
parent has really done effective teaching the child will 
need only a few words of admonition after he has heard 
the story of manhood to make him at once and forever 
stop the habit of self-abuse, if he has already learned it; 
or to be effectively protected against being led into the 
habit if he has not already learned it. 
The parent might mention, perhaps rather inciden- 
316 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
  
  ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
tally, the fact that children that become addicted to the 
habit are in great danger of seriously marring their bud- 
ding manhood or womanhood. No detailed, gruesome 
descriptions of “insanity and human wreckage” should 
be portrayed. Even if it should be demonstrated as 
true that self-abuse may cause insanity, much the strong- 
est motive for right living is to be found in painting the 
glories, wonders, and beauties of ideal and perfect man- 
hood and womanhood, and simply warning the child that 
indulgence in the wrong habit will mar this beauty and 
perfection, and cause him to fall short of the ideal. 
At the threshold of puberty, preferably just before 
crossing it, the parents should explain to their children— 
mother to daughter, father to son—about the matter of 
periodicity. ‘The mother should explain to the daughter, 
nature’s plan in the life of woman. When the mother 
explains that this experience to which the girl is intro- 
duced at the threshold of womanhood is nature’s method 
of preparing for future motherhood, the girl, budding into 
womanhood, is quite reassured and acquires the right 
mental attitude toward life and its experiences. Any 
efficient mother will, of course, instruct her daughter 
regarding precautions which should be observed in order 
that the young woman may be regular and in uniform 
good health. 
Similarly the father should explain to his son that 
soon after the crossing of.the threshold into puberty he 
may expect an occasional nocturnal emission, or loss of a 
fluid which collects in two little bladders (vesicles) that 
make a part of the internal sex apparatus and are located 
back of the urinary bladder and next to it. 
In nature’s plans, this albuminous vesicular fluid is 
provided to furnish nourishment for the sperm cells or 
spermatozoa of the semen. But these sperm cells of the 
semen are supposed to remain dormant for months dur- 
ing continent-living, athletic youth. There is, therefore, 
317 Periodicity
-P-A-G-E-348
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
no immediate need for the vesicular fluid. Consequently, 
when the vesicles become filled and distended they 
simply empty. This usually happens at night—we call 
it a nocturnal emission, and look upon it as representing 
nature’s method of relieving the tension in the sex appa- 
ratus—her method of taking care of the continent-living 
young man. 
Dr. G. Stanley Hall, after a study of the world’s 
medical literature on the subject of spontaneous emissions 
(noctural or diurnal) was led to remark, “Spontaneous 
emissions are probably as universal for unmarried youth 
as menstruation for women” (Adolescence, Vol. 1, p. 453). 
In checking the medical literature with his own findings 
in thousands of interviews, with college men especially, 
the writer is inclined to modify the rather sweeping state- 
ment of his colleague quoted above. The writer has found 
a considerable proportion of youths and young men of 
high school and college age who claim to be seldom or 
never conscious of a spontaneous emission or to have 
noticed the marks of such that may have occurred during 
sound sleep. Of course, if a young man is resorting to 
the act of self-abuse even as infrequently as once in two 
weeks, he would be quite unlikely to experience any 
spontaneous emissions. It is easily conceivable that a 
young man may be living clean and continent and still 
not experience a spontaneous emission, because the vesic- 
ular fluid may be reabsorbed or may be voided along 
with the urine at the time of the morning micturition 
once in two, three, or four weeks. 
The regularity of this function, if it may be so called, 
may be disturbed in four different ways. First, frequent 
emissions may be caused by an inordinate drinking of 
water in the evening, thus filling up the system with water 
which in turn will overfill the bladder by two or three 
o'clock in the morning, causing that organ to press 
against the vesicles, thus evacuating them. Second, 
318
-P-A-G-E-349
ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
frequent emissions may be caused by excessive albumins 
in the diet; for instance if a youth eats three eggs every 
morning he would facilitate the secretion of the albumin- 
ous vesicular fluid, which increased secretion would be 
voided with increased frequency. Third, increased fre- 
quency of emissions may be caused by faulty position 
during sleep. We are mammals. The mammal does not 
sleep on its back, but midway between side and belly. 
The man should sleep on his side. If he sleeps on his 
back the weight of his bladder resting upon the vesicles 
may evacuate them. Fourth, the most prevalent cause 
of frequent emissions is to be found in the sex excitement 
incident to the modern close-up dance and the “petting 
party” or spooning. This proximity of the body of a 
girl or a woman is practically sure strongly to excite 
sexually any red-blooded young man. As a result of this 
sex excitement, semen pours up from the testicle into 
the ampullae and vesicles, filling them to the limit. 
Following such an experience the vesicles are very likely, 
in fact almost sure to evacuate in the early morning 
hours. Incidentally the spontaneous emission which 
follows a strong sex excitement is accompanied by a 
draining off of semen and the young man addicted to this 
folly will feel the depletion of his manly vigor just as 
surely as the youth who is addicted to the habit of self- 
abuse. 
When a young man understands nature’s plan in a 
man’s life, he can be led easily by his father, or other 
leader whom he respects and trusts, to adopt the con- 
tinent life—the life of no sex indulgence of any kind— 
as the only regimen that will keep him perfectly fit 
physically, and the only program of life that will keep 
him worthy of the pure girl whom he hopes some day 
to wed. , 
Any wholesome-minded young man hopes some day 
to win and to wed a chaste, healthy, efficient young 
319
-P-A-G-E-350
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
woman. If he is trying to play the game of life fairly 
and on the square, he will recognize that the young 
woman has a moral and ethical right to demand of the 
young man who is to be her life partner, the same quali- 
ties that he is demanding of her: clean life, health, and 
efficiency. This means that we have reached a stage of 
social development where we recognize that there should 
be one and the same standard of living for the man and 
the woman:—The Single Standard. 
Summary The typical pre-adolescent boy is egoistic, thoughtless, 
blundering, rough, noisy, rude, unmoral, and unsocial. 
He is interested in woods and water, and in live things. 
There is sex consciousness but no reciprocal sex attraction 
between boy and girl. 
The typical adolescent youth is thoughtful and con- 
siderate. He has had a moral awakening and begins 
definitely to show the beginnings of altruism. He enjoys 
camping, hunting, and fishing. He is virile and aggres- 
sive, but not selfishly so. He is athletic and codperates 
effectively in team work. There is not only sex conscious-— 
ness but also a mutual and reciprocal sex attraction 
between youth and maiden. 
The remarkable transformation—boy to man, girl to 
woman—is due to the influence in them of a Hormone 
from the gonads. This recently discovered “‘life ferment,”’ 
entering the blood from the sex glands, causes the develop- 
ment of typical male qualities in the youth and of typical 
female qualities in the maiden. 
V One phase of the sex development is the experience of 
sex urge on the part of the adolescent. Uncontrolled sex 
urge has led to a train of evils—unhappiness, weakness, 
disease, degeneration—which we call the social evil. The 
cure of the social evil can be accomplished only through 
establishing right mental attitudes and habits in the 
adolescent. 
The thought habits and mental attitudes and physical 
320
-P-A-G-E-351
  ADOLESCENT PERIOD 
habits of the adolescent are much influenced by the ex- 
periences of the preceding period—pre-adolescence. It 
is therefore strongly to be recommended that the instruc- 
tion of the young begin early and that it be given by the 
parents, so far as that is feasible. 
A fundamental principle to be followed in the instruc- 
tion of youth concerning social relationships and personal 
attitudes and habits is that the instruction should be 
idealistic, positive, and constructive—not negative or 
morbid or fearful.

Another important function of the public school in 
a democracy is the discovery and development of the 
gift or capacity of each individual child. This dis- 
covery should be made at the earliest practicable 
age, and, once made, should always influence, and 
sometimes determine, the education of the individual. 
It is for the interest of society to make the most of 
every useful gift or faculty which any member may 
fortunately possess; and it is one of the main advan- 
tages of fluent and mobile democratic society that it 
is more likely than any other society to secure the 
fruition of individual capacities. To make the most 
of any individual’s peculiar power, it is important to 
discover it early, and then train it continuously and 
assiduously. It is wonderful what apparently small 
personal gifts may become the means of conspicuous 
service or achievement, if only they get discovered, 
trained, and applied. .... In the ideal democratic 
school no two children would follow the same course 
of study or have the same tasks except that they 
would all need to learn the use of the elementary 
tools of education—reading, writing, and ciphering. 
The different children would hardly have any identi- 
cal needs. There might be a minimum standard of 
attainment in every branch of study, but no maxi- 
mum. The perception or discovery of the individual 
gift or capacity would often be effected in the ele- 
mentary school, but more generally in the secondary; 
and the making of these discoveries should be held 
one of the most important parts of the teacher’s 
work.

CHAPTER XVI 
THE NEED OF BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN OUR 
KNOWLEDGE OF EDUCATION AND OUR 
EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE 
HE public school is designed to develop the pupil, 
but it is readily agreed by all that the needs of 
the individual pupil change with the social and 
community needs. Society is an organism. Social and 
community needs are therefore continually changing. 
It follows that the science and practice of schools must 
change. As a rule both social and educational move- 
ments require time and changes take place slowly. Edu- 
cational science and practice do not keep step. One 
necessarily lags behind the other and, even if it were 
possible to keep knowledge and practice in education 
abreast of each other, there would be the necessity of 
constantly adjusting the schools to a changing social 
order. 
The institutions of a democracy are changed with the 
consent of the people and depend upon popular enlighten- 
ment and control. The institutions of an absolute govern- 
ment are modified by one or by a few usually without 
the consent or knowledge of those governed. It was the 
consciousness of this fact that inspired the American 
Declaration of Independence. As might be expected, it 
requires a longer time to modify institutions which 
depend upon popular control than those which are auto- 
cratically controlled. The observation of this fact has 
brought many Europeans, particularly monarchists, to 
believe that a democracy is clumsy, unwieldy, and in- 
efficient as compared with monarchies and autocracies.

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
This was a leading factor in Germany’s attitude in the 
recent World War. Those of us who have faith in democ- 
racy believe that there is a greater measure of safety in 
popular control. This idea was advanced by the New 
England statesman, Fisher Ames, quoted indirectly by 
Emerson in his essay on Politics: “Fisher Ames expressed 
the popular security more wisely when he compared a 
monarchy and a republic, saying that a monarchy is a 
merchantman, which sails well, but will sometimes 
strike on a rock and go to the bottom; while a republic 
is a raft, which would never sink, but then your feet are 
always in water.” 
Those of us who are sometimes impatient with prog- 
ress in our Republic should remember that the very 
thing which provokes our impatience protects us from 
rash and precipitate action which might incur disaster. 
Our Our American public school system, like our govern- Educational ° Soa ee System ment, is an institution of the people, by the people, and 
renee for the people. In America, education emanates from 
a . the people. In Europe, it emanates from the govern- 
Government ment. In America, the school system originally was 
controlled entirely by the people residing in a very small 
district or locality. Gradually a certain degree of control 
has been vested in counties in some sections of the 
country and everywhere certain powers of school regula- 
tion, particularly the establishment of standards of 
attendance, teaching and organization have been ceded 
to the States. The first State Superintendency was 
established in New York in 1812 and, by the time of the 
Civil War, all the States of the North had similar officers, 
but such an office did not exist in the States of the South 
until after the Civil War. Prior to the War only twenty- 
four cities had superintendents. No power of controlling 
education in the States has ever been ceded to or exercised 
by the Federal Government. The transition from the 
district system to the city, township, or state system of

control does not mean taking education out of the hands 
of the people, but simply a more efficient administration 
by officers who are nevertheless responsible to the people 
and are either elected by the people or appointed by the 
representatives of the people. There is no tendency in 
America to take the control of the schools from the people. 
Usually in a European country, as for example in France 
or Germany, thé entire control, organization, and adminis- 
tration of the schools are vested in a minister or ministry. 
Those who complain that progress is slow in American 
schools in some respects as compared with European 
schools, should remember that we have the same pro- 
tection from exploitation and disaster in our school 
system which we possess in our political system. 
Education has existed in the world in some form or 
other for thousands of years. Science or the treatment 
of phenomena in a systematic manner by the discovery 
and presentation of truth in an orderly process of classifi- 
cation is quite modern. More science has been developed 
and applied to man’s use in the memory of persons now 
living than was produced in the entire previous range of 
history. 
Natural science, or that mass of knowledge dealing 
with things, plants, and brutes, such as geology, physics, 
botany, and zoélogy, developed before social science or 
that mass of knowledge which pertains to man and his 
moral, political, and intellectual relations. In fact, these 
latter branches of knowledge are largely in the process of 
being born and developed at the present time. No 
attempt to attack problems of education from a scientific 
basis had been made until the last few decades. ‘True, 
there have been before this those who, like Pestalozzi, 
Herbart, Froebel, and others, attempted to establish 
educational methods on experiments of one kind or 
another, but not until the twentieth century did any- 
thing appear worthy of the name of science in education.

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
Education, when first subjected to careful study, was 
called philosophy, then pedagogy, and only quite recently 
has it been called science. 
For centuries education continued as a matter of 
tradition and opinion, and because of the recentness of 
the scientific method, most of our educational knowledge 
and practice is still based upon traditional beliefs. In 
consequence, a major part of educational practice is un- 
supported by scientific experiment and: still is a matter 
of controversy, debate, and arbitrary decision. The lack 
of a scientific method of attacking education has prob- 
ably been the most outstanding difficulty in harmonizing 
knowledge and practice in education. 
Education Education is now generally regarded as a science, but 
Estanietoy this recognition has only recently been won. Education 
asa Science has suffered an experience similar to agriculture. In 
1857 a group of men went to the University of Michigan 
seeking to have agriculture taught there. They were re- 
garded with skepticism as no one at that time considered 
agriculture as a science or capable of systematic instruc- 
tion. That group of men left Ann Arbor and founded an 
institution for teaching agriculture at Lansing, Michigan. 
In 1862, the Federal Congress passed the first Morrill 
Act granting land to institutions which proposed to teach 
agriculture and mechanic arts. Other institutions were 
established similar to the one at Lansing, and other acts 
were passed by Congress extending Federal support to 
them, until we have agricultural and mechanical colleges, 
together with experiment stations for the scientific in- 
vestigation of agriculture and kindred subjects, in every 
State in the Union. 
Formerly, the term “farmer” was a derisive synonym 
for ignorance. Agriculture was based upon opinion and 
oftentimes superstition. Failure of crops was frequently 
attributed to planting in the wrong phase of the moon, 
or even to the vengeance of God. To-day agriculture is

a science. Practice is based upon actual experimentation 
and results. Even productivity of soil and water supply 
are being changed by scientific planting, rotation of crops, 
soil analysis, fertilization, and irrigation. Crops are no 
longer dependent upon opinion or the providence of a 
beneficent God, but upon the knowledge and ignorance 
of men. 
It has been only a few years since a small group of 
men, the pioneer among whom was Edward L. Thorndike, 
began to contend that mind and its products could be 
subjected to careful scientific measurement, qualitative 
and quantitative. They encountered skepticism and 
some ridicule, but they persevered. To-day, education 
has secured the same recognition as to scientific treat- 
ment that has been accorded to agriculture, though that 
recognition may not be so general among the people out- 
side the educational world. The establishment of scien- 
tific method in the field of education should be the means 
of bringing educational knowledge to a more general and 
unquestioned acceptance and therefore make possible 
some abridgment of the gap existing between our theory 
and practice in our schools. 
It should be noted that a gap exists between our 
knowledge and practice in education, both because in 
many instances we know a great deal that would improve 
the schools that we do not or can not put into practice, 
and because we practice a great many things in the 
schools about which we have little or no knowledge. 
Sometimes knowledge is ahead of practice, and at other 
times practice is ahead of knowledge. We shall proceed 
to discuss these two general phases of the problem with 
which this chapter deals and illustrate with concrete 
examples. 
Previous to the establishment of education on a scien- 
tific basis, there was a possibility of deriving knowledge 
for the improvement of schools because each school was 
330

PRESENT-DAY KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD EDUCATION 
after all a kind of experiment or laboratory in which 
children were being taught. There existed also the oppor- 
tunity for mutual discussion and comparison among those 
responsible for the management and direction of schools. 
Although the measurement of results and the evaluation 
of methods and materials were largely matters of guess- 
work, opinion, or rough estimation, there were many 
things that came to be generally recognized as true be- 
cause of the nature of circumstances or the general con- 
sensus of opinion arrived at by a great many working 
independently of each other. And thus there existed a 
body of knowledge about education which was outside 
the pale of mere opinion or controversy before there was 
a scientific treatment of education. At the present time, 
most of our knowledge about education is of this kind 
because scientific methods are so recent that very little 
information of a scientific character has yet been derived. 
In recent years, experimental methods have been employed 
on a large scale and schools have been established for 
testing principles of organization and types of instruction, 
such as the Lincoln School in connection with Teachers 
College, Columbia University, the Gary schools, and 
others, but as yet we have not had the time to evaluate 
these and little scientific knowledge has yet been accu- 
mulated. 
Although we have had some generally accepted 
knowledge about schools, we have always experienced 
difficulties in attempting to get it into use. There are 
numerous reasons for these difficulties. We shall mention 
only some of the more important ones and treat them 
under the following headings: Conservatism in Edu- 
cation; The System of Popular Control; Changing Con- 
ditions Outside the Schools; Control of Education on 
Political Rather than Professional Basis, and Necessity 
of Training Teachers.

as conservative. Ideas and traditional thinking are not 
easily changed. American educational ideals are very 
largely the result of Greek thinking before the time of 
Christ. Plato, Aristotle, and others are largely responsible 
for our cultural scheme. The thoughts of these ancient 
Greeks completely dominated European thought even 
after the downfall of Greece. Greek culture conquered 
Rome when Roman arms conquered Greece. After the 
middle ages, Greek culture was revived all over Europe. 
The Greek philosophers and thinkers became arbiters in 
all matters of learning. A question arose about the 
existence of spots on the sun. It was concluded after a 
search through all the works of Aristotle that there could 
be no spots on the sun because Aristotle made no men- 
tion of them anywhere. 
“The conservatism of men in education is nowhere 
demonstrated more clearly than in their clinging to educa- 
tional principles long after the reason for doing so no 
longer exists. No one will doubt the advances that have 
been made in the scientific world as a result of the Bacon- 
ian philosophy. In fact, since Bacon’s time, the world 
has been made over. We have entirely cut loose from 
the past in medicine, physics, chemistry, and the other 
physical sciences, and no one would think to-day of 
basing research in these sciences on deduction. We gain 
our knowledge of them from a study of things. What the 
ancients gave us in them has been brushed aside as worth- 
less rubbish. But in education we still cling to the past, 
although there is every reason to brush it aside that 
there was in the case of scientific knowledge. In fact, 
educational principles must go hand in hand with scien- 
tific principles, or they are worthless. Plato said, ‘All 
the useful arts are degrading, and the end of education is 
to cultivate the thinking powers,’ and we are willing to 
risk all on his judgment. At the time of the Renaissance, 
when men were digging from their hiding places the 
332
-P-A-G-E-365

manuscripts of the Greeks, some fellow happened to dig 
out this philosophy of Plato, and it has had such a tre- 
mendous influence that to-day we are unable to break 
loose from it.’”* 
We have already referred to the fact that the American 
school is controlled by the people and we have pointed 
out that this has a virtue in that it prevents rash and 
precipitate changes. Changes cannot be made as readily 
as in European countries where the system is controlled 
by the government. Every voter in America shares in 
the control of schools. Progress in educational practice 
can only be made after an idea has been presented by 
educational leaders to the public in such a measure as 
to convince at least a majority of the voters that it is 
desirable. For this reason, if for no others, educational 
practice would have to lag behind educational knowledge. 
A certain period of time is necessarily required to con- 
vince the public with reference to an educational need 
even after it becomes obvious to those who have the 
schools directly in charge. 
This is such an important element in the conserva- 
tism of tradition in our schools that I think it will be 
worth while to discuss it a little further. It should be 
remembered that many voters have attended school at a 
time when the school was quite different from the present 
or the time at which they are called upon to exercise the 
ballot in school matters. For this reason, almost any 
man or woman thinks that he or she can judge school 
needs without any assistance from the professional school 
man. Editors do not hesitate to write very positive 
editorials about what the schools should have and should 
not have, even though they attended an old-fashioned 
district school and have never visited a school since. It 
is just as if those who had never traveled in anything 
except stagecoaches would undertake to-day, without 
having seen a modern train, to discuss the railroad and

its needs. Nearly everybody has gone at some time to 
some kind of a school so the public has an assurance 
about its knowledge of schools which it does not have 
about law, medicine, or any other matter of public 
concern. 
This attitude of the public makes it exceedingly 
difficult for school leaders to get their knowledge of 
education into practice. As we have already pointed out, 
it has the virtue of protecting the schools against any- 
thing that has not already been thoroughly discussed and 
demonstrated to the public if not tested by scientific 
method. On the other hand, school leaders have not in 
the past shown the degree of interest in educating the 
public about school matters that is desirable. Educators 
are too prone to discuss their problems among themselves 
in a technical way unintelligible to the public. It should 
be remembered that if sometimes the public may seem 
stubborn and intolerant in voting on bond issues, con- 
solidation, and other school measures, educators are in- 
clined to appear at times intolerant to the public. It is 
true that a great many agencies are now operating to 
bring schools and school administrators and _ school 
teachers into contact with the public, such as Parent- 
Teacher Associations, women’s and men’s clubs, and 
others, but the lack of this kind of program for informing 
the public about schools has made the gap between our 
educational knowledge and practice much greater than 
it should have been. 
Another prolific source of difficulty in keeping our 
schools abreast of educational knowledge is found in the 
changes outside the school of a social, economic, indus- 
trial, or political character which are unforeseen and 
beyond the control of those who are responsible for the 
schools. We have already pointed out the fact that 
society is an institution which is organic or constantly 
changing. In consequence of this fact, no educational

} 
problem can ever be settled with finality. We are just 
10W passing through a period of violent upheaval and 
readjustment in social, economic, and political affairs. 
The World War involved us in revolution and reconstruc- 
tion in many directions. All of this has a vital and pro- 
found effect on schools and education. This same prob- 
lem of readjustment has always existed and will be neces- 
sary in the future development of schools though, of 
course, not in the same degree as it exists to-day as a 
result of the war. This general trend is admirably set 
forth by J. L. Horn: 
‘Again, this development of mass education has been 
taking place during a period which is itself a transition 
in the history of humanity. The development of the 
sciences; the establishment of cities; the political revo- 
lutions and the resultant changes in the form of govern- 
ment and of social concepts; the industrial revolution and 
its far-reaching changes in economic and social relations; 
the abolition of many well-established relations such as 
those which inhered in the institution of feudalism; these 
changes, as history goes, are so recent as to be practi- 
cally contemporary. 
“The very fundamental motives underlying mass 
education have been changing within the period of its 
institution. Beginning as we did with the purely religious 
motive, followed by the political motive inherent in dem- 
ocratic government under universal franchise, the motive 
of the moment must take into account the increasing 
complexity of modern life, requiring as it does many 
skills, abilities, and capacity to adjust, all of which im- 
plies ever increasing equipment, and an ever longer period 
of training. 
‘‘Public education has gone through an evolution com- 
paratively easy to trace. Beginning as a luxury reserved 
for those of high station it became, through the accident 
of the point of view of the Reformation, a religious need 
335

to be supplied by the State or church or some philan- 
thropic agency. With the development of political de- 
mocracy, it has become a definite secular function based 
on political motives; and finally in America it has become 
an institution of which every one is required to avail 
himself by compulsion of law to an ever-increasing age, 
and almost everywhere beyond the age of twelve.’”! 
Administrative positions in education were political 
in their origin and professionalization has been slow. 
This presents at the same time one of the outstanding 
causes as well as an example of our difficulty in bringing 
educational practice in accord with our knowledge. Cer- 
tainly no one believes that partisan politics should have 
any relation to schools. Education is no more a matter 
of partisan politics than religion or morals. No political 
party could be interested in an issue which would tend 
to hamper public schools or their improvement. And 
yet, in the case of the chief educational officers of the 
States, most of them are elected upon a partisan ticket 
in a political campaign. There has been a long and per- 
sistent agitation by school leaders against this practice, 
but in thirty-four States the State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction or similar officer is still elected in this 
way. This position was not generally recognized or 
established until the period just before and just after the 
Civil War. At first there was no conception of the posi- 
tion as a professional occupation. It came into existence 
in many States as a clerical function exercised by some 
other state officer. Since its recognition as a separate 
office, it has been often regarded as a political reward. 
Generally the voters are much more interested in the 
candidates for Governor or other state offices than for 
that of State Superintendent. The tendency to vote the 
party ticket has prevented much consideration being 
given by the average voter to the educational or pro- 
fessional qualifications of those running on the state

336
-P-A-G-E-369
  PRESENT-DAY KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD EDUCATION 
ticket for the most important educational position in the 
State. At the present time, only six States have the chief 
educational officer appointed by the Governor, and only 
eight States have them appointed by the State Board of 
Education. 
What has been said about state administrative officers 
also applies to other administrative officers to a greater 
or lesser degree, particularly county and district super- 
intendents. There is an exception in the case of the 
city superintendency. ‘This position has come to be 
almost completely divorced from partisan politics and, 
uniformly, city superintendents are selected by boards 
of education or other bodies which usually seek to find 
persons with the proper professional training. But even 
here politics cannot be completely eliminated, because 
candidates for these boards frequently run on partisan 
tickets and sometimes reflect their sentiments in their 
attitude on the matter of an administrative or executive 
officer. 
A very important and difficult problem which makes 
accommodation of educational practice to knowledge a 
slow process is the necessity for training teachers which 
arises when new forms of organization or methods of 
teaching are attempted. Some educational reforms re- 
quire a long period to become effective because a new 
generation of teachers must be trained who have the 
technical and professional knowledge necessary to carry 
the proposed changes into effect. William McAndrew 
puts this in a very effective phrase when he says, ‘“Teach- 
ers have a vested interest in certain subjects and meth- 
ods.” By this he means that because certain persons 
have learned to teach certain subjects in the curriculum 
and have learned in the normal school or by experience 
to employ certain methods of instruction, it is difficult 
to change the curriculum or methods of instruction be- 
cause some people will have to lose their jobs. In any 
337 Necessity of

Teachers
-P-A-G-E-370
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
case, it always takes time to train either the same teachers 
or new ones who will have the technical knowledge and 
skill to teach the new things or teach in a new way. An 
example of this difficulty is found in the attempt to de- 
velop vocational education in the United States. Since 
the passage of the Vocational, or Smith-Hughes, Act by 
Congress in 1917, appropriating money from the Federal 
Treasury for the stimulation of vocational education in 
the States, the greatest difficulty experienced in setting 
up a program of vocational training, which was under- 
taken in each State after the passage of the Federal Act, 
has been that of securing those who had the necessary 
professional and technical knowledge and training in 
agriculture, trades and industries, home economics, and 
commerce, to undertake the direction of this work. 
Teacher training is still an unsolved problem in 
American education and most of those teaching in our 
schools do not have the proper professional preparation. 
This fact accentuates the difficulty of bringing the school 
in line with the best educational knowledge because those 
charged with the instruction of the youth do not have the 
professional skill to employ modern or new methods. 
Horn cites one phase of the difficulties arising from the 
teacher training problem when he says, ‘‘One of the most 
potent factors tending to hold the American school system 
and its divisions in a grip of rigid immutability, has been 
our double system of teacher training. In their efforts to 
recruit teaching forces for the elementary schools, the 
early school men established training schools—our normal 
schools—institutions where training was given in methods; 
where just enough was taught to provide for the immediate 
need of securing teachers for the schools. On the other 
hand, teachers for the secondary schools have naturally 
been recruited from the colleges; and so the double 
system took root. A vicious circle was established. The 
normal school, originally a most useful institution, has 
338
-P-A-G-E-371
PRESENT-DAY KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD EDUCATION 
by the very fact of its growth and development, at the 
same time that it has always limited its functions to the 
training of elementary-school teachers, fastened the 
rudimentary inevitableness of the elementary school upon 
the American system; for the teachers trained for that 
school have ordinarily not been equipped to enrich its 
curriculum by the introduction of secondary-school sub- 
jects in the earlier years.””! 
We have attempted to present a few of the obstacles 
in the way of a closer adaptation of theory and practice 
in our schools. There are other factors equally as impor- 
tant as those we have presented and many minor con- 
siderations which would require much space to present. 
It is not the purpose of this chapter to point out the 
present practice of schools or show just how far this 
practice lacks unity with our present knowledge, but it 
would seem worth while to show in a broad way just 
what is the general situation as a result of the retarding 
factors just described. 
About thirty years ago leaders in education began to 
realize that our school curriculum in America, particu- 
larly in its elementary stages, was outworn and urgently 
in need of reform. It was pointed out that as elementary 
education, secondary education, and higher education 
had all historically developed independently, there was 
no real articulation in the curricula of these important 
divisions of our school system and that, as a consequence, 
there was much wastage in pupils dropping out of school 
at an early age and, among those who continued, in the 
actual time required to pass through the system from 
kindergarten to college or university. Our college gradu- 
ates were found to be two or three years older than those 
of European institutions and an agitation for reorganiza- 
tion was started. At the beginning the discussion was 
precipitated largely by Charles W. Eliot, then President 
of Harvard University, and William R. Harper, then 
") a Le Hoes, “‘The American Elementary School,”’ p. 20.

President of the University of Chicago. President Eliot, 
interested largely in reducing the age of college graduates, 
raised the question as to how the school curriculum might 
be shortened and at the same time enriched. The discus- 
sion quickly became general and aroused much interest 
among all types of school men. The agitation has con- 
tinued since that time. Many conferences have been 
held, important committees have been appointed and 
have made valuable studies, numerous volumes have 
been written, and a great deal of experimentation has been 
done. All of this has shown to the general satisfaction of 
school men that a complete reorganization is badly 
needed, and yet the conditions to-day are very largely as 
they were when the agitation began. 
Our elementary school system with its “grades,” was 
borrowed from Germany. Some have doubted this, but 
a careful investigation will establish the fact. A bulletin 
of the United States Bureau of Education says: “In 
America, during the period when our schools were being 
molded into the semblance of a system, German influence 
in shaping the structure was much more direct and 
potent than has been generally recognized.”' Charles 
Brooks, the forerunner of Horace Mann in Massachusetts, 
is quoted in the same bulletin as follows: “From what 
I have learned, it is my opinion that the Prussian system 
is to make a new era in the public education of the 
United States.’ 
Likewise, the college and university in this country 
originated as an agency for higher culture and the so-called 
“learned professions.” In the German system, the 
elementary school of eight grades did not prepare for 
anything above it. Students passing through the elemen- 
tary school could not enter the gymnasium, which corre- 
sponds to our high school, much less the college or 
university. The masses passed through the elementary

school into the common occupations and industry. The 
only way they could get any more education was in the 
“continuation” school. Those who expected to go into 
the professions or “higher walks’’ started at the same 
age, generally six years, as the masses began the ele- 
mentary school. After three years of special training 
they passed into the gymnasium, from which they could 
enter the college or university. The German system 
of education was therefore the counterpart of a social 
and political caste system. 
Unfortunately, the American school system was largely 
affected by the German. Hence the lack of articulation 
of its parts. The American high school was a compara- 
tively late afterthought, attempting to furnish a route 
from the elementary school into the college in response 
to a demand that came from the democratic ideals of 
America. 
In the circumstances, it is not strange that our system 
should have turned out to be wasteful and poorly articu- 
lated. The loss of students dropping out of our system 
and the tremendous loss of time by those remaining in it 
have been abundantly shown. 
Under our system the pupils generally remain in school 
fairly well until the fifth grade. F. E. Spaulding has 
called us a nation of ‘“‘sixth graders.” After the fifth 
grade, there is a tremendous leakage. The United States 
Bureau of Education made a study of what becomes of 
the fifth-grade boy and girl. The study showed that of 
1000 pupils in the fifth grade, 830 pass to the sixth grade, 
634 of them enter the eighth grade, 342 of these reach the 
high school, but only 139 graduate; and while 72 of the 
original 1000 enter college, just 23 finally finish.’ 
President Eliot proved at the outset of the discussion 
that an enormous amount of time was wasted by the 
pupils remaining in the elementary school. Concerning

this experiment he wrote: ‘I procured two careful esti- 
mates of the time it would take a graduate of a high school 
to read aloud consecutively all the books which are read 
in this school during six years, including the history, 
the reading lessons in geography, and the book on man- 
ners. The estimates were made by two persons reading 
aloud at a moderate rate, and reading everything that 
the children in most of the rooms of that school have been 
supposed to read during their entire course of six years. 
The time occupied in doing this reading was forty-six 
hours. The children had, therefore, been more than two 
solid years of school time in going through what an 
ordinary high-school graduate can read aloud in forty-six 
hours.’ 
It has been conclusively shown that the elementary 
curriculum is too long and that the upper grades do not 
hold the pupils, especially the bright ones, because of the 
deadly and formal nature of much of the subject matter 
and because so much of it is a mere repetition of subject 
matter in the early grades. There was once a time, when 
a few parents thought children might skip grades or pass 
on without completing all the work, but teachers were 
shocked at such a suggestion. It has now been conclu- 
sively demonstrated that bright pupils may be pushed 
ahead into higher grades and soon do just as well or 
better. Even repeaters have been found that would 
do better in the grade above, than in the one in which 
they have failed. 
Furthermore, in many places the elementary curricu- 
lum has been shortened a year or more apparently without 
any actual loss in educational advantage to the pupils. 
Many cities and some States have a seven-year elementary 
course instead of the old eight-year course, giving the 
same amount of material in seven years as is usually given 
in eight years. Kansas City, Missouri, has had this 
kind of seven-year elementary schools since 1867, and

in 1918 forty-eight cities had it. Louisiana has used it 
throughout the State for years and studies have shown 
that the pupils have held their own with those who have 
completed the eight-year course elsewhere. 
It has been shown with equal clearness that the courses 
of study, particularly in the last grades of the elementary 
school, can be enriched and reorganized so as to deprive 
them of their deadly formalism and furnish motivation 
that will stimulate pupils to continue in school. The 
Junior High School is a solution of this problem. The 
Junior High School has demonstrated its success beyond 
peradventure and has revitalized the curriculum in the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth grades where the traditional 
curriculum was so deadening; and further, it helps to 
bring into articulation the elementary school and the 
secondary school. It does this by offering a course of 
study in the seventh and eighth grades, which anticipates 
the high school curriculum in specialization and by a kind 
of exploration discovers the aptitudes of pupils, so that 
they can later follow a course in the high school which is 
adapted to their temperament, abilities, and needs. 
Notwithstanding all that has been demonstrated with 
reference to the inefficiency and waste of the traditional 
curriculum, it-still remains in use in most places to-day. 
The attack upon the elementary curriculum is still being 
carried on with vehemence and the effort is still being 
made to accomplish an articulation between the elemen- 
tary and high schools. | 
“The American public school system now stands, 
after three centuries of growth, complete in form only. 
Its three divisions, elementary, secondary, and that em- 
bracing higher education, are joined together, end to end, 
forming a lineal whole. ... In organic relation, in 
sharpness of province, and in distinctiveness of function, 
these divisions are not yet satisfactorily articulated.’””

tional elementary school curriculum, still generally in use, 
and characterized it as: 
‘‘Aimless; it does not function in the lives of pupils. 
“Lifeless; mere form subjects predominate. 
“Disconnected; fourteen school subjects are treated 
as unrelated except when arbitrarily and superficially 
correlated as school room arts. 
“‘Congested; the crowded situation is due to the treat- 
ment of empty details. 
‘“Wasteful; ‘Progress through the grades’ consists of 
‘marking time’ and ‘busy work.’ 
“Untimely; the traditional curriculum is not apace 
with the vital issues of the day.’”? 
We stated that lack of unity in educational knowledge 
and practice is occasioned both by the fact that knowledge 
sometimes outruns practice, and also by the fact that 
practice sometimes outruns knowledge. We have shown 
concretely how we continue in practice much that our 
knowledge has shown undesirable. Much more could 
be said about that great unexplored field of education, 
where lack of experimentation or even empirical knowl- 
edge makes it necessary for us to practice without know- 
ing. This gap, however, will be gradually closed as our 
application of scientific experimentation enables us to 
discover what the facts are and removes practice from 
the sphere of opinion and guesswork. 
In 1917 Abraham Flexner published a paper under 
the title ““A Modern School” which has recently been 
republished in a volume with another paper on “‘A Modern 
College.”’ Flexner’s ““Modern School’ called for a very 
radical reorganization and, when published, was based 
largely on opinion. The General Education Board, how- 
ever, provided Teachers College of Columbia University 
with the funds to establish a school in which Flexner’s 
ideas could be tried out. As a result we have had the 
Lincoln School for the past six years, running largely as

an educational laboratory and experiment. In this way, 
it will be possible eventually to determine in a scientific 
manner how far the practice of the Lincoln School is 
sound and how far Flexner is correct in his opinions. 
This is only one of many similar, though perhaps less 
important and less extensive experimental studies of 
educational theory and practice. 
No matter how much progress we make in educational 
science, we shall never be able to keep practice from out- 
running knowledge to some extent. New and attractive 
materials and methods will be constantly appearing 
through discovery and invention, and there will be those 
who will try out these new things, and naturally so, 
prior to any educational experimentation to determine 
the proper methods for the best results. An illustration 
of this is afforded at the present time in the increasing 
introduction into the schools of motion pictures in 
the absence of any knowledge about their educational 
value, methods of use, and proper modes of presen- 
tation. 
They are being introduced because of the general 
appeal that they make, the vitality and interest that they 
inject into the course, and the convenience that they 
offer in presenting much that was presented formerly in 
other ways. It will require long and careful experimenta- 
tion to determine how much more effective these pictures 
are than the old methods, what material should be pre- 
sented in this way, the devices that should be employed 
to secure the best results, and other questions of similar 
nature which readily suggest themselves for answer. 
The absence of scientific method in the treatment of 
education is one reason why it has been difficult to bridge 
the gap between our knowledge of education and our 
practice of teaching. However, education is now becom- 
ing established as a science, and it should be possible in 
the future to achieve more success than we have had in

the past in keeping educational practice abreast of our 
knowledge of education. 
Again, practice has lagged behind our knowledge of 
education, partly because of the conservatism which has 
been so persistent in education. Men cling to educational 
practices longer than they do to practices in almost any 
other field of human interest and activity. Another 
reason why practice has lagged behind our knowledge 
of education is because in our country there is popular 
control of the schools. A certain period of time is required 
to convince the public with reference to an educational 
need, even after it becomes obvious to those who have the 
schools directly in charge. Practically all our people 
think they are competent to render a decision regarding 
any phase of educational practice. 
Still another source of difficulty in modifying practice 
to keep abreast of developing educational knowledge is 
found in the social, economic, industrial, and political 
changes which take place outside the schoof and which 
make it impossible to settle any educational problem with 
finality. The control of education has been largely on a 
political rather than on a professional basis, and this has 
retarded the development of educational practice as com- 
pared with the development of the science of education. 
Again, it has been extremely difficult to provide ade- 
quately for the training of teachers so that they could 
keep abreast of our advance in the development of educa- 
tional science. Further, teachers have had _ special 
interests which have made it difficult or impossible for 
some of them to see education as a whole in an unpreju- 
diced way. The normal school system of the country 
has tended to perpetuate traditional educational prac- 
tices without due regard to the increase of knowledge 
respecting educational values and methods. 
It is now realized that there is an urgent need for the 
reorganization of the school curriculum. Our elementary 
346

PRESENT-DAY KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD EDUCATION 
school system, was borrowed largely from Germany, while 
our system of higher education was developed independ- 
ently. There has not been proper articulation between the 
different parts of our educational system. As a result, 
it is generally believed that there is needless waste in our 
educational work. There is waste due to unnecessary 
elimination of pupils from school. There is also needless 
waste on the part of those who repeat grades in the schools. 
Experiments and practice have shown that the tradi- 
tional elementary school curriculum can be shortened. 
It has also been shown that the curriculum can be enriched 
by the addition of subjects which would have value in 
contemporary life. 
While emphasis has been placed in this chapter on 
the failure of practice to keep abreast of scientific knowl- 
edge respecting education, still it should be said that in 
some ways practice outruns accurate knowledge. We still 
teach certain subjects and employ certain methods with- 
out knowing whether they are the most valuable and 
effective subjects and methods that could be employed. 
However, experimental schools are being established to 
investigate and test educational doctrines in the hope 
that all our practice may eventually be based upon 
adequate and accurate knowledge, although we must per- 
haps expect that in some respects practice will generally 
outrun accurate and adequate knowledge of educational! 
values and methods.

The Estab- 
lishment of 
Free and 
Compulsory 
chools XVII 
CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
UR early forefathers engaged for many decades in 
vigorous and often heated debate over the question 
of establishing free and compulsory education for all 
children, regardless of their social, economic, or racial status. 
There may be some readers who can remember the time 
when the schools were not free; every parent paid for the 
tuition of his children. It was quite generally believed 
in our country in former times that it would be unjust 
for a community to make every citizen contribute to the 
education of all the children of the community, because 
it was held by many, though not by everyone, that 
schooling was of benefit only to the children who received 
- it. But even in the first period of our history, it was urged 
by some persons that the training at the public expense 
of all the young would be of advantage to all the people, 
since an ignorant person would not be able to comprehend 
the requirements in order to become a decent and law- 
abiding citizen. It was asserted by a few that every 
adult who had had no schooling would become a menace 
to the peace and welfare of the community, and that 
therefore every child should be compelled to acquire the 
rudiments of knowledge so that he could at least read. 
In 1642, the Massachusetts Colony enacted a law 
compelling parents to have their children taught to read, 
and enforcing fines if they neglected this duty. In 1647, 
the same colony enacted a law requiring that every com- 
munity having as many as fifty householders should ap- 
point a teacher of reading and writing and should provide 
for his wages in any way they deemed best. This law also 
348 
 
-P-A-G-E-383
  CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
required that every community having as many as 
one hundred householders must provide a Latin grammar 
school to prepare youths for the university. Nevertheless, 
the majority of our forefathers believed that an educated 
adult would have an advantage over an uneducated one 
because he could make his living in an easier way, would 
have more leisure for enjoyment, and his education 
would improve his social status; but these benefits would 
be of value solely to the individual and not to the com- 
munity. Since most of the people held this view in earlier 
times, the schools were originally private institutions 
for the most part, and were supported by those who could 
afford to pay tuition fees. In those days, few persons 
would have thought of suggesting laws compelling all 
the people to pay taxes for the support of public schools, 
for the reason that it was not generally believed that a 
person who could not read or write or use figures would 
imperil the economic, social, or moral welfare of the 
community. 
Any reader of these lines would be impressed by 
an examination of the arguments for and against the 
establishment of free schools and compulsory education 
laws, which arguments extended over a considerable 
period in our early history. As one traces the discussion 
down through the years, he can see how those who main- 
tained that the schooling of a// children—at least in the 
rudiments of education—was essential for the welfare of 
all the people in the community, continually gained force 
and adherents, until finally the balance of power swung 
over from the opponents to the advocates of universal 
free education. The proposition that made the strongest 
appeal and that ultimately determined positive action 
was that every person who could read, write, and calculate 
according to the needs of daily life, and who had learned 
something about religion and the founding of our govern- 
ment and the principles of freedom upon which it is 
349
-P-A-G-E-384
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
maintained, would make a better citizen than one who 
could not read or write and so who would have to depend 
upon others for information regarding the nature of our 
government and what is demanded of every individual 
in order that it should continue to be strong, stable, and 
prosperous. In the discussion of this matter, statements 
were frequently made to the effect that autocratic and 
monarchical forms of government exist where a large pro- 
portion of the people are ignorant. Just as frequently 
one reads that in a government like ours all the people 
must possess the rudiments of knowledge or else our 
democratic institutions cannot survive; if only a few are 
educated while the many are ignorant, the former will 
in time take unfair advantage of the latter, and democratic 
government will perish. 
These propositions were presented so vividly and force- 
fully by the early friends of universal free education 
that they were at last successful in overcoming the opposi- 
tion to the maintenance of a school system which required 
that all the citizens in a community should contribute 
to the education of all the young, even though some of 
the people had no children themselves to take advantage 
of the schools. There were a few persons in every com- 
munity who protested as vigorously as they could that 
it was an injustice to make a family in which there were 
no children help pay for the education of other people’s 
children. Those who clung to this view were upheld 
by intelligent and leading men in other countries; such 
men as Herbert Spencer in England, for instance, con- 
tended that a child who received an education gained 
benefit for himself individually, but that he did not con- 
tribute to the welfare of the people as a whole, and that 
therefore he should pay for his own schooling and others 
should not be required to assist him. 
It should be specially noted that free and compulsory 
education was not established in our country for the

purpose of equipping the young so that they could get 
the most out of life individually; or at least individual 
betterment was regarded as incidental to the promotion 
of the general welfare. This view has persisted down to 
our own day and apparently is held at the present moment 
by most of those who are responsible for the support and 
administration of public schools. But there are among us 
persons who think that a graduate of a common school, 
a public high school, or a state-supported university, does 
not utilize his education for the promotion of community 
welfare so much as for his own material and social 
advancement, and they have recently expressed these 
views quite vigorously. The belief had become so wide- 
spread in our country that education is essential for good 
citizenship and that the better educated a person is 
the better citizen he becomes, that until recently one 
rarely heard a voice raised against this view. However, 
it was questioned actively and acutely by legislators in a 
number of States during the legislative months of 1923, 
and it is being questioned by boards of education as well 
as by laymen as these lines are being written. The 
occasion for questioning the value of education in pro- 
moting general welfare has arisen in connection with the 
discussion of bills for the appropriation of funds for the 
maintenance of state supported colleges and universities; 
and boards of education in some places are calling a halt 
to expenditures for public high schools. In some States, 
the funds asked for the support of universities were either 
not appropriated at all, or were greatly reduced; and the 
debates in the legislatures over the appropriation bills 
showed that there are persons among us who are sceptical 
concerning the advantage to the community of much of 
our present-day free higher education. 
During the past two decades the expenses of high 
school education have increased several fold in our coun- 
try. When public high schools were first established, only 
351 Does 
Education

or the

Primarily?
-P-A-G-E-390
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
an occasional pupil took advantage of them, but now the 
majority of pupils in many communities complete a high 
school course. This has required the multiplication of 
facilities for secondary education. Public high schools 
originally offered only one course of study; now the high 
schools in even the smallest towns offer several courses, 
and in the larger communities they offer many courses. 
The equipment in public high schools has increased 
enormously in quantity and cost during the past two 
decades, until to-day the typical high school in a city of 
twenty thousand or more inhabitants is better equipped 
in every department than was the typical college in our 
country five decades ago. As a result of the rapidly 
increasing cost of high school education, voices are just 
beginning to be heard in protest in some places. They 
have not yet made much impression upon the public and 
apparently they are not retarding the progress of second- 
ary schools, for every day one reads of the building and 
equipment of magnificent new high schools, in small as 
well as in large communities. Further, elaborately 
equipped junior high schools in which the methods of 
senior high schools are introduced—at least in part—are 
being established everywhere. More will be said about 
junior high schools at another time; they are mentioned 
here simply as an illustration of the fact that while a few 
persons in many communities think we are doing an 
injustice to some taxpayers in providing expensive free 
secondary education for all the young who wish to take 
advantage of it, still the majority of our people firmly 
believe that any boy or girl who completes a high school 
or university course will be of greater service to the 
community than one who terminates his education with 
the completion of the eighth grade or earlier. It should 
be mentioned in this connection that the Carnegie 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has taken 
a stand in its last report, just published, against public 
352
-P-A-G-E-391
  
  CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
high schools as they are at present organized and admin- 
istered, maintaining that they are far too expensive and 
that it is not just to tax a community so heavily for such 
costly education as is being provided in most communities. 
It seems certain that the proposition that the educa- 
tion of all the young contributes to the general welfare, 
increasing as the education is increased and the educa- 
tional period prolonged, will be critically examined during 
the next decade, both by the advocates and by the 
opponents of free higher education. The present writer 
has already heard a number of influential persons express 
approval of the views of the Carnegie Foundation for the 
Advancement of Teaching, referred to in the preceding 
paragraph. There are a few students of public education 
who are beginning to express doubt regarding the fairness 
and wisdom of multiplying educational facilities at public 
expense for all the young who wish to take advantage of 
them. Just recently, the present writer heard a prominent 
dean of a college of education say in an address at a large 
educational convention that our schools are becoming 
top heavy; that they are being overloaded with boys and 
girls who should be engaged in some practical work 
rather than attending school. He maintained that it was 
not worth while for more than fifteen or twenty per cent 
of the graduates of the elementary school to go forward 
into the secondary schools, and that not more than five 
per cent at most of the graduates of high schools should 
go on into colleges or universities. He argued that 
secondary and collegiate education is becoming so expen- 
sive that the educational system will break down, at 
least unless we can think of some new way of raising 
funds to support high schools, colleges, and universities. 
It is significant that the dean’s auditors seemingly 
did not sympathize with him in his doubts about the 
desirability or the possibility of continuing and extending 
our system of higher education. They listened to him in 
353 How 
Can We Pay 
the Bills?
-P-A-G-E-392
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
what appeared to be a hostile, or at least sceptical, atti- 
tude. They did not applaud his assertions. It was 
apparent that they regarded his views as reactionary. 
The people undoubtedly believe that the more education 
the better for the public good, and that there is no 
possibility, or at least no probability, of making our 
educational system too elaborate, too extensive, or too ex- 
pensive. At the same time, the discussion of the address, 
after it was completed, showed that educational specialists 
are not unaware of the fact that some persons are beginning 
to ask for evidence that boys and girls who take advantage 
of free public education for twelve or sixteen years return 
to the community as much as they receive fromit. During 
the next decade, questions of this sort will undoubtedly 
be asked freely and some plan will have to be devised to 
show conclusively to doubters, if it can be shown, that the 
more education a boy or girl receives at public expense, 
the greater service he can and does render to the commun- 
ity which supports the educational system. 
It should be added that most of our people are not 
yet terrified by the increasing cost of our schools. It is 
readily granted that education is more expensive than 
any other public enterprise, and the end does not seem to 
be in sight yet by any means. Will we go bankrupt if we 
do not call a halt to educational building and equipment? 
To the increase in teachers’ salaries? To prolongation of 
the compulsory school period? To the elaboration of the 
curriculum? To the appointment of school physicians 
and nurses? etc., etc. The friends of our public schools 
acknowledge that we cannot pay increasing education 
bills if we continue to pay as much as we have been 
paying for chewing gum, tobacco, gasoline, joy rides, 
motion pictures, women’s clothing, cosmetics, jazz music, 
extravagant furnishings in our homes, and so on. Do you 
who are reading these lines appreciate that the nation’s 
tobacco bill is greater each year than its bill for elemen- 
354
-P-A-G-E-393
CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
tary, high school, collegiate and normal school education 
all combined? Do you know that there is as much 
spent for candy and chewing gum as for all our educational 
work, and that much more is expended for automobiles 
and gasoline for joy riding than is expended for school 
buildings, equipment, textbooks, teachers, health officers 
in schools, playgrounds, and all other items of school 
work combined? Do you know that baseball and the 
theatre cost as much as our total educational bill? 
Those who approve our educational expansion and 
maintain that it should be continued claim that it really 
comes down to this: Is education of greater importance 
for national, state, and individual welfare than cigarettes, 
gasoline, confections, jewelry, silk stockings, movies, and 
the like? If we could spend as much money for education 
as we spend for luxuries—not depriving ourselves entirely 
of the latter but curtailing them a little—no nation in 
the world could keep in sight of the United States educa- 
tionally. We could build up the minds, the health, and 
the character of our young people so that they would be 
equipped to meet the new problems which are sure to 
arise in our changing social and physical conditions. 
All we need to do, say the upholders of our educational 
system, is to shave off a little from our rouge bill, gasoline 
bill, movie bill, jazz bill, and automobile bill, and we will 
have adequate funds to pay all the educational bills. 
And the happiest outcome of this program will be that 
when we have more education of the right sort, we will 
be less interested in gum, rouge, jazz, movies, tobacco, 
baseball, and confections than we are now. It works out 
that way always; the interests developed in a sound 
education lessen the craving for physical and emotional 
indulgence. 
Some readers may be asking themselves the questions: 
“Do all those who hold that public education promotes 
general welfare really believe this proposition? Do they 
355
-P-A-G-E-394
Why Do 
Parents 
Keep Their 
Children in 
Public 
Schools? 
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
keep their children in public schools because they think 
that if they are educated they can be of greater service 
to the community than if they are ignorant? Do parents 
urge their children to complete a high school and univer- 
sity course because they expect that by so doing they can 
advance the welfare of all the people in the community? 
Or do most parents keep their children in school as long 
as they can in the belief that the better educated they are 
the easier and better living they can make and the higher 
social position they can attain in the community in which 
they live? As a matter of fact, what objectives do 
American parents have in mind when they keep their 
children in public schools?” 
Unquestionably the majority of parents believe that 
a boy or girl who is well educated will get on more easily 
than one who is poorly educated. The typical American 
parent thinks more of the prosperity of his own children 
than he does of the welfare of the community in which 
they live. One who has frequently to discuss with parents 
the question of what studies their children shall pursue in 
high school or in college becomes impressed with the fact 
that most parents do not consider whether or not a par- 
ticular study will enable a child to understand the needs 
of and to serve the community in which he lives. It is 
quite rare to hear a parent say, “I would like to have 
my boy take such and such a course because he will 
receive training thereby which will help him to become a 
better citizen than he otherwise would be’’; or ‘‘Unless 
he completes such and such a course he will not under- 
stand what the needs of the community are, and he will 
not receive any stimulus to use his talents to advance 
the welfare of the community’’; or “I want my child to 
appreciate that the community has provided facilities 
for his education and so he must utilize what he gains in 
school for the benefit of all the people of the community.” 
Instead of such comments parents usually say: “I 
356
-P-A-G-E-395
    
CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
want my boy to study geometry (for instance) so that 
he will gain good mental discipline, and then he will 
be able to handle himself successfully in situations in 
which he may be placed in daily life’; or “I want him to 
study bookkeeping so that he will know how to keep 
accounts accurately when he gets out into life’; or “T 
would like to have him study Latin so that he will receive 
culture and be able to associate with cultured people’’; 
or ‘‘I wish he would study manual training so that he will 
be able to go to work at once as soon as he leaves school’’; 
or “I would like to have him take a law course because 
I believe he could make a comfortable living in the law’’; 
_ or “I don’t want him to study teaching because this is a 
poorly paid profession and I think he can do better in 
something else.’’ Not all American parents discuss the 
education of their children in such terms, but many of 
them do. 
Fortunately, an education which will best promote the 
interests of the individual will, as a rule, be of greatest 
service to the community. An individual cannot make a 
good living unless he can serve people according to their 
needs. If he becomes a skilful surgeon at the expense 
of the State—many States are now supporting medical 
institutions in which training is almost or completely 
free—he will make a good living, but he will do so by 
serving the people who have made it possible for him to 
secure his education. Of course, he may take advantage 
of the fact that he is a skilful surgeon to overcharge 
those whom he serves, and undoubtedly this is the case 
in many instances; but nevertheless the community is 
vastly better off by making it possible for men to become 
skilful surgeons at public expense than if there were 
only such surgeons and as many of them as could afford 
to defray all the expenses of their education, both general 
and professional. 
Again, one can make a fairly comfortable living who

    THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
has become an expert teacher entirely at the expense 
of the State, and he may take some advantage of the 
community in which he teaches because he is very able,— 
that is, he may secure a larger salary than he is really 
entitled to, considering that he is the beneficiary of the 
State, and that it would have been impossible for him to 
become a teacher if the State had not provided free training 
for him; and yet it is vastly better for the State to bear 
all the expense of training skilful teachers, even though 
they do not fully appreciate their responsibility to the 
State, than to depend upon the supply of teachers which 
could be secured if each one had to pay all the expenses 
of his preparation. 
Even in the case of the individual who has at public 
expense pursued studies in the elementary school, in the 
high school, and in the university which do not fit him 
for any special service to the community—not even for 
teaching—it may still be said that he is of advantage to 
the community in that he disseminates knowledge as he 
moves about among people, and in his daily life he em- 
phasizes the kind of conduct that the possession of 
knowledge confers upon one. If he has studied literature, 
mathematics, foreign languages, and the like, he will show 
some effect in his own behavior—in being more restrained 
in the indulgence of his impulses and appetites, and he 
will be able to throw light on problems which perplex 
people who have not had such training, and so he will 
be of service to the community even though he has no 
intention of serving it. His views, his conduct, his atti- 
tude in the face of intellectual and social problems will 
be emulated by the people with whom he associates; 
thus they will profit by his learning. It is probable that 
the way an educated man meets the situations of life is 
more to be desired than the way in which the uneducated 
man meets them, and so from this point of view as well 
as from the others mentioned, the influence of the edu- 
358 
   
-P-A-G-E-397
  CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
cated man in a community will be more wholesome and 
beneficial than the influence of an uneducated man. 
The American people feel the force of this principle even 
though they cannot express it definitely; it is more a 
matter of faith with them than of explicit belief. This 
faith has been sufficiently strong to maintain courses of 
study in elementary and high schools and state supported 
universities that do not bear directly upon any of the 
material or social needs of life so far as the people can see. 
The objectives which the typical parent has in view 
in keeping his children in school have partially, but not 
principally, determined the courses of study and methods 
of teaching and management in present-day American 
public schools. Parents have the bread-and-butter 
objective mainly in view in planning the education of 
their children. This does not mean that they advise 
their children to pursue studies which will prepare them 
directly for earning money when they leave school or 
college, though some parents do give their children just 
such advice. When they come to the school to talk with 
teachers regarding the work of their children, it is evident 
that they want them to study “practical”’ things; this is 
not true of all parents, but it is probably true of a majority 
of them. At the same time, they may be willing that 
their children should complete a course in algebra, for 
instance, not because they think it will be of direct 
service to them in making their way in the world, but 
they believe it will discipline the mental faculties; and 
one can make an easier living with a disciplined than with 
an undisciplined mind. Probably not more than five 
parents in a hundred chosen at random would advise their 
children to study algebra and geometry, for instance, 
merely in order that they may understand these subjects 
and gain intellectual benefits from them, even though 
they cannot apply them practically or gain mental 
discipline from them which they can use in the practical 
359 The

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
situations of daily life. As a matter of fact, astronomy 
has but few followers in present-day American education, 
and algebra is losing some portion of its once large fol- 
lowing, even in the universities; and one reason why 
these branches are not popular is because they seem to be 
detached from the practical needs of life. Other subjects 
are offered in high schools and universities that are but 
little patronized for the same reason that astronomy and 
algebra are neglected. 
The studies that are most numerously and eagerly 
pursued are those that apparently have direct reference to 
some profitable vocation or profession, or that have the 
reputation of being good subjects for mental discipline. 
During the past decade, there has been a shifting of em- 
phasis in respect to studies in secondary schools, colleges, 
and universities. The experience of the World War 
gave tremendous impetus to applied science and economic 
subjects; but just now students are drifting away from 
these studies and electing others in their place, according 
as they hear that there are good opportunities in one or 
another calling,—in teaching, for instance, or in journal- 
ism, or in certain commercial fields. In the high school 
there has been a continual drift away from the so-called 
cultural studies into applied science and commercial and 
vocational subjects. 
If left to themselves, and not taking account of the 
question of difficulty of mastery, pupils would, as a rule, 
choose the studies that their parents favor. They think of 
studies principally as means for advancing their material 
welfare and improving their social status. Studies that 
they believe will help them to make the most money and 
enjoy the greatest social prestige are the studies they will 
choose, as a rule, though individual interests and emula- 
tion play a réle in determining their choices. The value 
of a study because of the social distinction which it 
confers upon its votaries plays a more important part in 
360

the southern and eastern than in the northern and 
western parts of the country. Latin, for instance, is 
more generally regarded in the East and South as the 
subject of chief value in the curriculum than is true in the 
North and West. The study of Latin in most high schools 
and colleges in the South, and to a lesser extent in the 
East, distinguishes a pupil from his classmates and sets 
him above them in culture and mental acumen. It is 
considered that one who pursues this subject is not so 
much under the dominance of practical needs as one who 
studies vocational, commercial, agricultural, or even 
scientific subjects. The pupil who pursues Latin is 
likely to enjoy more leisure and so-called cultured life 
than one who pursues other subjects. In the South and 
East the studies that are looked upon by a considerable 
proportion of the people as of least merit are those that 
relate most directly to the earning of a livelihood, while 
this is not the case, as a rulc, in either the high schools 
or the colleges of the northern and western sections of 
our country. 
The typical parent in every section of the country 
would like to have his children pursue studies which 
would enable them to get along well with the people 
among whom they must spend their lives. Even the 
parent who has given very little attention to the matter 
recognizes that certain studies are ‘fashionable’ and 
that everyone must have some knowledge of them in 
order to avoid criticism by his associates. The greater 
his knowledge of them, the more highly he will be regarded 
by his friends. History, literature, music, and art are, 
as a rule, the subjects that the layman regards as essential 
in order that his children may avoid the criticism and 
secure the admiration of those with whom they come in 
contact. In most sections of the country, an adult who 
could talk glibly about current topics in literature would 
be ranked as a superior person in culture and people

  THE. CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
would pay him homage. Even practical minded people 
place high value upon the ability to enumerate names and 
dates in history and to converse easily about the character- 
istics of books that are regarded as “‘significant’’. 
The typical parent does not regard it as important 
that his children should study subjects that would help 
them to understand human nature in its deeper aspects 
in order that they may adapt themselves harmoniously 
to people. Psychology and philosophy would not prosper 
in any secondary school unless they were presented so 
that they would relate directly to teaching, and then 
those who were preparing for the teaching profession 
would pursue them while all others would leave them 
untouched. In the colleges and universities psychology 
is quite popular, but this is because it is regarded as 
essential in preparation for several vocations and pro- 
fessions,—journalism, teaching, medicine, and law. 
Courses in psychology that are designed to give an under- 
standing of human nature without reference to any 
practical application are not largely elected in the colleges 
or universities. In other words, while parents wish 
their children to study subjects which will be of value to 
them in their intercourse with people, still they have in 
view superficial rather than profound social adjustment. 
We have not yet grown out of the practice which Herbert 
Spencer condemned ninety years ago in England,— 
parents wish their children to be educated according to 
the customs and fashions of the times. This is not 
altogether a disadvantage so far as the welfare either of 
the individual or of society is concerned, since taken as a 
whole, people appreciate knowledge of substantial worth, 
and they praise the individual who possesses such knowl- 
edge more than one whose knowledge is purely spectacular 
so that it cannot be used for the betterment of the com- 
munity in any way. 
The typical parent places some but not supreme 
362
-P-A-G-E-401
  
CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
value upon studies that free the mind of a child from fear 
and superstition, but which do not relate in any way, so 
far as he can see, to the child’s social or material advance- 
ment. ‘To refer to the subject of astronomy again: the 
typical parent does not think that it would be worth 
while for his child to master this subject in order that he 
might thereby solve intellectual problems and increase 
the range of his mental vision. It does not seem to most 
parents that intellectual needs arising out of the com- 
plexity of the world in which one lives are as vital as 
physical needs; it is not generally considered that mental 
hunger is as pressing or as important as physical hunger. 
Indeed, the typical parent, in laying out a course of 
study for his child, takes slight account of intellectual 
needs as distinct from physical or social needs. He does 
not think that there can be intellectual pain from lack 
of understanding of the laws that operate in one’s en- 
vironment, as. there may be distressing physical pain 
due to lack of harmony with the physical environment. 
Finally, the typical parent does not strongly urge his 
children to pursue studies that enable them to dis- 
criminate between the things that are aesthetically 
admirable and those that are commonplace or ugly. 
The majority of patrons of the schools can hardly be 
convinced that a child has aesthetic needs that are 
comparable with his physical needs in their urgency and 
importance. Most parents would not of their own accord 
provide studies for their children which would enable 
them to reconstruct their environments so as to increase 
aesthetic objects and eliminate ugly ones, or to create 
aesthetic things appealing either to the eye or to the ear. 
The introduction of such studies into the elementary and 
high schools has, generally speaking, been opposed 
by parents in the belief that they are merely “‘faddish” 
and ‘freakish’ as compared with the studies that 
have direct bearing upon the earning of money or

The Chief 
Objective in 
American 
Schools

meeting the demands of the environment socially. 
From this brief review it may be inferred that the 
objectives in present-day American schools are not 
being determined solely by parents or by pupils. If they 
were we would now have quite different courses of study 
from those we actually have in all our schools. The 
courses would be much less complex and highly dif- 
ferentiated than they are. They would relate almost 
entirely either to making a living in a profession or a 
vocation, or to acquiring attainments which are thought 
to be essential in securing social prestige. But if parents 
are not determining the objectives in our schools, then 
who is determining them? ‘Teachers and students of 
education primarily. They have led and are now leading 
the way. They are accomplishing this through in- 
vestigations in laboratory and classroom and discussion 
at educational meetings and in educational journals. 
And there is one objective that is becoming fundamental 
in American education, and that is,—preparation for all 
the needs of actual life. And what are these needs, as 
they are being agreed upon to-day and made the basis of 
the work in every phase of our educational system from 
the kindergarten through the graduate school of the 
university? First of all they are social, including personal, 
civic, and political relations. The leaders who are most 
frequently mentioned to-day in American education are 
those who are teaching that the chief need in life is 
harmonious adjustment to the people among whom one 
lives. Our educational psychologists maintain that nature 
has so constituted a human being that when his fellows 
show him honor, good will, and friendship he will be 
happy. On the other hand, when they are hostile toward 
him, when he is conscious that they are against him and 
not with him, he will be downcast and unhappy. Nature 
has established this as a fundamental law of human 
nature in order that people will be incited to live in 
364
-P-A-G-E-403
CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
accord with the demands of their fellows. If men had 
been so constituted that they did not care what their 
fellows thought about them, human society as we know 
it would be impossible. In developing human society 
nature had to equip a human being with emotions so 
that the indifference, hostility, or condemnation of his 
fellows would give him the keenest possible pain, and 
lead him to avoid the kind of conduct that brings con- 
demnation and practice the conduct that wins approval 
and friendship. A human being not constructed on this 
plan is abnormal or degenerate. 
We see now why the chief purpose of the school in 
America is to make an individual social. It is to teach 
him so that he will understand how he must live in order 
to dwell in peace and harmony with his associates. The 
school must, it is true, prepare him to make a living in a 
purely physical sense, but this is not the chief business of 
life at all. It is probably the chief concern of crude, primi- 
tive people who live close to the earth and whose chief 
need is to get enough to eat and to be protected from the 
elements; but the chief needs of one living in America to- 
day are very different from those of a savage in the forest. 
How is this conception affecting the work of the 
schools in our country? We are coming to believe that a 
pupil should, above everything else, be trained to be a 
social being. He must learn to read, to write, and to 
spell, so that he may participate in what his ancestors 
have achieved, and what his associates are now achieving, 
and so that he may communicate his experiences to them. 
This should be the guiding aim always in the teaching of 
reading, writing, and spelling. A pupil should study 
history in order that he may learn the course over which 
the race has come, and so that he may understand the 
conditions essential to the welfare of human society in the 
present. The learning of dates and names in history, 
unless they help a pupil to understand modern society 
365 
 
-P-A-G-E-404
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
and adapt himself to it, is considered to be useless. The 
pupil should study geography in order that he may be a 
citizen of the world, and not simply of the street or town 
in which he happens to live at the moment. He should 
learn that human society to-day is bound together very 
closely, and while people may be separated in space they 
are, or should be, very close together in spirit;—we are 
all members of one body, and the conduct of one indi- 
vidual has an influence upon all his fellows. The pupil 
should study literature as a concrete presentation of 
social conduct. He should see that codperation and 
altruism yield pleasure and happiness in the end, while 
antipathy and selfishness are certain to yield pain and 
unhappiness. 
Thus American educational practice is being deter- 
mined by the view that while the physical needs in human 
life are primordial they are nevertheless not of primary 
importance, for the reason that, we have learned how to 
provide for our physical needs without devoting most 
of our attention or most of our energy thereto.. By means 
of inventions we are making petroleum, coal, water 
power, electric power, and the winds do most of the 
work necessary to provide food, clothing, and shelter, 
so that we may be physically comfortable. The majority 
of the people in American life to-day devote only a small 
part of their thought and energy in any one day to pro- 
viding for their physical needs. They devote a great 
deal more time and energy to the effort to solve the 
problems, first, of securing the esteem, goodwill, respect, 
and confidence of their fellows; and, second, of organizing 
and conducting community, state, and national life so 
that every individual may to the fullest extent possible 
receive all the benefits that flow from codperative living 
in highly developed groups. There should be no mis- 
understanding here; it is recognized in educational 
theory to-day that everyone has physical needs and 
366 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
  CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
that these should be provided for in our educational 
régime. There should be studies that relate to the 
securing of food, clothing, and shelter, and the pro- 
tection of health, but these should not occupy the 
most important place in the curriculum, either in the 
elementary school, in the high school, or in the college. 
But rather the educational materials that are concerned 
with personal, civic, and political relations, that show 
how people can live together in small and in large groups 
so as best to promote the interests and well-being of all, 
are regarded as of chief importance, and they are coming 
to play, if they do not already play, the chief rdle in our 
courses of study. 
Acceptance of the social as the main objective of work 
in our schools has not been easy for parents and laymen, 
for the reason that it seems to them more or less visionary 
to maintain that the social need in American life to-day 
is greater than the physical or any other need. But 
educational psychologists are showing that the largest , 
part of one’s thoughts and feelings relate to his social 
adjustments. Most of his pleasures and pains have their 
source in his social contacts. The unsuccessful and 
unhappy individual is the one who is ill-adapted to the 
people about him because of temperamental, moral, or 
aesthetic deficiencies, rather than the one who does not 
have enough food, clothing, or shelter. There may be a 
few of the latter in every community, but the number is 
insignificant when compared with the total number of 
persons in the community. Further, the most stable and 
prosperous nation is the one in which the people are best 
organized and best trained in group adjustment and 
codperation, rather than the one that is most prolific in 
material resources. 
There is another objective which teachers and students 
of education have been pressing forward, and they have 
succeeded in securing an important place for it in the

elementary and high school, in the college, and in the 
university, and this is the intellectual objective—enlarging 
the range of one’s mental vision, pushing back the bounda- 
ries of knowledge and understanding so that one may 
know how the world in which he lives is constructed and 
how it operates. Educational psychologists are showing 
that one who does not understand the laws of the world 
in which he lives will be a victim to a greater or less extent 
of superstition and fear. Therefore, say the leaders in 
educational thought, all pupils should pursue studies that 
interpret the laws of nature, even though the knowledge 
thus gained cannot be applied to increasing one’s material 
well-being or social prestige. Take physics or botany, 
for instance. These subjects may not have for the typical 
pupil any material or social value of importance, but 
they may have tremendous intellectual value in helping 
him to understand the phenomena of the world in which 
_he lives. Every normal person, so it is urged, will come 
in contact constantly with these phenomena, and for this 
reason his education should assist him to comprehend 
them and to discover the laws that govern them. 
In arranging the program of the schools so that they 
will prepare for the needs of life, teachers and students 
of education are laying stress upon still another objective. 
It is maintained that the welfare of every normal person 
is determined largely by the aesthetic or unaesthetic 
character of the objects and sounds he encounters in 
daily life. He cannot remain neutral in his environment. 
He either is pleased or is distressed by the sights and 
sounds that play upon him; some of them exalt the tide 
of life—increase his strength and pleasure—while others 
lower the tide of life and detract from his comfort and 
happiness. The latter objects and situations we regard 
as ugly or unharmonious, while those that increase our 
delight and stability we regard as beautiful or harmoni- 
ous. So American schools have, after considerable oppo- 
368
-P-A-G-E-407
CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
sition from Jaymen and parents, introduced into the cur- 
riculum subjects that teach the child how he can eliminate 
or modify the objects and sounds about him that cause 
distress and increase those that give him pleasure because 
of their aesthetic qualities. Singing, playing on musical 
instruments, drawing, painting, designing, etc., have come 
to play an important rédle in American schools, though 
some persons still condemn them by calling them “‘fads”’ 
and ‘‘frills’”. But the educational psychologist has been 
analyzing the sources of happiness and of distress in 
human life, and he has reached the conclusion that one’s 
well-being is determined in an important degree by the 
aesthetic character of the things upon which he looks 
and to which he listens. 
Finally, it is urged by teachers and students of edu- 
cation, as well as by parents and laymen, that one’s well- 
being will be determined in a large measure by his fitness 
to perform some definite task which contributes to the 
welfare of society as a whole or one of its subordinate 
groups. In other words, most individuals must be pre- 
pared to practice a profession or a vocation which renders 
service to society. So our schools are shaping their pro- 
grams so that they can attain the general objectives which 
are of importance for all individuals —physical welfare, 
social adjustment, intellectual understanding, and aes- 
thetic appreciation and creativeness; then the object- 
ive of vocational or professional skill must be attained. 
This is the program which schools throughout America 
have entered upon and are trying to perfect, and which 
will be considered in detail in later chapters. It is as 
true of schools in rural sections as of those in towns and 
cities, that they are seeking to construct courses of study 
and to adopt methods of teaching and management 
which will assist the young to attain these objectives. 
In the early history of our country, the schools were 
not free; parents paid for the tuition of their children. 
369 The 
Professional 
or Vocational 
Objective

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
Summary Free and compulsory education was established only 
| after a long struggle. It was believed formerly that edu- 
cation was of value primarily to the individual who re- 
ceived it; but the idea gradually grew in the minds of our 
forefathers that every person who could read, write, and 
calculate according to the needs of daily life and who had 
learned something about religion and the founding of our 
government and the principles of freedom upon which it 
is maintained, would make a better citizen than one who 
could not read or write and so would have to depend upon — 
others for information regarding the nature of our govern- 
ment and what is demanded of every individual in order 
that it should continue to be strong, stable, and prosper- 
ous. The belief has now become widespread in our coun- 
try that education is essential for good citizenship and 
that the better educated a person is the better citizen he 
becomes. Very recently voices have been raised against 
this view, but they have not yet shaken the faith of our 
people in the need of free and compulsory education for 
the welfare of the nation. 
The expenses of education have increased fourfold 
in our country during the past two decades, and just now 
there is vigorous debate as to whether we can continue to 
support so expensive an educational system. The ques- 
tion is being asked widely to-day,—How can we pay the 
mounting bills for education? Many people are answer- 
ing this question by saying that we must choose between 
education on the one hand and various luxuries in which 
we indulge, such as tobacco, automobiles, gasoline, 
motion pictures, expensive clothing, cosmetics, jazz music, 
and the like, on the other hand. 
The majority of parents unquestionably believe that 
a boy or girl who is well educated will get on more easily 
in life than one who is poorly educated, and so they keep 
their children in school. The typical parent probably 
does not keep his children in school primarily so that they 
370
-P-A-G-E-409
CHANGING OBJECTIVES IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS 
may become better citizens. Some parents send their chil- 
dren to school so that they may secure mental discipline 
in the belief that this will help them to solve success- 
fully the problems which may arise in their daily lives. 
But fortunately, the education that will be of greatest 
service to the individual in fitting him for the needs of 
daily life will be of greatest value also for the community. 
A well educated person is an asset to the community even 
though he may not serve it directly. His views, his con- 
duct, and his attitude in dealing with social and intellec- 
tual problems will be of value to the community. 
The objectives which parents have in view in sending 
their children to school are not in all cases the same as the 
objectives which superintendents, principals, and teachers 
have in view in determining courses of study and methods 
of teaching. Parents generally urge their children to 
pursue courses that have direct reference to some profit- 
able vocation or that have the reputation of being good 
subjects for mental discipline. During the past decade 
there has been a marked shifting of emphasis in respect 
to studies in elementary schools and colleges, due to the 
fact that new commercial and professional opportunities 
have magnified the importance of commercial and pro- 
fessional subjects. | 
The typical parent would like to have his children 
become adjusted harmoniously to the people among 
whom they live, but he does not, as a rule, advise them 
to pursue subjects that would help them to understand 
human nature in its deeper aspects. Psychology and 
philosophy would not prosper in any secondary school; 
and the latter subject, at least, is declining in colleges. 
However, psychology in its applied aspects is increasing 
in popularity. 
Parents usually wish their children to pursue studies 
which are fashionable so that they may gain in prestige 
in the community in which they live. The typical parent 
371 
   
-P-A-G-E-410
    THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
does not appreciate the value of studies that dispel fear 
and superstitition. He does not value highly studies 
that cultivate a child’s aesthetic appreciation and that 
give him skill in modifying the objects in his environment 
with a view to increasing their aesthetic value. Parents 
have generally spoken of the introduction of aesthetic 
subjects into the schools as faddish and ephemeral. 
s ‘The chief objectives in American schools are not being 
determined primarily by parents but rather by those who 
conduct the schools, who are teaching that the first aim 
of the school should be to help pupils to understand and to 
adapt themselves to the people about them in harmonious 
relations. So the chief objective in our schools now is so- 
cial adaptation, which includes personal and civic relations. 
The curricula, methods, and discipline in our schools are 
being determined largely in view of this chief objective. 
¥ It is recognized in American schools that each in- 
dividual has physical needs which should be taken 
account of in his education, but these needs are not 
primary; or at least they are not of chief consequence in 
contemporary American life. They should not be 
ignored, but they should not be exalted to first place in 
our educational system. 
It is becoming universally agreed by educational 
people that the school should enlarge the pupil’s under- 
standing of the world in which he lives so that he will 
not suffer from fear or seek superstitious explanations of 
the phenomena occurring in his environment. It is 
also agreed that every pupil should have training which 
will enable him to increase the aesthetic objects in his 
environment and modify or eliminate the objects and 
situations that cause discord and disharmony. 
Finally, we are aiming in our schools to train pupils 
for some vocation or profession in the belief that he who 
is prepared to pull his own oar when he leaves school will 
make the best citizen and will get most out of life himself.

CHANGING COURSES OF STUDY 
EADERS of this volume whose memory of school 
R work extends back over a period of twenty-five 
years, and who are also familiar with the changes 
that are taking place at the present time in the curricula 
of the elementary and the high school, undoubtedly ask 
occasionally (the present writer has often been asked 
these questions): 
“Why should there be such constant change in the 
branches that are taught in the schools?” 
“What is the necessity for incessantly shifting em- 
phasis, now on one branch, now on another; now intro- 
ducing a new study, and again eliminating or curtailing 
an older one?” 
“Would it not be possible, and if possible would it 
not be desirable to agree upon the studies of greatest 
worth in education and then stick to them?” 
‘“‘Are not American teachers and school boards fickle 
and faddish in their educational notions?” 
“Ts it feasible to give pupils a sound education when 
those who manage the schools and teach pupils do not 
know what materials of education are of lasting worth?” 
“Ts it not true that the present generation of children 
do not possess the power of prolonged concentration on 
mental tasks which was possessed by preceding genera- 
tions?” 
“Ts it right that every person in a community who has 
a freak idea about the training of the young should have 
an opportunity to introduce it into the course of study?”

Why Are 
Our Schools 
So Different 
From Most 
European 
and Oriental 
Schools? THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
are continually remarking upon the rapid changes taking 
place in the courses of study in American schools. The 
writer has heard men in a number of foreign countries 
condemn our educational system because of its lack of | 
stability. They have said that we do not know our own 
minds; we take up a fad in education, ride it hard for 
a few years, and then abandon it for another fad. Itisa 
comment very frequently heard in most foreign countries, 
that so many subjects are taught in American schools 
that nothing is thoroughly learned by pupils and they 
acquire the habit of incessantly jumping from one topic 
to another, with the result that most of them become 
scatterbrained as compared with pupils in European and 
Oriental schools, who study only two or three or, at the 
most, four subjects at a time. It is charged that we 
do not train our pupils to be students or scholars; we 
simply entertain them with a great variety of superficial 
knowledge. | 
One reason for the difference between the courses of 
study in American as compared with European and 
Oriental schools is found in the fact that in our country 
society is plastic and mobile, while in foreign countries it 
is fixed and unchangeable for the most part. We have 
no barriers which prevent the members of one economic 
or social group from emerging out of their group and 
entering another one. A father does not pass on his 
vocation, profession, or social status to his son; the son 
may engage in an altogether different occupation from 
his father, and occupy a very different social and economic 
position. But this is not the case in European and 
Oriental countries; or at least it has not been so until the 
present moment. As a consequence of the World War, 
the countries of the Old World may regain plasticity and 
mobility; at the present writing there are indications 
that the old order is changing—it has broken up completely 
in at least one nation, and it threatens to break at any

moment in other countries. But in most foreign countries 
society is still so non-plastic that social and political 
relationships do not change materially from one gener- 
ation to another. An individual is born into a class or 
caste and is trained for his duties therein; and there is 
slight chance that he will shift from one class to another 
during his lifetime. 
When there is hardly any change in social or political 
ideals or manner of life in a country from one generation 
to another, the training of the young in any one gen- 
eration will consist in impressing upon them the ideals 
and practices of preceding generations. If a child is 
destined to become a member of the peasant class in 
a European or Oriental country, he will be trained 
therefor just about as his father, grandfather, great- 
grandfather, and on back for many generations were 
trained. There is no need to introduce anything very 
new into this system of education because there is little 
a child will have to do in his life that his ancestors did 
not have to do before him. It would disturb the social 
order if the members of the rising generation should be 
trained differently from the generations that preceded 
them. An American who keeps this fact in mind will 
not be surprised when he goes into a European or Oriental 
school to observe pupils pursuing practically the same 
course of study that had been pursued by their ancestors 
for centuries. 
Just before the outbreak of the World War, the writer 
inspected Mohammedan schools in North Africa. Children 
were observed doing exactly the same kind of work and 
in just the same way as was done a thousand years ago, 
according to the records we have of early schools. The 
writer also inspected schools in a number of European 
countries, and he saw work going on in most of them that 
very closely resembled the description of school work

new studies embodying recent discoveries and extensions 
in our knowledge of man and nature and the develop- 
ment of the young were not introduced into the schools, 
teachers usually replied—‘‘We think our children ought 
to study classical subjects—those that have permanent 
value and not the new and ephemeral subjects.”’ And 
without exception teachers, and also laymen, when 
pushed for a justification of their narrow course of study— 
they did not themselves call it narrow—would say that 
the proper task of a school is to give children the rudi- 
ments of knowledge—mainly reading, writing, and 
numbers, to transmit to them the classical literature of 
the race, to discipline the mental faculties, and to develop 
good mental habits by difficult studies. According to 
this theory, two or three studies that rigorously discipline 
mental faculties are better than dozens of subjects 
that do not require severe application. 
There is another principle which has played and still 
plays an important réle in differentiating European and 
Oriental from American schools in respect to courses of 
study. We are living in the present more than in the 
past; we think more about what we are going to achieve 
in the future than about what our ancestors have achieved. 
Every day in our country we hear of new accomplish- 
ments in every field of thought and endeavor; and this 
has put us in a constantly expectant attitude. We an- 
ticipate that we will be better off to-morrow than we are 
to-day, because we will make improvements in every 
phase of our life. Since we are so well pleased with the 
present and are looking forward all the time for even 
better things in the future, we do not have a high regard, 
certainly not a reverence, for the achievements of the past. 
But it is exactly the reverse in many of the European 
and in all of the Oriental countries. The present and the 
future are of minor importance as compared with the 
past. This is not as true at the present moment of 
376

Russia, England, and Germany as it was before the war, 
but it is still true in other countries. Nothing produced 
in the present is considered by these peoples to possess 
as great value as the products of the past. They look 
backward rather than forward, so they train their chil- 
dren on ancient rather than on modern knowledge. They 
do not like the term “‘modern’’, and they look with sus- 
picion upon individuals who advise them to become 
modern. However, the World War lessened the con- 
fidence of some of the Old World peoples in the superior 
value of things ancient, and just now there is talk in 
certain of these countries of modernizing the course of 
study. ‘These are the same peoples that have condemned 
the schools of America because they have given a larger 
place to modern than to ancient studies. They have 
believed that America was making a mistake in giving 
such prominence in all schools to studies that aim to 
interpret present-day life and train pupils to adjust 
themselves thereto. 
It was said in Chapter XVII that American edu- 
cators are seeking to develop courses of study for all our 
schools which will assist the young directly to under- 
stand the world in which they live and to adjust them- 
selves effectively thereto—not simply the physical world 
but also the intellectual, social, and aesthetic world. 
The slogan of American teachers during the last few 
years has been—*“*The school must prepare for the needs 
of actual life.’”’ —Thousands of men and women are devot- 
ing themselves to a study of the question,—What is 
meant by “actual life” to-day in our country, and what 
education does an individual need in order to meet the 
requirements of actual life? There is one phase of this 
investigation which has been carried forward in America 
farther and faster than in any other country, and it has 
played and is now playing the dominant réle in modify- 
ing courses of study in all our schools. This investigation

Schools THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
is seeking to determine to what extent, if at all, any par- 
ticular study can train mental faculties so that power 
will be developed which can be applied in all the situa- 
tions of actual life. It was said in preceding paragraphs 
that the course of study in European and Oriental schools 
is based largely upon the doctrine that the proper func- 
tion of the school is to discipline the faculties of the 
mind, and any subject that is well adapted to this pur- 
pose will be valuable, even though it has no direct refer- 
ence to any need which will arise in daily life. 
People who rely upon “common sense” for their 
knowledge of human nature generally hold the view that 
the mind is so constructed that if it is exercised in any 
way it will acquire a power or strength or ability which 
can be used in any way whatsoever, just as if a muscle 
is exercised in any specific way the strength developed 
can be utilized in a general way. Thus if a person goes 
into a gymnasium and by pulling weights develops his 
arm and back muscles, he can use the strength he has thus 
gained in any way he wishes—in pitching hay, in chop- 
ping wood, in boxing, in rowing, in milking cows, or in 
any other activity. Is this proposition true? It has been 
shown time and again that it is not true as _ stated. 
People are specialists in muscular activities. In the high 
schools, colleges, and universities an adult is not likely 
to be good in all branches of athletics. One who is ex- | 
cellent in rowing may be no good at all in boxing, wres- 
tling, vaulting, sprinting, or in baseball, football, or 
gymnastics. People who have endurance in walking on 
level ground may lack endurance in climbing mountains. 
Men who can walk all day long in a furrow behind a plow 
usually tire quickly when they walk on a sidewalk in the 
city. | 
Illustrations might be multiplied ad libitum to show 
that muscular skill gained in a special activity is confined 
almost wholly to that special activity. One who has 
378
-P-A-G-E-419
CHANGING COURSES OF STUDY 
tremendous strength and endurance in a special activity 
may have to begin de novo to build up strength and 
endurance if he engages in a different activity. There 
is probably some slight general training derived from 
any vigorous muscular activity in the way of developing 
breathing power and stimulating vital organs so that 
they can respond to vigorous demands. So far as any 
special kind of muscular activity will increase breathing 
capacity and strengthen digestive, assimilative, and elimi- 
native organs, it will have general value, because when 
the individual takes up a different kind of muscular 
activity he will make use of the breathing, digestive, 
assimilative, and eliminative functions. 
The principle that specific exercise develops specific 
and not general skill, ability, and endurance, has occu- 
pied the attention of our educational psychologists and » 
teachers for the last twenty or twenty-five years more 
than any other single question in psychology or edu- 
cation. Innumerable persons have discussed the problem, 
in addresses and in articles, and many investigators 
have studied it experimentally. For a quarter of a cen- 
tury, men and women have fought and bled over this doc- 
trine of formal mental discipline. While European and 
Oriental psychologists and educators have, for the most 
part, endorsed the doctrine that mental exercise in any 
specific field develops general mental power, American 
psychologists and teachers maintain that it has been 
demonstrated experimentally that the doctrine is untrue, 
at least as it has been utilized in determining the relative 
values of studies in the schools. Twenty-five years ago, 
it was generally maintained, alike by teachers and by 
laymen, that the studies of greatest value for all pupils 
were arithmetic and grammar, because these subjects 
more than any others developed the reasoning powers. 
Spelling was considered valuable partly because it de- 
veloped memory. Of course, every teacher and probably 
379 
 
-P-A-G-E-420
The 
Doctrine 
of Formal 
Discipline 
is Still 
Believed 
by Some THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
every layman believed that the rudiments of reading, 
writing, spelling, and numbers had to be mastered by all 
children in order that they might get on in daily life; but 
a considerable part of each of these “tools of knowledge”’ 
was taught because it was deemed to be valuable for 
mental discipline, even if it were not of practical service 
in actual life. But the educational psychologists, and 
the teachers of an analytical and inquisitive turn of mind, 
who have been observing and investigating this matter 
for the last two decades, have reached the conclusion 
that it is wasteful and unjustifiable to teach any subject 
merely because of its theoretical value in disciplining 
the faculties of the mind. If a subject or topic will not 
function in any of the situations in which one will be 
placed in actual life, it will have slight value in his ed- 
ucation, and it ought to give way to some other subject 
_ or topic that will be related directly to his physical, 
intellectual, social, or aesthetic needs. 
It would require many volumes the size of this one 
to present a résumé of the discussions and investigations 
of the doctrine of formal discipline; and the debate is not 
yet concluded. Some persons, laymen particularly, 
though a few college presidents and professors should be 
included, still believe in the doctrine and try to base our 
courses of study on it. Speaking generally, but allowing 
for exceptions, the teachers of the classics and, to a lesser 
extent, the teachers of mathematics hold that a study is 
valuable just in the measure that it disciplines mental 
faculties, and not in the measure that it can be utilized 
directly in any of the experiences of daily life. Some of 
the teachers of English grammar hold the same view. 
The present writer has recently heard teachers of arith- 
metic complain because of the way in which the subject 
is being curtailed by the elimination of tables and meas- 
ures and processes that are believed by those who have 
rejected the doctrine of formal discipline to be of slight 
380
-P-A-G-E-421
CHANGING COURSES OF STUDY 
value in actual life to-day. Some teachers maintain that 
even if the tables of stone or lumber measure, or cube 
root, or partial payments will not be used by one out of a 
thousand children who are now in the schools, neverthe- 
less these matters should be studied because of the mental 
power which they develop. 
The educational psychologists and the more ‘‘radical”’ 
teachers maintain that this is an illusion, and they 
demand that these topics, and others like them, should 
be deleted from the arithmetic required of all pupils. 
They point to experiments which have been made which 
show that pupils who have learned to reason in arithmetic 
may not be able on this account alone to reason much, if 
any better in grammar, logic, ethics, psychology, or in any 
of the practical situations of daily life. Further, they 
call attention to the fact that persons who have devoted 
many years to reasoning in mathematics or in languages 
or in mechanics, or in any other special field, may be 
quite incapable of sound reasoning in any department but 
the special one in which they have had special training. 
A grammarian, for instance, if he has had no training in 
economics, may reason very feebly and inaccurately in 
this latter field. The ability to reason is a specific and 
not a general ability. Indeed, persons who have been 
put through elaborate formal training in the elementary 
and high school and in college are often entirely incapable 
of dealing with the complicated problems that arise in 
connection with the work of a board of education, a 
board of health, a common council, a governor’s office, a 
kitchen, or a nursery. It has frequently been noted by 
observers that some of the most conspicuous failures in 
the training of children are persons who have completed 
long courses of study based on the doctrine of formal 
discipline. 
So in respect to the practice of attempting to train 
memory through the spelling of long lists of words that 
381 But it Has 
Been Shown 
to be 
Fallacious
-P-A-G-E-422
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
are not used in actual life,—it has been shown by in- 
vestigators that the kind of memory trained by learning 
to spell words orally is of little or no service in the situ- 
ations in which people are placed in daily life. It is 
not even of much service in spelling, because people who 
can spell a bookful of words orally often make blunders 
when they write these words in a letter or in an article. 
Memory is specific in its functioning. It may work well 
in the special way in which it has been trained but not 
in other ways. An experienced ticket agent may be able 
to remember details about fares and time-tables to a 
phenomenal extent, but he may not be able to remember 
people’s names, or any facts of history, literature, or 
economics any better than, and often not as well as, a 
person who cannot remember very much about fares or 
time-tables. 
The writer has colleagues whose memory for historical 
facts, or botanical facts, or mathematical facts, or 
psychological facts, is extraordinary, but outside their 
special fields their memory is very ordinary. One man 
has a marvelous memory for legal facts, including details 
of cases and decisions of courts and judges, but he often 
forgets the names of his friends, and he hardly ever 
remembers to go to his meals on time. He says he has 
forgotten all the mathematics he ever learned, even some 
parts of the multiplication tables. He has a wonderful 
memory for all details that belong to his profession, but 
he has a treacherous memory for other things. Every 
normal mind operates on this plan. This is why people 
who are in touch with the results of investigations say 
that it is wasteful to teach pupils ten thousand words, 
most of which they will never use in daily life, merely to 
discipline their memory. 
So, while the problem of the extent to which mental 
activity in any specific field will develop power that can 
be utilized in different fields is still under investigation, 
382
-P-A-G-E-423
  
CHANGING COURSES OF STUDY 
nevertheless the question is practically settled so far as it 
affects educational procedure in most of our schools. 
During the past decade, educational psychologists, super- 
intendents, principals, and teachers throughout the 
country have been examining all the studies in the 
elementary and high school with a view to selecting 
subjects and topics that relate quite directly to the needs 
of actual life and disregarding others. Topics and sub- 
jects that have been retained in courses of study merely 
for the purpose of training mental faculties have been 
marked for deletion. There is greater activity at the 
present moment in this than in any other phase of 
educational investigation and discussion in America. 
Already there is general agreement regarding many of the 
subjects and topics that should be taught in the schools, 
and agreement also regarding certain subjects and topics 
that have been taught heretofore but that have ceased 
to be of value and so they ought to be eliminated. It is 
impossible now to stop the movement in American schools 
to reconstruct courses of study on the basis of direct 
usefulness in actual life, although there are voices raised 
against this desecration of curricula, as they regard the 
matter. 
The abandonment of the doctrine of formal discipline 
and the whole-hearted adoption by most educational 
psychologists and educators of the principle that the 
schools of whatever grade should teach pupils knowledge 
and skill that will be of service to them in daily life will 
explain what is happening to our courses of study, which 
so perplexes European and Oriental visitors to our coun- 
try, and which is mystifying even to some of our own 
people. New subjects and topics relating to health, 
economics, citizenship, thrift, science, household arts, 
industry, agriculture, relations of capital and labor, 
music, art, etc., are being incorporated into the courses of 
study of the elementary and high schools, as well as the

colleges and universities. Traditional subjects, such as 
spelling, are being severely pruned. Twenty-five years 
ago pupils learned to spell from ten to fifteen thousand 
words; but as a result of investigations carried on during 
the past two decades, it has been found that the typical 
graduate of a high school does not need in his school work, 
and will not need in later life, to spell more than three 
thousand words at the outside, unless he engages in some 
technical pursuit, when it may be necessary for him to 
master a special and technical vocabulary. The typical 
American in his correspondence and in his writing for 
the newspapers rarely employs more than fifteen hundred 
different words; many of us never use more than half this 
number. In view of these facts, the course in spelling in 
the schools to-day is being constructed on the principle 
that the words that will be actually used in daily life 
should be mastered so that they can be spelled auto- 
matically, and the technical and unusual words that were 
formerly taught but that will probably never be used 
are being eliminated. Not a single word is being re- 
tained in present-day spelling courses on the theory 
that it will be valuable in the training of memory. 
A quarter of a century ago, in the elementary school 
several years were devoted to the study of technical English 
grammar. But recent investigations have shown that 
many of the constructions which have been taught are 
never employed in daily life by the typical American. 
At the same time, some of the most frequently used 
grammatical constructions are most frequently violated. 
The appreciation of these facts is leading to a complete 
reconstruction of the course in grammar. Pupils are 
being taught to use correctly the constructions which 
they employ in ordinary speech and writing. These are 
presented in a great variety of linguistic situations so that 
by continued use in all the ways in which they will be 
employed later on, the pupil acquires the ability to use 
384
-P-A-G-E-425
  CHANGING COURSES OF STUDY 
them correctly in an automatic manner. Before he leaves 
the elementary school he learns the parts of speech so 
that he knows their names and can recognize them, and 
he learns also the principles governing their proper use 
in sentences, and especially the kinds of sentences that 
he is likely to use in daily life. Farther than this he does 
not go in the study of English grammar. The time a 
pupil saves in curtailing this subject is devoted to the 
more thorough mastery of language as it is used in daily 
life, and also to gaining knowledge and skill in other 
fields which will help him to understand the world in 
which he lives and to reconstruct it so as to promote his 
well-being. 
The elimination of topics in arithmetic has already 
been referred to. The only additional word needing to 
be said here is that no subject in the curriculum is being 
analyzed and overhauled more thoroughly than this 
one, which for generations has occupied the place of 
prestige in the course of study in the elementary school. 
Our educational psychologists and teachers see nothing 
about arithmetic that should entitle it to exceptional 
favors in the course of study. The reasoning power de- 
veloped by arithmetic can be utilized in arithmetical 
situations only; but to-day these situations do not con- 
stitute a very large or the most important part of 
the life of the typical American. There are other kinds of 
situations concerned with political, social, ethical, moral, 
hygienic, domestic, artistic, and other relations and 
activities that play a more vital rdle than arithmetical 
situations do. The latter cannot be neglected, but they 
ought not to be over-emphasized in a course of study, 
and the appreciation of these facts is at the bottom of the 
thorough pruning which the subject is now undergoing 
and will continue to undergo during the next few years. 
Space will not permit us to go through with every sub- 
ject taught in schools for the purpose of showing what is 
385
-P-A-G-E-426
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
happening to it, either by way of extending it because it is 
thought to be of increasing importance, or pruning it 
because it is believed to be of decreasing importance in 
actual life. It is enough to say that all curricula are 
being scrutinized with a view to deleting what has 
persisted in them on the supposition that it is valuable for 
the discipline of mental faculties; and also with a view to 
emphasizing topics that have been gaining in importance 
because of changes in American life or because of the 
development of new knowledge in various fields. 
It should be added that no topic is likely to be retained 
in any subject merely because it is ancient. If it is of 
service. in present-day life it will continue to enjoy a 
place in the curriculum; but age alone will not insure its 
‘retention. In this respect our American schools are 
distinguished from European and Oriental schools, in 
which age is one factor in determining the value of any 
topic or study. In these latter schools a person is not 
regarded as educated, or at least not cultured, unless he 
has amassed a considerable body of knowledge of ancient 
flavor. But in our country we are rapidly coming to the 
view that culture does not depend upon the mere pos- 
session of facts, whether ancient or modern. The 
cultured individual is one who has acquired knowledge 
and skill which make him of service to society, and 
habits of conduct which make him agreeable in associ- 
ation with his fellows. Knowledge which does not func- 
tion in the life of the individual in his relations with 
others, to-day is not regarded by American teachers as of 
value for culture any more than for disciplinary purposes. 
The knowledge that will confer the greatest amount of 
culture upon the child is that which will enable him to 
interpret the nature and needs of the people among whom 
he lives, and to adjust himself to them in harmonious 
relations. 
It should be acknowledged that there is at the present 
386 
 
-P-A-G-E-427
  CHANGING COURSES OF STUDY 
moment a good deal of debate and even conflict between 
the friends of vocational education on the one hand, and 
cultural education on the other. It is recognized that 
vocational education is going forward throughout the 
country with great momentum. There is no stopping 
it, even if any individual or any group of individuals 
should wish to do so. Those who are directing the 
movement know quite definitely what they want, and 
they are proving that they understand how to secure it. 
This does not mean that every question concerning the 
character of vocational education is settled to the satis- 
faction of all its votaries; as a matter of fact, there is still 
difference of opinion expressed in vocational conferences 
respecting the balance which should be preserved between 
cultural training on the one side, and specific preparation 
for a particular vocation on the other. There are those, 
both within and without vocational education circles, 
who maintain that in the public schools boys and girls 
should pursue cultural subjects and master the principles 
underlying a vocation rather than to acquire the me- 
chanical skill necessary to practice any vocation. Others 
hold the contrary view. 
In some States vocational education is administered by 
boards created for the special purpose in various com- 
munities, while in other States all education, cultural and 
vocational, is put in charge of one and the same board— 
the board of education. In these latter States it is 
maintained that vocational training should be regarded 
simply as a phase of general education, while in other 
States it is believed by the votaries of vocational education 
that it can receive proper recognition and emphasis only 
when it is detached from cultural education and adminis- 
tered by boards that have a high respect for it, and that 
will see to it that the training is definite and specific. 
As a consequence of this distinction between vocational 
and cultural education, the former is more clearly defined, 
387 Vocational 
vs. Cultural 
Education

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
is more definite and specific in States like Wisconsin, 
where it is in charge of special boards, than it is in some 
States which the writer has visited. 
Should girls study the same subjects as boys through- 
out the elementary and high school? Many persons in 
our country are asking this question now. For the 
purpose of bringing the question before us, a portion of a 
letter written recently may be quoted here. The writer 
says that much of the strain and stress in our day arises 
from the fact that girls are educated away from the life 
they ought to live. He continues: 
“T can cite my own household as an illustration. 
Mrs. M. completed a high school course and two years in 
a college. She never studied one thing that related to 
keeping a house. I am able to pay for a servant, but 
we seem to be unable to keep help very long. Whenever 
we are without help Mrs. M. prepares a meal or two and 
we take the rest out. But a half hour in the kitchen 
will put her into a frame of mind from which she does 
not recover during the rest of the day. But when the 
woman’s club has some kind of doings she will work there 
all day and not be exhausted at all. The fact is, anything 
in the house gets on her nerves and she makes life a little 
disagreeable for all the family, but she can do any- 
thing outside with pleasure and without exhaustion. All 
her education really separated her from household duties, 
and now she detests the work. So, as a matter of fact, 
while I can pay the bills for a decent and comfortable 
home, we do not have such a one. There are other 
homes in this city just like mine.” 
One can hear many educational people saying about 
the same things now about the education of girls that 
Mr. M. says. Everywhere there is growing dissatisfac- 
tion with the ‘“‘old-fashioned,’’ conventional method of 
educating girls, and already important modifications are 
under way. In many places to-day, a girl in school has 
388
-P-A-G-E-429
CHANGING COURSES OF STUDY 
better opportunities for a useful education than Mrs. M. 
had when she was a pupil. Most up-to-date towns and 
cities have well-arranged courses relating to the making 
of a home, and all girl pupils are required to complete 
some of this work. In many high schools, girls may 
elect various studies in home making in the place of 
mathematics, physics, etc. 
It is true that there are still sections of our country 
in which it is thought that girls should pursue only so- 
called cultural and disciplinary subjects. The present 
writer has heard it said a great many times that a girl 
has the same mind as a boy, and she should have it 
trained in the same manner. Some women’s colleges 
still base their courses on this doctrine more than do the 
high schools or the elementary schools. The women’s 
colleges, speaking generally but allowing for a few ex- 
ceptions, have lagged behind other educational insti- 
tutions in adapting their work to the requirements of 
present-day life. They have operated in the past— 
and some of them are still operating—on the belief that 
education means acquiring learning which cannot be 
applied in any way to the situations of actual life. 
A suggestive illustration may be drawn from the 
educational aspirations of the negro. Those who are 
directing negro education, in the South particularly, 
have to fight constantly against the desire of the negro 
to study Latin, algebra, and other subjects which are 
regarded as “cultural” and “disciplinary” but not 
practical. The negro has reasoned thus: “In order to 
be a real aristocrat, I must study the things which the 
aristocrats study. ‘Their studies have no practical appli- 
cation. If I should study agriculture, engineering, or 
household arts, I would have to work with my muscles, 
and so I would not be admitted to real society. Quality 
folks never work with their hands. They do not do 
any work at all. They are just polished, and Latin and

algebra will put on a polish better than anything else.” 
Men like Booker T. Washington have had to spend 
much of their energy in combating this naive, absurd 
educational philosophy. Somewhat of the same phil- 
osophy in principle has been and is now being followed 
by some of the girls’ schools and colleges. 
There is a vigorous movement in the public schools to 
put all the work of home making on a scientific and 
dignified basis. ‘There are junior and senior high schools 
throughout the country that are beginning to train girls 
so that they will gain as much pleasure from home work 
as they will gain from getting up a church supper or 
attending a club meeting. The girl who looks upon the 
kitchen as a laboratory; who understand the chemical, © 
bacteriological, and physiological principles which are 
involved in all that takes place there, and who regards 
cookery and whatever goes with it as a fine art, will not 
be ‘‘all done up” when she spends an hour or two in 
the kitchen, and she will not feel that she is doing menial 
things then she gives attention to the sanitation, 
decoration, etc., of her home. 
It is the woman who has been brought up to regard 
everything in the home as commonplace drudgery, fit 
only for servants, who chafes when she is called upon to 
perform any of the work herself. She is the one who fills 
the house with complaining and who says, “I am not 
going to be the servant of this family. I am nothing but 
a drudge for the rest of you.” At the same time, every 
member of the family may be doing his or her work; 
but women like Mrs. M. consider that any work connected 
with the house is drudgery, and anything outside of it is 
recreation. 
With a view to obtaining information regarding the 
benefits which women believe they have derived from 
different educational programs, the present writer, with 
the codperation of the United States Bureau of Education

  In some places pupils set up and print the publications and circulars issued by

and fourteen important colleges and universities, has 
secured testimonies from a large number of women who 
have had time and occasion to put their secondary and 
higher education to the test. There was prepared a list 
of five thousand college and university graduates of at 
least five years’ standing, (there were representatives in 
every class from 1898 to 1915),so that they had had an 
opportunity to determine to what extent their education 
had proved to be of service in meeting the needs of actual 
life. In making up this list it was decided to secure 
an equal number from co-educational and from non- 
co-educational colleges, as follows: Northwestern, Bryn 
Mawr, Minnesota, Radcliffe, Illinois, Wellesly, Wisconsin, 
Goucher, Ohio, Smith, Colby, Chicago, Simmons, and 
Iowa. 
A letter was sent to each of these five thousand 
graduates asking for information regarding the studies 
pursued in high school and college and for an expression 
of opinion, supported by concrete data, respecting the 
value of each study as tested by the needs of life. Each 
graduate was asked whether if she were now beginning 
her high school or college course, she would, in the light 
of her present knowledge, and if she were granted freedom 
of choice, elect the same subjects that she pursued 
originally. She was asked, further, whether she would 
advise a daughter to complete the same course of study 
that she completed in high school and college, and if 
not, what modifications she would suggest, and why. 
The women were asked to state their occupations. 
The occupations that were most numerously represented 
were, first, feacher; next, home maker; next, mother. Then 
in order—librarian, social worker, secretary, accountant, 
dean of women, business woman, writer, editor, clinician, 
pharmacist, Red Cross worker, artist, principal of schools, 
deaconess, lawyer, nurse, farmer, Y. W. C. A. worker. 
The teachers, taken as a whole, are quite well satisfied

with the education they received in high school and 
college, although there is an occasional note of dissatis- 
faction because certain subjects were not taught so that 
they could be used in the practical situations of daily life. 
The home makers, mothers, and social workers are, with 
very few exceptions, discontented with their education. 
Only four of the home makers and mothers would elect 
the same course of study that they originally pursued if 
they had an opportunity to go over their high-school and 
college course again, because they failed to receive much 
help in solving the particular problems with which they 
have had to deal every day since they became home 
makers and mothers. The severest condemnation of the 
educational program was made by those who signed 
themselves as mothers. Very few of them had an oppor- 
tunity to study subjects in either high school or college 
that pertained to the nature or training of children, and 
now they have to care for children and trainthem. They 
do not want their daughters to go through the same 
régime that they were compelled to pursue. They do 
not wish to have their daughters pursue studies that 
relate only to the care and training of children or to 
home making, but they would like to have them devote 
some time to these matters while they are in high school 
and college. 
Lack of It is worthy of special mention that graduates of Courses in ° Home colleges for women complain more generally of the lack 
rans of opportunities to pursue courses relating to home 
making and motherhood than do the graduates of co- 
educational universities. As a matter of fact, some of 
the women’s colleges make only slight provision for 
studies which relate to home making in any of its aspects. 
The larger co-educational universities have departments 
or colleges of household arts in which there are courses 
that relate to every phase of home making, including the 
nature and training of children, and the girl students in 
392
-P-A-G-E-435
CHANGING COURSES OF STUDY 
these universities are electing such courses in constantly 
increasing numbers. 
The greatest dissatisfaction with the training in high 
school and college is expressed by the oldest graduates, 
as is reflected in the following typical letters written by 
women who graduated fifteen or twenty years ago: 
“T had no training that related specifically to home 
making which I think I should have had. I graduated 
before home economics was taught at......... Since 
two out of three women marry, I think home making as a 
profession should have consideration in the education 
of all girls.” 
“T regret that in neither high school nor college did I 
have an opportunity to take domestic science. I think 
all girls need training in the lines that the majority of 
women will either follow or direct. They need training 
in the consideration of community problems and oh, 
how I do wish that they would get some training that 
would teach them suitable dress. Our small high schools 
need more work in physical training for all, not just 
basketball for the one who likes it.” 
“My college education did not sufficiently equip me to 
become what I now am—the manager of a house and 
the mother of children. Having a trained mind has 
perhaps helped me to do my work and train my children 
more intelligently than some could have done these things, 
but I have always deeply felt the lack of practical knowl- 
edge of things pertaining to my special problems.”’ 
The curricula in our schools have changed greatly 
during the past two decades. There has been such a 
rapid change that visitors from foreign countries think 
we are educationally unstable and are drifting with the 
tide. Changes in courses of studies are much more 
rapid and profound in our country than in any European 
or Oriental country. 
The chief reason why our courses of study change more 
393 Typical

  Chief

rapidly than they do in other countries is because our 
educational system is plastic and mobile as compared 
with systems in foreign countries. In our social and 
political ideals and practices and in our manner of life 
we change very rapidly and profoundly as compared with 
people in foreign countries. The changes in education 
are not more rapid than they are in other aspects of our life. 
A forward-looking people require constant changes in 
their social, political, and educational régime. It is 
inevitable that our courses of study should be modified so 
long as our people are going forward in all aspects and all 
phases of social, political, and industrial life. 
A slogan of our teachers for the past two decades 
has been: ‘‘The School Must Prepare for the Needs of 
Life.” Thousands of men and women are devoting 
themselves to a study of the question of what is covered by 
“the needs of life.” 
One of the chief reasons for the modification of our 
courses of study has been our abandonment of the 
doctrine of formal discipline. According to this doctrine, 
those studies are of greatest value that strengthen or 
sharpen the faculties of the mind even though the subjects 
themselves have no relation to any of the needs of life. 
When our curriculum was planned originally, it was 
believed that specific studies developed general mental 
ability, but our educational psychologists have shown 
that this is an erroneous doctrine and we no longer have 
faith in it, speaking generally. 
Originally, certain studies were given a place of dis- 
tinction in our courses of study in all our schools and 
colleges because it was thought that they developed 
reasoning power; other studies were given a prominent 
place because they trained memory; still others because 
they developed imagination. A movement is going 
forward now to eliminate from all courses of study all 
subjects and topics that have retained a place in the 
394 
 
-P-A-G-E-437
CHANGING COURSES OF STUDY 
curriculum simply because they were supposed to be 
valuable for the training of perception, reason, memory, 
or imagination. 
Traditional studies are being modified greatly with a 
view to retaining only the topics that appear to relate 
directly to the needs of contemporary life. Arithmetic, 
grammar, spelling, geography, Latin, and so on, are 
undergoing profound modification from this standpoint. 
There is vigorous debate taking place between the 
advocates of cultural and the advocates of vocational 
education. The former maintain that the latter are 
seeking to abolish cultural training from the schools, 
but the latter maintain that all subjects can be taught 
so as to confer culture, and that no subject which is 
taught specifically for cultural purposes can yield culture 
in the highest degree. 
During the past two decades the education of girls has 
received particular attention. Originally girls were trained 
in the same way as boys, but there has recently been 
vigorous protest against this program. It is now being 
maintained that girls should have opportunity to study 
household arts instead of, or at least as well as, subjects 
like algebra, geometry, Latin, etc. In many places all 
girls are now required to pursue subjects in the elementary 
and in the high school relating to home making. The 
testimony of women who have graduated from college 
regarding the education of girls shows that they believe 
that all girls should have training relating to homemaking 
as well as general training which will fit them for life 
outside of the home.

CHANGING METHODS OF TEACHING AND MANAGEMENT 
[: IS safe to say that there are readers who are in 
What the doubt concerning the wisdom of the changes they see 
ont ae taking place in the schools in the methods of teaching 
Think of the and of managing pupils. Quite often one reads articles Newer . ° 5 .0| #1 « Methods in magazines and newspapers sharply criticizing the 
schools for their laxity and softness in the methods of 
teaching and of managing children. The present writer 
hears laymen say frequently, and teachers occasionally, 
that we are losing control of our pupils and that they are 
not learning to apply themselves diligently and con- 
tinuously to their mental tasks. Laymen visit the 
schools and see pupils constantly in action. When they 
were in school themselves they sat in their seats and 
learned their lessons; but now pupils are out of their 
seats as much as they are in them while they are in the 
classroom. They are on their feet and are using their 
muscles in the performance of their tasks, and visitors 
frequently ask: ‘How is it possible for pupils to develop 
their minds properly unless they use their brains instead 
of their hands?”’ The writer recently received a letter 
from one critic of the newer methods who had been 
visiting the school attended by his two children, and the 
complaint he makes is often made by parents and laymen. 
He says: 
“The children in the rooms I visited did not seem as 
quiet or did not apply themselves as thoroughly to their 
lessons as we children were required to do when I was in 
school, and I cannot see the reason for the way in which 
the pupils do some of their work. They seem to spend 
their time handling things instead of learning about 
396
-P-A-G-E-439
CHANGING METHODS 
them. It looks to me as though they are wasting their 
time. Certainly it would be better for them to learn the 
tables and then use them in solving problems instead of 
taking so much time to fool with the things themselves. 
I spent two hours in this school in order to see what sort 
of work my children are doing, and during the whole of 
those two hours the pupils moved about the room without 
asking the teacher, and I saw some instances in which a 
child went and sat with another one and they worked 
together. In their recitations the pupils sometimes 
talked directly to one another as though there were no 
teacher present. Now I don’t believe that this is the 
best way to carry on school work. It is certainly very 
different from the way in which I had my schooling.” 
Visitors from European countries cannot understand 
why there is so much activity all the time in the typical 
American classroom. Compared with a European or 
Oriental school, an American school is unorganized, 
noisy, and even disorderly. In a classroom in a foreign 
country, speaking generally, pupils sit in their seats 
while they are preparing their lessons; they are forbidden 
to have any communication with their classmates; they 
cannot leave their seats without first securing the per- 
mission of the teacher. ‘Their work largely consists in 
memorizing the lessons assigned them. For the most 
part, their plan of study consists in going over and over a 
lesson until they have fixed it so that they can reproduce 
it without error. They learn rules and formule by 
heart and then apply them to imaginary problems in their 
text books. In due course they are summoned to the 
teacher to recite on what they have learned and they 
make an effort to reproduce everything they have 
memorized. 
In brief, methods of teaching in most foreign coun- 
tries consist principally in requiring pupils to learn 
verbatim certain facts, rules, and formule, and then

apply them to problems found in the textbook. They 
must show to the teacher that they have memorized 
thoroughly what was assigned to be learned, and have 
applied the rules and formule accurately. Methods of 
management consist almost entirely in compelling pupils 
to be quiet and not to have any communication with 
classmates, so that everyone in,the classroom may devote 
himself without distraction to the work in hand. 
American teachers, taken as a whole, have for the 
past few years been trying to base their methods of 
teaching upon the psychological principle that a child 
learns by doing rather than by memorizing exclusively. 
This principle was not discovered by American psycholo- 
gists and teachers; the classic educational writers from 
Aristotle down to Herbert Spencer have emphasized the 
importance of doing for effective learning, and have 
condemned the practice of appealing to memory chiefly 
in teaching the young. Aristotle, in discussing the 
teaching of music, contended that in order to understand 
and appreciate it, the learner must actually execute it; 
without the latter, the former will be impossible. 
Says Comenius: “The objects themselves, or, where 
this is not possible, such representations of them as can 
be conveyed by copies, models, and pictures, must be 
studied. In the case of the languages, arts, morality, 
and piety, impression must be insured by expression. 
‘What has to be done, must be learned by doing.’ Read- 
ing, writing, and singing are to be acquired by practice. 
The use of foreign languages affords a better means of 
learning them than do the rules of grammar. Practice, 
good example, and sympathetic guidance teach us virtue 
better than do precepts.”’ 
Pestalozzi protested against the practice in his day of 
requiring pupils to learn the contents of books. He says: 
“T believe that the first development of thought in the 
child is very much disturbed by a wordy system of teach- 
398
-P-A-G-E-441
CHANGING METHODS 
ing, which is not adapted either to his faculties or the 
circumstances of his life. According to my experience, 
success depends upon whether what is taught to children 
commends itself to them as true through being closely 
connected with their own observation. As a general 
rule, I attached little importance to the study of words, 
even when explanations of the ideas they represented 
were given.”’ 
Milton, though a linguist himself, advised against the 
emphasis that was placed upon linguistic study in the 
schools of his time. Among other criticisms of the 
methods of the schools, he says that, “Though a linguist 
should pride himself to have all the tongues that Babel 
cleft the world into, yet if he have not studied the solid 
things in them as well as the words and lexicons, he were 
nothing so much to be esteemed as any yeoman or trades- 
man competently wise in his mother dialect only.” 
But even in the face of the severe condemnation of 
mere verbal learning which was uttered by Comenius, 
Locke, Rousseau, Bacon, Pestalozzi, Herbart, Herbert 
Spencer, and many others, memorization has continued to 
play the chief rdle in the schoolrooms of most foreign 
countries, and of our own country until very recently. 
In such schools the pupil as a learner means the pupil as a 
memorizer; and the teacher is a hearer of recitations for the 
purpose of ascertaining whether pupils have fixed their 
lessons in memory so that they can recall them without 
error, and have correctly applied rules and formule to 
imaginary situations presented in the textbooks. Lay- 
men who visit such schoolrooms are likely to approve 
them because of the quiet which prevails in them and also 
because of the apparent diligence of pupils who are busy 
conning over their tasks sothat they can be recited exactly 
as they are given in the text books. 
But during the past few years, educational psy- 
chologists in America have been presenting the results 
399 The 
Persistence 
of Mere 
Memory

-P-A-G-E-442
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
of experimental studies showing that a pupil may be 
able to recite a rule correctly and apply it accurately to a 
textbook problem, but that at the same time he may not 
be able to apply it to an actual problem as he has to deal 
with it in daily life. Special investigation, as well as 
observation and experience, have shown that mere word 
knowledge may not, and for that matter usually does not, 
give understanding of actual, concrete situations unless a 
pupil has translated his rules and formule into concrete 
terms and used them in solving actual problems. A 
pupil may learn all the rules in the textbook regarding 
banking (as an instance), so that he can recite them 
accurately; but if he has not employed his rules in actual 
banking procedure by performing the processes described 
by the rules, he may be about as ignorant of banking as 
he was before he learned his rules. And what is true in 
respect to banking is true of every other process in 
- arithmetic or of any other subject for that matter. 
Readers of this volume can easily make observations 
that illustrate this psychological and educational principle. 
If any reader’s children attend a school in which the 
work is of the verbal type,—the learning of facts, rules, 
and formule in text books and reciting them for the 
purpose of revealing whether they have been memorized 
accurately ,—he can test his children when they come home 
to see in how far they can apply in actual, concrete 
situations what they have learned in school. Parents 
often complain that their children do not make any use 
in the home or outside of what they are learning in 
school; and yet these same parents sometimes approve 
methods of teaching which require pupils to memorize 
verbal knowledge without actually performing the actions 
to which the knowledge relates. 
During the past few years, a new term has been in- 
troduced into educational literature in our country, and 
it suggests what we are striving to attain in our methods 
400
-P-A-G-E-443
CHANGING METHODS 
of teaching. This is the term dynamic, which is con- 
trasted with the term static; the former refers to the kind 
of teaching which requires pupils actually to do what they 
are learning. If, for instance, they are learning linear 
measurement, they must use the units—inches, feet, 
yards, rods—in actual measurements, and in this way 
they will learn the value of each unit and the relations 
between the several units. In concluding their study of 
the units of linear measurement they construct a table 
and memorize it, but this is the last and not the first step 
in the mastery of the subject. And so with every table 
in arithmetic; it is constructed only after pupils have 
had experience in actually using the units of the table. 
They cannot understand the relations of the various 
units in any measurement until they discover by actual 
trial how many of one unit are required to make each of 
the other units. This is the type of work that the father, 
whose letter was quoted in the second paragraph of this 
chapter, complains about because the pupils seem to be 
“fooling” with the measures when they ought to be 
memorizing the tables and applying them to imaginary 
problems in the textbook. This parent would approve 
the static method of teaching whereby pupils would never 
handle any object or perform any process they were 
studying. 
Any adult ought to know that he cannot master a new 
object or process merely by learning rules concerning it; 
one always wants to handle new objects or try out new 
actions before he is satisfied that he understands them. 
While most adults appreciate this principle so far as their 
own need is concerned, still they frequently fail to interpret 
a child’s need as of the same character and urgency as 
their own. Whenever a normal adult comes in contact 
with a wholly new situation he tries to experiment with 
it or test it in some way so that he can gain an under- 
standing of it in terms of what he can do with it, or how

it is composed, or what it can do to him; but when a child 
does the same with a new object or situation which he 
encounters, he is thought by some to be wasting his time 
or merely “fooling” with things that he ought to learn 
about in his textbook. 
Words are merely symbols; they have no meaning for a 
learner unless they are embodied in concrete experience. 
Our early ancestors who developed words had the ex- 
periences first which they denoted; the words came after 
vital, concrete contact with the objects, situations, and 
phenomena to which they referred. But in teaching 
children according to the static method, which was 
universal in our own schools in an earlier day and which 
is still almost universal in foreign schools, words are 
learned ahead of the experiences which they denote on 
the theory that a novice can appreciate the experiences 
of those who developed words merely by memorizing 
the words. ‘This is the great illusion in education which 
educational psychologists and teachers in America are 
trying to dispel from the schoolroom. All of the changes 
that are taking place in the methods of teaching in our 
schools are based on the principle that children can gain 
real knowledge that will be of service to them only by 
concrete experience in manipulating the objects and 
performing the processes they are learning. To com- 
prehend adequately the characteristics of any occupation 
or activity, one must actually reproduce the movements 
and adjustments of that activity or occupation. Merely 
to read about the work of the blacksmith or carpenter or 
farmer, or even to look at them while they are busy in 
their several ways, or to listen to them describe their 
daily round of duties, will yield at best only vague and 
blurred outlines of their functions; but when a pupil 
cultivates a garden or makes a hand sled or fashions into 
desired shape a piece of iron—these and other like tasks 
that the young take delight in performing will serve best 
402
-P-A-G-E-445
  CHANGING METHODS 
to give real and accurate knowledge of these activities. 
In our country, in all our teaching, we are going over 
completely onto this dynamic principle. The present 
writer has discussed this matter in his book Mental 
Development and Education, and a few paragraphs from 
that book are here reproduced: ‘In the modern kinder- 
garten, for example, the pupil devotes much of his time 
to constructive activities that are planned to meet his 
every-day needs. A well-conducted kindergarten is a 
place of testing, of experimenting, of constructing, of 
practicing in play the serious enterprises of later life. 
The pupil does not spend his time simply memorizing the 
names of things; he works with the things themselves. 
He may not be able to read or write the words clay, 
hammer, knife, flower, and so on, but it is planned that he 
should come to know these things by working with them 
directly. Again, the cordial welcome which our people 
have given the Montessori methods indicates that we 
appreciate a system of teaching and training based on the 
dynamic nature and needs of the young. 
“In the ‘Houses of Childhood’ the children are always 
doing; they are not required to sit in seats and memorize 
words. They are engaged in buttoning and _ lacing 
frames, performing such acts as they need to perform in 
buttoning and unbuttoning their own clothes, and in 
lacing and unlacing their shoes. They build towers with 
blocks of varying sizes. They match colored spools. 
They use their fingers to trace letters or geometrical 
figures, or to measure distances. They employ their 
muscles to estimate the relative weight of different objects. 
They are blindfolded and then fit geometrical inserts into 
their proper forms; in this way they must discover 
through feeling thecharacteristics and relations of different 
forms. They learn to read in part by constructing words 
from letters cut out of cardboard. ‘They learn to write by 
tracing words on the sand, the floor, or on the blackboard. 
403 The 
Dynamic 
Principle 
Illustrated 
in the

Schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-446
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
“The Montessori system is based on the principle 
that the child can learn only through sense activity and 
motor action. Dr. Montessori did not discover this 
fundamental principle of learning. Every serious student 
of childhood and education from Locke to the students 
of our own day has emphasized it. Dr. Montessori has 
applied the principle skilfully in devising apparatus 
which exercises the senses and stimulates constructive 
activities. She is not a ‘discoverer’ or a ‘wonder- 
worker’; she is simply a clever and resourceful teacher 
who is familiar with what many investigators have done 
and many teachers have accomplished; and she has made 
some advance upon what others have achieved in the 
practical training of young children. 
“The Montessori apparatus has been regarded by 
some as possessing mystic value. But it is not necessary 
to have this apparatus in order to apply the Montessori 
principles. Any ordinary home or school could afford 
children much of the sensory and motor experience that 
can be gained from the Montessori apparatus. This 
apparatus is designed to give children training in doing 
some of the important things they will need to do in 
daily life and to stimulate them to observe and discrim- 
inate carefully through all the senses. A child from three 
to six years of age who is allowed considerable freedom in 
the use of objects in the home, and who can be with his 
mother in the kitchen and elsewhere and participate in 
her activities will gain the sort of experience that he is 
expected to derive from the use of the Montessori appa- 
ratus. Further, if he has asand pile and a collie dog, and 
tools such as a hammer and saw and the like, and a few 
pieces of gymnastic apparatus,—a rope ladder, and a 
swing and trapeze, for instance,—he will gain more 
varied experience than he could acquire if he should be 
confined to the Montessori apparatus alone. 
“The dynamic principle is being applied in the 
404
-P-A-G-E-447
  CHANGING METHODS 
elementary, grammar, and high schools, as well as in the 
kindergarten and the Montessori schools, though, as we 
shall see later, the higher the pupil ascends in school, the 
more his work must consist in organizing and interpreting 
his experiences. But the fundamental aim of progressive 
schools of every grade to-day is to have pupils master 
things and actions as well as words and rules. We are 
hearing much about the Gary schools, the Fairhope 
school, and others of similar character; but they are 
merely conspicuous illustrations of tendencies to be seen 
everywhere throughout the country. He is regarded 
as the most skilful teacher who is most resourceful in 
leading his pupils actually to experiment with the objects 
or to perform the actions which he is teaching them. On 
the other hand, he who is regarded as the most ineffective 
teacher, the one who is farthest behind the times, is he 
who simply has his pupils sit in their seats and memorize 
rules and apply them to imaginary rather than real, 
every-day problems. There are certain sections of the 
country in which teaching is still largely of the latter 
sort, and these sections are regarded by educational 
people everywhere as retarded in their educational 
development. 
“It is encouraging to note the change which is taking 
place in the textbooks in arithmetic. Those now coming 
from the press are requiring the pupil to react upon his 
environment in ways which will compel him to use the 
arithmetic he is trying to learn. The mere memorizing 
of definitions or fundamental operations and applying 
them in the solution of problems entirely remote from the 
pupil’s daily life is passing, though it has not disappeared 
altogether by any means. The boys who take part in 
the annual corn-raising contests in the country schools of 
Winnebago County, Illinois, for instance, thoroughly 
master a large part of the essentials of arithmetic, for 
they must make careful measurements of the land on

which the corn is raised, careful computation of the 
amount of seed needed, of the yield from each hill of 
the value of the crop, and the percentage of profit. 
“The principle in question is universal in its application 
to the work of the schoolroom. One cannot make a 
mistake in saying that a pupil will gain effective command 
of reading and spelling only by using these arts in some 
vital way. They must not be set apart from his active 
life, but must be made the means of acquiring useful 
knowledge, recording it, and communicating with his 
friends. As early as the tenth year children will strive 
with all their might to write well when they wish to send 
a letter to some friend. Then they will give attention to 
chirography and spelling. They will work out the 
meaning of words, securing help from every available 
source when they wish to decipher the story in some 
interesting book. In the same way the college student 
will attack with zest and enthusiasm the difficulties 
of a foreign language when he is looking forward to a trip 
abroad. ‘The chief function of both teacher and text- 
book should be to create situations appealing so strongly 
to the learner’s interests and impulses that he will largely 
disregard the drudgery of mastering the technique of a 
subject, as he fixes his attention upon the end to be reached 
and eagerly presses toward it. 
‘The subject which has offered the greatest resistance 
of any in the elementary school curriculum to the appli- 
cation of dynamic methods is grammar. It has been 
more than any other study the despair of teachers and the 
bugbear of pupils. Yet it is possible to combine the use 
of language and the technique of grammar and to relate 
both to the pupil’s actual experience in such a way that 
he will come to appreciate the help that he will receive 
from the study of grammar. ‘The sentence, as the pupil 
himself uses it, especially in written expression, should 
be made the basis of grammatical study. His own

compositions upon subjects in which he is vitally in- 
terested will furnish all the materials necessary for gaining 
a mastery of the essentials of grammar. From his own 
essays he may be led to see what the nature of a sentence 
is; what various functions words perform; the changes 
that occur in words as they are used in varied relations; 
the necessity for different kinds of sentences, and the 
characteristics of each. In short, he may be so taught 
that he will come to regard grammar as a useful tool, 
which, like the ability to read and to write, he sees to be 
necessary as a rule for the adequate interchange of 
thought.” 
A further illustration of the dynamic principle, as it 
is being applied in our schools, is found in the teaching 
of history. Doubtless some of our readers can remember 
the time when the learning of history consisted of memor- 
izing dates and names of important persons, mainly 
warriors, and the wars in which they participated, with 
the outcome thereof. History learned in this way never 
functioned actively in the daily life of the learner. The 
facts he memorized by great effort remained static in his 
associations with people, either individually or in groups. 
Let any reader ask himself this question: “How much of 
the history I studied in the schools fifteen or twenty 
years ago has played any rdle in my life, either by way of 
helping me to interpret the trend of human affairs about 
me, or by way of enlightening me in respect to my 
duties as a citizen?” The answer to that question 
probably would be convincing to most of those who 
should ask it, that history has not played a prominent 
part in the intellectual, moral, or civic life of most 
persons trained in schools twenty or twenty-five years 
ago. 
How does the dynamic principle apply to the teaching 
of history? If you have not recently observed the work 
of a class in history in a progressive school, you are 
407 The

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
urged to visit such a class and note the ways and means 
by which history is made vital and illuminating in the 
lives of pupils. The past is reconstructed as fully as 
possible. Every sort of concrete evidence that can be 
obtained is used to help children to visualize and appre- 
ciate the epochs which they are studying. They drama- 
tize the people, situations, and events which are described 
in the authorities which they consult. They are shown 
motion pictures made by students of history of dramati- 
zations of important historical epochs. They make 
models of the homes and assembly places occupied by 
the people during the epoch which they are studying. 
In other ways the men and women who have lived in 
earlier times are made to pass in review before present-day 
pupils so that their habits of life—personal, social, 
political, industrial, and so on,—can actually be observed. 
It is probably no exaggeration to say that every 
teacher in our country, who has felt the spirit of American 
education, is endeavoring to devise new and better ways 
of applying the dynamic principle in all his teaching. 
The educational magazines—there are literally hundreds 
of them in our country—are filled with accounts of 
experiments conducted for the purpose of showing how a 
particular topic in the various subjects of study in the 
elementary and high schools can be taught in a more 
dynamic way than it has been taught before. Depart- 
ments of education in the universities and normal schools 
are publishing bulletins by the hundreds giving results of 
investigations relating to problems of dynamic teaching. 
At every educational meeting, teachers describe the 
results of their experiences in teaching subjects so as to 
give pupils actual experience in doing the things they are 
learning. This will explain why the atmosphere in a 
typical schoolroom in our country is very different from 
what it was twenty-five years ago. It will explain why 
pupils are on their feet much of the time and using their 
408 
 
-P-A-G-E-453
CHANGING METHODS 
hands while they are studying. It will explain why there 
appears to be so much more going on in a typical school- 
room to-day than in almost any schoolroom a quarter of a 
century ago. 
There is one subject which is rapidly coming to 
occupy first place in the work of teaching the young, not 
only in the elementary and high school but also in the 
home; and it is of supreme importance that it should be 
taught in a dynamic way, so that special mention may be 
made of it in this place. By way of introducing the 
problem with which we have to dealit may be asked: “Is 
there any good reason why one who lives in America 
should love his country?” Let one ask this question of 
the first ten adults one meets on the street or elsewhere 
and note the answers he receives. The majority of them 
will probably not be very clear or emphatic in their 
responses. Ask them what the country does to promote 
their welfare and most of them will be hazy and uncertain 
in their answers, because they have never thought in 
concrete terms regarding the service which our country 
renders to all its citizens. The present writer sometimes 
talks with adults who do not feel that the country is a real 
thing with a heart; it is to them a sort of abstract and 
remote thing which does not come close to the life of 
anyone. 
Will the persons who are reading these lines please 
ask their children at the first opportunity whether they 
really love their country? They will probably all be 
demonstrative in their assertions of affection and loyalty; 
but then ask them to explain why they love their country, 
and the responses will certainly be a revelation to many 
who have taken it for granted that young people really 
feel an attachment for our country and understand why 
they should have love for it. 
The writer has visited many classes in different 
sections of the country in which pupils have been reciting

in “civil government.” He has heard lessons on Ameri- 
canization. He has listened to recitations on the duties 
and responsibilities of each individual to the government. 
Further, he has heard pupils reproduce what they had 
learned about the way States, counties, cities, and dis- 
tricts are governed, but he has not often heard pupils say 
a word which would show that they were actually con- 
ceiving of the country, the State, the city, the town, and 
the district as playing an important rdle in determining 
their comfort, happiness, and feeling of security. He has 
frequently asked pupils during recitations in civil govern- 
ment to mention one thing the national government 
had done for them that day or week which had promoted 
their welfare, and the responses have rarely been satis- 
factory. Asa rule, the pupils who have been questioned 
never connected the government directly with their own 
daily experiences. They did not think that the country 
had made it possible for them to have an education, or to 
earn their living, or to enjoy any other advantage. 
Pupils have said to the writer time and again that the 
clothing they wore, the food they ate, the houses they 
lived in, the automobiles they rode in, and so on, were 
earned as a result of their own industry or that of their 
parents; and they did not appreciate that the country 
had anything to do with the advantages which they 
enjoyed. 
_Every reader will undoubtedly agree that one cannot 
love any person or any thing unless that person or thing 
has some vital connection with his own life—is essential 
to his intellectual, physical, emotional, moral, or 
aesthetic well-being. We cannot have affection for a 
mere abstraction, or for anything that does not in any way 
affect our happiness or prosperity; so the chief requisite 
in developing love of country in young people is to lead 
them to feel that the country is very real and that without 
its constant assistance, watchfulness, protection, and 
410
-P-A-G-E-455
CHANGING METHODS 
guidance we would not have the comforts, the safety, 
and the freedom which we now enjoy. 
We must begin with very concrete experiences to 
awaken in our pupils a consciousness of the benefits 
which they receive from the government. Let us start 
with the school. ‘“‘Who built this school building and 
equipped it with all that is needed to carry on our work? 
Who pays for the teachers and for the heat? Suppose 
that every pupil had to pay his share of the cost of these 
things, how many of them would have any schooling? 
There are children in some countries who cannot go to 
school, because there is no school for them to attend; 
and children in other countries who can attend school 
but for a short time because they cannot afford it, since 
they have to pay all the cost of their schooling. Most of 
the people in these countries go through life ignorant, 
and the only thing they know how to do is to work at 
hard manual labor. They do not have time or the means 
forenjoyment. They can earn scarcely enough food and 
clothing to keep body and soul together. But in most 
of the States in our country, everyone who wishes to do 
so and who is industrious and capable may go to a free 
school for at least sixteen years—eight years in the 
elementary school, four years in the high school, and four 
years in the state university. Who is it that pays the 
expenses of all this education? The district, city, town, 
county, State, the United States, all help to pay it, 
so that every individual may make the most of his life. 
Every day a child is in school he is indebted to his country 
for the advantages he enjoys.” 
Again, the parent or teacher must lead the child to 
see that without the care and assistance received from 
his country he would constantly be exposed to dangers 
and: hardships. Take his health, for instance. How 
could he protect himself in times of epidemic of scarlet 
fever, typhoid fever, yellow fever, cholera, or other 
411

diseases unless the town, city, county, State, and nation 
came to his aid? In other countries these diseases often 
kill a large part of the people because their countries do 
not give them the right kind of help in time of need. 
There is not a child of any age who cannot be impressed 
with this story. And when the impression is made, let 
the parent or teacherask: “Here we are receiving help 
all the time, so that we may keep well and enjoy life, 
and what should we do for the country that helps and 
protects us?” 
Even a young child can be led to appreciate that the 
country is a very real thing, that it is constantly helping 
every person to solve his problems, and that without its 
aid we would all be helpless. This is why we should love 
our country and be loyal to it. It cannot go on helping 
everyone unless everyone will codperate with it. Anyone 
who stands in its way is an enemy of everyone. Any 
person who accepts the benefits which our country offers 
him—and everyone does accept them—and who is then 
unappreciative and disloyal is greedy and mean, and he 
does not deserve to receive any assistance. 
Young people, and older ones as well, who live on 
farms, are often unable to see how they are assisted or 
protected by the country. They usually find fault with 
it, and they see nothing about it to admire or respect. 
They have to work hard, and they think that whatever 
they possess they have earned by the sweat of their brow 
without aid from any source. Here is a good opportunity 
for a parent in a rural home or a teacher in a rural school 
to lead young people to see that farmers as well as those 
who work in banks, in stores, in factories, or in offices of 
any kind are helped and protected by the county, State, 
and nation. How could farmers combat diseases that 
attack their crops and their animals unless the nation had 
studied.these diseases and had devised ways and means of 
controlling them? In foreign nations, where the tiller 
412

CHANGING METHODS 
of the soil works without much, if any, help from his 
country, these diseases often completely destroy his crops 
and his livestock, and millions of people may starve 
because there is not enough food. Children should be 
led to understand that great progress has been made in 
farming during the last fifty years, and this has been 
made possible almost entirely because of the watchfulness, 
assistance, and protection of the country. Our country 
supports stations where every problem which the farmer 
encounters is scientifically investigated, and as soon as 
information which will be of help to him is secured it is 
conveyed to him in books, in institutes, and in other ways. 
A hundred years ago farmers traded their wheat, corn, 
and cattle directly for clothes, flour, etc. They had to 
carry their grain to the man with whom they wanted to 
make a trade; but our country has developed a system of 
transportation, so that now practically every farmer, no 
matter where his farm is located, can send his grain to 
Chicago, to Seattle, to New Orleans, or to New York 
City and get money for it with which he can buy what he 
wishes. He is no longer obliged to trade his products with 
somebody in the neighborhood. 
Young people admire and respect a person or a thing 
that is strong, powerful, and capable of meeting any 
emergency. Pupils ought to be impressed with the fact 
that America is a great, powerful, and courageous country. 
Sometimes parents think it is not desirable to speak of 
our nation as a great and powerful country, and so they 
miss one opportunity to arouse the admiration, affection, 
and loyalty of children. Young people cannot be made 
to admire a weak or flabby person or thing, and there 
cannot be any harm in indulging their love for strength 
and magnitude. The more a parent can impress upon 
his children the vast power and resources of our country 
the warmer attachment they will have for it. 
Of course, our nation’s vast power must be used in an

honorable way. Young people do not like a bully. They 
admire a strong person if he is fair, if he will not pick 
on those who are smaller and weaker than he is himself; 
so the teacher must not fail to impress her pupils with 
the fact, for fact it is, that our country is using its strength 
for the betterment of all people and not for the enslave- 
ment of any of them. Just now, a teacher can impress 
this idea more strongly than it would have been possible 
to do four years ago. Our country has taken the lead in 
offering to abandon our great ships and to cease building 
any more for a considerable period. America could build 
ships more easily than any other country and yet our 
country is willing to give weaker nations a chance. We 
are not using our power to take advantage of any weak 
people. Throughout the World War, and since then, we 
have stood for freedom for all peoples, weak or strong. 
We will not exploit weaker nations than our own, and 
we do not want any other strong nation to take advantage 
of those who are not so strong. 
The American ideal is freedom for all people so long 
as they live in accord with rules and regulations which are 
essential to the welfare of all. While we have might, still 
we stand strongly against the idea that might makes right. 
No nation in the world’s history has ever emphasized this 
principle so strongly as America has done both by precept 
and by example during the last decade. A parent ought 
to put this idea before his children very concretely on 
every suitable occasion. Nothing will strengthen the 
admiration, affection, and loyalty of children as they grow 
older more than this idea of great strength held in check 
in order that those who are not so strong may have a 
chance to live their lives unhampered and unterrified. 
Next to the teaching of citizenship in our schools, the 
teaching of health is coming to occupy the place of chief 
importance, and we are making extraordinary progress in 
applying the dynamic principle to the method of teaching 
414
-P-A-G-E-459
CHANGING METHODS 
this subject. There is a peculiar situation to deal with 
since children do not naturally feel any concern about 
health, and it is difficult to make them careful in respect 
to health matters. It takes a skilful parent or teacher to 
convince a five or six-year-old child that if he puts dirty 
fingers in his mouth he may suffer from internal pains, or 
become sick so that he will have to stay in bed. Nature 
seems to say to a young child: “Put your fingers in your 
mouth whenever you want to. Then when you take them 
out of your mouth, and they are covered with saliva, 
pick up dirty objects if you wish to, and then put your 
fingers in your mouth again. Don’t pay any attention to 
dirt.” In the same way, nature encourages a child to 
run out in the rain, to lie down in the grass or sand when 
he is overheated, to gulp down his food, to eat anything 
he likes at any time he can get it and especially to eat an 
excess of sweets, to give no attention to the care of his 
teeth, eyes, or skin; in short, nature apparently says to 
children: “Go ahead and do anything you want to, 
enjoy yourself in any way you wish, and don’t take any 
thought about your health.”’ 
In teaching any health habit, it must be connected 
directly with the child’s wish to run faster, to climb higher, 
to throw straighter than rivals, and to be always able to 
take part in the games that are going on. If he throws 
himself down on the ground, for instance, when he is 
overheated, he will not be able to do any of these things 
as well as if he would stand up and keep moving when he 
is perspiring. Asa matter of fact, this is one of the health 
habits that it is difficult to lead young children to observe; 
it is difficult to induce children in the teens even to 
observe it. 
Further, pains and aches must be connected directly 
with unhygienic habits. It is of no use to say to a child 
that he will have a pain if he violates a health rule; but 
when the pain comes, the parent can lead him to see the

cause of it; and when this is done systematically the child 
will make the connection in due course. Then when he is 
tempted to crack a nut with his teeth, say, the thought of 
the pain that is likely to follow may restrain him. Of 
course, one cannot expect that one or two warnings will 
hold impulses in check. Only by constant and unvarying 
repetition for many months can a child establish the 
connection between unhygienic habits and pain, sickness, 
and lessened ability to do what he wishes to do. 
It will not be possible to show in detail how dynamic 
methods are coming to be used in all the subjects of 
study, but space may be taken to point out briefly how 
the dynamic principle is being observed in the teaching 
of the so-called formal or mechanical studies. Take 
spelling, for instance. Formerly pupils stood up in a row 
and spelled orally the words pronounced by the teacher. 
To-day in any progressive school the pupils write the 
words, as well as spell them orally, and they use them in 
sentences as they are likely to use them in writing letters, 
reports, or essays. It has been shown experimentally 
that one may be able to write isolated words in a list 
accurately and readily, but hemay not beable to writethem 
so accurately or so readily when they occur in sentences, 
for the reason that spelling habits, like all other habits, 
are very specific. When one has learned to spell a word 
in a certain situation, he can spell it in that situation but 
not so readily, if at all, in a different situation; that is to 
say, when the circumstances in which a word has been 
learned are altered even slightly, an individual may not 
show a secure mastery of it. Spelling of familiar words 
ought to be largely automatic, which requires that they 
should be learned in school as they will be used in daily 
life; that is, they should be written in the types of 
sentences in which they most frequently occur. 
Again, the dynamic method is being observed in the 
teaching of handwriting. According to the static method, 
416
-P-A-G-E-461
CHANGING METHODS 
the pupil learns to write by reproducing copies in a special 
copy book. He first practices the elements of the letters, 
and later he combines these as they occur in letters; and 
finally he combines the letters into short words first and 
then into longer words. As a result of this system of 
training, the pupil may be able to write esthetically in 
his copy book, but he may write altogether differently 
when he needs to use handwriting in the expression of his 
thoughts. A pupil taught in this way thinks of hand- 
writing as an accomplishment for a special handwriting 
period. He has not used it as a medium for the expression 
of thought, so that it is regarded as a sort of thing in 
itself, possessing characteristics of inherent value. In 
learning to write he gave his attention mainly to the 
mechanical processes involved, so that when he writes 
now he has to continue to give conscious attention to 
the mechanical processes. 
When handwriting has thus been practiced in a special 
period during eight years, with attention focused upon 
the mechanics of the process, it cannot then be used 
automatically merely as a medium of expression. One 
may see in the schools of foreign countries, and he may 
still see in some of our own schools, pupils who cannot use 
writing automatically in conveying their ideas to others. 
When they take their pens in hand to express themselves, 
their thinking ceases. One may observe children who 
have practiced handwriting as a special exercise for ten 
or fifteen minutes a day all through the elementary 
school, whose mental processes are slowed down by the 
pen. When they are asked to express themselves on any 
topic on which they could talk freely and at great length 
or to write a letter to a friend, they do not know what to 
say and they ask for assistance. With such children the 
pen has become a barrier to the expression of thought. 
But when pupils are taught according to the dynamic 
principle, they acquire their handwriting in connection 
417 
 
-P-A-G-E-462
The

of Reading THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
with the expression of their ideas in the different subjects 
of study in the school and in communication with their 
friends outside of school. Theylearn to write by writing. 
Of course, they must devote some attention at the outset 
to the mere mechanics of constructing letters and words, 
but they are required at the earliest possible moment to 
express their thoughts through the medium of hand- 
writing. As they pass through the grades they have an 
increasing amount of experience in readily employing 
handwriting in the expression of ideas, so that by the 
time they reach the eighth grade handwriting becomes 
largely an automatic medium of expression for most of 
them. The pen can be used then in graphic expression 
much as the tongue is used in oral expression. If a pupil 
had been required to spend fifteen minutes a day all 
through the grades in the study of the mechanics of speech, 
and if he had not had training in the use of oral language 
in conveying his experience and his views to others, he 
would not be able to use oral language any more freely 
in the eighth grade in expressing thought than he can use 
handwriting when he has learned it as a thing in itself 
and not as medium of expression. This psychological 
fact is accountable for the change which is taking place in 
our country in the teaching of handwriting in the schools. 
The old copy books are going, and in many places have 
gone completely. 
Take another illustration—the teaching of reading. 
In our schools a few years ago, pupils prepared each 
reading lesson by studying the new and difficult words so 
they could pronounce them. When they came to recite, 
their effort was centered chiefly upon pronouncing the 
words accurately. Classmates kept watch of each reader 
in order to note whether he miscalled any of the words. 
This method of teaching has been or is being abandoned 
in every progressive school system. Instead of emphasis 
being placed upon the correct pronunciation of -words, 
418
-P-A-G-E-463
CHANGING METHODS 
it is now placed upon the gaining of thought readily and 
accurately and expressing it easily and pleasingly. It 
has been shown experimentally that a pupil may be able 
to read a page without error in pronunciation and still 
he may have only a hazy notion of the meaning of what 
he reads. Also, he may read slowly and painfully. 
But in actual life his chief concern will be to get the 
content of his reading rapidly and accurately, for other- 
wise he will be handicapped, since the amount which one 
must read in order to keep in touch with the life about 
him is already enormous and is constantly increasing. 
Furthermore, the need for oral reading is constantly 
declining. A large proportion of persons in present-day 
American life are hardly ever called upon to read orally; 
but they are constantly called upon to read rapidly in 
order to gain an understanding of, and to keep in touch 
with, the life about them. Practically all of the reading 
of most persons to-day is “‘silent.” It is not necessary 
that they should pronounce the words they read; on the 
contrary, it is better that they should not pronounce them, 
actually or internally, for the reason that the pronuncia- 
tion of words slows down the process of gaining thought. 
Any reader of these lines may test himself; if he mentally 
pronounces all the words he reads, he is a slow and inef- 
fective reader. On the other hand, if he can grasp the 
meaning of phrases or clauses without mentally pronouncing 
the words, he is more likely to be a rapid and effective 
reader. The larger the units hecan interpret without being 
conscious of the words—or at least without pronouncing 
them—the better reader he will be, so far as the needs of 
contemporary American life are concerned. 
Now, if in teaching a child to read, emphasis is con- 
stantly placed upon correct oral pronunciation of words, 
he will acquire mental habits which will make it difficult 
if at all possible for him to read as rapidly and effectively, 
so far as grasping the content of his reading is concerned. 
419

Language THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
as if he had had much experience at the outset in reading 
solely for the purpose of gaining meaning accurately and 
rapidly. For this reason, we are striving in our schools to 
have children from the first grade on throughout all the 
grades read silently for a large part of each reading period 
and then state in their own words or to act out the thought 
of what they have read. They are trained to read as 
rapidly as possible so that they will not be halted in the 
gaining of meaning by giving attention to separate 
words, since explicit awareness of separate words in one’s 
reading delays and often confuses the process of inter- 
preting the thought contained in the reading. 
We may mention one further illustration of the appli- 
cation of the dynamic principle in the method of present- 
ing studies in American schools to-day. Probably most 
of the readers of these lines have studied French, German, 
Spanish, or Italian in school. If they studied any of these 
languages twenty or twenty-five years ago, they know 
that chief emphasis was then placed upon grammar. 
They learned the vocabulary of the languages by con- 
necting each word with its English equivalent. They did 
not use the foreign language in the classroom; they always 
recited in the native tongue. Their reading in the foreign 
tongue was designed principally for the purpose of 
illustrating the grammatical rules which they had memo- 
rized. Consequently pupils did not gain the ability to 
speak the language, to read it readily, to understand it 
when spoken, or to write it easily. Investigations recently 
made have shown that pupils in the high school who have 
spent four years in studying a foreign language have often 
found themselves utterly unable to use the language when 
in need of it while visiting the country in which it is the 
native tongue. Anyone who has seen much of Americans 
in France, Germany, or Italy knows that only very 
rarely can they use the native language of any of those 
countries though they may have studied it for a number 
420
-P-A-G-E-465
CHANGING METHODS 
of years. They were taught the language in a static way 
and consequently it is not of service to them now. 
The static method still prevails in the teaching of 
foreign languages in our schools more largely than it does 
in the teaching of any other subject probably, but still 
it is being abandoned in many places in favor of the 
dynamic method. One may visit progressive schools 
in which pupils are actually using the foreign language 
which they are studying. Emphasis is placed upon 
speaking, reading, and understanding a language, rather 
than upon a mastery of its technique. The pupils are 
required to interpret the teacher’s communications in the 
foreign language; they exchange ideas with one another 
in the language; they write it as well as speak it, and they 
read it without waiting to get a complete knowledge of 
its grammatical construction. That is to say, they learn 
the foreign language in the way in which they will need 
to employ it. They do not neglect grammatical study, 
but it plays a decidedly subordinate rdle; it is resorted to 
principally in order to help the learner to interpret 
correctly what he reads or hears. So long as he can 
interpret accurately without grammatical study, he is 
permitted and encouraged to go forward with the use of 
the language. 
During the past two decades the methods of teaching 
in our schools have changed rapidly and profoundly. 
The critics of our schools think that our newer methods 
give children too much freedom, and especially that they 
substitute too largely the use of the hand for the exercise 
of the brain. Visitors from foreign countries are always 
forcibly impressed by the activity which they observe in 
our schoolrooms. In practically all foreign countries the 
methods of teaching consist mainly in requiring pupils to 
memorize contents of books and to recite them without 
verbal error. 
A slogan of our American teachers for the past two 
421 Summary

THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
decades has been, ‘‘Learn to Do by Doing.” The great 
writers on education from John Locke to Herbert 
Spencer have endorsed and emphasized this principle. 
During the past few years our educational psycholo- 
gists have shown that a pupil may be able to recite a rule 
correctly and apply it accurately to a textbook problem, 
but that at the same time he may not be able to apply it 
to an actual problem such as he has to deal with in daily 
life. So our teachers say, ‘“Have the pupil learn things 
in the school in the way in which he will have to use them 
outside of school.”’ 
The term, dynamic, is becoming common in our 
educational literature. It is used in contrast to the term, 
static. It means that in our methods of teaching we aim 
to have pupils learn by actually performing the processes 
they are studying, rather than by sitting in their seats 
and memorizing words about the processes. 
We are coming to believe that words are merely 
symbols and that they gain meaning only as they are 
learned in connection with concrete, dynamic experience. 
The changes that are taking place in our methods of 
teaching are based upon this principle. The aim of all 
progressive schools to-day is to have pupils master 
things and actions as well as words and rules. 
Each subject in the curriculum, even so formal a 
subject as spelling, can be taught in a dynamic as con- 
trasted with a static way. The most resourceful teachers 
are the most successful in devising dynamic methods in 
presenting all subjects. The more completely a pupil 
can do what he has learned, the more completely he 
attains the ideal we are striving for in the methods of 
teaching in our schools. This principle applies to spell- 
ing, handwriting, reading, and other formal subjects, 
as well as to content studies. 
In no subject is the dynamic principle being applied 
more thoroughly or with greater success than in the

teaching of children to become good citizens. Formerly 
pupils studied civil government by memorizing the 
contents of a textbook; now they organize their school 
into a community and administer it as a miniature society. 
They also study concretely how the government of the 
town or city in which they live is actually carried on and 
with what results. Pupils come to appreciate their 
country and gain a love for it because they are led to 
understand how it cares for them, protects their well- 
being, and safeguards them at home and abroad. 
The teaching of health in our schools is being pro- 
foundly affected by the dynamic principle. Formerly 
pupils learned definitions of the organs of the body and 
their functions. To-day they become familiar with the 
requirements for maintaining health and vigor so that 
they may accomplish the objectives in which they are 
interested and avoid losing time and suffering pain because 
they violate the laws of nature.

Our People XX 
PROMOTING THE HEALTH AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 
HE medical examination of young men during the 
World War revealed a surprising situation in 
respect to the health and physical development of 
our people, as Dr. Winslow has shown in Chapter XI 
of this volume. We had been assuming that we were a 
strong, vigorous, healthy nation. We had been going 
ahead in our work, our amusements, and all our under- 
takings at such a rapid pace that we had taken it for 
granted that our people were in good health or they 
would have had to slow down in their activities. But the 
results of the medical examination of soldiers put an end 
to our assumptions regarding our superior physical 
condition. A large proportion of young men in the prime 
of life were found to be physically defective in one way or 
another and to be below par in general health. Most 
surprising of all, it was found that a larger proportion of 
young men born and reared in the country than in the 
city were suffering from maldevelopment of various sorts 
and were not up to the standard in physical vigor. They 
bore the effects of early diseases that left weaknesses and 
deformities sufficiently serious to unfit them for military 
service. They showed lack of normal development of the 
different members of the body which, even if they were 
not marked enough to prevent them from entering the 
war, would nevertheless prove a handicap in the enter- 
prises of daily life. 
Even the Federal health authorities were impressed 
by the evidence of the inferior physical condition of 
424
-P-A-G-E-471
  PROMOTING HEALTH AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
young men at a time in life when bodily and mental 
vigor should be at the maximum and maldevelopment 
should be least conspicuous. The newspapers as well as 
the medical, and to some extent the general, magazines 
have been devoting much space to a discussion of the 
reasons why so many of our young men are not better 
developed physically and are below a reasonable standard 
of health so that they cannot meet the requirements of 
the sort of life they would have to undergo in the army. 
The chief conclusion which must be drawn from this 
discussion is that we have not undertaken to solve the 
problem of the sound physical development and the 
promotion of the health of the young in as thorough- 
going a way as we have undertaken to solve most of our 
other problems. We have been so busy developing our 
natural resources that we have overlooked to a harmful 
extent the development of our human resources; and we 
have been so impressed by our material successes and 
prosperity that we have not as a people been much im- 
pressed by the prevalence among us of physical defects 
and deficiencies and ill-health. Professor Fisher and 
others, especially persons connected with the Life Exten- 
sion Institute, have been saying for some time that a 
large proportion of our people are losing from ten to 
thirty or forty per cent of their time and energy because 
of preventable diseases, and that this constitutes a very 
serious economic loss, to say nothing about the distress 
which is caused thereby. We have had such unequalled 
success in the development of machines to take the place 
of human hands that most of us have not noted the fact 
that workers in factories are laid off and our pupils in 
school are absent frequently, caused by diseases that could 
quite easily be avoided. 
Our people are becoming thoroughly aroused in 
regard to this matter and are determined that the physical 
development and the health of our school children shall

be improved. A large number of national, state, and 
local organizations have been and are being formed for 
the purpose of investigating the health conditions of the 
young, and are taking proper steps to improve these condi- 
tions. As these lines are being written, the organization 
of the Child Health Association of America is being 
completed, and Herbert Hoover, Secretary of Com- 
merce, is taking the leadership of the Association. This 
is a significant fact because it indicates how seriously 
our people are taking hold of the task of promoting the 
health and physical development of the young. The 
Federal Children’s Bureau has been devoting some at- 
tention for years to the subject of the health of school 
children, and it is proposed to devote much more attention 
to it in the future. State and city boards of health 
throughout the country are awakening to the necessity of 
getting at the causes which made it impossible for so 
large a proportion of our young men to meet the require- 
ments of service in the army, and then to modify or 
eliminate those causes. 
The first point of attack in the promotion of the health 
and normal physical development of school children is the 
hygiene of school buildings. There can be no doubt that 
a considerable part of the preventable disease and mal- 
development among the young is due to the fact that 
most of our children are in school buildings from three to 
five hours a day for an average of five days a week, forty 
weeks in the year, from the age of six to the age of four- 
teen—the period when physical development is most 
rapid and when defects and deformities can become 
established most easily. Nature undoubtedly intended 
that the young should live an active muscular life out in 
the open during the developmental period. When the 
human body was being constructed, man lived out of 
doors and he had to engage in an active muscular life for 
subsistence. Almost over night, as such things should be 
426 
   
-P-A-G-E-473
    
PROMOTING HEALTH AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
measured, we have changed our mode of living so 
that instead of being out in the open, hunting and 
fishing, etc., for a living, we now spend our time indoors, 
usually in a sitting posture, and we exercise the brain 
principally instead of the muscles. This change in our 
habits of living has an unfavorable effect upon the young 
particularly. Nature is more insistent that the young 
should live a motor life than that adults should do so; but 
we put our children in a school building at the age of 
five or six and keep them there a considerable part of 
their waking life for from eight to twelve years. And to 
add to the injurious effect of such a life for the young, the 
educational methods which have been in vogue heretofore 
have required that children should sit in seats learning 
lessons or reciting them during practically all of their 
time in school buildings. The wonder is that a larger 
proportion of them have not been defective or deformed 
or their vitality weakened so that they could not resist 
disease. 
Serious attention is now being given to the improve- 
ment of the hygiene of school buildings and their equip- 
ment. First of all, an effort is being made to provide air 
within school buildings which shall be, as near as possible, 
like the air out of doors. It has been shown that a large 
proportion of the diseases from which school children 
suffer are due to the unhygienic atmospheric conditions 
in school buildings. Numerous investigations have 
impressed the fact that the air has been too dry and too 
hot and that it has contained dust which carried disease 
germs. ‘Too often it has been “dead,” which is chiefly 
responsible for the prevalence of respiratory diseases 
among school children. These facts are now quite 
generally understood by educational people and, to some 
extent, by laymen; and in the new school buildings that 
are being erected, special appliances are being installed so 
that the atmospheric conditions will be more healthful 
427 The Problem 
of Hygienic 
Ventilation

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
than has been the case heretofore, speaking generally. 
Older school buildings are being reconstructed with a 
view to improving the ventilation so that the air in the 
schoolroom will closely approximate the air out of doors 
in every quality except temperature. Some States have 
enacted laws requiring that plans for every new school 
building shall be submitted to expert authorities who are 
charged with the responsibility of securing proper ventila- 
ting and heating arrangements so as to conserve the health 
of school children. 
The problem of the one-room rural school is the most 
difficult to solve, but even here conditions are being 
rapidly improved through the installation of better heat- 
ing, ventilating, and humidifying devices. A number of 
States have passed laws requiring that all stoves in school 
rooms shall be provided with jackets so that the heat may 
be distributed with some degree of uniformity throughout 
the schoolroom. There is a movement also in the direc- 
tion of requiring that every schoolroom heated by a stove 
shall be provided with an inlet for fresh air to be heated 
and distributed about the room. However, the writer 
has very recently inspected rural schools in certain States 
in which no intelligent attention has yet been given to 
problems of heating, ventilating, or humidifying the air. 
In such schoolrooms a large proportion of pupils are 
afflicted throughout the fall and winter months with 
respiratory troubles. 
Defects Due The medical examination of soldiers showed that 
sae defects due to unhygienic posture during the develop- 
Sekclenae mental period—spinal curvature, for instance—were 
found among young men. And the discussion of the 
matter by physicians, teachers, and laymen has empha- 
sized a fact already understood by many persons, that 
school seats improperly adjusted to the children who sit 
in them are responsible for certain defects in physical 
development. During the past two or three decades, 
428 
 
-P-A-G-E-475
  PROMOTING HEALTH AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
superintendents, principals, and teachers have been call- 
ing the attention of boards of education and patrons of 
the schools to the necessity of providing seats for school 
children properly adjusted to their physical measure- 
ments. Ifashort child and a tall child are required to use 
a seat and desk of the same height, one or the other will 
have to assume an unhygienic posture, and if this is 
continued for several hours each day for a number of 
years, it is practically certain that there will be mal- 
development in some respect. Even before the prevalence 
of physical defects among young people was revealed by 
medical examiners during the World War, school buildings 
were beginning to be equipped with seats which were 
adaptable to the physical measurements of pupils. One 
may safely predict that it will not be long before school 
children throughout the country will not have to use 
while they are in the schoolroom furniture which will 
habitually require them to assume unhygienic postures. 
And not only are school buildings and furnishings 
being determined in view of the requirements for the 
promotion of the health and physical development of the 
young, but the program of school work is also being 
scrutinized from the same standpoint. The school day 
_of children in the various grades and in the high school 
is being studied in order to ascertain how the various 
tasks can be arranged and performed so as to avoid 
unnecessary fatigue. It has been shown by investigations 
that studies which require substantially the same mental 
or motor processes, if they follow one another directly 
in the day’s program, will be more likely to cause fatigue 
in pupils than if studies that do not use the same mental 
or motor processes are alternated. Further, the hygiene 
of each branch of instruction is being studied in order to 
determine how it can be pursued with the least nervous 
wear and tear. In short, every phase of the problem of 
schoolroom fatigue has recently been or is now being

investigated, and it may be predicted that, in due time 
teachers will be able to arrange the daily, weekly, and 
monthly programs of work and present each branch of 
instruction so that the energies of pupils will not be 
wastefully dissipated. 
As a result of investigations already concluded, one 
reform has been achieved in our schools. Formerly very 
young children were required to perform tasks requiring 
a high degree of muscular control and coérdination. 
Thus pupils in the first grade were expected to write with 
pens having sharp points, to do fine work in sewing, and to 
thread needles having small eyes. They were provided 
with small blocks for building purposes. In fact, all their 
school activities were based on the false principle, that the 
smaller the child the more delicate his fingers and muscles 
and the finer and more highly coGrdinated tasks 
he should be required to perform. But this pro- 
gram has been completely changed in the progressive 
schools of our country. Instead of requiring the youngest 
children to do the finest work, while permitting older 
children large freedom in this respect, the order is reversed. 
The youngest children now do not generally write with 
pens or if they doit is with those that have coarse points. 
The pencils they use have soft lead. The youngest 
children are not required to write in small spaces demand- 
ing precise muscular control; they write a large, coarse 
hand. They have large blocks for building purposes. If 
they engage in sewing at all, they do coarse work and use 
large needles with large eyes. 
The youngest children are not required to toe a line 
and maintain a controlled attitude in their recitations for 
a very considerable period, but this may be required of 
the older children whose nervous development makes it 
possible for them to perform such tasks without over- 
strain. Each year as they develop they are required to 
‘work with smaller implements and to perform tasks

demanding increasingly fine coérdinations, on the prin- 
ciple that in the development of the nervous system 
the centers that govern large muscles and coarse, non- 
precise movements should be exercised earlier than the 
centers that control highly codrdinate movements. 
When young children attempt to execute highly coérdi- 
nated activities for which their nervous development has 
not adequately prepared them, they become fatigued 
easily. Much of the schoolroom fatigue of the era now 
passing has been due to the excessive demands made 
on pupils in the performance of precise and complicated 
motor tasks. 
It is not intended to convey the impression that 
school children do not show any overstrain in our schools 
to-day; quite the contrary is true, in fact. It is claimed 
by medical inspectors in the various cities of our country 
that a sufficiently large proportion of school children are 
overstrained to invite the serious attention of parents, 
teachers, and boards of education. It is believed that 
one cause of this overstrain is malnourishment. The 
children are not sufficiently nourished to provide energy 
for all the demands that are made upon them. In the 
attempt to solve this problem, schools everywhere are 
instituting a program of school feeding for children who 
show under-nourishment or overstrain. Milk is furnished 
to such children in the middle of the forenoon session, by 
school authorities and sometimes in the middle of the 
afternoon. It is becoming the practice to furnish school 
lunches at noon to children who reveal deficiencies in 
their nutrition. Of course, malnourishment is not always 
due to an inadequate amount of food; it is due as frequent- 
ly to improper food or to the environments in which a 
child lives, which keep him in a highly tense or irritated 
condition so that he cannot properly assimilate the food 
which he consumes. In New York, Chicago, Boston, and 
other cities, the whole subject is under investigation by

civic or private welfare organizations. The general 
phases of the problem have been discussed in Chapter IX, 
and it will not be necessary to go into the matter in further 
detail here. 
It is beginning to be appreciated that the overstrain 
so often seen in school children is not due principally or 
even largely to the excessive demands of the school 
curriculum upon nervous energy but rather to the con- 
ditions surrounding children, especially in towns and cities. 
The present writer has called attention in another con- 
nection to the over-stimulating effect upon the young 
of contemporary life in our country and a few paragraphs 
may be quoted because they bear directly upon the 
problem of fatigue among school children. 
“From one point of view we would not expect either 
children or adults to be overtaxed in these times. We 
do not work as hard now as our forefathers did fifty years 
ago. In former days, the young and the old alike arose 
with the sun and were often busy at hard labor until the 
sun went down. This program was carried out day 
after day, week after week, and month after month. 
Nowadays, there are fewer hours of labor, and work is 
not so heavy as it was formerly, for we have learned how 
to make machines perform the heaviest parts of our tasks. 
‘‘And yet we learn from many sources that there is 
overstrain among the young as well as among adults. 
This is undoubtedly due to the fact that the majority of 
young persons, as well as adults, to-day do more work 
that overtaxes brain and nerves than they did thirty 
years ago. There is a difference between being muscularly 
tired and being nervously tense and strained. Modern 
urban life tends to put children’s nerves on edge. Even 
if a child does not have to do any hard work, mental or 
physical, he can still hardly escape from being intensely 
stimulated much of the time. To-day he must adapt 
himself to many more people than would have been 
432 
 
-P-A-G-E-483
    PROMOTING HEALTH AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
required of him twenty-five years ago, and this is likely 
to develop nervous tension. Following a plow all day 
long is easy on nerves compared with meeting different 
people throughout the day and adjusting oneself to them. 
In addition, a large proportion of young persons must be 
on crowded streets a considerable part of each day, dodg- 
ing vehicles, getting out of the way of pedestrians, being 
angered because of the apparent meanness or selfishness of 
adults, or being intensely stimulated in rivalry with com- 
petitors, or in anticipation of approaching exciting events. 
“One who is using his muscles mainly is working along 
lines of least resistance, as compared with one who is 
using his brain constantly, whether in study, in social 
adaptation, or in dealing with complicated and constantly 
shifting situations such as city life presents. In following 
a plow the work soon becomes largely automatic, and 
the mind moves along unobstructedly in a sort of day 
dream. The plowman is not constantly wrestling with 
dificult problems. His energies are being expended 
mostly through his muscles, thus relieving his nervous 
system. When he has finished his day’s work he can lie 
down and he may be asleep as soon as his head touches 
the pillow. 
“But it is quite the reverse with one who has been 
chiefly using his brain all day, who has been trying to 
solve involved problems of one kind or another, and who 
has not used his muscles very actively. When night 
comes the brain and nervous system of such a person are 
likely to be unduly stimulated and he cannot relax im- 
mediately. Often he will lie awake for hours after he 
retires. He may talk in his sleep and be partially aroused 
during the night. His nervous system does not become 
entirely relaxed at any time. But the plowboy prob- 
ably can secure profound sleep during the entire night. 
“Take a young person who is in contact with many 
people of different dispositions, who is in a large, complex

The Chief 
Cause of 
Overstrain 
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
school for several hours each day, who has parties to give 
and to attend, whose home constantly, is in a more or 
less excited state because of the complicated life which is 
streaming through it,—such a child is very likely to 
become overstrained. He may have ‘colds’ or indigestion 
or a fever, but the fundamental cause is nervous over- 
strain. 
“In remedying this condition, the first point to 
appreciate is that overstrain results from the effort to 
adapt oneself to too many and too complex situations. 
Every reader of these lines has probably at some time 
had the experience of having half a dozen problems 
pressing upon him for solution at the same time. His 
attention was drawn first here and now there and again 
in another direction, and he could not go forward in any 
direction because he was in the hands, so to speak, of 
conflicting and competing ideas and desires. He was 
literally torn by mental conflict. So long as competing 
or conflicting ideas prevent one from working through 
first one problem and then another, he will be tense and 
he will feel strain and stress. Some persons, children as 
well as adults, are able to deal with complicated situations 
much more easily than other persons, because they have 
the power of shutting out every problem but the one they 
are working on at the moment. When the one in hand 
is solved they take up the next one, and so they go on; 
and they get through a relatively large amount of difficult 
mental work without overstrain. 
“In preventing overstrain in a child, then, we must 
limit the number of problems that press upon him at any 
moment. This is always an individual matter. The 
parent or the teacher who knows the child alone can 
determine how complicated a life he can live—whether 
he can do all the work of his grade in school, whether he 
can participate in competitions and contests, whether he 
can endure all the examinations that are ordinarily given 
434 
   
-P-A-G-E-485
    PROMOTING HEALTH AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
in the school, and whether he can take part in outside 
activities—practice music, for instance, and attend parties. 
Some children can do all these things and not show over- 
strain, while other children would be broken in trying 
to carry through so complicated a program. 
“The home and school should make an attempt to 
counteract the exciting influences of the street. At certain 
periods, every pupil in school and every member of a 
family should be quiet. Young and old alike should 
learn to sit still. Merely to tell children to keep quiet will 
not accomplish much, of course; this is more likely to 
accentuate restlessness than tosubdue it. But if some- 
one will tell or read a captivating story every day, or 
describe an interesting event or object or natural law, 
so that all who hear it will listen and be still, it will prove 
an excellent discipline and a restorative for the nervous 
system. 
“Tt is peculiarly unfortunate that the voices of Ameri- 
can parents and teachers often increase the tension and 
excitability of the young. A high-pitched, rasping, loud, 
restless voice will overstimulate the majority of children 
within its reach. Even adults cannot listen quietly to 
such a voice. On the other hand, a well-placed, well- 
controlled, modulated voice is soothing to an over- 
wrought nervous system. One who will make observa- 
tions can see persons who are tense and restless becoming 
calm under the influence of such a voice. Parents and 
teachers should keep this fact in mind, for one can control 
the quality of his voice to some extent. If he allows 
himself to become tense the evil effect will be apparent 
in his voice, which is delicately responsive to one’s mental 
and nervous condition. 
“Something could be done in the school, too, to offset 
the lack of poise in the life outside. In the Montessori 
schools there are brief periods of quiet each day. A 
signal is sounded on the piano, the room is darkened, and 
435
-P-A-G-E-486
  Medical

in Schools ‘THe CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
children become relaxed and quiet. They remain so for 
a little time; then another signal is sounded, the room is 
made light again, and the work progresses. Every school- 
room should have several brief periods during the day 
when the pupils should relax. There is no danger of 
overdoing relaxation in American life. The danger is on 
the other side,—that there will not be enough of it, no 
matter what program we may follow in the effort to 
secure it.” 
Reference has been made to the investigations being 
conducted by medical inspectors throughout the country. 
It should be added here that there are very few com- 
munities of ten thousand or more inhabitants in which 
there is not at least one physician or trained nurse who is 
employed to make physical examinations of school chil- 
dren and recommend proper treatment of defects, de- 
ficiencies, or diseases. In some of the largest cities— 
Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, San Francisco, and the 
like—there is a large staff of well-trained physicians and 
nurses who devote their entire time to promoting the 
health and physical development of school children. They 
examine every pupil at least once, and often twice, a year. 
They make reports to parents or guardians respecting the 
condition of the health and physical development of each 
child. When they find defects of posture and develop- 
ment, they outline a remedial program. If they discover 
that a child is suffering from adenoids, infected tonsils, 
carious teeth, or defective vision or hearing, they advise 
parents respecting the procedure which should be fol- 
lowed in order to correct the difficulties. Nurses visit the 
home to see if the recommendations of the medical 
inspectors are carried out. Some States have laws re- 
quiring that medical inspectors or nurses be provided for 
rural as well as for town and city schools, and it is probable 
that all the States soon will enact legislation of this 
character.

  PROMOTING HEALTH AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
Not only do the medical inspectors and nurses make 
examinations in order to discover defects or diseases 
already contracted, but they are on the alert to prevent 
the spread of disease among school children and the 
contracting of diseases due to improper posture or misuse 
of the senses or members of the body, particularly the 
eyes. In consequence of very active investigation and 
discussion of these matters during the past two decades, 
there is to-day less strain put upon the eyes in an 
up-to-date American school than there was formerly. The 
print in text books has been improved and this has helped 
to correct bad posture of pupils in school work. 
With a view to promoting sound physical development 
among our children, schools everywhere are adopting a 
program of physical education, which includes gymnastics 
and games and plays of all sorts. States like Wisconsin 
require that there shall be a certain amount of physical 
training in all the schools of the State. New school build- 
ings are being equipped with gymnasiums and sometimes 
with swimming pools, and teachers are engaged who have 
had special training in physical education with a view 
to teaching the young. Normal schools and universities 
are establishing courses in physical education for teachers 
in the public schools so that they may direct the physical 
training of the young, and the enrollment in these courses 
is increasing with extraordinary rapidity. There can be 
little doubt that we have entered upon a program which 
if carried through to completion will secure better physical 
development and better health among school children 
than has been the case in the past. 
There is one movement which promises to accomplish a 
good deal in promoting the physical development and the 
health of our young people, and this is the establishment 
of playgrounds in towns and cities, and even in rural sec- 
tions, and arranging the work of children of all ages 
so that every day they will have opportunity for plays

and games. There is apparently complete agreement 
among those who have charge of the care and culture 
of the young that health and physical development can 
be promoted more effectually by plays and games than 
by formal gymnastics, though the latter have a place 
in the child’s physical education. Everywhere there is an 
insistent demand that a playground be established within 
the reach of pupils in every school, and that it be properly 
equipped and be under the supervision of a trained play 
leader. A slogan frequently heard throughout our country 
to-day is,—‘‘Playground facilities for every child in 
elementary and high schools!’ High schools and univer- 
sities are endeavoring to secure adequate playground 
space so that every student may have an opportunity 
to participate in games. Some high schools and col- 
leges are requiring all students to play one or more games 
as a regular feature of their program. Swimming is being 
made a requirement for graduation in some places. 
One often hears it said that the children in the city 
are greatly handicapped because they have no place for 
games and plays except the street, but that the children 
in the towns and in the country are more fortunate, since 
they have plenty of open space in which to play. But, 
as a matter of fact, most towns and country districts 
have inadequate facilities for play. In some such com- 
munities recently visited by the writer, little effort has 
been made to provide opportunities for games and plays. 
The children are often limited to a vacant lot; but even 
if vacant lots could be used for play, they are usually not 
suitable therefor, since it is rare that one can find such a 
lot which is adapted to baseball, football, or any of the 
tag games, and certainly not for any gymnastic activities. 
The country school building is often located on a small 
plot of ground which does not afford sufficient space for 
the games and plays which children like and in which they 
should indulge. The farmers protest if the pupils make

use of the fields adjoining the school grounds for any of 
their games. In some rural districts the teacher is under 
constant criticism because her pupils over-run the property 
adjoining the school, when they do not have room to play 
their games on the school grounds. Some important 
surveys of country life recently have been completed and 
they show that, except in rare instances, no one has 
devoted time or thought to providing facilities for plays 
and games for children in the country. 
Fortunately, the country roads as well as the untilled 
fields and the woods afford opportunities for the young 
to play some of the games in which they take delight; but 
they do not provide for all their needs. The children in 
the typical country school have no place where they can 
play baseball, for instance, or football or basketball or 
any of the ball games of which they are passionately 
fond. Country children, contrary to popular belief, do 
not play as great a variety of games as children in towns 
or cities where there are playgrounds. They are handi- 
capped particularly in respect to facilities for gymnastic 
activities, so that the city child who is within reach of a 
weil-conducted playground is better off, even with all 
the disadvantages of city life, than the country child 
for whom no provision has been made. 
The rapid drift of population to the cities makes the 
problem of promoting the health and physical develop- 
ment of the young largely an urban problem. In an 
earlier day, cities were planned as though children were 
not to live in them, or at least were not to enjoy any 
special rights in them. We have been hearing a good 
deal in the last few years about the rights of different 
groups of persons—women’s rights, employers’ rights, 
workers’ rights, and so on. We have rarely heard any- 
thing said, until quite recently, though, about children’s 
rights. Do they have any special rights? This is being 
very actively discussed now in a city which the writer 
439 
  The Health 
and Physical
-P-A-G-E-492
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
is studying. Many of the children have roller skates. 
Nearly every one of them has an express wagon or a 
coaster or a racer of some kind. They indulge in 
roller skating and operate their wagons on the sidewalks 
at all hours during the day. It need hardly be said that 
they make a lot of noise. Roller skating is a noisy pastime, 
and riding in a cart which does not have rubber tires is 
even noisier. A number of citizens in the city under 
observation have written to the newspapers complaining 
about the “‘frightful racket’? which the children make. 
They say it has become so annoying that it is impossible 
to secure an hour’s quiet anywhere in the city. Nervous 
people say they are made ill by these incessant, irritating 
noises. The police have been asked to put an end to the 
nuisance, but they are unwilling to proceed against the 
children, because they say there are no laws which make it 
an offense for children to skate or run carts on the side- 
walks. 
This is a typical problem which has to be solved sooner 
or later by every city of any size. Children who play 
on the streets of a crowded city are always a disturbing 
factor. They not only make noise but they get in the 
way of pedestrians and commerce. In some cities rigorous 
laws are put on the statute books compelling children to 
keep off the streets. If there are no public playgrounds, 
then they are required to play in their own homes. Of 
course, they often take a chance and try to play on the 
streets, but they are always being chased by the police 
and frequently penalties are inflicted upon them or their 
parents for violating the laws. 
We are coming to see that no city can solve this 
problem satisfactorily which does not proceed on the 
principle that children as well as adults have rights which 
must be respected. Does this mean that children should 
be allowed to roller skate in a city whenever and wherever 
they choose, and also to operate their express cars, throw 
440 
 
-P-A-G-E-493
  PROMOTING HEALTH AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
snowballs, roll hoops, and run over lawns? It means 
nothing of the kind. When a large proportion of the 
adults claim that they are irritated by the noise which 
the children make, the latter must be restrained to 
some extent. Either they must indulge in their noise- 
making activities in certain streets set aside for them or, 
if this is not feasible, then they must play their noisy 
games at certain times during the day and not at other 
times. Adults who are frightened by roller skates, carts, 
and the like might be able to work out a program so that 
for two hours each day, say, the children could engage in 
these pastimes, if during the rest of the day the adults 
could be sure that they would not be disturbed; but the 
latter should not be expected to submit to a regimen 
which will make it impossible for them to have any hour | 
during the day when they can be free from irritation and 
annoyance. 
Finally, something should be said regarding the move- 
ment to have all pupils in our schools pursue physiology 
and hygiene as a regular subject of study. It has been 
taken for granted that knowledge pertaining to the 
structure and function of the human body will lead a 
child to observe the laws of health. An interesting illus- 
tration of this general belief is found in the fact that in 
most States there are laws requiring that all pupils be 
given instruction regarding infectious diseases and the 
effects of alcohol and narcotics upon the human body; 
and many States are now considering the establishment 
of laws requiring instruction relating to sex hygiene, 
patent medicines, and other matters concerning health. 
Tn all times, the majority of people have believed that 
knowledge will not only give power, but that it will 
influence conduct. At the same time the conviction has 
been deepening among educational people in our country 
that knowing and doing are two different and sometimes 
antagonistic things. One hears it said everywhere now

that a person may acquire learning without gaining 
wisdom. Since the days of John Locke, educational 
reformers have called attention to the failure of much of 
the learning of the schools to influence the behavior 
of the learners. The classic writers all seem to agree upon 
the principle that a child may learn rules pertaining to 
good behavior, but he may habitually act directly con- 
trary to these rules. — 
With a view to securing some first-hand information 
relating to the outcome of the study of physiology in the 
schools upon the health habits of pupils, the writer has 
had a large number of university students write out a 
detailed account of their own experience in regard to the 
matter; and people in various walks of life have contrib- 
uted to the investigation. These persons have all had the 
ordinary instruction in physiology. Most of the students 
could give the names of many of the bones of the body 
and accurately locate them. They could give the names 
of the more important vital organs, locate them, and 
describe their structure and principal functions. They 
could also state a number of rules relating to the character 
and quantity of food required, the methods of preparing 
it for assimilation in the organism, the hygiene of breath- 
ing, exercise, bathing, of abstinence from alcohol and 
tobacco, and the like. 
But the testimonies of these persons regarding the 
influence of this learning upon their health habits were 
negative in the majority of cases. All of the subjects 
stated that they had memorized statements to the effect 
that drinking ice water was harmful to health, but 
two-thirds of them indulged in it without restraint. 
They had memorized rules regarding the thorough mas- 
tication of food, but practically all of them testified that 
they had given no attention to the matter until the recent 
popular agitation about “Fletcherizing” had attracted 
their attention. The men had all learned that tobacco 
442 
 
-P-A-G-E-495
  PROMOTING HEALTH AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 
is injurious to health and efficiency; but the majority 
of them used it in one form or another. These students 
had memorized rules to the effect that health could be 
preserved only when one retired early and rose early, but 
hardly a student had observed this rule. They all declared 
that what they had been put through in physiology had 
exerted little or no influence upon their habits in regard 
to sleep or work. Again, most of the students had learned 
in their books that candy is injurious to the digestive 
organs and the teeth; but not one student in ten refrained 
from eating sweets because of this instruction. The list 
of instances showing how instruction had failed to influ- 
ence conduct might be extended ad libitum. 
Among those who gave testimony in this inquiry were 
a number of students of medicine. Of course, medical 
students have a more extensive knowledge of the structure 
of the human body than have students of arts and letters; 
and one might expect that the former would practice 
rules of hygiene more fully than the latter, or than laymen 
in general. But the medical students said that in no 
respect did they live more hygienically than do people 
who have little or no knowledge of the construction of the 
body. They testified that they, as do most physicians, 
used tobacco freely; that they did not abstain totally 
from alcoholic drinks; that they were not more temperate 
and restrained in their dietetic habits than are other 
people. According to the observation of the writer, no 
more regard is paid to securing-fresh air in a classroom or 
convention hall of physicians than of lawyers or ministers 
or farmers. Medical students are apparently less re- 
strained in regard to the use of tobacco and alcohol than 
are those studying for the ministry or for teaching; but 
it is not the study of physiology which has developed 
hygienic habits among ministers and teachers; it is the 
traditions of their professions.

The First

Teaching 
  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
hygiene in the past failed to take effect in conduct? The 
reason seems clear; the instruction has been too technical, 
too anatomical, too cold, and too remote from the every- 
day life of pupils. Memorizing technical terms about 
bodily structure or rules about general hygiene will not 
influence conduct greatly so far as health matters are 
concerned. Again, the aim of preserving health merely 
as a formal or moral idea does not appeal strongly to the 
typical boy or girl. We have to reckon first with the 
indifference which children manifest toward health. 
Primitive man, whose heir the child of to-day is, had to 
bolt his food and to pay little attention to its quality. 
He probably never thought of having a balanced ration, 
but ate what he could get and had his fill of it. In various 
other ways primitive man was indifferent to conditions 
which if ignored to-day would seriously lessen the individ- 
ual’s vitality or eliminate him altogether. As the arts 
of civilizations have increased, and man has been freed 
from his subjection to nature, he has at the same time 
lost some of his original resistance to discomfort and 
disease. It is this difference between primitive and civil- 
ized life, with the child tending to live on a primitive 
program under conditions of civilization, that makes in- 
struction in hygiene at once imperative and unusually 
difficult. 
As suggested in Chapter XIX, the first thing to 
aim at in instruction in hygiene is to lead the child to 
appreciate that certain health habits will make him 
more efficient than he otherwise could be in attaining 
the ends which he wishes to achieve. If it can be made 
apparent to him in a very concrete, dramatic way that 
preserving his teeth, chewing his food thoroughly, re- 
straining himself in the use of candy, taking his food at 
regular times, breathing through his nostrils, having 
fresh air in his sleeping room, avoiding extreme fatigue, 
bathing at regular intervals, changing his clothing if it 
444 
 
-P-A-G-E-497
PromotTinc HEALTH AND PuysicaAL DEVELOPMENT 
becomes wet—that in these ways he can gain more 
strength, be more alert, have greater endurance, and so 
on, he will be in a frame of mind to profit by his instruc- 
tion. This will be particularly true if the teacher can 
show that the boys and men in the community who 
excel in dynamic activities owe their superiority to their 
hygienic life. 
We are beginning to appreciate further, that it holds 
in physiology and in hygiene as in other studies, that 
instruction in order to be effective must be adapted to 
the particular interests and needs of the individuals for 
whom it is designed. This means that what is taught in 
the eighth grade may not be well suited for the fifth 
grade and wice versa. Knowledge which might prove of 
great practical advantage in the life of the adolescent 
may be wholly without value for a child nine or ten 
years of age. It is a fundamental principle of develop- 
ment that knowledge will take effect in the life of the 
individual only when it is related to his needs and interests. 
Human nature is not so constituted that an immature 
individual can store up knowledge in anticipation of 
some future time of need. Knowledge so acquired will 
either remain dormant or it will be eliminated altogether. 
That knowledge alone will persist which plays some 
role in determining the individual’s welfare in his every- 
day efforts at adaptation to the environment around him. 
The World War revealed a surprising situation in 
respect to the health and physical development of our 
people. Even Federal health authorities were impressed 
by the evidence of the inferior physical condition of 
young men at a time in life when bodily and mental 
vigor should be at the maximum. 
Our people are becoming thoroughly aroused to the 
necessity of providing for better physical development 
of our young people than we have had heretofore. Many 
national, state, and local organizations have been and

Summary

  THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
are being formed for the purpose of investigating the 
health conditions of the young and using effective means 
to improve these conditions. The first step in promoting 
the health and physical development of school children 
is improvement in the hygiene of school buildings. It 
has been shown that a considerable part of the mal- 
development and ill-health of children is due to the fact 
that we compel all our young people to spend several 
hours a day for about forty weeks a year and for at 
least eight years in school buildings that are often not 
hygienic in respect to ventilation, seating, or lighting. 
The hygiene of the school program is being investi- 
gated. Already we are relieving young children of fine, 
highly codrdinated tasks. We are constructing the daily 
program so that pupils will not be kept seated for long 
periods at a time. Opportunities are being provided for 
a variety of games and plays every day. 
The problem of malnourishment is being studied, and 
effective remedies are being applied. The conviction is 
becoming widespread that in towns and cities, our children 
are being injured by overstimulation and many persons 
are working on the problem of securing less stimulating 
environments for children both in the home and in the 
school. We are endeavoring to work out a program 
which will make it possible for pupils to secure periods 
of quiet and relaxation every day. 
In order to promote the physical well-being of our 
children, we are providing medical inspection of schcol 
pupils not only in the cities but also in the rural schools. 
Certain States have enacted laws requiring health inspec- 
tion of pupils in all schools, rural as well as urban. 
Physical education is becoming a regular part of school 
work. In some States, teachers must have training in 
physical education and must conduct this work in their 
schools. Playgrounds are being established in connection 
with public schools. There is a movement now starting

to provide playgrounds and playdays for country 
children, who have been largely overlooked heretofore. 
Our chief problem to-day is to promote the health 
and physical development of urban children, since a 
majority of children now live under urban conditions. 
It is beginning to be appreciated that children in the 
cities have a right to use the streets for play, if there is 
not adequate provision in playgrounds; and cities are 
recognizing this right by setting aside certain streets for 
certain kinds of play, such as coasting. 
The study of physiology and hygiene is to-day being 
required of all pupils in every progressive community. 
This study aims to develop health habits in respect to 
diet, posture, sleep, exercise, the care of the teeth, of 
the skin, etc., etc. It is the aim to have instruction in 
hygiene properly adapted to the age and special needs 
of the children for whom it is designed.

EXTENDING EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES, OPPORTUNITIES, 
AND REQUIREMENTS 
HE maxim of American teachers, boards of 
education, and a large majority of laymen at 
the present time seems to be,—‘*The more educa- 
tion the better for the individual, the community, the 
State, and the nation.”’ As evidence that our people are 
devoted to the increase of educational facilities, oppor- 
tunities, and requirements in every direction, one has 
but to make an inspection trip throughout the country 
and observe what is taking place in the way of providing 
new school buildings and elaborate equipment, and ex- 
tending the school year and the period of compulsory 
education. The most prominent and imposing buildings 
in all sections of the country are those devoted to educa- 
tion. They always make a deep impression upon visitors 
from foreign countries, and many of our own people 
speak in complimentary terms of our magnificent educa- 
tional plants. In the Old World, the buildings that 
attract attention are mainly the cathedrals, mosques, 
parliaments, and military establishments. But in our 
country the school buildings dominate the landscape. 
The different wards in cities vie with one another in 
erecting structures that compel admiration on account of 
their architectural beauty and their massiveness. 
Whether or not our people have consciously accepted 
the principle that the well-being of a people depends 
chiefly upon thoroughgoing education of the young, 
they are at least putting the principle into practice. It 
would not, of course, be quite true to the facts to say 
448
-P-A-G-E-505
  EXTENDING OuR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
that all our people approve the expansion of the educa- 
tional program, involving the expenditure of vast sums 
of money for buildings, equipment, and teachers, and in- 
volving also increasing demands upon the time and 
attention of the young. It should be added, though, 
that those who are hostile to the extension of our educa- 
tional work have not been able thus far to retard educa- 
tional expansion in an important degree. 
Those who are leading in the enlargement of our 
program are proceeding on the principle that as a nation 
develops, its educational opportunities, facilities, and 
requirements must be increased. They hold that when 
the expansion of the educational program is arrested, 
the development of a people will be arrested at the same 
time. They point to certain countries of the Old World 
as an illustration of the apparent law that a nation goes 
forward in its material, intellectual, political, social, and 
moral development just in the measure that its educa- 
tional program is enlarged to provide for the increasing 
complexity of life in the community, State, and nation. 
The progress of a people means increasing knowledge in 
respect to every phase of human life, regarded individu- 
ally or politically. When a people cease to add to knowl- 
edge affecting human welfare, they cease to make ad- 
vance in the arts of civilization, and apparently they 
begin to return in their course. There have not been 
many nations that have remained static for a long period; 
when they have not gone forward, they have gone back- 
ward. One can go around the Mediterranean Sea and 
observe numerous illustrations of this apparent law. 
Nature seems to say to a people: “‘Keep going forward 
or your days will be numbered.” 
As society grows more complex, and knowledge essen- _ 
tial to the maintenance of its stability and the promotion 
of its welfare is increased, it is imperative, of course, that 
the young should be put into possession of this knowledge 
449 As a Nation 
Develops, Its 
Educational 
Program 
Must be 
Increased 
 
-P-A-G-E-506
    THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
so that it will not be necessary for them to begin where 
their ancestors began, and re-discover the arts of living. 
This is why schools are maintained,—so that the young 
may take advantage of the experiences of their forbears 
in solving the problems of individual and social life. 
Primitive people, whose society is extremely simple, do 
not need schools because there is not much knowledge. 
to transmit to the oncoming generations; but a highly 
developed people need highly developed schools in order 
to maintain the position which they have reached in 
their development. If the schools cannot transmit to 
the young the knowledge which their predecessors have 
accumulated, then a people begin to return in their 
course. One can see just this thing happening to-day in 
some of the countries of the Old World. They are not 
as strong, stable, and prosperous as they were several 
centuries ago. Certain of these countries had attained 
to a high degree of culture, but their schools were not 
developed so that they could pass on this culture to 
‘future generations and it is passing out of the life of the 
people. Remains of earlier culture may be seen in the 
churches, art galleries, museums, and other institutions 
but the people have not assimilated the culture, so that 
they are dropping backward instead of going forward in 
civilization. And once a people begin to go downward, 
it seems that nothing can stop them. They lose their 
enthusiasm for knowledge and return inevitably to a 
point where practically their sole interest consists in 
securing indulgence of their appetites. 
The More So the slogan of our people—‘‘The more education 
poucation the better for individual and social well-being”—is un- 
questionably based upon true and profound principles of 
human nature. And how are we putting our slogan into 
effect? First of all, we are increasing the number of 
days each year that the young may and must attend 
school. Probably some readers can remember when 
450 
 
-P-A-G-E-507
  EXTENDING OuR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
children attended the rural school for not more than one 
hundred days, at the most, in any one year; and in some 
States the majority of rural pupils did not attend more 
than seventy-five days in any year until quite recently. 
But at the present time many States require a yearly 
attendance of at least one hundred fifty days, and we 
are apparently moving in the direction of a program 
which will require that every rural school pupil must 
attend school between the ages of six and fourteen for at 
least two hundred days every year. In town and city 
schools in most sections of the country, pupils are now 
required to be in school from one hundred eighty to two 
hundred days each year from the age of six to fourteen. 
Our people are not yet satisfied with the length of 
the school year. Everywhere throughout our country 
voices are being raised in favor of all-year schools. Dur- 
ing the last decade, boards of education in various places 
have taken action looking toward the curtailment of the 
long vacation. Many of the superintendents who have 
recently reported upon the desirability of having school 
the year round have said that the only barrier to con- 
tinuous sessions in their several communities is the finan- 
cial one. If they could obtain the necessary funds to 
meet expenses, they would immediately go onto the all- 
year program. 
Not every one who has expressed himself on the sub- 
ject favors an all-year school. Some say that both 
children and teachers need substantially three months in 
the summer to recuperate from nine months intellectual 
work. Still others maintain that the summer time is not 
suitable for school activities. Most parents who have 
offered their opinions upon this topic have expressed 
themselves in favor of a longer session than we now have, 
because they appreciate that it is a difficult matter to 
keep children happily and wholesomely occupied for 
three months at a stretch; but there are some parents 
451 The Pros 
and Cons 
on an

School
-P-A-G-E-508
THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
who have said that they do not want to keep their 
children in school during the summer because they prefer 
to have them spend the time in travelling or in the study 
of nature out of doors. Farming people—some of them, 
not all of them—think their children ought to help in the 
fields during the summer after they have reached the 
age of ten. Our present plan of part-year schools was 
instituted long ago largely in deference to the wish of 
farming people who needed their children to work in the 
fields several months each year. Only a very small 
fraction of our young people are now required to work in 
the fields or have an opportunity to do so, but in most 
places we still continue to shut up our schools during 
the summer months. 
It has been shown that pupils who are out of school 
for ten or twelve weeks during the summer lose much 
that they have gained during the nine months while 
they are in school, and it takes some time at the opening 
of school in the fall to recover lost ground. Pupils not 
only forget what they learn but they slip back into 
habits which make it difficult for them to apply them- 
selves to intellectual pursuits. This latter consequence 
of the long vacation is probably the most serious of all. 
It is difficult at best in present-day American life to 
develop habits of concentrated application among pupils; 
there is so much that is distracting going on outside of 
the schoolroom and the home that pupils are continually 
lured away from their studies. The motion picture 
theatre, the pool hall, the dance hall, the automobile, 
the playground, the call of the street,—all make a tre- 
mendous appeal to young persons of both sexes. Intel- 
lectual work seems dull and uninteresting in comparison 
with these exciting emotional activities in the world 
outside the school. Even rural school pupils feel the lure 
of the town and the city, because many of them now have 
automobiles so that the motion picture theatre, the dance

hall, and other seductions are practically as near to them 
as if they actually lived in the city. 
The records of juvenile courts show, and the testimony 
of parents reinforce the court records, that young people 
engage in disorderly conduct more frequently during the 
long vacations than at any other season of the year. A 
boy or girl who frequently attends motion pictures, the 
pool rooms, or dance halls,and who does not have regular 
occupation during the day, will be very likely to think up 
mischief. Systematic intellectual application is the best 
antidote to the unwholesome influence of places of amuse- 
ment in contemporary life. In fact, the only safeguard 
of young persons who indulge in the dissipations of these 
times is mental application for a number of hours every 
day for at least five days in the week. When boys and 
girls are left without occupation for two or three months at 
a stretch, the chances are that some of them will commit 
offenses against the customs and conventions and possibly 
against the laws of the communities in which they 
live. 
There is another important reason why our people 
are beginning to think that we should conduct schools on 
an all-year program. The countries in Europe which are 
our rivals in competition for commercial supremacy are 
quickening the pace in their educational work. They 
are considering the establishment of all-year school pro- 
grams, and they are even developing an extensive night- 
school régime. They know that the nations that will 
lead in the future are those that can accomplish the most 
in their schools. The wars hereafter will probably be 
fought more largely in the schoolrooms than on the 
battle fields of the world. We have thus far had an 
advantage over most nations, probably all of them, in 
our educational work, but unless we enlarge our present 
program, we may drop behind in the procession of the 
nations.

Should We We must in the future accomplish more during the 
School Day? school life of our children than we have been able to do 
heretofore, and so we must have them under school 
influences for a larger portion of their time than we have 
had them in the past. There is no escape from this 
requirement if we are to meet the new conditions in the 
world. There is widespread belief that we ought not to 
make the school day longer than it now is in most places; 
but in any community which is provided with play- 
grounds, it might prove of advantage if they could be . © 
placed under the direction of school authorities so that 
pupils could be subjected to school influences during the 
entire day. Also, if our schools could all be provided with 
well equipped manual arts and household arts labora- 
tories, pupils might with advantage to their intellectual 
development and without prejudice to their health or 
recreation, spend an hour or two in manual and household 
activities beyond the regular school day. But we must 
gain more time for school work mainly by utilizing the 
long vacation. In some cities it would be of advantage 
to pupils if they could be in school Saturday forenoon 
instead of being left with nothing to do except to run the 
streets. School buildings are the most sanitary and 
healthful places in many communities, and most children 
are better off in them than they are in their own homes 
or on the streets. This is not true in all communities, but 
it is true in a great many of them. 
A Hygienic It has been urged in the past that pupils would become 
gat abe mentally and nervously fatigued unless they could have 
two days’ vacation each week and three months’ vacation 
in the summer. Modern studies have shown that the 
best way to avoid fatigue from intellectual work is to have 
frequent relaxation periods. From the standpoint of 
conserving energy and avoiding overstrain in school work, 
it would be better to follow an all-year program in which 
there would be five or six one-week vacations scattered

throughout the year, with one-day vacations each week, 
and several relaxation periods during each school day. 
It is a wasteful plan to crowd children until they become 
fatigued and then have a very long break for recuperation. 
When one actually becomes fatigued nervously, it is a 
slow process for him to regain his accustomed vigor, 
whereas if he could have a relaxation period before he 
becomes fatigued, his energies would be more readily 
restored. 
Of course, an all-year session presents difficult prob- 
lems from the teacher’s standpoint, but these problems 
have been solved in normal schools and colleges that have 
practically continuous sessions. A few years ago, all 
higher educational institutions had a three-months’ vaca- 
tion in the summer, and now practically none of them 
follow this program. It can be arranged in the public 
schools, as it is in colleges and normal schools, so that 
teachers can have long vacations when they need them 
for study or rest. This plan is already in operation in 
many places. There are barriers to be surmounted, but 
our people are becoming disposed to work out a program 
to surmount them. 
Many cities are attempting to solve the practical 
problems of an all-year school, and various plans are being 
tried out; they differ in details but agree in the funda- 
mental aim of providing facilities and opportunities for 
school work during the summer months. Some cities have 
established an extra term and have called it a summer 
school. A few have instituted summer work especially 
to help backward children. As an instance of the ten- 
dency of the times in respect to the establishment of an_ 
all-year school, the action of Mason City, Iowa, may be 
mentioned. The year is divided into four quarters of 
twelve weeks each. During the summer months, the 
forenoon session begins at eight o’clock and continues 
until twelve o’clock. It is devoted to regular work with 
455

a liberal amount of supervised play. The afternoon 
session is devoted to supervised play, field sports, and 
folk games. 
Seattle established an all-year school in 1923. The 
attendance the first summer was very large; many more 
pupils attended than were expected. It was planned to 
make the summer work of value especially to those who 
were able to push ahead of their grade, and also those 
who were behind in their work and needed assistance in 
order to be promoted. 
Not only are we striving to work out feasible plans 
for an all-year session of public schools in order to econo- 
mize time in education and save the waste due to a long 
summer vacation; we are also working out programs for 
extending the compulsory school age. It has been 
thought heretofore that pupils ought not to be required 
to remain in school after they had reached their fourteenth 
birthday; but in all the more progressive States in our 
country now, a child is not permitted to detach himself 
completely from school at the age of fourteen. He must 
at least attend a vocational or continuation school for 
part of his time until he is sixteen, and in Wisconsin, for 
instance, until he is eighteen years of age. If after the 
age of fourteen he takes a position in a store, a factory, 
a shop, or a bank, his employer must allow him enough 
time off each week to meet the requirements of the 
compulsory education law. 
In some sections of the country the educational system 
is being reconstructed in certain particulars so as to 
encourage pupils to continue in school full time until 
they are eighteen. Formerly the elementary school com- 
prised eight years and the last year was conducted as 
though it were a finishing year. When the length of the 
elementary school period was settled upon originally, 
it was the belief of those who decided it that only a very 
few children in a community would continue their school- 
456
-P-A-G-E-515
EXTENDING OuR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
ing beyond the eighth grade. So the elementary school 
became an educational unit sharply marked off from the 
secondary school unit. The program of the former was 
worked out on the theory that it must provide all the 
education which at least ninety-five per cent of the chil- 
dren in a community would receive. ‘The secondary 
school program was constituted on the theory that its 
proper function should be to prepare pupils for college; 
the studies and the methods of presenting them univer- 
sally adopted in the secondary schools had reference 
solely to the requirements of entrance upon college 
studies. No attention was paid to the so-called practical 
needs of secondary school pupils. 
But the courses of study in the public high schools 
to-day are administered largely without reference to 
special requirements for entrance upon college work. It is 
true that in every high school in a community of five 
thousand or more inhabitants there is a course of study 
offered which is designed principally as a preparation for 
college, but this course does not absorb a large part of 
the time and energy of teachers and of the resources of 
the high school. The college preparatory course is sub- 
ordinate to other courses in the typical American high 
school to-day; the organization and administration of the 
high school is conducted mainly, though not entirely, 
with a view to meeting the needs of pupils even if they 
do not go any farther in their schooling. The high school 
to-day is really a continuation of the elementary school, 
not a separate unit detached from the first unit and 
administered for an altogether different purpose. 
During the past decade an institution has been devel- 
oping the purpose of which is to facilitate transition from 
the elementary to the high school, and this is the junior 
high school. It is often spoken of as the connecting link, 
and those who originated it and who are responsible 
now for its development have really had in view the

establishment of a school which would bridge the chasm 
between the elementary and the high school so that there 
would be one continuous school from the kindergarten 
to the senior year of the high school. The rapidity with 
which the junior high school is being adopted in small 
as well as in large communities is evidence that we are 
moving onto a program wherein a large proportion of 
pupils will continue in school full time for twelve years. 
It may be predicted that the compulsory full-time period 
will soon be extended to the eighteenth year, or to the 
completion of twelve years of standard educational work, 
even if some pupils must take thirteen or fourteen years 
to complete it. 
A few years ago, the Russell Sage Foundation con- 
ducted an investigation to determine the success which 
the various States were having in enforcing compulsory 
education laws. The investigation revealed the fact that 
the total number of days spent in school by children in 
certain States was only one-half or one-third of the 
number of days spent in school by children in other States. 
It was found that some of theStates were so lax in enforc- 
ing the compulsory education laws that many children 
of school age did not attend school at all after nine or 
ten. Even in such a progressive State as Ohio, it was 
discovered that parents frequently kept their young 
children out of school to work and nobody said anything 
about it. A number of southern States practically ignored 
compulsory education laws, and they were shown up 
when it was revealed during the World War that a sur- 
prisingly large proportion of drafted men could not read 
or write. A small percentage of them were foreign born; 
but most of them were born and bred in the United 
States. The results of these investigations have impressed 
our people with the fact that while we have providedacom- 
plete and exceedingly expensive educational system, some 
of our children have not enjoyed the advantages thereof. 
458 
 
-P-A-G-E-517
EXTENDING OuR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
The State of Ohio has already been referred to; it 
has just enacted a law which will make it possible for 
school officers to keep every child of school age in school 
every day during the school year, provided he is physically 
and mentally capable, and making exceptions only for 
extraordinary circumstances such as a death in a family. 
The problem of regular school attendance in States like 
Ohio is in the way of being solved. Every teacher in 
the State becomes an assistant to attendance officers in 
locating children of school age in her district or ward 
and seeing to it that every such child is in school con- 
tinuously unless he is incapacitated. 
Heretofore the attendance problem has been most 
serious in rural schools. Farmers in some sections of the 
country have thought nothing of keeping children out 
of school who could work any time when there was work 
to be done. During the last two or three years, when 
the attendance problem has been receiving special atten- 
tion at educational meetings, the writer has heard teachers 
in rural schools in almost every State say that when there 
was any work that children could do on the farm, it was 
impossible to keep them in school. This is one reason 
why children reared in the country are at a disadvantage 
as compared with city children in respect to the breadth 
and thoroughness of their education. If the schooling 
of boys and girls reared in the country can be broken 
into whenever there are any chores to be done at home, 
it is certain that they will be handicapped in maturity. 
Educational men as well as laymen everywhere are 
aroused to the seriousness of this problem, and there is a 
determination sweeping over our country to compel coun- 
try children to go to school and to remain in school as 
regularly and for as long a period each year as do the 
children in towns or cities. | 
It must be acknowledged that regular attendance at 
school is not considered to be necessary in sections of the

Parentsfrom Country where there are parents who have come from 
Forei . ; Countries countries where no effort has been made to get pupils 
Often Resist into school and keep them there for eight or ten years. 
sind In some of these countries, the favored classes have 
encouraged parents in the less favored classes to keep 
their children out of school and make them work. 
These parents have brought such notions to our country, 
and they do not now understand why it is necessary that 
their children should go to school, and they are sometimes 
in a rebellious and defiant attitude. The writer knows 
from experience that it is not easy to convince some of 
these parents that they have no right whatsoever to 
handicap a child by keeping him out of school to work. 
A resourceful teacher can frequently win over an obstinate 
parent so that he will willingly keep his children in school 
during at least the compulsory school period; but if he 
cannot be won over, we are coming to believe that he 
must be compelled to keep his children in school. 
The Truancy Of course, there are children who play truant whose 
Problem parents do not keep them out of school to work. There 
is scarcely a district or town or city in our country which 
does not have to deal with the truant problem. Nature 
has endowed some boys and girls with such strong nomadic 
impulses that she seems to say to them: “You must 
keep out in the open. You cannot stand it if you sit in 
school three or four hours a day. It will be better for you 
to run away from school and even from home and hunt 
in the woods, or fish or swim or hide in straw stacks and 
steal your food from farmers, or join a gang and make 
raids on fruit shops, candy stores, and the like.” 
Fortunately, we are reducing truancy in some measure 
by making school life less irksome for boys and girls 
who feel an irresistible longing to be constantly doing 
something adventurous. ‘The writer knows of schools 
which are being conducted so that there is but slight 
temptation for boys or girls to play truant. They are   
460
-P-A-G-E-519
EXTENDING OuR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
given a good deal of manual work and have opportunity 
for games and plays; and they even like their reading, 
number, geography, and history lessons because they are 
made concrete and interesting. It is not impossible that 
the time may come when we shall be able to teach children 
so that even the most restless of them will about as soon 
be in the school as to be climbing trees, throwing stones, 
roaming about the country, or forming gangs and fighting 
other gangs. 
But the schools in most places are not yet able to 
prevent truancy, and so there must be officers who will 
keep track of truants and see that they conform to the 
law and remain in school full time every day when it is 
in session until they are at least fourteen years of age. 
These truant or probation officers have a very important 
and at the same time a very delicate task to perform. 
Rough, unsympathetic men can do and have done great 
harm both to the children who are truants and even to 
their parents, who are sometimes in sympathy with them. 
As suggested above, there are families in many communi- 
ties, usually fresh from the Old World, in which there is a 
lack of appreciation of the need of keeping children in 
school until they are fourteen years of age or older. 
Most—fortunately not all—foreigners think their children 
should begin to work so as to increase the income of the 
family when they reach the age of nine or ten. Truant or 
probation officers have a difficult task to make such 
persons understand the American ideal in educating all 
children, whether or not the parents wish to have them 
educated. 
We are coming to accept the view that truant officers 
should be connected with the office of the county or city 
superintendent of schools in every community and not 
with the courts. They certainly should not be agents 
of the courts. A truant should not be regarded as a 
criminal and he should not be dealt with by any one who

actsfor the courts. Parents who do not keep their children 
in school should not in the first instance be regarded as 
criminals and should not be dealt with by court officers. 
Heretofore, truant and probation officers have as a 
rule had no training whatsoever for their special work. 
They have often been selected because of their rough-shod 
ways with people. This has been due to the fact that a 
truant has been regarded as a criminal who needed chas- 
tisement. An officer who regards truants from this 
standpoint is likely to do them more harm than good. 
It is being emphasized by educational people to-day 
that a truant officer should have made special preparation 
for his work. He should be a student of child nature and 
of the sociological conditions which lead to truancy. He 
should know how to handle people diplomatically, and 
he should have sympathy with young persons who cannot 
restrain their impulses so that they can submit to the 
restrictions of the school. From one standpoint, it is 
not to the discredit of a boy that he feels a longing to be 
out in the open, living an adventurous life; and he should 
not be treated as though he were guilty of some heinous 
crime when he runs away from school. The task of the 
truant officer is to make the school seem attractive to 
the truant rather than to drive him into the school 
with the rod. 
It may appear to some readers that while we are ex- 
tending educational facilities, opportunities, and require- 
ments for children in towns and cities we are not following 
the same program for children in rural sections. It must 
be acknowledged that in our educational progress the 
rural school has, speaking generally, lagged behind urban 
schools. But our people are aware of this fact and a con- 
siderable part of educational investigation to-day has 
reference to the devising of ways and means of improving 
rural education. The isolated, one-room school, which 
is still the dominant type of school found in rural sections 
462
-P-A-G-E-521
EXTENDING OuR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
throughout the country, is out of date in American life, 
and children living in the country who must attend such 
a school are seriously handicapped when compared with 
children who live in towns and cities. It is still regarded 
in some States as a matter of course that a child in a 
district or village school cannot have the educational 
advantages enjoyed by any child who can attend a town 
or city graded school. But the times are changing rapidly 
in respect to this matter. One may hear it said freely 
to-day in all sections of our country that a child reared 
in the country should receive as good schooling in every 
way as if he were reared in the city. This means that 
the one-room, isolated country school must be greatly 
improved, or it must be abandoned and in its place must 
be provided a community school as well equipped with 
capable teachers and with apparatus as are city graded 
schools. 
The writer recently, spent some time in Colorado 
observing developments there in rural education. It is 
impressive and encouraging to observe the progress made 
in various sections of that State in developing consolidated 
community schools offering all the advantages of well- 
organized and well-conducted city graded schools. These 
schools are found scattered throughout the mountains, 
the valleys, and the plains of the State. The physical 
barriers to consolidation of schools in all parts of Colorado 
are as great as they are in most other States. The popula- 
tion is sparser than it is in many sections of our country. 
The weather in winter is more rigorous and the snow is 
deeper in the mountains and valleys than is the case in 
most other places. And yet, consolidation is going forward 
with rapidity and enthusiasm in every part of Colorado. 
Some of the consolidated school buildings are as attractive 
and as healthful, well-lighted, and well-equipped, as are 
the school buildings in the cities of any State. In a number 
of the counties, attractive homes adjoining the community

school buildings have been provided for the teachers. 
The pupils are brought to the schools and returned to 
their homes in auto busses that are warmed in winter, 
so that the trip to and from school is comfortable. These 
busses are operated by the teachers, at least in a number 
of the consolidated districts, who apparently enjoy this 
phase of their work as fully as they do their teaching. 
There is slight chance that rural education can be 
greatly improved unless rural people will coéperate so 
that they can secure educational advantages equivalent 
to those of the city, in some such way as they are doing 
in the rural districts of Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, and 
other States. And a farmer who has the welfare of his 
children at heart will think better of a first-rate school 
located five miles away than of a tenth-rate school located 
at the turn of the road. Any good school that his children 
attend every day will be close enough in space and in 
spirit so that he will feel a personal interest in it. And 
when he sees what superior intellectual, social, and 
hygienic advantages he and his children gain from a well- 
equipped, well-conducted graded school, as compared 
with a poorly-equipped, ungraded, isolated school, he 
will not fail to give it his support. Such a school will 
be of direct service to him in his business as a farmer, 
whereas the one-room school can hardly ever be of any 
material assistance to him. 
And we come now to a vital question: How can this 
great program of extension of educational facilities, oppor- 
tunities, and requirements be supported by communities 
that are not well situated financially? The program which 
is being worked out in the more progressive and prosperous 
States is a very expensive one, and it would manifestly 
overtax the resources of less financially fortunate com- 
munities. A recent publication of the Bureau of Economic 
Research gives an estimate of the income of the people 
of a number of States. From this report we find that the 
464
-P-A-G-E-523
  
EXTENDING OuR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM 
per capita incomes in the States showing the lowest 
income are as follows: Alabama, $345; Mississippi, $352; 
Tennessee, $365; Arkansas, $379; North Carolina, $383; 
Kentucky, $392. Contrasted with these figures are those 
for the States in which the people enjoy a large income. 
These States show the following incomes per capita: 
Massachusetts, $788; Ohio, $789; Delaware, $792: New 
York, $874; California, $820; Nevada, $850. 
Is there any way out of the difficulty of providing for 
an expanding educational program in communities and 
States that are not as well situated financially as are other 
communities and States? Our people are beginning to 
take the view that equal educational facilities and oppor- 
‘tunities should be available for all our children, no 
matter where they may be born or reared. Because a 
child happens to be born and to be reared in an impover- 
ished State or in a rural section of a wealthy State, is no 
reason, we are coming to see, why he should be handi- 
capped in respect to his education at maturity as compared 
with a child born and reared in a prosperous State. A 
child brought up on a farm may not remain on the 
farm when he becomes mature. American life is so 
mobile that the country child is as likely to spend his 
mature years in a city as in the country; it should not be 
assumed that because he is born in a certain place he will 
remain there throughout his life. We are coming to see 
the educational bearings of the fact that society is so 
fluid in America that probably the majority of persons 
do not live out their lives in the place or under the social 
or economic conditions of their birth. 
We are committed in America to the principle that 
education is essential to the welfare of every person, 
_ whether regarded as an individual or as a member of 
society. It has already been said that we are establishing 
rigid compulsory laws based upon this principle. We are 
constantly saying that a child who is trained by a capable

Summary THE CHILDRENS FOUNDATION 
teacher and in a well-equipped and hygienic school build- 
ing will have an advantage over one taught by an inferior 
teacher and in a poorly ventilated, poorly lighted, and 
poorly equipped school. There is only one conclusion 
to be drawn from these elementary principles,—we must 
earnestly strive to equalize educational opportunities for 
all our children, whether they live in a wealthy or in an 
impoverished section, or in the country or in the village 
or in the city. In order to accomplish this, the more 
fortunate sections of a State in respect to financial 
resources must assist the less fortunate sections. The 
cities must help the rural districts to provide educa- 
tional facilities equal to those enjoyed by city children. 
The educational work of a State must be paid for mainly 
or wholly from state funds, since education is properly 
a state or national and not a local function. The nation 
must equalize opportunities as between the wealthier 
and the poorer States, so that children born and reared 
in impoverished localities will be helped by contributions 
from more prosperous sections. A child born and edu- 
cited in Vermont or New Hampshire is about as likely 
to become a resident of California, or Wisconsin, or 
Massachusetts when he is mature as he is to live out his 
life in Vermont or New Hampshire. When we really 
appreciate this fact we will see the necessity, looking at 
the matter from the standpoint of national well-being, 
of providing as good educational opportunities for the 
children in Vermont or New Hampshire as for the children 
in California, Wisconsin, or Massachusetts. Doubtless 
this will seem idealistic to some readers; but let all 
doubters take note of the fact that we have already 
entered upon this equalizing program, and it is being 
carried forward successfully in some parts of the count 
The maxim of all our people seems to be: ‘ 
education the better for the individual, the fommunity, 
the State, and the nation.” Anyone will be impressed

with the réle which the school is playing in American 
life if he will take a trip through the country and observe 
our school buildings and facilities for carrying on school 
work; and we are constantly increasing our facilities and 
extending our opportunities and requirements. 
We are appreciating that as a nation develops its 
educational program must be constantly enlarged. Na- 
tions that remain stationary educationally for a long 
period tend to go backward and ultimately to disappear 
altogether. 
We are becoming convinced that we must require our 
pupils to spend more time each year in school than has 
been the practice heretofore; so we have gradually ex- 
tended the school year until now plans are being formed 
in some places for the establishment of an all-year school. 
Already a few cities have adopted this program. The 
arguments in favor of an all-year school apparently out- 
weigh the arguments against it. 
There is a race among the nations for supremacy 
in respect to matters that depend upon education. Our 
people are awakening to this fact, and many of them 
already appreciate that we cannot hold our own unless 
our young people have more schooling than they have 
had in the past. 
There is a tendency to enforce compulsory laws more 
rigorously than has been done in the past. Some States 
have recently enacted laws which will make it practically 
impossible for any boy or girl of school age to be absent 
from school except for sickness. Our people are becoming 
convinced that an uneducated individual is a menace to 
the community. The World War showed that a con- 
siderable proportion of our young men were illiterate. 
This revelation has strengthened our people in their 
conviction that no child in America should be permitted 
to escape at least an elementary school education. 
The compulsory school age is being extended quite

boy or girl must be in school for full time until fourteen 
years of age, and part time from fourteen to sixteen, 
seventeen, or even eighteen years of age. 
Constant pressure is being put upon pupils to continue 
in school for full time after completing the elementary 
school curriculum. With a view to facilitating the transi- 
tion from the elementary to the high school, the junior 
high school is being widely established. This is designed 
to bridge the gap between the elementary and the high 
school. 
Our people are confronting a difficult problem in 
extending the compulsory school period or even enforcing 
attendance of all pupils for the length of the present 
compulsory period. Parents from foreign countries some- 
times resist enforcement of compulsory laws; but there is 
an increasing determination on the part of our people to 
compel all parents to keep their children in school during 
the compulsory school age. Truant or probation officers 
are being appointed each year for the purpose of enforcing 
the compulsory laws. 
The one-room rural school constitutes the most serious 
problem in present-day American education. The solu- 
tion of the problem seems to be in the direction of con- 
solidating one or two-room rural schools into graded 
community schools, properly equipped to do as efficient 
work as is done in the typical graded city school. The 
establishment of such consolidated schools has the effect 
universally to promote better attendance among rural 
school pupils.

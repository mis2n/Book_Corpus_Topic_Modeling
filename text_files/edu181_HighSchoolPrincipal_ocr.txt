  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tue high schools have not been as well studied 
by the profession as the lower schools. Satis- 
faction with tradition has endured longer in se- 
condary schools, which is merely to say that crit- 
ical self-consciousness made a delayed entrance 
into secondary education. This implies no in- 
feriority on the part of high-school teachers; it 
indicates a lack of external pressure in the forms 
of public criticism and student discontent. 
When these signs of maladjustment became suf- 
ficiently large and dramatic, those in charge of 
high schools began to think, investigate, and 
experiment. For some considerable time they 
have been in this period of alert questioning, and 
their skepticism now becomes orderly and scien- 
tific, carrying with it a most sensitive reverence 
for facts. 
All sorts of valuable studies have been made 
of the specific subjects taught in high schools, and 
the organization of its instruction and life has 
also had due attention. Little has been done, 
however, to study the organizers — the high-

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
school principals themselves, who have the great- 
est influence in determining what high schools 
are to be. We know a great deal about the pro- 
fessional history, training, and effectiveness of 
the ordinary high-school teacher, but it is quite 
amazing to discover how little we know about 
the high-school executive. 
This gap in our knowledge is now filled. The 
careful researches of Professor Koos have told us 
what in fact the high-school principal is in all his 
general tendencies and variations. He has sum- 
marized and simplified the major conclusions of 
his investigations in the small volume which is 
here presented. Not the least valuable contri- 
bution is that comment on existing facts which 
runs through the book, telling us the worth of 
existing practice and present tendency and di- 
recting us toward desirable modifications. 
The work has the form of an inductive study, 
in considerable degree statistical, but the spirit 
of the whole presentation is analytical and con- 
structive. While it gives us a very clear picture 
of the high-school principal as he is — a basic 
necessity in clear thinking about any functionary, 
particularly one who has been obscure — its 
service extends far beyond accurate description. 
We now know the high-school principal’s

duties — large and small— and their relative 
claims on his time and energy. The specifi- 
cations for his training are here made available 
for colleges, universities, teachers’ colleges, and 
certification boards. Henceforth superintend- 
ents and school trustees can be more intelligent 
in measuring the worth of applicants by definite 
quality standards which have a real basis in prac- 
tical need.

PREFACE 
Prottric as is the field of educational literature, 
that bearing on the high-school principalship is, 
strangely and unfortunately, lacking. Scattered 
materials there are, like Professor Davis’s report 
of an investigation into the activities of high- 
school principals, conducted for the Commission 
on Secondary Schools of the North Central Asso- 
ciation, and occasional articles by others appear- 
ing in a variety of educational periodicals. But 
nowhere is to be found anything approaching a 
comprehensive study of this increasingly impor- 
tant position in American education. Although 
this study lays no claim to all-inclusiveness, it 
does present a description of the high-school 
principalship along a number of lines for the 
most part untouched in materials available in 
print up to the time of writing. It should prove 
useful in several ways. It should assist the prin- 
cipal in service, now rapidly developing a profes- 
sional consciousness, to compare himself in a 
number of significant respects with others in sim- 
ilar positions. It should afford the superintend- 
vii 
   
-P-A-G-E-8
  PREFACE 
ent and the school board a broader basis of fact to 
be kept in mind in selecting principals or in del- 
egating responsibilities tothem. It should assist 
State authorities in coming to decisions on stand- 
ards appropriate for admission to the profession, 
and provide higher institutions with suggestions 
toward planning curricula in preparation for it. 
It should be useful also in courses for principals- 
in-training, and likewise as material for the 
guidance of those who may be considering the 
principalship as their life-work. 
Acknowledgment is made of the generous co- 
operation of the small army of high-school prin- 
cipals who supplied the information essential to 
such a study, and of the competent services in the 
work of tabulation rendered by Mr. Fred von 
Borgersrode, ‘Assistant Director of the Bureau of 
Research of the College of Education of the Uni- 
versity of Minnesota, and by Miss Agnes M. 
Thorson.

THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
I 
A STUDY OF THE HIGH-SCHOOL 
PRINCIPALSHIP 
THE NATURE OF THE STUDY 
Tue chief purpose of this little volume, as of the 
investigation which underlies it, is to inquire into 
the extent to which the high-school principalship 
has been professionalized, as well as to assist in 
marking out the lines of its further professionali- 
zation. Heads of schools — and of secondary 
schools — we have had for centuries, but, owing 
to the relative recency of the origin and rapid 
development of our American public high school, 
the occupation of its principalship is also rela- 
tively new. The unparalleled rate of growth of 
this new school during the last few decades, and 
the far-reaching modifications it is undergoing 
internally, naturally give rise to the question of 
whether the principalship is matching strides 
with the institution. 
The broad lines along which the inquiries of the 
study bear are the training, experience, and re- 
I
-P-A-G-E-16

sponsibilities of incumbents of this new position. 
Among specific questions to which the materials 
of the following chapters afford answer are the 
following: What is the typical distribution by sex 
of principals in small and large high schools? 
What are typical salaries for the work, and is 
salary advancement characteristic of promotion 
from smaller to larger schools? What are the 
facts concerning the training of present incum- 
bents — for example, as to its extent, degrees 
held, attendance in summer sessions, subjects 
emphasized, etc.? What aspects of their training 
are regarded as of greatest value by principals? 
What were their occupational plans as under- 
graduates? What have been their types of ex- 
perience in educational work? Do they consti- 
tute a stable professional group, or do a majority 
plan to forsake the field at the first opportunity? 
What is the allowance of time for administrative 
and supervisory activities? Are principals gen- 
erally given initiative in critical matters, or only 
in minor and clerical phases of the work? 
The sources of information were responses to 
an extended blank of inquiry by more than four 
hundred principals. Only high schools with sep- 
arate officers in charge were included in the study. 
The position which combines in one person the 
2

offices of superintendent and principal in charge 
of a small system of schools extending through 
both elementary and secondary grades, although 
an important one involving perplexing problems, 
is not considered. 
THE SIZE OF THE COMMUNITIES REPRESENTED 
The aim of such selection of high schools as was 
made for this study was to secure a representa- 
tion of communities ranging from those having 
high schools with enrollments of relatively small 
size to well up toward twenty-five hundred or 
three thousand students, as well as of all sections 
of the country. With this in view, the principals 
appealed to for information concerning them- 
selves and their responsibilities were in com- 
munities grouped as follows: 
  NUMBER OF Group Porutation RANGE Comnonrries 
1,000 to 2,500 104

ae +10,000 to 25,000 150 
Ween ee 25,000 to 100,000 66 
The number of high schools in communities of 
each population group has also been indicated 
and is seen to be sufficiently large to warrant 
comparisons,

THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION 
The extent to which all sections of the country 
are represented is shown in the fact that, with the 
States divided as New England, Middle Atlantic, 
Southern, Central, and Western, no single divi- 
sion includes less than fifty-eight nor more than 
one hundred and forty-seven high schools. 
Moreover, each of the four population groups is 
well represented in each section.

HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPALSHIP 
THE SIZE OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS 
The high schools range widely in enrollment, 
not only as to all the four hundred and twenty- 
one represented, but also within each group.

  The difference in this respect between the small- 
est and the largest is not far from three thousand 
students. The range is much narrower, of course, 
for each of the four groups into which the whole 
number of high schools has been divided. The 
ranges in enrollment of the middle fifty per cent 
gives a much better impression of the typical 
sizes of the high schools in each group. These 
are, respectively, 111-224, 184-372, 431-793, and 
5
-P-A-G-E-20
    THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
825-1463, and indicate less of overlapping upon 
each other of the four groups than do the full 
ranges from the smallest to the largest. These 
ranges of the middle half make contact only for 
Groups I and II. The median enrollments, 
which are, respectively 161, 279, 579, and 1158, 
show differences of approximately a hundred be- 
tween Groups I and II, three hundred between 
Groups II and ITI, and six hundred between 
Groups III and IV. 
It will be well to keep these facts concerning 
the enrollment of high schools in mind in can- 
vassing the materials of subsequent chapters — 
not only those concerning the distinctiveness of 
size, but also the extent of overlapping.

SEX DISTRIBUTION AND SALARIES OF 
PRINCIPALS 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRINCIPALS BY SEX 
Tue division of these more than four hundred 
principals by sex shows the usual predominance 
of men. Of the whole number, slightly less than 
ten per cent are women. Moreover, the propor- 
tion of women declines rapidly as the size of com- 
munities and enrollment of high schools increase. 
Among the principals in the high schools of 
Group I 23.1 per cent, or almost a fourth, are 
women. This proportion drops to slightly more 
than an eighth for Group II, and to only 2.7 per 
cent in Group III. The principals in the largest 
high schools are exclusively men. 
It is therefore to be concluded that, although 
women are sometimes given positions as heads of 
high schools in the smaller communities, the 
present situation affords little or nothing of en- 
couragement for ambitious members of the sex to 
rise to the positions of larger responsibility in 
this field. This is especially notable in view of 
9
-P-A-G-E-24
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
the great predominance of women on the high- 
school teaching staffs from which most of our 
principals are recruited. These facts are, how- 
ever, descriptive of the status quo in a single 
school year, and cannot show a tendency to 
change in the proportions of women principals, if 
such there has been, in recent years.

cipals there is a median difference of $1120 in 
annual stipend in favor of the male principal, 
equivalent to exactly forty per cent of the latter’s 
median salary. The median differences in each

mately a fourth to a half of the woman principals’

two thirds. For women the increase is not so 
gratifying, being little more than a third from the 
first group to the third. 
Both the advances in salary for men from 
group to group and the range from the median to 
the highest salaries paid give encouragement to 
the hope of developing a real profession of the 
high-school principalship. Those in touch with 
the salary situation can, of course, cite instances 
of annual salaries much larger than the highest 
found in the schools here represented. While not 
yet typically adequate, especially in view of the 
long periods of training and apprenticeship in- 
volved, the salary situation here set forth points 
to the attainment of a livelihood sufficiently com- 
fortable to induce men to enter upon the work as 
a permanent vocation, and to secure the special 
professional equipment essential to success in it.

THE PRINCIPAL’S TRAINING — I. ATTENDANCE

ATTENDANCE IN HIGHER INSTITUTIONS 
Tse form in which data were supplied by the 
high-school principals made it possible to com- 
pute the number of years each had been in at- 
tendance upon higher institutions subsequent 
to graduation from high school. Attendance 
upon summer sessions was added to attendance 
during regular sessions after having been reduced 
to a comparable basis by dividing the number 
of weeks of such attendance by the number of 
weeks in the usual school year. 
Except for the principals of Group I, small 
proportions have had less than four years of 
training in higher institutions, the typical amount 
required for the attainment of the first, or bac- 
calaureate, degree. Other than this finding, the 
most remarkable in this study of the periods of 
attendance is the declining proportion of prin- 
cipals, as one advances from the smallest to the 
‘largest groups, who have discontinued their

years for the four groups are, respectively, 46.2, 
69.4, 78.7, and 82.2. That is, the proportion in- 
creases from less than a half to more than four 
fifths. The proportions with five or more years 
likewise increase steadily — from less than a 
seventh in Group I to almost a half in Group IV.

it is to be expected that the proportion holding 
higher degrees increases from the group of small- 
est to the group of largest communities. The ad- 
vance from group to group is, in fact, interest- 
ingly regular, since the percentage of those hold- 
ing masters’ as their highest degrees increased by 
between seven and eight per cent for each suc- 
ceeding group after the first. Although these in- 
clude only slightly more than an eighth in the 
smallest cities, they include more than a third in 
cities with populations of twenty-five thousand 
to one hundred thousand. The proportion of 
principals with doctors’ degrees, while not neg-

  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
It is perhaps hardly necessary to report that 
the first advanced degree here concerned is usu- 
ally the master of arts, and the doctors’ is for the 
most part the doctorate of philosophy. Only in- 
frequently are the advanced degrees other than 
these. : 
The outstanding conclusion from the data so 
far summarized in the chapter is that, the larger 
the community and the high school, the more 
urgent are advanced training and advanced de- 
grees in the credentials of candidates for the 
principalship. 
THE RECENCY OF SUMMER ATTENDANCE 
One of the most interesting facts appearing ina 
study of the training of high-school principals is 
the frequency and recency of their attendance 
upon summer sessions of higher institutions to 
add to their professional equipment. Almost a 
third of the entire number of administrative offi- 
cers considered were in attendance during either 
the summers of 1920 or 1921 — that is, the last 
two summers previous to the date of supplying 
the information — while almost a half were in 
attendance during some summer since 1915. 
Except for Group IV the proportions enlarge 
with the increase in the size of community. This

ATTENDANCE AND DEGREES 
increase leads to the conclusion of a feeling of 
greater need for recent training as responsibilities 
increase. It is difficult to explain the percentages 
for Group IV, which are smaller than even for 
Group I, unless it is because they have had a 
longer period of years than other groups within 
which to supplement by summer attendance the 
training received during undergraduate resi- 
dence, or because, being near the top of their

THE PRINCIPAL’S TRAINING — II. HIS WORK 
IN EDUCATION 
THE NUMBER OF COURSES IN EDUCATION 
TuE courses in the field of education taken by 
high-school principals will be considered in three 
ways: first, the number taken; second, the fre- 
quency with which particular courses have been 
taken; and, third, the location of those which the 
principals report as being of most use to them in 
their work as heads of high schools. 
The numbers of courses taken range widely 
among the whole group of principals — from 
none to twenty-five. More than five per cent 
have never made contact with courses in educa- 
tion in class, while a fraction more than twenty- 
five per cent have had only one, two, or three 
courses. This is almost a third of all principals 
who have taken three courses or less in these 
lines. The median principal has made contact 
with the field through nine courses representing 
a total of perhaps twenty-four or twenty-five 
semester hours of credit. 
29
-P-A-G-E-44
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL’ 
For all but a single section of the country the 
medians are only one course more or less than 
this number. The notable exception is New 
England, where the median is four courses, where 
almost three fourths have had less than the 
median number for all sections, and where al- 
most exactly half have taken three courses or less. 
THE SPECIFIC COURSES TAKEN 
The particular courses reported to have been 
taken range widely in content. Computation of 
the percentages of all principals reporting shows 
seventeen different courses taken by a fourth or 
more, but of these only four were found to be con- 
stituents of the training of approximately two 
thirds or more. These are history of education, 
principles of education, principles of secondary 
education, and high-school administration. 
Of the six courses reported by a half or more of 
the principals, namely, history of education, prin- 
ciples of education, principles of secondary educa- 
tion, high-school administration, technique (or 
general methods), and educational psychology, 
all but one (high-school administration) are those 
commonly prescribed for high-school teachers-in- 
training. Another course not commonly pre- 
scribed for candidates for high-school teaching,

  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
high-school curriculum, was taken by almost a 
half of these principals. While the training of 
principals in education, when this is measured by 
the number of courses taken, goes considerably 
beyond that of the teacher, there is only partial 
approach to unanimity of agreement, as evi- 
denced by specific courses taken, as to what 
should make up the additional content. At the 
same time, the frequency with which these two 
courses in high-school administration and high- 
school curriculum have been taken, not to men- 
tion others like supervision, psychology of high- 
school subjects, educational measurements, etc., 
shows evidence of some trend toward desirable 
practices. 
THE COURSES OF MOST USE 
Admittedly, data concerning the frequency 
with which particular courses in education have 
been taken cannot go far in determining which 
are of greatest value. Although no attempt has 
been made in this study to supply.a final and 
conclusive answer to the question, some ap- 
proaches assist materially in this direction. One 
of these was to secure the opinions of the prin- 
cipals as to the courses taken which seemed to be 
of most use to them as principals. The courses

Of these thirteen lines, four only, namely, prin- 
ciples of secondary education, educational psy- 
chology, philosophy of education, and technique, 
have been or are frequent constituents in the pro- 
fessional training of high-school teachers. The 
remaining courses, nine in number, may be re- 
garded as content over and above that typically 
emphasized for high-school teachers-in-training. 
Computation indicates that an average of thirty- 
five per cent only of all the principals have had 
courses along these nine lines. The proportion is 
only slightly increased if the computation in-

cludes only the first five of these courses which 
are not typically found among those prescribed 
for teachers-in-training. 
Although this method of evaluation is not ade- 
quate for determining what should constitute the 
training in education of high-school principals, 
the evidence leads to the conclusion that they 
have been insufficiently trained on the profes- 
sional side.

THE PRINCIPAL’S TRAINING — III. HIS 
ACADEMIC AND OTHER PREPARATION 
SUBJECTS STUDIED IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE 
In the chapter immediately preceding, attention 
was given only to the training in education of 
high-school principals. It is pertinent also to 
consider their preparation along other lines. To 
this end all principals codperating were asked to 
indicate which of a long list of subjects, mostly 
academic, they had studied in high school or in 
college. In order to canvass this aspect of pre- 
paration of those administering high schools, 
computations were made of the percentages of 
those who had pursued the subjects (a) in college 
or (b) either in high school or college or both. 
A spread of training to a variety of lines is 
clearly desirable for liberalizing purposes for all 
educational workers. It is also essential that, in 
so far as the principal must serve in the dual 
capacity of teacher and head of the school, he be 
adequately equipped in the subjects in which he 
gives instruction. But there are two additional 
37 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
needs of the high-school principal for training 
outside the special field of education. The first 
of these concerns (1) his responsibilities as a 
supervisor of instruction. It should be apparent 
without argument that ignorance on the part of a 
supervisor of content in a given field must oper- 
ate as a chief hindrance to effective supervision. 
It is therefore essential that during his period of 
training the principal make contact with as large 
a proportion as possible of the main fields of in- 
struction represented in the high-school program 
of studies. The second need is that for (2) the 
contribution of certain subjects to his work as a 
high-school administrator. Each of these needs 
will now be given at least partial consideration. 
The subject representation in the work taken 
in high school and college by high-school prin- 
cipals shows a commendable spread over most of 
the whole academic range. The percentages of 
principals who have made contact with each 
main field in college is for the most part reassur- 
ingly large. Almost all have had college work in 
English, mathematics, some foreign language, 
and history and the other social studies, while 
very large proportions have had work in most 
other lines like the sciences.

THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
even if it is not followed up in college, must make 
some contribution to a principal’s supervisory 
equipment, the percentages who have carried 
work in the several fields either in high school or 
college are also significant in this connection. 
Without exception, these percentages are larger 
than are those for work pursued in college only. 
In some instances, as for Latin and certain of the 
sciences, the former are strikingly enlarged. As 
a whole, including consideration of work taken by 
the principal during his secondary school course 
increases our degree of assurance on the score of 
his equipment for supervisory responsibilities. 
In one respect, however, his contacts are pa- 
thetically inadequate, even when both high 
school and college training are considered, and 
this is in such special non-academic lines as agri- 
culture, shop work and related fields, music, the 
graphic arts, commercial lines, and physical 
training. 
SUBJECTS OTHER THAN EDUCATION OF MOST USE 
In order to ascertain the trend of principals’ 
opinions as to which of the subjects other than 
education are of most use to them as administra- 
tive heads of high schools they were asked to 
indicate which of the long list of subjects that

had best served them in this way (and “not 
as teachers”). Although the balloting extended 
over more than a score of the total list of sub- 
jects the principals had taken, for only ten did 
the proportion of all ballots cast exceed two 
per cent. The subject coming in for most fre- 
quent designation is English, with 22.9 per cent. 
This is followed by psychology — not educa- 
tional psychology, which was here excluded from 
consideration — with 16.8 per cent of all ballots. 
Then come public speaking and sociology, each 
with 11.2 per cent; succeeded by philosophy (6.1), 
political science (6.1), history (5.8), economics 
(4.9), mathematics (4.0), and chemistry (2.1). 
The large proportions favoring English and 
public speaking lead to the conclusion that train- 
ing on the expressional side is regarded by the 
principal as valuable professional equipment. 
The generous extent of acknowledgment of pro- 
fessional value in the social subjects — history, 
sociology, political science, and economics — is 
probably largely attributable to their contribu- 
tion to his comprehension of the function of the 
school in modern society, while he may look upon 
philosophy as serving a somewhat similar pur- 
pose. Psychology may be highly valued both on 
account of the explanation, indirect or otherwise,

-P-A-G-E-58
    
THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
it provides of learning processes and of an under- 
standing of human nature necessary in the prin- 
cipal’s work. It is somewhat more difficult to 
account for the percentages ascribing values of 
the sort under consideration to chemistry and 
mathematics, unless supervisory responsibilities, 
that is, improving instruction in these subjects, 
come into play where these are considered. If 
this is true, it is to be assumed that some of the 
recognition given English and the social subjects 
is assignable to the same causes, but it is difficult 
then to understand why other subjects than those 
so far mentioned should not have come in for 
more favorable consideration. 
It is perhaps within the truth to say that, of 
the academic subjects, the principal regards as of 
highest professional value those which have in- 
creased his effectiveness in public presentation, 
which have enlarged his conception of the func- 
tion of the school in modern society, and which 
have contributed to his understanding of learning 
processes and of human nature.

THE PRINCIPAL’S TRAINING — IV. HIS SHIFT 
OF EMPHASIS AFTER UNDERGRADUATE 
YEARS 
THE PRINCIPAL’S UNDERGRADUATE 
OCCUPATIONAL PLANS 
Have principals planned as early as during 
undergraduate years to enter upon the special 
work in which they are now engaged? Or was 
the decision to engage in their present line of 
work an afterthought, rather than something 
toward which they directed the selection of their 
college courses? As the answer to some such 
question as this has. significant bearing on the 
kind and extent of training that can be mapped 
out and prescribed for those who will become 
heads of high schools, the principals codperating 
in this study were directed to indicate their occu- 
pational plans as undergraduates. 
Their responses show that somewhat more 
than half — 52.1 per cent, to be exact — had 
planned to enter educational work of one sort or 
another. Of these more than four fifths (43.5 per 
cent of the whole) had selected “teaching” or 
“high-school teaching” as the occupational de-

stination. Only twenty-eight, or 6.2 per cent, of all 
principals had planned to engage in educational 
administration, and only eight of these were looking 
forward to the high-school principalship! Anaddi- 
tional small proportion reported having selected 
educational work without having in mind any 
special line.

  AFTER UNDERGRADUATE YEARS 
As was to have been expected, the plans of a 
large proportion, almost thirty per cent, lay out- 
side the field of education, in such professions as 
law, medicine, engineering, etc. Lastly, a con- 
siderable proportion did not comply with the re- 
quest, which may be understood to signify that 
some at least who became principals were with- 
out occupational plans of any sort during under- 
graduate years. 
The major fact of significance here is that the 
high-school principalship is an occupation upon the 
work of which entrance is made without its having 
been planned for during the period of undergraduate 
training and with nothing in the way of special 
training, other than that necessary for teaching, hav- 
ing been taken to prepare for its responsibilities. 
THE SHIFT OF EMPHASIS IN SUBSEQUENT TRAINING 
That principals do not regard their undergrad- 
uate work adequate preparation for their present 
activities may in part be judged from the large 
proportions with graduate training and advanced 
degrees as already reported in Chapter III. An- 
other line of inquiry with findings pertinent in 
this connection concerns their majors and minors 
of specialization during undergraduate and grad- 
uate years. 
49  
-P-A-G-E-64
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
Since few of the principals as undergraduates 
contemplated engaging in the work of school ad- 
ministration, only a small proportion (7.6 per 
cent) selected education as their major subject, 
whereas all the remainder (92.4 per cent) pursued 
one or another of the academic subjects. Under- 
graduate minors are distributed in proportions 
almost identical. Not all principals have taken 
up graduate study, but the number doing so is 
large enough to make the conclusion unequivocal: 
there is a marked shift to education as the major 
subject, more than a half reporting it. The minor 
also is in more than a fifth of the cases devoted to

this more strictly professional field. Obviously, 
a majority of the principals in and through their 
graduate training have been endeavoring to com- 
pensate for the professional inadequacies of under- 
graduate training. 
LINES OF EMPHASIS IN FURTHER TRAINING 
Additional evidence of the compensatory char- 
acter of the principals’ training subsequent to col- 
lege graduation is found in the compilation of 
their responses to a question put to them, “If you 
were to make further preparation for the work of 
high-school principal, what sort of training would 
you emphasize?” Except for a small group of 
miscellaneous responses, the answers divide into 
two main groups: (1) educational topics and (2) 
other subjects. The total count of the former 
overwhelms those in the latter, since of 929 
topics or subjects, listed by the principals, 799, or 
85.9 per cent, are classifiable as educational. 
The most common educational topic among 
the wide variety listed is “administration” or 
“high-school administration,” and this is fol- 
Jowed i in order of frequency of mention by mea- 
‘surement, supervision, various phases of psychol- 
ogy (“educational,” “adolescent,” “of high- 
‘school subjects,” etc.), “education” without

THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
specification, curriculum, guidance, methods, etc. 
The most common other subjects reported 
were social subjects (most frequently sociology) 
and English and public speaking (more fre- 
quently the latter aspect). 
There is an interesting and significant corre- 
spondence between the preferences here reported 
and those portions of Chapters IV and V in 
which are presented data concerning the subjects 
and courses taken which were found to have been 
of greatest professional value. The organization 
of captions is not identical in the two educational 
lists, and this fact accounts for most of the differ- 
ences to be found in them. The list of subjects 
other than education indicated as being profes- 
sionally valuable as reported in Chapter V is 
somewhat more detailed as well as wider than 
those in which further training would be chosen, 
but the agreement on English, public speaking, 
and the social studies signifies a large degree of 
corroboration. :

there is so much in common between what has 
just been presented on the principals’ choices of 
lines of emphasis in further training and their re- 
sponses to one other question, that it seems ad- 
visable to introduce a digest of the latter at this 
point. The question under consideration is “On 
what aspect of the work of the high-school prin- 
cipal are we most in need of information?” 
The answers here again range widely and are 
also not without difficulties of classification. A

“Administration” here includes usually the an- 
swers put in this general way or as “high-school 
administration.” The same may be said of the 
bulk of those answers listed here as “supervi- 
sion.” “Responsibilities of the principal” is re- 
ported often in just these words because this was 
one of the chief lines of inquiry in the question- 
ary. The import of the remaining categories is 
sufficiently apparent to warrant omission of fur- 
ther characterization of the aspects tallied under 
them. 
At least two conclusions are to be drawn from 
this array of aspects of their work believed by 
high-school principals to be those on which they 
are most in need of information. The first of 
these is their large extent of resemblance to the 
educational topics listed by principals as those 
which they would emphasize in further training. 
Complete identity there is not, but, on the other 
hand, there is so large a measure of identity of 
58

AFTER UNDERGRADUATE YEARS 
content as to add much corroboration to the con- 
clusion of a marked shift of emphasis from under- 
graduate years to the present time. The second 
is the suggestions the categories provide for desir- 
able lines of research as touching high-school ad- 
ministration and supervision. It requires only a 
brief second glance at the list of categories to con- 
vince that here are fields for inquiry that will not 
soon be exhausted.

HIS EXPERIENCE AND PROFESSIONAL 
STABILITY 
HIS EXPERIENCE IN EDUCATIONAL WORK 
MartERIALs so far presented afford some clues to, 
but no adequate description of, the types and 
extent of educational experience the principals 
have had before attaining their present positions. 
What are the kinds of educational service they 
have rendered? What is the dominant type of 
experience preliminary to entrance upon their 
specialty? On the average how long must they 
serve in one group before advancing to the next? 
These are some of the questions concerning the 
principalship next to be answered. 
Although the “average” principals have had a 
wide variety of educational experiences including 
even teaching in rural schools, junior high schools, 
and colleges, and administrative work as superin- 
tendent, the lines in which they rendered longest 
service are teaching in elementary grades and in 
high schools, and administering high schools.! 
1In the work of tabulation on which the conclusions are based it 
was sometimes found impossible to distinguish between service as

To the first of these they devoted somewhat more 
than one year. Principals in the smallest com- 
munities have averaged 7.4 years of high-school 
teaching and 5.4 years in their present line. 
This does not mean that they have spent the sum 
of these averages in service in high schools, since 
the average total years in all educational lines for 
this group is 9.6. It is to be understood that 
principal in small schools including both elementary and high-school 
grades on'the one hand and strictly high-school grades on the other. 
It may be assumed that in almost all cases years devoted to service 
in the “principalship” pertain to the high school only. 
61
-P-A-G-E-76
THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
during most of their period of service as prin- 
cipals they have also been teaching in the high 
schools. ‘These figures indicate in addition that 
the high-school principalship is typically not en- 
tered even in these smaller high scuools without 
a period of apprenticeship in high-school teach- 
ing. 
The average numbers of years of experience in 
high-school teaching, in the principalship, and in 
the superintendency increase consistently from 
Group I to Group IV. The first mounts to 17.2, 
the time spent in principalships to 12.5, and that 
in all educational lines to 20.6 — a full score and 
more. The difference between the numbers of 
years spent in high-school teaching and the prin- 
cipalship widens from two years in Group I to 4.7 
years in Group IV. The period of apprentice- 
ship in high-school teaching appears to be longer 
for the positions of larger responsibility than for 
high schools in the smaller communities. 
Comparison of these figures on the years of 
service necessary to enter the positions of larger 
responsibility with those concerning salaries paid 
as presented in Chapter II do not afford a basis 
for a conclusion of rapid advance for most prin- 
cipals from the lower to the higher levels of re- 
muneration. Genuine assurance is nevertheless

provided for an expectation of salary advance 
with added experience in the work. 
A consideration of much significance to pro- 
gress toward professionalizing an occupation is 
the period of service in it of those who enter. A 
conclusion warranted by these average periods of 
service is that the turnover as measured by the 
full term of years in all principalships must be 
proportionately small and slow. With reference 
to frequent shift from one occupation to another 
high-school principals constitute a stable group. 
DO PRINCIPALS PLAN TO REMAIN IN THE WORK? 
The problem of whether we have in high-school 
principals a group of educational workers satis- 
fied with their occupation to the point of being 
willing to remain in it was approached more di- 
rectly by putting to them the questions, “Do you 
plan to remain in the work of high-school prin- 
cipal? In educational work? To what line of 
work, educational or otherwise, do you plan to 
transfer?” 
The digest of answers to these questions shows 
that a full three fifths of all are planning to con- 
tinue as high-school principals. The proportion 
planning to remain increases from Group I in 
which it is somewhat more than a half to Group

ing from 11.5 per cent in the smallest communi- 
ties considered to 22.8 per cent, in the second 
group, and again to 24.7, or almost a fourth in 
Group III. A much smaller proportion — only 
slightly more than a tenth — of principals in the 
largest high schools look forward to the shift 
from direction of the affairs of a high school to 
those of the system as a whole. It is one of the 
deficiencies of educational work that it is still in 
the transitional stage of professionalization per- 
mitting any one engaged in it to move with little 
or no specialization of preparation from one line 
to another.’ The high-school teacher who entered 
upon his work with professional preparation all 
too meager for that work aspires to the principal- 
ship and attains it too often without additional 
equipment for its responsibilities, and the high- 
school principal in turn looks upon his position as 
a stepping-stone to the superintendency. We 
ought soon to reach a higher stage in the evolu- 
tion of the high-school principalship as a profes- 
sion, a stage on which those who plan to engage 
in it will first be specially equipped for its respon- 
sibilities, and, after having been so equipped, will 
not soon seek service in a line of work with 
clearly different responsibilities for many of 
which the special training requisite for the high-

school principalship can hardly be appropriate. 
Assurance that such a stage is attainable, even

portions of principals who are planning to remain

VIII 
HIS TIME FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND 
SUPERVISORY ACTIVITIES 
In order to perform the professional duties pe- 
culiar to his position as head of the high school, 
the principal must have time for the work. It is 
common knowledge that principals in small high 
schools spend larger proportions of the school day 
in teaching and in charge of assembly rooms than 
do those in the larger units, but little more than 
general statements concerning the situation in 
this regard are available. The study here being 
reported made special inquiry to secure informa- 
tion along lines necessary to ascertaining for each 
principal the proportion of the schedule day 
available for administrative and supervisory 
activities. Among the items secured to this end 
were the numbers of periods in the schedule week, 
the numbers spent by the principal in teaching, 
in assembly hall duty, etc.

THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
and supervisory responsibilities show a marked 
tendency to enlarge as the high school increases 
in size. The median per cent advances from 26.9 
in the group of smallest high schools represented 
to 100 in the largest, which is the same thing as 
saying that in high schools with a median enroll- 
ment of 161! only a fourth of the schedule day is 
set aside for performing the functions peculiar to 
the task, while in high schools with a median en- 
rollment of 1158 — about a thousand students 
more — the entire day is available for such use. 
For the high schools of the two intervening 
groups these median per cents are 51.4 and 88.3.

The full range of percentages for each group is 
wide, including the full range from no portion to 
all the day in Groups I, II, and III, but only 
‘from two thirds to the full day in Group IV. The 
range of the middle fifty per cent of cases, a 
better measure of tendencies than the full range, 
shows rather consistent advances from group to 
group. 
INADEQUATE TIME ALLOWED IN THE SMALLER 
SCHOOLS 
An inference of this phase of the study is that, 
for principals in the two larger groups of high 
schools, inroads upon the administrative and 
supervisory day in the way of teaching or as- 
sembly hall duty are usually either negligible or 
non-existent. But in the smaller groups the 
time set aside for administration and supervision 
is not nearly as large. The question may be 
raised as to whether, especially in the high 
schools of Group I, notwithstanding their small 
size, sufficient time is at hand for adequate per- 
formance of the functions properly falling to the 
lot of the principal. The doubt persists even 
when account is taken of the time for administra- 
tive work outside the limits of the schedule day. 
One anticipates also, that less responsibility for 
75
-P-A-G-E-90
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
“ significant functions is assigned to principals in 
such schools. 
The teaching responsibilities of principals in 
the smaller schools argue that, no matter what 
the shift of emphasis in professionalizing training 
for the duties peculiar to the principalship, cur- 
ricula should continue to prepare for the former 
portion of his activities. We need not deplore 
this as being gratuitous, in view of his respon- 
sibilities as a supervisor of classroom instruction, 
responsibilities that must increase as he is pro- 
moted from each group to the next larger. What 
must be avoided is preparation for teaching to 
the exclusion of those activities which subse- 
quently demand all his time.
-P-A-G-E-91
Ix 
HIS RESPONSIBILITIES 
OBTAINING THE EVIDENCE 
Nor only must the principal have time for the 
performance of administrative and supervisory 
functions, but, if he is to be more than a merely 
nominal head of his school, he must have impor- 
tant responsibilities. The study being reported 
made inquiry also on this point by ascertaining 
from the principals the facts concerning in whom 
initiative is vested in a variety of activities essen- 
tial to performance in high schools. The prin- 
cipal was directed to indicate in whom, in the 
school system, initiative was lodged or centered 
in each of nineteen administrative and supervi- 
sory activities in the high school. Provision was 
made for checking under “high-school principal,” 
“superintendent,” “school board,” and “other 
persons or group,” and request made to report the 
official title of such other persons. 
The list of activities provided for the designa- 
tion requested was not intended to be complete, 
the aim in selecting the items being to secure a 
7
-P-A-G-E-92
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
representation of the extent of initiative assigned 
the principal. There are, thus, at the lower ex- 
treme such responsibilities as ‘‘ordinary dis- 
ciplinary control of high-school students,” “con- 
trolling debating, dramatic, and other similar 
student organizations and activities,” and “‘keep- 
ing high-school records and reports,” and, at the 
other, “selecting new high-school teachers,” 
“disciplinary control involving suspension or ex- 
pulsion of high-school students,” and “preparing 
the high-school financial budget.” Among the 
responsibilities lying somewhere between thése 
extremes are “planning or making the high- 
school course of study” and “conferring with 
high-school teachers about their class work.” 
THE LOCATION OF INITIATIVE 
If attention is directed first to the proportions 
of the whole number of principals in whom initia- 
tive is vested, one finds the anticipated variation 
among the several categories concerning which 
inquiry was made. The activity in which the 
smallest percentage of principals are assigned 
initiative is preparing the high-school financial 
budget, the proportion closely following those for 
selecting new high-school teachers and recom- 
mending salary promotion. Not far in advance 
78 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
HIS RESPONSIBILITIES 
of these are selecting high-school textbooks, se- 
lecting equipment, approving supply lists, and 
disciplinary control involving suspension or ex- 
pulsion. At the other extreme, in the order of 
declining proportions, are organizing the class 
schedule, ordinary disciplinary control of high- 
school students, keeping records and reports, call- 
ing and holding teachers’ meetings, and advising 
students concerning courses and curricula. Be- 
tween the proportions for the two groups already 
named lie those for visiting classwork for super- 
visory purposes, directing janitors, planning the 
course of study, conferring with teachers about 
their classwork, admitting students, and controll- 
ing athletic relations. 
The chief competitor of the principal for initia- 
tive is the superintendent. The activities in 
which initiative is more frequently vested in him 
than in the principal are selecting new high- 
school teachers, recommending salary promotion, 
approving supply lists, and preparing the finan- 
cial budget, and others in which he is frequently 
assigned initiative are planning the course of 
study, admitting students, visiting classwork for 
supervisory purposes, disciplinary control involv- 
ing suspension or expulsion, and selecting text- 
books and equipment. These ten activities

HIS RESPONSIBILITIES 
vested with initiative in them, lead to the infer- 
ence that he is little more than the nominal head 
of the high school. The other activities are, of 
course, necessary of performance, but they in- 
clude only a few of a critical nature that tend, un- 
accompanied by those involving greater respon- 
sibilities, to make of the principal little more than 
a minor functionary. 
The compilation of responses indicates that for 
all the activities listed initiative is often located in 
principal and superintendent working in conjunc- 
tion. The proportions of high schools of which 
this is true varies from activity to activity, but 
for the most part they are large if the proportions 
in which initiative is located in the superintend- 
ent are large. In most instances this type of re- 
sponse may manifest a hesitancy to clothe the 
principal with full authority to initiate, and in 
this sense it points to restrictions on the profes- 
sionalization of the principalship. In some in- 
stances, however, it doubtless signifies codpera- 
tive agreement of principal and superintendent 
on important procedures or questions of policy. 
To the extent that the latter situation obtains it 
is to be encouraged rather than decried, since, for 
purposes of an articulated school system, there 
must be the best of codperation all the way from 
85  
-P-A-G-E-100
THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
teacher to school board, and even farther. To 
this end the principal should always consult his 
superintendent when important changes in policy 
or procedure are contemplated. This is, how- 
ever, far from divesting the principal of initiative. 
In this study the school board was found to 
exercise initiative to some extent. The more 
notable proportions of high schools in which this 
situation obtained were those for selecting new 
teachers, recommending salary promotion, visit- 
ing classwork for supervisory purposes, disciplin- 
ary control involving suspension or expulsion, 
selecting equipment, approving supply lists, and 
preparing the high-school financial budget. 
Here, except to the extent that principals did 
not misunderstand the import of the inquiry (and 
this could not be large), we have persistence of a 
practice of the board to arrogate to itself the pro- 
fessional functions of its employees instead of 
restricting its own activities to deliberation and 
legislation. 
There are other types of location of initiative, 
such as other combinations, for example, the 
superintendent and the board, or the principal 
and the board; the State authorities; and some 
subordinate of the principal. Instances of two or 
more officers initiating in conjunction are scat-

HIS RESPONSIBILITIES - 
tered through all the activities named. State 
authorities make their most frequent appearance 
as initiators in matters like planning courses of 
study and selecting textbooks. Subordinates of 
the principal often have initiative in such matters 
as advising students concerning courses and cur- 
ricula, controlling athletic relations (where the 
coach functions), controlling debating, dramatic, 
and other similar student organizations and ac- 
tivities, selecting textbooks, selecting high-school 
equipment, and keeping records and reports. 
To the extent that these subordinates work under 
the direction of or in codperation with the prin- 
cipal, this is merely a reassignment of initiative 
by the principal in whom it was originally located, 
and these instances may properly be added to 
those in which the principal reports that initia- 
tive is located in him. It is to be noted that 
most of these are among the less critical func- 
tions. 
COMPARISON OF INITIATIVE IN SMALL AND 
LARGE HIGH SCHOOLS 
It is almost common knowledge to those at all 
conversant with the situation that the extent of 
delegation of responsibility to the principalship in 
large high schools tends to exceed that in smaller

units. A comparison was made on this score of 
the high schools of Groups I and IV, respectively 
the smallest and largest schools represented in 
the present study. The original comparison con- 
cerned all the nineteen activities to which refer- 
ence has so far been made. At this point, how- 
ever, it will suffice to include only nine of these, 
four being among those in which it was found 
that initiative is most frequently located in the 
principalship and the remaining five among those 
in which it is less often so located. 
In harmony with our expectation, as to most of 
these nine activities there is a larger extent of 
location of initiative in the principals of Group 
IV than in those of Group I. Even in two in 
which at first glance it seemed that the reverse 
was true — that is, for keeping records and re-: 
ports and for selecting new high-school teachers 
— consideration of all the facts points to more 
voice in these matters for the larger principalship. 
For the former activity initiative is often re- 
delegated to some person subordinate to the 
principal; for the latter, there is much more often 
location of initiative in the principal and superin- 
tendent in conjunction and less often in the super- 
intendent alone where the largest schools are con- 
cerned. Similar evidence for other activities cor- 
93
-P-A-G-E-108
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
roborates a conclusion that the contrast of small 
and large principalships in this regard is even 
more marked than at first appears. 
At the same time there is unmistakable evi- 
dence that for all groups the delegation of initia- 
tive is often too restricted to allow for the proper 
professionalization of the occupation. For the 
more critical functions, like selecting new high- 
school teachers, visiting classwork for super- 
visory purposes, conferring with teachers about 
classwork, and disciplinary control involving sus- 
pension or expulsion, too little responsibility de- 
volves upon the head of the high school. This 
criticism is to some extent applicable even in the 
case of less critical functions like organizing the 
class schedule, controlling debating, dramatics, 
and other student activities, keeping records 
and reports, and ordinary disciplinary control. 
Whatever may be the obstructing factors here — 
for example, lack of preparation of the principal 
for his work, his hesitancy to assume responsi- 
bilities, a tradition of retaining for the superin- 
tendency full control in all critical relationships, 
insistence by the board or community that the 
superintendent retain all important responsibil- 
ities, or the superintendent’s jealousy of what he 
regards as his prerogatives — it is essential that 
94,

the principalship be endowed with more vital 
responsibilities. Some differences in this respect 
between the smaller and the larger principalships 
there should be. There may be good grounds for 
withholding initiative in one or another of the 
functions in the full list from the younger prin- 
cipal and perhaps even for the more experienced, 
but this admission cannot affect the conviction 
that the high-school principalship must be vested 
with significant and not merely minor respon- 
sibilities,

PROFESSIONALIZING THE PRINCIPALSHIP 
RECAPITULATION 
Tuis study of principals of more than four hun- 
dred high schools ranging in enrollment from ap- 
proximately fifty to almost three thousand stu- 
dents and serving communities with populations 
of a thousand to a hundred thousand in all sec- 
tions of the country results in the following as its 
main findings: 
(rt) The position is looked upon for the most 
part as one for men. Although almost a fourth 
of the incumbents are women in the group of 
smallest communities considered — those with 
populations of a thousand to twenty-five hundred 
—the proportion declines rapidly with each 
larger group until not a woman is found in the 
high-school principalships in cities with popula- 
tions of twenty-five to one hundred thousand re- 
presented, the positions of largest responsibility 
included in the study. 
(2) Salaries for men, while not yet adequate in 
view of the long periods of training and appren- 
96
-P-A-G-E-111
PROFESSIONALIZATION 
ticeship required, assure advancement to a com- 
fortable livelihood as one is promoted from the 
smaller to the larger high schools, and are suffi- 
ciently large to induce capable men to enter upon 
the work as a permanent vocation — an impor- 
tant factor in efforts to professionalize an occupa- 
tion. The salaries of women principals are no- 
tably lower. 
(3) Although a small proportion of principals 
in communities of all sizes have had less than four 
years of training beyond the high school (the per- 
centage being largest where the smallest schools 
are concerned), large proportions have had more 
than this amount. The proportions with five or 
more years of training beyond the high school are 
also large. Moreover, these proportions tend to 
increase as the high schools and communities in- 
crease in size. In harmony with these data are 
those pertaining to the percentages of principals 
with advanced degrees, predominantly the mas- 
ters’. The proportions with degrees higher than 
the bachelors’ increase from approximately an 
eighth in the smallest to almost two fifths in 
the largest communities represented. Advanced 
training and graduate degrees become increas- 
ingly passports to principalships of greater re- 
sponsibility. 
97
-P-A-G-E-112
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
(4) A significant fact disclosed is the large pro- 
portions of principals in high schools and com- 
munities of all sizes who have recently been in 
attendance in summer sessions. The proportion 
whose last summer attendance was during 1920 
or 1921 is almost a third of the whole, while the 
proportion in attendance since 1915 is almost a 
half. Except for principals in the group of larg- 
est communities and high schools, the propor- 
tions increase as one proceeds from the positions 
of smaller to those of greater responsibility. The 
large proportions who thus supplement their 
earlier preparation by summer attendance seem 
thereby to be admitting their need for compensa- 
tory training as well as their belief that the higher 
institutions now offer something of genuine pro- 
fessional meaning. 
(5) While no inconsiderable proportion of the 
principals have had no courses in the special field 
of education, the median of nine courses for all 
principals shows that this is far from typical. 
The courses taken by all reporting cover a wide 
variety of materials, but those most frequently 
recurring are identical with those usually pre- 
scribed for high-school teachers-in-training, such 
as history of education, principles of education, 
principles of secondary education, technique (or 
98
-P-A-G-E-113
PROFESSIONALIZATION 
general methods), and educational psychology. 
The only additional course reported by more than 
a half of the principals is high-school administra- 
tion, probably among the first to be taken to com- 
pensate for the inadequacy of earlier prepara- 
tion. Other courses reported less frequently but 
by at least a fourth of all principals are philoso- 
phy of education, curriculum, high-school cur- 
riculum, educational sociology (or social aspects 
of education), city school administration, super- 
vision, special methods, psychology of adoles- 
cence, psychology of high-school subjects, and 
educational measurements. 
Computation of the percentages of those hav- 
ing had these and other courses in education who 
regard them as being of “most use” to them as 
principals discovers thirteen for which the pro- 
portions exceed ten per cent. Of these four only, 
principles of secondary education, educational 
psychology, philosophy of education, and tech- 
nique, are or have been frequent constituents in 
the professional training of high-school teachers. 
The remainder may be regarded as content over 
and above that typically taken by the principals 
as undergraduates. Moreover, at their present 
states of training, an average of only thirty-five 
per cent of the principals have had courses along 
99
-P-A-G-E-114
THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL | 
these nine lines. Although this is far from a 
complete criterion of professional training for the 
principalship, it indicates rather emphatically 
that when judged by their peers, large propor- 
tions have been inadequately prepared. 
(6) In order to be properly prepared for their 
supervisory responsibilities, principals should 
have had contact with as nearly as possible the 
full range of subjects represented in the high 
school. Inquiry shows that the percentages of 
principals who have pursued courses in each of 
the main academic fields in college are reassur- 
ingly large. Because contacts during secondary- 
school training are also pertinent in this connec- 
tion, the percentages who have had contact with 
these fields either in high school or college were 
computed, with the result that in all cases the 
proportions were enlarged — for some subjects, 
much more than others, to be sure. The only 
fields in which the percentages who have had 
such contact are regrettably low are the non- 
academic subjects such as agriculture, shop and 
related work, the arts, commercial lines, and 
physical training. 
(7) The academic subjects reported by these 
high-school heads as having been of most use to 
them as principals (“not as teachers’’) are, in the 
100
-P-A-G-E-115
PROFESSIONALIZATION 
order of frequency, English, psychology, public 
speaking, sociology, philosophy, political science, 
history, and economics. It is perhaps safe to 
conclude that of the academic subjects the prin- 
cipal regards those of highest professional value 
which have increased his effectiveness in public 
presentation, which have enlarged his conception 
of the réle of education in modern society, and 
which have contributed to his understanding of 
learning processes and of human nature. 
(8) A negligible proportion of principals 
planned as undergraduates to enter the work in 
which they are now engaged, although a majority 
(52.1 per cent) had it in mind to go into some 
line of educational work, the bulk of these into 
“teaching” or “high-school teaching.” The re- 
mainder of those who had undergraduate plans 
— many had none — contemplated entering law, 
medicine, the ministry, engineering, business, etc. 
It is not too much to say that most incumbents 
stumbled into the high-school principalship, and, 
therefore, were without anything approaching 
adequate professional equipment for the task. 
(9) Acknowledgment of inadequacy of prepara- 
tion on the professional side during undergradu- 
ate years is provided, first, in the shift of em- 
phasis as shown in the undergraduate and gradu- 
101
-P-A-G-E-116
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
ate majors and minors of specialization reported 
by the principals. Undergraduate majors and 
minors were well-nigh exclusively in fields other 
than education, whereas more than half of the 
graduate majors are or were in education, with 
almost a fifth of the graduate minors also in pro- 
fessional subjects. 
The necessity of further emphasis on the pro- 
fessional side in making adequate preparation for 
the principalship is shown in the responses of 
principals to the question, “If you were to make 
further preparation for the work of high-school 
principal, what sort of training would you em- 
phasize?” Fully six sevenths of all lines listed 
classify as educational. The most common top- 
ics under which these responses classify are ad- 
ministration (usually “high-school administra- 
tion”), measurement, supervision, psychology 
(educational aspects), curriculum, guidance, 
methods, etc. All but a small proportion of the 
non-educational (mostly academic) subjects 
listed are those like the social studies and English 
and public speaking already reported as being 
highly regarded from the professional standpoint 
by principals in service. 
(10) Inquiry concerning aspects of the work of 
the high-school principal on which we are “most 
102
-P-A-G-E-117
PROFESSIONALIZATION 
in need of information” brought responses for the 
most part classifying under heads similar to those 
used in tabulating the answers to the question 
just quoted. Besides corroborating conclusions 
already drawn the responses indicate fields of re- 
search touching the high school which will not 
soon be exhausted. 
(11) The average periods of educational ex- 
perience of principals show: (a) that, for the 
most part, they are recruited from the high- 
school teaching staff where they must first serve 
a period of apprenticeship; (b) that the periods of 
service as teachers, as principals, and in all prin- 
cipalships are proportionately small and slow. 
These data, as well as those pertaining to the 
principals’ plans for the future, indicate that pro- 
fessionally they constitute a stable group. In 
the positions of larger responsibility only rela- 
tively small proportions plan to leave educa- 
tional work. The most frequent type of shift 
contemplated, except in the group of smallest 
high schools, is to the superintendency, but in the 
largest principalships the proportion aspiring to 
the superintendency is markedly diminished. 
The facts touching experience and plans lend 
courage to the hope of developing an attitude of 
remaining in the high-school principalship as a 
103
-P-A-G-E-118
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
life work, rather than regarding it as a temporary 
occupation merely, a sort of a stepping-stone to 
the superintendency or some other line of subse- 
quent activity. As already suggested, compen- 
sation for the work begins to warrant such an 
attitude. 
(12) The time available to the principal for ad- 
ministrative and supervisory activities tends in 
the larger high schools to include all or almost all 
the schedule day, but in the smaller institutions 
the portion devoted to teaching and supervision 
of assembly or session rooms is so large that too 
little time is allowed for activity which should 
be more distinctive of the principalship proper. 
The teaching responsibilities in the smaller 
schools, as well as the fact of promotion from 
smaller to larger principalships, argue against re- 
moving from curricula in preparation for the 
work the content which prepares him also for 
teaching responsibilities. Such a constituent of 
preparation is not gratuitous, in view of his ob- 
ligations as a supervisor of classroom instruction. 
What must be avoided is preparation for teaching 
to the exclusion of those activities which, as he 
advances to positions of greater responsibility, 
demand larger and larger pene of his 
schedule day. 
104
-P-A-G-E-119
PROFESSIONALIZATION 
(13) Evidence on the location of initiative for a 
wide variety of administrative and supervisory 
activities discloses a deplorable hesitancy in 
many systems to make the high-school principal 
responsible for anything more than minor or 
clerical details. Even as to some of these the 
superintendent is often a competitor for initia- 
tive. This tendency is not one pertaining to 
small high schools only, although it is much more 
marked here than in the larger institutions. 
Whatever the obstructing factors, elevation of 
the principalsaip to genuinely professional status 
demands endowing it to a larger extent with 
more significant responsibilities. 
THE NEED FOR ACCELERATING 
PROFESSIONALIZATION 
The facts just summarized find the principal- 
ship in an interesting transitional stage consid- 
erably advanced beyond occupations entered 
upon by the veriest of generalists but in several 
respects somewhere below time-honored profes- 
sions such as medicine and law. In matters of 
remuneration, periods of training (inclusive of 
summer attendance), pursuit of pertinent courses, 
length of stay in the work, determination to re- 
main in the service, time available for discharging 
105 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
responsibilities peculiar to the vocation, and loca- 
tion of initiative in significant functions much 
progress has been made. But the materials of 
the study simultaneously disclose untoward con- 
ditions that must be remedied before, with but 
occasional exceptions, the high-school principal- 
ship can be classed with the indubitable profes- 
sions. Many lines of accelerating professional 
progress are open, among them those now to be 
briefly discussed, namely, extension of the periods 
and proportions of specialized training, recruiting 
capable young men for the work, adding by 
means of research to the special content pertinent 
to the principalship but still nowhere available, 
and seeking responsibility for the more significant 
functions of administration and supervision of 
the high school. 
MORE TRAINING FOR THE PRINCIPALSHIP 
It goes almost without saying that profession- 
alization of an occupation is far from solely a 
matter of extending the period of training, either 
general or special, of candidates for the positions 
open in that line. Most readers will be able at 
once to mention by name high-school principals 
who, in terms of years in school or courses in edu- 
cation pursued cannot measure very high, but to 
106
-P-A-G-E-121
PROFESSIONALIZATION 
whose professional conception of their calling 
little if anything could be added from what is now 
available in the way of training for it. On the 
other hand, it is not difficult to call to mind men 
engaged in medical practice, let us say, who, al- 
though they have spent years on end in general 
and special preparation, are still far from conceiv- 
ing their work on as high a level as the principals 
referred to. 
It is, nevertheless, clear that elevation of the 
high-school principalship to undoubted profes- 
sional status requires that more specialized pre- 
paration be prescribed for admission to it. Data 
of the present study point to such a conclusion. 
Although all desirable special content is not yet 
at hand, the last few decades have witnessed an 
increase in the range and amount to such an ex- 
tent as to justify steps in this direction. In the 
transitional stage in which we now are it will be 
necessary for such special training to be both 
(a) compensatory and (b) preliminary. It should 
be (a) compensatory in the sense of being added 
by principals now in service during summers and 
during the regular school year to training not 
typically pointing definitely toward the respon- 
sibilities of the principalship, a training whose 
most frequent direction has been that of prepara- 
107
-P-A-G-E-122
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
tion for high-school teaching. It should be (b) 
preliminary in the sense of being taken before en- 
trance to the work by candidates without previ- 
ous experience in the high-school principalship. 
In addition to the preparation required of high- 
school teachers-in-training, this special content 
could properly emphasize such lines as are con- 
sidered most pertinent to their work by the prin- 
cipals represented in this study, or in which they 
indicated preferences to continue preparation, 
namely, city and high-school administration, 
supervision, educational psychology in several of 
its aspects, principles of secondary education, 
high-school curriculum, mental and educational 
measurements, guidance, vocational education, 
methods, etc., not to mention such academic sub- 
jects as the social sciences and English and public 
speaking. The period of training for admission 
to the principalship should shortly be raised to 
not less than five years beyond high-school grad- 
uation. The fact that large proportions of prin- 
cipals already qualify on such a standard argues 
the feasibility of such a requirement. A mo- 
ment’s consideration of the range of contacts es- 
sential to such training should convince that, 
despite the present partial state of development 
of special content, even a five-year period is all 
108
-P-A-G-E-123
  
  PROFESSIONALIZATION 
too brief. The candidate must first serve an ap- 
prenticeship as high-school teacher for which, of 
course, not less than four years beyond the high 
school has been a standard requirement. This 
preparation and experience fits him in part for his 
supervisory responsibilities, but in preparation 
for the latter he should also make contact with 
each of the main fields of study represented in 
high-school programs. In addition he must 
have, in order to be able to discharge satisfactor- 
ily his administrative and supervisory responsi- 
bilities, the additional special content to which 
reference has already been made. It is difficult 
to conceive of a four-year curriculum that can 
compass all this. 
It is the belief of the writer that not less than 
the last three years of this five-year period should 
be mapped out with the high-school principalship 
in prospect. It is even desirable to have the 
courses of the lower college years selected to 
some extent to this end, much as pre-legal and 
pre-medical work is outlined. There are at pre- 
sent, however, serious obstructions to carrying out 
sucha plan. One of these is the large proportion 
of college graduates who enter upon the work of 
the principalship without having looked forward 
to doing so during undergraduate years. The 
109 
   
-P-A-G-E-124
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
other is a fact so far not reported in the study, 
that more than half of the present incumbents of 
principalships have taken their undergraduate 
work in separate colleges, most of them of the 
“small” liberal arts type. These infrequently 
carry the student into the fifth year and almost 
as infrequently offer special educational content 
in excess of that prescribed for teachers-in- 
training. The immediate solution of the pro- 
blem of securing for the principalship five years 
of preparation in higher institutions seems to be 
to offer two chief types of opportunity to do so, 
(x) the five-year period during all the last three 
of which the candidate moves consistently 
toward his professional goal, and (2) the one-year 
graduate period during which effort is made to 
compensate for the professional inadequacies of 
the undergraduate training. 
Recent modifications of the Teachers’ License 
Law of Indiana as applying to high-school prin- 
cipals are somewhat in line with the latter type of 
proposal. The high-school principal’s license of 
the first grade, valid for five years, and good for 
administration and supervision in any high 
school, prescribes one year of work in a standard 
university, eighteen semester hours of which 
must be in professional courses pertinent to the 
110 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  
PROFESSIONALIZATION 
principalship, the additional semester hours re- 
quired being ‘“‘in any other two fields of know- 
ledge,” or “‘in education courses other than those 
required and elected” to make up the total of 
eighteen. The standards for a high-school prin- 
cipal’s license of the second grade, valid for three 
years, and good for administration and supervi- 
sion in any high school, are not as high, but re- 
quire ‘additional school preparation [beyond 
college graduation] equivalent to ten semester 
hours” and credit up to fifteen semester hours, 
presumably either undergraduate or graduate, in 
certain “required professional courses.” 
GUIDANCE AND RECRUITMENT OF CAPABLE MEN 
To the writer one of the most disconcerting 
facts in the foregoing chapters is the negligible 
proportion of high-school principals who planned 
as undergraduates to enter the work in which 
they are now engaged. Almost all stumbled into 
the principalship, large numbers from the neigh- 
boring fields of high-school teaching and from 
other fields of educational service, but almost as 
many from paths leading to other professions and 
occupations. 
If it is admitted that principals must be trained 
for the work, and preferably by means of a cur- 
Tit
-P-A-G-E-126
  THE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
riculum more or less specialized through a period 
of years, it is corollarial that those who are ulti- 
mately to enter the service make the decision 
earlier than is now the practice. This means 
guidance. In some way the schools and colleges 
of education in such of our universities as af- 
ford opportunities for educational specialization 
should influence young men in their undergradu- 
ate years to select the principalship as their occu- 
pational goal. This can in part be accomplished 
by inducing those with appropriate personal and 
mental equipment who plan to enter high-school 
teaching so to modify their curricula to include 
more of the content pertinent for high-school ad- 
ministration and supervision. Where the supply 
of such young men is inadequate, these schools 
ought also to seek to divert young men of parts 
who are still undecided as to occupational de- 
stination from streams leading to professions now 
overcrowded. 
Of much more help in the recruitment of ca- 
pable men for this profession should be the high- 
school principal himself. He should make it a 
point in his significant work of guidance to direct 
the attention of boys of promising personality 
and capacity to the opportunities for service and 
a livelihood in the line of work in which he him-

self is engaged, to discuss with them the prepara- 
tion requisite to making for success in it, and to 
canvass with them the places where such pre- 
paration is available. On account of economic 
considerations, he will be most successful in re- 
cruitment with boys from families of the middle 
class where more or less sacrifice and struggle are 
entailed in order to make available the oppor- 
tunities of an education. This will be the more 
appropriate since such boys will the more readily 
sense the democratizing functions of the sec- 
ondary school. 
Both guidance and training should lead to a 
conception of the high-school principalship as a 
life-work, and not as a stepping-stone to some other 
occupation. Our chief concern here is with the 
frequent aspirations of principals to the superin- 
tendency. To be sure, the training for these two 
specialties will always be in part alike. More- 
over, there are ample precedents for “promot- 
ing” the principal to the superintendency. Two 
lines of advancement in responsibilities and sal- 
ary have in the past been open to capable prin- 
cipals, one to principalships elsewhere and the 
other to the local superintendency when it be- 
comes vacant. Of the two the latter is the more 
likely to be opened up, since the principal is bet-

ter known to the community in which he works 
than elsewhere. We can hardly expect the popu- 
lace or even the school board to appreciate the 
need of differentiated training for the two occu- 
pations when many educational leaders are not 
yet conscious of it. Nevertheless, the slow turn- 
over in the principalship, the satisfaction of over- 
whelming majorities of present incumbents with 
the work to the point of not hoping to get out of 
it, and the special content more and more neces- 
sary to equip one for it urge us in turn to en- 
courage those who contemplate entering it to 
make it their life’s occupation. 
ADDING TO PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE 
A third approach in accelerating professionali- 
zation of the principalship is by adding to the 
body of knowledge pertaining to it. Much re- 
mains to be done. Higher institutions are, of 
course, under obligation to contribute in this way, 
and are doing so through research projects both 
of members of their faculties and of graduate 
students. But at best the numbers thus engaged 
are relatively few compared with the vast fields 
still unexplored. Principals in service must 
come to contribute more than they have to the 
solution of administrative and supervisory pro-

blems like those listed by principals themselves in 
the section of an earlier chapter (VI) in response 
to a request to state on what aspects of the prin- 
cipal’s work we are most in need of information. 
They should likewise stand ready to codperate 
with others in efforts to add to the total of special 
content available. In significant respects to the 
extent that knowledge peculiar to the secondary 
school is adequate will genuine professionaliza- 
tion be achieved. 
SEEKING RESPONSIBILITY 
Finally, efforts to map out and put in operation 
curricula in preparation for the principalship, 
guidance and recruitment of capable men for 
candidacy for the positions, and prosecution of 
related research will not alone professionalize the 
occupation, if incumbents are not vested with 
initiative in critical functions. The data of the 
present study, especially of Chapter IX, indicate 
that there is too little delegation of responsibility 
to many principalships to afford latitude for real 
professionalization. If the high school is to 
render the high type of social service which we 
are coming to demand of it, the principal must be 
clothed with initiative not only along lines like 
ordinary disciplinary control, making the class 
115

schedule, and keeping records and reports, but 
also in more vital relationships like selecting new 
teachers, planning the course of study, visiting 
classwork for supervisory purposes, and selecting 
equipment. Whatever the obstructing factors, 
whether the principal’s own hesitancy to assume 
the obligations, his lack of preparation for the 
work, the tradition of retaining for the superin- 
tendency full control in all critical matters, the 
superintendent’s jealousy of what he regards as 
his prerogatives, or any others, the principal 
must seek more responsibility. Without real re- 
sponsibilities no one can grow to professional 
stature. With traditions and practices opposed, 
responsibilities will not come of their own accord; 
they must be sought. 
Seeking responsibility should not involve an 
attitude of defiance toward either the superin- 
tendent or the school board. The attitude should, 
on the contrary, always be one of codperation. If 
the principal contemplates important changes in 
policy or procedure, the superintendent should 
always be first consulted, as this is essential to 
the proper coérdination of the several parts of the 
system. As has already been asserted, such an 
attitude of codperation is not at all the same 
thing as divesting the principal of initiative.

THE WORK MERITS PROFESSIONALIZATION 
If we were still conceiving of the secondary 
school as an institution extending over four 
school years with a curriculum suggesting little 
more than selection and preparation of its stu- 
dent body for higher levels of training — a sort of 
short and narrow isthmus between the elemen- 
tary school and the college—one might well 
question why so much ado is made about profes- 
sionalizing the position of directing it. But this 
meager conception is fast being left behind by 
the Great American Secondary School now in the 
making. It has opened its doors to such large 
proportions of the populace that it has become 
less and less solely a college preparatory school. 
In many sections, in terms of the proportion of 
its graduates who go on, it is even now pre- 
dominantly a non-college-preparatory institu- 
tion. Although it still has much to accomplish 
before all the children of all the people attend, 
the proportions of the population represented in 
it are equaled by those in the secondary schools 
of no other large nation. This popularization 
has been accompanied (or, perhaps better, closely 
followed) by a horizontal expansion of the offer- 
ing which has extended to subject after subject

until not only students and their parents but 
teachers and principals as well, are baffled as to 
how such a wide range of material can be ad- 
ministered best to contribute to the balanced edu- 
cation of those enrolled. The occupationalized 
types of content, demanded by a democratized 
school, at first a bit hesitant to enter, are now 
crowding in with increasing variety. Their ap- 
propriate administration constitutes, perhaps, 
the most difficult curricular problem of all. 
But the secondary school is expanding not 
merely horizontally; it is extending vertically 
also. It is reaching downward to include the 
upper years of the elementary school: data pre- 
sented by Superintendent Pratt! indicate that 
almost two thirds of the cities of one hundred 
thousand and over have junior high schools in 
operation or in various stages of preparation. It 
is reaching upward to include what have formerly 
been regarded as the first two years of college 
work. We are rapidly moving toward an eight- 
year period of secondary education. 
These expansions from the simple college pre- 
paratory isthmus to the Great American Second- 
ary School of the future, the characteristics of

which no one can predict in detail, constitute 
a tremendous challenge to the high-school prin- 
cipal. They call for constructive ability of the 
highest order. They are transmuting the little 
taskmastership of a generation or two ago into 
the work of a social engineer. For a position of 
such inspiring responsibilities no extent of pro- 
fessionalization can be too great.

Blount College and the University of Tensessee. 
Wirn this present year, the University of Tennessee, 
whose existence, under her maiden name of Blount Col- 
lege, dates from September 10th, 1794, rounds out the 
span of her first one hundred years. 
“i: Nature has no counterpart to that arbitrary division 
of infinite time which man denominates a century. Or- 
thodox natural science, scorning the poetic fancy of the 
myths and traditional lore which would tell us that with 
each recurring one hundred years the Phoenix is born 
again and the century-plant blooms anew, records, 
among all her duly authenticated phenomena, none 
whose cycle is a century. Nevertheless, man has made 
the century the yard-stick with which he measures his- 
tory, and has, by an immemorial and worthy custom, set 
apart centennial anniversaries as historical resting 
places and occasions of solemn and reflective ceremonial, 
upon which, in pleasant reminiscence and hopeful 
augury, to recite the story of the past and read the 
promise of the future.   
The University whose days have thus lengthened 
into five score years is a venerable and historic institu- 
tion, and one of the few pioneer institutions that yet 
survive within the borders of our State. 
If, itis true, we compare its life of one hundred years 
with the ages of finite time recorded in human history, 
and the countless unrecorded ages of infinite time that 
lie beyond those vague and measureless wastes, over 
which, to use the words of Lowell, fancy flutters ‘‘like 
a butterfly blown out to sea, and finds no foothold,” this 
closing century will seem but as the single ticking of 
a clock, that in the same instant hath both beginning 
and ending. / 
Nor is our University ancient in days when compared _

with the yet more ancient and venerable institutions of 
learning in Europe and this country. 
The Universities of Paris and Bologna were cele- 
brated as ancient schools centuries before America was. 
discovered: the classic Universities of England, Oxford, 
which received the fostering care of Alfred the Great, 
and Cambridge, its scarce younger sister, begin their 
histories with the dawn of English civilization: and are 
rich with memories and inspiration of that which has 
been best and highest in that civilization; while among 
the older Universities of America, illustrious in name 
' and glorious in achievements, Harvard has already 
passed the two hundred and fifty-seventh mile stone in 
her history, Yale dates her records from the birth of the 
eighteenth century, and Princeton, to whom Tennessee-- 
ans owe so much, is of scarce less ancient origin. 
Although, in contrast with these older academies the 
University of Tennessee seems but in the first flush of 
adolescent vigor, nevertheless, to us who live in a civili- 
zation that is comparatively new; in aland that hath not. 
the historic associations of ivy-mantled castles, ruined 
battlements and the dim fretted vaults of ancient 
cathedrals; in sight, as we are to-day, of a river down 
whose placid bosom Indian war canoes have stealthily 
glided almost within the memory of living man; 
surrounded by wooded hillsides in which painted sav- 
ages have lurked on death-dealing mission, even since 
this century began; an institution well deserves to be 
termed historic and venerable, whose foundation ante- 
dates by two years the establishment of our State 
government, and whose early history, inseparably linked 
with that of the infant Commonwealth and entwined 
with memories of its illustrious pioneers, brings us, 
when we read its records, into closer touch with the: 
inspiring spirit of those brave days. 
There is, I believe, nothing more conducive‘to good. 
citizenship, more stimulating to patriotic love of country
-P-A-G-E-6
—5— 
and a high sense of civic duty, and more inspiring to 
true ambition, than the study of that history which 
teaches us what manner of men our forefathers were ; 
in what high emprises they engaged; what they suf- 
ferred, dared and achieved ; and what was their rugged 
virtue and strength of character. 
Our present civilization must of necessity incur the 
danger that inevitably shadows all advancing civiliza- 
tions, that with the growth of luxurious arts, tending to 
develop the graces and refinements of character, there 
is a constant and imperceptible tendency to lose the 
stronger, rougher virtues developed in pioneer times ; 
and in these days of our republic, when there are upon 
every hand omens which can but make the thoughtful 
citizen tremble, when, in the not distant future, the “‘irre- 
pressible conflicts” which we daily seek to postpone, 
can be postponed no longer, and ‘‘the times that try 
men’s souls” shall come again, it will be well for our 
land, and will make certain a happy termination of our 
dangers, if, in those days, the citizens who will have to 
solve those fearful problems and meet those dangers face 
to face, shall be quickened by those same pioneer virtues 
of fearless determination, rugged honesty, and unquench - 
able love of liberty, which inspired the early settlers of 
this country so valorously to fight the good fight. 
That distinguished historian and erudite scholar, 
Judge John Haywood, has written, in his history of our 
State, that: ‘‘In viewing the first settlements of Ten- 
nessee, and those who were the principal actors in the 
establishment of them; in contemplating the obstacles 
opposed to their efforts, and the difficulties which were 
encountered in surmounting them; in noticing the expe- 
dients resorted to for the accomplishment of their pur- 
poses, (there) will also be evinced an important truth 
that men, educated in poverty and almost in ignorance 
of literature of any sort, are yet capable of great achieve- 
ments and of actions the most highly conducive to the
-P-A-G-E-7
—6— 
prosperity and character of the nation to which they 
belong.” : 
‘That the achievements of these men were great, our 
present civilization bears witness; that they were, in 
the main, without literary education, is true ; but neither 
must it be forgotten, on the other hand, that John Sevier, 
William Blount and William Cocke, and, in fact, all the 
great pioneer leaders, except James Robertson, were 
men of excellent education and considerable polish, 
Governor Blount especially being one of the most courtly 
and cultivated gentlemen in the entire South; and that 
the main body of the pioneers had received at least the 
elementary education given in the log-house country 
schools in the lands east of the Alleghanies, whence 
they had come. 
Thus, Theodore Roosevelt, in his brilliant book on 
“The Winning of the West,” invaluable to the student 
of our pioneer history, bears testimony to the fact that 
in examining ‘‘numerous original drafts of petitions 
and the like, signed by hundreds of the original set- 
tlers of Tennessee and Kentucky,” he was ‘“‘struck by 
the small proportion—not much over three or four per 
cent. at the outside—of men who made their mark instead 
of signing.” * 
The pioneers, let me repeat, while, in the main, not 
cultured, were not, as a rule, illiterate. 
It was in 1763 that King George III. of England, in 
order to allow the ‘‘savages to enjoy their deserts in 
quiet lest the peltry trade should decrease,” endeavored 
to arrest the tide of civilization advancing irresistibly 
westward from the Atlantic seaboard, by a Royal procla- 
mation that forbade the provincial governors to grant 
lands or individuals to purchase lands from the Indians 
upon any territory lying west of the sources of the rivers

flowing into the Atlantic; but vain was his proclama- 
tion as that royal mandate by which his predecessor, 
King Canute, had sought to stop the advancing tide of 
ocean. For overruling Destiny had decreed that ‘‘ West- 
ward the course of empire” should take ‘‘its way,” and 
that the history of the American people, for the first 
century of their national life, should be, im the main, the 
history of ceaseless and ever advancing western migra- 
tion. And so it has come to pass that the royal procla- 
mation bids fair to live in history chiefly because it 
called forth the eloquent protest of Edward Burke in his 
oration om Conciliation with Ameria. ’ 
And when, in the latter part of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, in the period of the Revolution, the great turbid 
wave of civilization swept westward over the crest of 
the Alleghanies down into the beautiful valleys of South- 
western Virginia and Eastern Tennessee, it had, with 
other admixtures, one predominating and salty element 
that gave it savor, the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians ; as 
sturdy, upright, God-fearing and intelligent a race of 
men as history has ever known, if, withal, a little inclined 
to narrowness, and who deserve, if any people do,.to be 
termed ‘‘the salt of the earth.” These men it was who 
constituted the dominant and principal element, the very 
bone and sinew, of the body of settlers and home seekers 
who came into these mountain valleys in search of per- 
manent abiding places, after the roving hunters and 
trappers who had preceded them had passed restlessly 
onward into other forests lying. yet further westward. 
Let me quote Roosevelt: ‘‘ The backwoodsmen were 
Americans by birth and parentage, and of mixed race,

but.the dominant strain in their blood was that of the 
Presbyterian Irish—the Scotch-Irish as they were called. 
Full credit has been awarded the Roundhead and the 
Cavalier for their leadership in our history; nor have we 
been altogether blind to the deeds of the Hollander and 
the Huguenot; but it is doubtful if we have wholly 
realized the importance of the part played by that stern 
and virile people, the Irish whose preachers taught the 
creed of Knox and Calvin. These Irish representatives 
of the Covenanters were in the west almost what the 
Puritans were in the northeast, and more than the Cava- 
liers were in the south. Mingled with the descendants 
of many other races, they nevertheless formed the kernel 
of the distinctive and intensely American stock who 
were the pioneers of our people in their march westward, 
the vanguard of the army of fighting settlers, who 
with axe and rifle won their way from the Alleghanies 
to the Rio Grande and Pacific.” * 
And with these men came their preachers; not overly 
tolerant, perhaps, or liberal in opinion, and fond of 
preaching what a contemporaneous writer terms ‘‘ very 
judicious and alarming” discourses; but resolute, high- 
minded, heroic men, who shared the labors and perils of 
the settlers, ‘tilled their fields, riflein hand, and fought 
the Indians valorously,” feeling, as has been said, ‘“‘that 
they were dispossessing the Canaanites, and were thus 
working the Lord’s will in preparing the land for a race 
which they believed was more truly His chosen people 
than was the nation which Joshua led across the Jordan.” 
They feared God and kept their powder dry. 
These men, when they had come to the western set- 
tlements, had brought with them their rifles and axes 
across their saddle bows, and their Bibles and spelling 
books in their saddle pockets; for they had diligently 
read their Bibles and they had accepted and practiced as 
a part of their religion, with that same fervid intensity

with which they performed all their religious duties, the 
wordsof the WiseMan: ‘‘ Take fast hold of instruction ; 
let her not go; for she is thy life.” And so it came to 
pass that wherever these men went they established a 
church, and at the same time they built hard by a school 
house. 
And so it is that history, in its imperishable rec- 
ords, must note the fact that the four prominent edu- 
cators of pioneer times in Tennessee, the Reverends 
Samuel Doak, Thomas B. Craighead, Hezekiah Balch 
and» Samuel Carrick, were all Presbyterian ministers, 
of Scotch-Irish descent, and all but one, to the honor of 
Princeton be it said, having been students at that 
college. ‘ 
« The first and greatest of these valiant and worthy 
pastors, Samuel Doak, established near Jonesboro, in the 
year 1777, a Presbyterian church, afterwards known as 
‘Salem Church” and an academy of learning, afterwards 
known as ‘‘ Washington College,” which are said to 
have been the first church and first institution of learn- 
ing established west of the crest of the Alleghanies.* 
The last named, Samuel Carrick, a scholarly and ardent 
young Pennsylvanian, who had settled in Tennessee in 
1788, was the first pastor of the First Presbyterian 
Church of this city, and the first President of Blount 
College. 
The early interest displayed in Tennessee in educa- 
tional matters is the more noteworthy when contrasted 
with the fact that North Carolina, of whose territory

Tennessee was a part until the year 1790, was, before the 
Revolution, in this respect, one of the most backward of 
all the American colonies. : 
We may surmise that its colonial government, which 
was always, I believe, of a pronounced Tory and reaction- 
ary character, had some sympathy with the jealous fears 
of popular education expressed in the year 1671 by Sir 
William Berkely, the Royal Governor of Virginia, in the 
words: ‘‘I thank God there are no free schools, nor 
printing; and I hope we shall not have these hundred 
years; for learning has brought disobedience and heresy 
and sects into the world, and printing has divulged them 
and libels against the best government. God keep us 
from both.” 
The Tennessee mountaineers shared not, however, in 
these views,‘ their feeling being rather expressed in the 
clause proposed, it is said, by Samuel Doak, at the con- 
vention held at Jonesboro, in 1784, to adopt a Constitu- 
tion for the revolutionary government of Franklin, 
which not only declared that ‘all kinds of useful learn- 
ing shall be encouraged by the commonwealth,” but 
specifically provided for the erection, near the center of 
the State, of a university, to be endowed by an appropri- 
ation of land and supported by public taxation, and also 
contemplated, at a subsequent day, public grammar 
schools in each county.’ 
But. although the spirit expressed in this clause did 
not then find permanent expression,* and although the

tion, in behalf of popular and higher education, including the Act 
establishing the University of North Carolina, at which so many

independent little government of Franklin, scarcely large 
enough to be termed a ship of State, was unable, even 
with John Sevier at the helm, to weather the storms of 
opposition that beat upon her, and foundered after four 
years of tempestuous cruising, nevertheless the idea thus 
expressed by” Doak, that learning is an excellent thing, 
and that education is the true corner stone of the State, 
still survived, and was one of the first to find expression 
after the Commonwealth had established its independent 
existence. 
In the year 1790, North Carolina, for the second time, 
ceded to the United States the area now comprising the 
State of Tennessee, and the cession having been accepted, 
the United States soon thereafter created a territorial 
government embracing the ceded district, with the 
imposing name of the ‘‘ Territory of the United States of 
America South of the River Ohio,” and George Wash- 
ington, then President of the United States, appointed 
as the Territorial Governor that polished gentleman 
and capable statesman, William Blount. 
In the fall of 1794, two years after Colonel James 
White, the original proprietor and worthy founder 
of Knoxville, whose character is said to have won for 
him the cognomen of ‘‘ the just,” had laid off the sixty- 
four lots comprising the original town, the Territorial 
Assembly met in its first regular session at Knoxville, 
the session commencing, as the clerk has recorded, with 
“‘a suitable and well-adapted prayer by the Rev. Mr. 
Carrick.” ® 
  
9. Annals of Tennessee, by J. G. M. Ramsey, p. 624. There 
had been a preliminary session of the House of Representatives, 
begun, at Knoxville, on the 4th Monday in Feb., 1794, at which ten 
persons were selected, from whom Congress subsequently chose 
five as the Legislative Council, or upper house, but no legislation 
was enacted, and the session begun at Knoxville on Aug. 25th, 1794, 
was the first regular session of both houses of the Assembly. See 
Ramsey’s Annals, pp. 621-3.

The members of that assembly were the pick and 
flower of the community, for people then still retained 
the old-fashioned idea, sounding so absurdly in these 
enlightened days, that the people should select their best 
and fittest men to represent them in their Legislative 
bodies. | 
‘These representatives, as did their constituents, knew, 
with a realizing sense, the value of education, and knew 
that in no community is it of such vital necessity as in a 
Republic, a government that can not be safely or perma- 
nently built except upon the corner stone of universal 
education. 
It may perchance also be that these legislators remem- 
bered that North Carolina in. ceding Tennessee to the 
United States had stipulated that the inhabitants of the 
ceded territory should ‘‘enjoy all the privileges, benefits 
and advantages set forth” in the ordinance of 1787, for 
the government of the Northwest Territory; one of 
the articles of compact declared in this celebrated ordi- 
nance being in these words: ‘‘ Religion, Morality and 
Knowledge being necessary to good government and the 
happiness of mankind, schools and the means of educa- 
tion shall forever be encouraged.” '' This, therefore, 
is the fundamental law of our land.. 
And so it was that on September 3rd, the territorial 
legislature, having made provisions for its judicial sys- 
tem and for the public revenue, granted a charter to 
Greeneville College, whose first President was the Rev- 
erend Hezekiah Balch, and whose centennial anniversary, 
under its present name of Greeneville and Tusculum 
College, was celebrated but a few weeks since. 
And hence it was that on the next day, William Cocke,

representative from Hawkins County, one of the strong- 
est men developed in those sturdy times, a man of great 
natural ability, and who, as orator, has had but few peers 
in the history of Tennessee, presented, as the record 
shows, ‘‘a Bill for the establishment of —— College 
in the vicinity of Knoxville,” the blank being subse- 
quently right worthily filled with the name of the hon- 
ored Governor, and on September 10th, 1794, the fifteenth 
day of the first regular session of the first Territorial 
Assembly, the bill chartering our university became a 
law, baptising her with the name of the ‘‘ President and 
‘Trustees of Blount College in the vicinity of Knoxville.” * 
By the preamble of its charter the College was dedi- 
cated to the promotion of ‘‘the happiness of the people 
at large, and especially of the rising generation” as a 
seminary of education where youth might be ‘‘ habit- 
uated to an amiable, moral and virtuous conduct, and 
accurately instructed in the various branches of useful 
science, and in the principles of the ancient and modern 
languages,” and was made a non-denominational institu-. 
tion by the provision that the Trustees ‘‘shall take 
effectual care that students of all denominations may 
and shall be admitted to the equal advantages of a liberal 
education, and to the emoluments and honors of the Col-- 
lege, and that they shall receive a like fair, generous and 
equal treatment during their residence therein,” a provis- 
ion which makes Blount College the first strictly non-de- 
nominational college established under the jurisdiction 
of the United States, according to the authority of Col. 
Moses White, the learned and scholarly historian of 
our University, whose sketch of the ‘Karly History 
of the University of Tennecsee” is the over-flowing

well-spring of information, from whith all later searchers 
must drink. 
That the legislature intended the establishment of 
this college to be no idle ceremony, but regarded the 
step which they were taking as fraught with highest 
significance to the young Commonwealth, is demon- 
strated by the character and standing of the seventeen 
men designated in the charter as Trustees: first, the 
Rev. Samuel Carrick as President, ‘liberal, tolerant 
and refined,” than whom none was more scholarly, none 
more worthy; then His Excellency, William Blount, Gov- 
ernor of the Territory, afterwards one of the first two 
United States Senators from Tennessee; three Honor- 
ables who were respectively the Secretary of the Terri- 
tory and its two Judges; General John Sevier, the hand- 
somest man in the Territory, dashing Indian fighter and 
_ popular hero, first Governor of Tennessee, first represent- 
ative in Congress from the Mississippi valley, and first in 
the hearts and memories of every East Tennesseean ; 
Colonel James White, (after which name we must write 
an interrogation point, for there were two Colonels 
of that name, and history leaves it doubtful whether 
ous Trustee was the James White who founded Krox- 
ville, or James White, the representative from Davidson 
County, although our University historian is firmly of 
the former opinion); another Colonel who was a 
representative in the Territorial Assembly ; then Colonel 
William Cocke, he of ever grateful memory, who had 
introduced the bill for the establishment of the College, 
and was afterwards Blount’s colleague in the Sen- 
ate of the United States; and nine other gentlemen 
  
14. I have endeavored in every instance to give credit to Col. 
White for information gleaned from his pages, but may in some 
instances have forgotten the quotation marks, and therefore state 
generally that whenever any particularly interesting bit of informa- 
tion is given concerning the early days of our University it may be 
known to be the result of his researches.

designated in the charter as ‘‘ Esquires,” then without 
official stations, yet bearing names no less honored in the 
community than those of their predecessors; among 
whom were Archibald Roane and Willie Blount, both 
subsequent Governors of the State, Charles McClung, 
a prominent Knoxville pioneer, who, according to 
Colonel W. A. Henderson, suggested the design for 
our Great Seal of State, and George Roulstone, deserv- 
ing of immortality as proprietor and editor of the first 
newspaper published in Tennessee, which appeared in 
1791, and was called ‘‘ The Knoxville Gazette,” although 
it then happened to be published at Rogersville. Four 
of these Trustees were subsequently United States Sena- 
tors from Tennessee, and three Governers of the State. 
The College began operations soon thereafter in a 
two-story wooden building erected by subscription, and 
which, as our historian tells us, stood near the northwest 
corner of the square upon which the First Baptist Church 
of this city now stands, about where Yeager’s drug store 
is now located, the entire square having been donated to 
the College by Col. James White, the founder of the 
town. * 
And there for many faithful years stoad this modest 
edifice, as a light house of learning standing on the very 
shores of civilization. 
The entire population of the Territory at that time, 
both free and slave, was less than the present population 
of our trio of Knoxville cities. Knoxville, though the 
capital of the Territory, was on the very outskirts of the 
settlement, with a vast waste of wilderness separating 
her from the Cumberland settlements, her nearest neigh- 
bors on the West. The town was then little more than

a cluster of houses,” surrounding the loop-holed and 
palisaded block house, a fair type of those places of 
refuge from the Indians, which have played so impor- 
tant a part in the history of our civilization, as it has 
advanced on its westward way. 
On all sides, were ‘‘endless leagues on leagues” of 
forests, haunted with wolves, bears and ‘‘the hawk-eyed 
and wolf-hearted Indian,” and interspersed only here and 
there with an occasional clearing, or a village surround- 
ing a biock-house. 
It was only three years before the founding of the 
College that Governor Blount had held at Knoxville his. 
famous treaty with the Cherokee Indians, at which, on 
an oak shaded knoll on the banks of the Holston, at the 
foot of what is now called Crozier street, the forty-one 
chiefs who were in attendance, were, in turn, with sol- 
elmn pomp and ceremonial, presented by the master of 
ceremonies to the Governor, arrayed in resplendent uni- 
form, and as tradition relates, seated upon a dais, and at 
which the polished Governor succeeded, through the daz- 
_ aling effect of his ceremonial display, or otherwise, in 
inducing the Indians to agree to perpetual peace, and to 
give up large bodies of their lands for a very trifling con- 
sideration, the agreement of peace, however, being ap- 
parently entered into by the Cherokees with the same 
facility with which it was almost immediately thereafter: 
broken—by both sides. 
It had been in the very year before the College was 
established that the Rev. Mr. Carrick, its first President, 
had been, at the imperious call of duty, forced to leave 
the body of his beloved wife to be buried by a faithful 
servant and neighborhood women, while he, with the 
other able bodied citizens of Knoxville, shouldered his 
rifle and marched to the top of the range of hills upon

which the Knoxville Colored College now stands, to 
intercept the threatened attack of over a thousand 
Creeks and Cherokees, under the leadership of John 
Watts, the half breed Cherokee Chief, who were only 
turned aside a few miles from the city by approaching 
daylight, having been delayed by a family named Cavet, 
who, with unreasonable obstinacy, objected to being 
scalped, and in a spirit of captious and pugnacious oppo- 
sition detained the Indians longer than had been ex- 
pected. Tothis, coupled with an amiable discussion that 
arose among the Indians as to whether or not they should 
massacre all the inhabitants of Knoxville or only the 
men, which was somewhat protracted, may be attributed 
the saving of the town, as its fighting men numbered 
only forty, and the oldest two of these had been left to 
guard the women and children in the block-house. " 
It was at the same session of the ‘Territorial 
Assembly at which Blount College was chartered, that 
Mr. Kelley and Mr. Beard, the representatives from 
Knox county, were granted ‘‘leave of absence to go 
on a scout against the Indians;” and at the close of 
the session Governor Blount, at the request of the 
members from the Mero District, ordered a guard of 
soldiers to accompany them across the Cumberland 
mountains. * 
The citizens of Knoxville and the surrounding coun- 
try at that time, were practically frontiersmen, strong, 
sinewy, home-spun, God-fearing men, and mainly, except 
a few traders at Knoxville, engaged in agriculture 
and hunting. 
It is probable that few youths found time in these 
days for an elaborate schooling or academic training, 
being only able to give to their education the intervals 
snatched from agricultural labors, although as we learn

from J. W. M. Brazeale, in his curious and moralizing 
book, ‘‘ Life as it Is,” it was not long before the manners 
and customs of the people underwent ‘‘a considerable 
change and many of them began to think of becoming a 
polished and fashionable people. School houses were 
erected all over the country, in which the children were 
instructed, not only in the various branches of literature, 
but, it was the business of school-teachers, at that day, to 
instruct the youth in the rules of politeness and morality, 
as well as those of literature and science; and it was 
rare to meet with a boy of thirteen years of age, who 
would not make a more genteel bow than is now made 
by our members of Congress. Children at that day 
were not permitted to join in the conversation of 
grow1-up people, but were taught to be listeners instead 
of talkers, and educated to respect hoary hairs, and treat 
the aged with politeness and veneration.” ” 
We can easily fancy that in these country schools, the 
emphasis was not laid too heavily on the instruction in 
literature and science, and that this boy of thirteen 
would probably cut a pretty poor figure in the final ex- 
aminations of our school children to-day; but yet, after 
all, there is something in the old time education in po- 
liteness, and the stern drill in the rudiments of educa- 
tion, which some old fashioned people yet think to be 
almost as good as a modern smattering in the sciences. 
We must also remember that while Blount College 
had been liberally endowed by the Territorial Legisla- 
ture with Trustees, it had been endowed with nothing 
else, the scanty revenues of the Commonwealth being 
probably needed for the expenses of the frugal govern- 
ment and more especially for purposes of common defence 
against the Indians, so that when Blount College and 
Greeneville College were chartered, the essential feature 
of Doak’s Franklin plan for a university, namely: that it

should be supported by public taxation, was omitted. 
Blount College, neither in its beginning, nor in its sub- 
sequent history, at any time, received any grant from the 
public revenues or any support from the government ;* 
nor did each family contribute either one peck of cornor 
twelve pence to its support as the citizens of New Eng- 
land taxed themselves to support Harvard College; it was 
always dependent for its support upon its tuition fees 
and voluntary contributions. 
So that, although, as our historian has gleaned from 
the earliest records of Blount College, the little ‘‘ College 
Book of Students and Accounts,” made of plain, unglazed 
paper, covered with a sheet of coarse wall paper, which 
dates from 1804, the price of tuition in Blount Col- 
lege was only $8.00 per session of five months, and that of 
boarding only ‘$25.00 per session,” it is probable that 
in a community with but little accumulated wealth, even 
this modest fee was sufficient to prevent the College from 
being attended by any except the favored sons of the 
wealthier classes living in Knoxville and its immediate 
vicinity; for we must not forget that the rival institutions 
of upper Hast Tennessee, Greeneville College and Wash- 
ington College, by which latter name Doak’s Academy 
was chartered by the State of Tennessee in 1795, both of 
which were located in the older and then more thickly 
settled portion of the State, drew unto themselves nearly 
all the college students from that section, and were much 
more largely attended than Blount College. 
‘We must not therefore fall into the error of regarding

tion from the University of North Carolina, adopted a resolution, 
in which it is said: ‘‘Tennessee, in her present condition and 
infant state, has not arrived at the period when her revenues will 
even authorize a loan to patronize the seminaries of learning already 
established within the limits of her own state.’’ Quoted in Phe- 
lan’s History of Tennessee, p. 234.

Blount College as an institution giving a general educa- 
tion to the mass of the people; it was on the contrary, a 
classical Academy for the sons of the comparatively 
wealthy, giving them a classical training and acquaint- 
ance with the polite and liberal arts. 
It is a noteworthy fact that our early Legislators, 
while they thus made abundant provision for the higher 
learning, failed to provide at the same time for that com- 
mon and general schooling which is the only sure found- 
ation upon which the higher education can be built. 
Not until many years after Blount College was estab- 
lished was there any public school system whatever in 
Tennessee, and none that was efficient until 1873, and 
even with the system that then existed, the college and 
its successors had no organic or ‘official connection, and 
from it derived no support. Our Legislators began 
their system of public education at the top, instead of 
first laying the sure foundations of common school edu- 
cation. 
It was this lack of an efficient common school 
system that up to the civil war was the greatest obstacle 
in the way of the more wide spread influence of the various 
colleges of the State, and caused them, one and all, to be, 
more than they should have been, institutions for the edu- 
cation solely of the more favored portion of the community. 
It isa fact that has often been remarked, that here lies, 
inthe main, the broad distinction between education in 
the North and in the South prior to the war ; for although 
in New England, Harvard College had been founded 
before public schools were established, yet the defect was 
almost immediately remedied, and only eleven years after- 
wards, Massachusetts laid the foundation of an efficient 
system of public schools which have supported the Col- 
lege from that good day until this; and so in the other 
New England States; and so generally throughout the 
North. In the South it has been otherwise. 
The explanation commonly given for this is that the
-P-A-G-E-26
— 21 — 
slave-holding system, by which the education of a large 
class of the population was rendered impolitic and for- 
bidden, and the education of the poorer whites thought 
unnecessary, naturally confined education largely to the 
aristocratic and slave-owning classes, and made these 
ruling classes feel it unnecessary to tax themselves for the 
education of the rest of the community. However, there 
is much weight to be attached to another explanation:” 
that the system of townships, as independent municipali- 
ties, existing in most of the Northern and especially in 
the New England States, by furnishing local organiza- 
tions through which public schools could be supported, 
and the absence of such municipalities in the South, 
with the more scattered character of its population, had 
much also to do with the matter. But whatever the 
explanation may be, the fact exists, and no one can fully 
understand the history of higher education in Tennessee 
who does not understand and remember this fact. The 
frequent apparent failure of the higher education in Ten- 
nessee to accomplish its ideals, has been largely due to 
the lack of common schools affording the necessary pri- 
mary education and the source whence the Colleges might 
draw their pupils. 
The students of Blount College, coming therefore 
mainly from the leisure class, who desired an acquaint- 
ance with the polite arts, it was but natural that its cur- 
riculum should have been the traditional training of the 
old fashioned classical seminary. 
We are confirmed in this surmise by the glimpse that 
is given us in the college record of the studies pursued 
by William E. Parker, who graduated October 18th, 1806, 
the first and only graduate of Biount College, who

is recorded by President Carrick as having been exam- 
ined and approved in Virgil, Rhetoric, Horace, Logic, 
Geography, Greek Testament, Lucien, Mathematics, 
Ethics and Natural Philosophy. * 
The Rev. Dr. Thomas W. Humes, in his address deliv- 
ered at the semi-centennial Anniversary of the settlement 
of Knoxville, has also preserved for us a picture of the 
commencement, exercises of Blount College, which gives 
us an idea of their Academic nature. They took place 
just east of the barracks, that is, on the present court 
house square, just about where Governor Sevier’s monu- 
ment now stands, in an unenclosed space, which was, as 
he tells us, preserved cleanly swept by the soldiers, and 
appropriated to the public exhibitions of the students of 
the College. ‘‘T’he stage, erected against the wall of 
the barracks, a room of which’ was devoted to the use of 
the students who were to be speakers of the day; the 
citizens passing by stately sentinels into the open area, 
where seats were preserved for their accommodation ; the 
silent throng standing with uncovered heads in prayer ; 
the voice of the Reverend President commanding, in 
scholastic phrase, the appearance of the youthful orator, 
and the bursts of martial music and the firing of cannon, 
with which the intervals of juvenile display were enli- 
vened, all constitute,” now as then, ‘‘a picture of early 
days rich to us in novelty.” * 
That this classic Academy, however, did indispensa- 
ble and precious work in training the minds of the rising 
generation, is attested by the list of its students, among 
which appear the names, honored in East Tennessee, of 
McClung, Hyndman, Rodgers, Campbell, Reese and 
others, one of the first names appearing in the record 
book being that of C. C. Clay, whom President Carrick 
noted as giving evidence of ‘‘good genius, orderly and

diligent,” whence we are not surprised to learn that he 
was afterwards Governor of Alabama and Senator in 
Congress from that State. * 
But let me not pass from the history of Blount Col- 
lege without noting the fact that her record book shows 
that for some time at least, young women were admitted 
as students, apparently upon equal terms with the young 
men, and as a matter of course, without any particular 
to-do being made thereat; and for the benefit of the 
future Alumnz of the University, be it noted that the 
first feminine names are those of Polly McClung, Bar- 
bara Blount, Jennie Armstrong and Mattie and Kittie 
Kain. * Of these, Barbara Blount was the charm- 
ing daughter of the courtly Governor, who had lived for 
sometime after he came to Knoxville upon a knoll 
between the University and the river, which must have 
been where the house of Dr. Dabney now stands. In 
honor of his daughter the knoll was named ‘Barbara 
Hill,” the name being afterwards given to the entire Col- 
lege Hill. It may also be read that the marks of merit 
used to indicate the standing of the girls were the words : 
“attentive,” ‘‘diligent” and ‘‘ingenious,” and that 
while some of the other girls attained unto one or two 
of these marks of distinction, the charming Barbara 
alone gained all the marks of merit, and was recorded as 
not only ‘‘attentive,” but also ‘‘diligent,” and also 
“ingenious,” so that it is no wonder, as our historian 
says, that she afterwards captured Major Gerieral Gaines 
of the United States army. 
And so passed the days of Blount College. It was not 
a great institution; it was not, perhaps, what we would 
to-day call a university. But we may be certain that the 
Rev. Mr. Carrick labored well and faithfully, and that 
even if he did not teach these young men and young 
women much science, he instructed them well in the

classics, and inspired them with a love of learning and . 
an ideal of lofty character. Blount College was an inde- 
pendent, though modest, academy of learning, in which 
the lamp of scholarship and culture was kept always 
brightly burning, shedding its beneficent rays over many 
a young and ambitious student; and so it should be 
remembered. 
And now I come to a chapter of our history, which, 
as a son of Tennessee, I would. need not be opened; a 
chapter, adding nothing to the fame of our State, in 
which is written the story of her dealings with our Uni- 
versity and other of the institutions of learning within 
her borders ; a chapter, which, unfortunately, cannot be 
omitted from their history. 
I recite this story, not in a spirit of reproach, but of 
tegret, seeking only to find and declare the truth, and, as 
one loving his State, believing that when she shall know 
the truth, she will hasten to repair whatever of wrong 
may have been committed. 
Prior to 1806, there had been pending for several 
years a legislative controversy between the United States 
and Tennessee, as to the ownership of the vast domain 
of vacant lands within the borders of the State. 
_ In the light of to-day we would have no hesitation in 
saying that the United States had decidedly the better 
‘ argument. Nevertheless, in 1806, Congress, no doubt 
largely in ‘‘a spirit of compromise,” but perhaps more 
as ‘“‘an act of grace,” ceded to Tennessee all the right 
and title of the United States to the lands lying within 
the State east and north of a certain specified line, run- 
ning across the western part of the State, and afterwards 
known as the Congressional Reservation Line, to take 
effect upon the release by Tennessee of all claims to the 
lands lying west and south of this line. ”

The State of Tennessee, in the same year, by an Act 
of Legislature, accepted the provisions of the Act of 
Congress, and in the following year the cession was duly 
perfected by a written instrument executed by our Sena- 
tors and Representatives in Congress, releasing all claims 
of the State to the lands west and south of the reserva- 
tion line. 
By virtue of this settlement Congress ceded to Ten- 
nessee, subject to certain claims reserved under the North 
Carolina cession, and to the lingering Indian titles, all 
the title of the United States to a magnificent empire, 
comprising about the eastern two-thirds of the State, 
reserving to the United States about the western third.” 
However, in thus yielding this vast territory, Con- 
gress, not unmindful of the solemn covenant ‘that 
schools and the means of education shall forever be 
encouraged,” which North Carolina has made a perpetual 
privilege to be enjoyed by the inhabitants of this soil, 
and in order to insure its faithful performance after the 
land should have passed from the United States, had pro- 
vided, in the Act of 1806, as one of the inseparable con- 
ditions of the cession, that Tennessee should set apart 
within the ceded territory one hundred thousand acres, to 
be located in one entire tract, on land to which the Indian 
title had been extinguished, lying within the limits that

had been reserved to the Cherokee Indians by North Car- 
olina in 1783, which should be sold for not less than two 
dollars an acre, and the proceeds invested for the use of 
two colleges to be established by the Legislature, one in 
East and one in West (now Middle) Tennessee; with a 
like tract for the joint use of academies to be created in 
each county of the State.” 
‘The cession act also contained the further express 
condition, which afterwards became of deepest signi- 
ficance to the institutions of learning, that the people 
residing ‘‘south of French Broad and Holston and west 
of Big Pigeon rivers, provided for by the Constitution 
of the State of Tennessee,” should be ‘‘secured in their 
respective rights of occupancy and pre-emption” and 
receive titles to the land claimed by them ‘‘at a price not 
less than one dollar per acre.” 
Out of these two conditions, apparently in no wise 
connected, there at once arose, by reason of a state of 
affairs existing at the time, as to which, by an unfortu- 
nate oversight, Congress had made no express provision, 
a conflict of interest, dire in its results, between the col- 
leges and academies, on the one hand, and the residents 
south of the French Broad and Holston on the other. 
And here begins a “strange eventful history ;” the 
story of these clashing interests, and the manner in 
which the State of Tennessee did, or did not, carry into 
effect the act of Congress; a story which is essential to 
a clear understanding of the subsequent history, not 
‘only of our University, but of higher education through- 
out the State. % 
The underlying cause of the trouble was the fact that

hundred and forty acres to every six square miles in the territory 
ceded, where existing claims would allow, to ‘‘ be appropriated for 
the use of schools for the instruction of children forever.’ How- 
ever, as this provision was on an entirely different basis from that 
in reference to colleges and academies, no further reference will be 
made thereto.
-P-A-G-E-34
—27 — 
the territory designated as that in which the college and 
academy tracts should be located, was one and the same 
as that in which there had also been made provision for 
the rights of occupancy and pre-emption. 
The two educational tracts, it will be remembered, 
were to be located in that specific portion of the ceded 
territory lying within the lands reserved by North Car- 
olina in 1783 for the Cherokees, to which the Indian title 
had already been extinguished. 
This Cherokee reservation had extended so near to 
where we are assembled to-day, that I doubt not but 
that David with his sling might from here have cast a 
pebble into its bounds; for it had embraced all that 
expanse of country, unsurpassed in loveliness, which lies 
spread out, in varied panorama, before the spectator look- 
ing southeastwardly from our college campus ; extending 
from the opposite shore of the stately river that rolls at 
the foot of College Hill, past the wooded hills and fertile 
valleys, past the beautiful Chilhowee range, to the very 
cloud-capped crest of the Great Smoky Mountains; 
stretching northeastwardly to the rushing waters of the 
Big Pigeon; southwestwardly to the extreme limits of 
the State.” 
This, then, was the area in which the college and 
academy tracts were to be located. It was arich domain, 
lying south and east of the French Broad and Tennessee 
rivers, and extending from the Big Pigeon to the Little 
  
81. This “ reservation,’ by which North Carolina, in violation 
of her treaty of 1777 and her act of 1778, attempted to greatly nar- 
row the Indian boundaries, without so much as saying ‘‘ by your 
leave,’’ had included, in addition to lands in the western part of 
North Carolina,” the entire southeastern portion of the present State 
of Tennessee, lying west of the Big Pigeon river, south of the French 
Broad, and south and east of the Tennessee, from its junction with 
the French Broad above Knoxville, to the southern boundary of the 
State. Actsof North Carolina, 1783, ch. 2, sec. 3.

to the Indian boundary line, will be found in Appendix C.

    ‘Tennessee, containing perhaps eight hundred thousand 
acres, with many rich lowlands and fertile valleys. At 
least one-half of its entire acreage was peculiarly well 
adapted for cultivation, embracing some of the most fer. 
tile lands in the State, while the remainder was, in the 
main, mountain land unsuited for farming, though rich 
in every mineral wealth. ”   
And now as to the residents in this territory south of © 
French Broad and Holston. How came they in this 
region? What were their rights of pre-emption and 
occupaticy ? and how were these rights acquired ? 
As early as 1777, by that treaty near the Long Island 
of the Holston, by which North Carolina had conceded | 
to the Cherokees nearly all that portion of Tennessee 
lying southwest of Jonesboro, a concession which was 
confirmed by solemn legislative enactment in the follow- 
ing year, and emphasized, as to this territory, by the 
“reservation” of 1783, this fair region has been within 
the limits of the Cherokee hunting ground, in which the 
whites were forbidden to settle or in any manner intrude. © 
Nevertheless, unfortunately for the institutions of 
_ learning, so fair had been this rich garden, so inviting 
its valleys, so enticing its prospects, that in spite of‘ 
treaties and legislative prohibitions and the hundred-fold 
greater perils from the Indians, its charms had proven 
an irresistible attraction to an army of settlers, who had 
invaded this territory, encroaching farther and farther 
upon the Indians, conquering the soil from them, acre by 
acre, at the cost of countless privations, often, indeed, of 
life itself. . 
  
32. This area embraced the greater part of the present county: 
of Blount, most of Sevier, and portions of Loudon, Knox, Jefferson 
and Cocke counties. It is the section known in our State legisla:: 
tion as the district south of the French Broad and Holston. 
The estimate of the proportion of arable lands was given me by 
Gen. J. C. J. Williams, who-is thoroughly acquainted with thi 
section of country.
-P-A-G-E-36
—29 — 
In vain had the Congress of the Confederation, in 
1785, by the treaty at Hopewell, again declared this 
region to be within the Indian boundaries, and that all 
settlers should ‘‘forfeit the protection of the United 
States” and be subject to punishment by the Indians. 
Encouraged by the revolutionary government of Frank- 
lin, ‘‘whose leaders stood distinctly for the idea of en- 
croachment,” * and whose two quasi treaties of Dumplin 
Creek and Chota Ford, although never recognized by 
North Carolina, and repudiated by the United States, 
afforded, perchance, some moral, if not legal, justifica- 
tion for the settlements made on the faith of those treaties 
before the provisions of the treaty of Hopewell became 
known, the settlers steadily extended their possessions, 
moving their habitations ever farther and farther south- 
ward, nearer and nearer to the Cherokee towns that lay 
along the southern banks of the Little Tennessee. 
In vain did Congress, in 1788, issue a proclamation 
forbidding all intrusions upon this territory and enjoining 
the departure of persons already there. Equally inef- 
fectual were the threats and ravages of the exasperated 
Indians, who continually complained as the settlements 
constantly encroached upon their hunting grounds, and , 
took sullen revenge upon these settlers and other whites 
as well, in marauding attacks and midnight slaughter. 
_ Nor did the stringent provisions against new en- 
croachments contained in the treaty of the Holston, by 
which, in 1791, Governor Blount succeeded in extin- 
guishing the Indian title to the lands north of Maryville, 
prove more effective. 
Still the boundary was overleaped ; still the invasion 
continued southward, and it was not until the treaty held 
  
33. Quoted from a valuable paper by Prof. Stephen B. Weeks 
on ‘‘General Joseph Martin and the War of the Revolution in the

Association for 1893, p. 444.

near Tellico in 1798 that the large number of settlers 
who had taken up lands southwest of Maryville, in the ~ 
forks of the Tennessee and Little Tennessee rivers, 
ceased to be within the Cherokee boundaries. * 
Such was the nature of the settlements south of the © 
French Broad and Holston. . 
It is not my purpose: to-day, however, to pass moral 
judgment as to the right and the wrong in the conflict 
between the settlers and the Indians ; perhaps this would 
be impossible, from the lack now of sufficient data upon 
which to base such judgment. There was undoubtedly 
much of right, much of wrong, on both sides. 
While it is impossible to excuse the constant violations 
of treaties, yet when I remember that these settlers were, 
in the main, honest men, seeking homes for themselves 
and their families, I cannot but feel that the original 
wrorg had been done—a wrong not only to these settlers, 
but to Civilization—when in deference to a highly tech- 
nical legal fiction, it had been conceded, in the first 
instance, that the Indians had gained'a title, which 
others were bound to respect, to vast areas of land out- 
side of their actual habitations and improvements, simply 
by roving over them in their hunting, fishing and warring 
expeditions, and that they were entitled to reserve these 
domains for these purposes, to the exclusion of home- 
seekers and tillers of the soil—a legal fiction which, in 
that inevitable conflict between Civilization and Savagery, 
in which Civilization shall ever prevail, should yield to the 
claims of those who desire to take up their habitations 
upon the land, to cultivate and improve it.” Hunting 
grounds must ever give way to homes. 
I can well understand that these men felt, as they 
  
84. See as to these various treaties and enactments, historical 
note, Appendix C, 
85. Since the whites had begun to settle in this section of the — 
country, the Cherokees had had no towns or fixed habitations north 
of the Little Tennessee river. 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
—31— 
gazed pon this fair land from which it was sought to 
exclude them, that they had, by hasty pens, been cheated 
out of that which had been their birthright. 
But whatever the merits of the struggle between set- 
tlers and Indians, certain it is that as to other citizens of 
the State the settlers had earned a prior right to these 
lands. Every acre had been ‘‘cleared by the axe and 
held by the rifle,” those ‘two national weapons of the 
American backwoodsman, in whose use he has never 
been excelled ;” every acre had been bought with drops 
of blood. 
And hence, it was but just and fitting that when 
those lands were freed from the Indian title, and became 
subject to lawful disposition, the State, in putting them 
upon the market, should officially recognize this prior 
claim and give the settlers that same right of preference 
which North Carolina had in 1777 given to the actual 
occupant of the soil in selling her western lands,” and 
which has since been recognized both by Tennessee and 
the United States in every disposition made of any body 
of their public lands,” the right, in legal parlance, of pre- 
emption, or literally, of prior purchase, that is, the right 
of the occupant who has settled upon land before the Gov- 
ernment has made it subject to purchase, to be given a 
first chance to buy it upon the terms prescribed, when it 
is put upon the market. 
So manifestly had the settlers south of the rivers 
earned, by sweat and blood, a prior claim to the fields 
which they had cleared, and the cabins which they had

raised and guarded, that it is little wonder it had been 
provided as one of the fundamental ‘‘ Declaration of 
Rights” in the Constitution of 1796, under which Ten- 
nessee was admitted into the Union, that they were 
entitled to the right of pre-emption in the territory 
which they occupied. * 
And so it was that in 1806, no disposition having as 
yet been made of these lands, no title vested in the 
settlers, no payment made by them to either State or 
National Government,® Congress by that same cession 
Act, in which it had required the college and academy 
tracts to be located in the territory south of French 
Broad and Holston, had also provided that the settlers 
should be secured in their pre-emption rights and receive 
titles to their occupant claims, at not less than one 
dollar an acre. 
And now there fell upon the State the double duty of 
  
88. Tennessee Constitution of 1796, Declaration of Rights, 
Article XI., sec. 88: ‘‘That the people residing south of French 
Broad and Holston, between the rivers (Little) Tennessee and the 
Big Pigeon, are entitled to the rights of pre-emption and occupancy 
in that tract.” 
North Carolina had previously, in her Act ceding Tennessee to 
the United States, reserved the right of the General Assembly 
passing the Act to open an office for the entry of pre-emptions by 
the people then ‘‘residing south of the French Broad, between 
the rivers (Little) Tennessee and Pigeon,’’ but the Assembly seems 
to have adjourned without opening the office. (North Carolina 
Acts, 1789, chap. 3, sec. 1, sub-sec. 10; Scott’s Laws, vol. 1, p. 408.) 
39. There were some instances entirely distinct from the oceu- 
pant claims, in which persons had paid for and obtained grants 
from North Carolina for lands lying south of French Broad and 
Holston, but the Tennessee Legislature made provision for such 
persons by providing that other grants should issue to them, 
instead, in other parts of the State. (Acts of 1806, ch. 1, sec. 27; 
Whitney’s Land Laws, p. 131; Scott’s Laws, vol. 1, p. 901.) 
See historical note, Appendix D, for various Tennessee enact- 
ments, from 1799 to 1805, inclusive, in reference to the occupant 
claims south of the French Broad and Holston. :

setting apart within this territory the two educational 
tracts which were to be sold for not less than two dollars 
an acre, and the preservation of the pre-emption rights 
of the occupants at not less than one dollar an acre. 
The task of the State would have been easy of perform- 
ance had it not been for the one fact, so disastrous in its 
results to our institutions of learning, so injurious to the 
cause of higher education in Tennessee, that, already 
in 1806, so thickly had this region been settled that it 
was impossible to lay off two tracts of one hundred 
- thousand acres which should not include lands already 
occupied, and, in fact, be largely composed of them.” 
It being thus inexorably demanded by the logic of 
the situation that the college and academy tracts should 
be chiefly composed of occupant lands, the question of 
the price which the State should fix upon them became 
one of vital importance to the institutions of learning, 
for on this would mainly depend the amount which they 
would receive from their respective funds. 
Congress, it will be remembered, had merely fixed a 
minimum of one dollar per acre on the occupant lands. * 
No legislation, either State or National, had ever defi- 
nitely determined the price to be charged; this was now 
the task of the State. 
Complicating the situation was the fact that the min- 
  
40. In a report made to the Tennessee Legislature, November 
Ist, 1821, by the Committee on Education, it is stated that this 
territory was ‘‘ already in the possession of occupants.’’ (Printed 
in Nile’s Weekly Register, vol. 21, p. 299.) Merriam says that all 
of this land which was fit for cultivation, and to which the Indian 
title had been extinguished, had been settled prior to 1806. (Higher 
Education in Tennessee, p. 39.) 
We may be certain that as the Act of Congress allowed pre- 
emptions of 640 acres to each occupant, not exceeding his previous 
claim, the larger part of the arable land in this district was 
already subject to pre-emption claims in 1806. 
41. Merriam, usually very accurate, erroneously states that the 
Act provided that these lands shoutd be sold at not ‘more’? than 
one dollar per acre. (History of Higher Education, p. 38.)
-P-A-G-E-43
—34— 
imum of two dollars an acre, placed by Congress upon 
the college and academy tracts, was an unusually high 
price in those days; in fact, it is doubtful if much of 
the lands could have been then sold at that rate. Even 
one dollar per acre was, generally speaking, a high 
price. ” 
It ‘was also manifest that Congress had not had in 
mind the contingency that the educational tracts would 
include the occupant lands, and had expected that the 
occupants would receive their lands at a less price than 
the minimum fixed upon the college and academy tracts ; 
otherwise the difference in the two provisions was mean- 
ingless. 
To discharge the trust confided in the State with 
equal justice to all, and with due regard to all conflict- 
ing equities, became now a task of no little delicacy and 
difficulty. As that charming and diplomatic old knight, 
Sir Roger de Coverley, used to say, when called upon to 
settle a dispute between his neighbors, ‘‘much might be 
said on both sides.” : 
However, in view of the extreme hardship which 
would have resulted to the settlers from strict, literal 
  
42. In the report of the Committee on Education, cited in note 
40 supra, it is stated that in 1806 one dollar per acre ‘‘ was consid- 
ered a high average price.’’ 
Up to this time no public land had ever been sold in Tennessee 
at more than fifty cents an acre. The price fixed by the North 
Carolina Act in 1777 was twenty-five cents. (North Carolina Acts 
of 1777, 2nd seas., chap. 1, sec. 4; Scott’s Laws, vol. 1, p. 159.) 
The Act of 1783 fixed fifty cents an acre, payable in specie certifi- 
cates, etc. (North Carolina Acts of 1783, chap. 2, sec. 10; Scott’s 
Laws, p. 269), and by the cession Act of 1806, Congress had author- 
ized Tennessee to perfect titles based on warrants issued under this 
Act to countless acres in the State. 
When, in 1799, Tennessee had contemplated opening her own 
land offices, she had fixed the price of lands at twenty-five cents 
anacre. (Acts of 1799, ch. 24; Scott’s Laws, vol. 2, p. 264.) : 
The public lands of the United States were, however, at that © 
time selling at two dollars an acre. “
-P-A-G-E-44
—35— 
compliance with the terms of cession,“ and the grave 
doubt whether the lands could have been sold at the price 
fixed for marry years, it cannot be denied that the State, 
being thus confronted with a condition of affairs for 
which no express provision had been made, was justified 
in departing from the letter of the cession, provided she 
should in some other manner give effect to its spirit and 
provide for the objects to be attained. 
The course, however, which was adopted by the 
Legislature, was extraordinary, and without apparent 
justification, even if somewhat palliated by tardy and 
partial efforts at compensation made in later years. For 
on the very day on which the Legislature accepted the 
Act of Congress and solemnly enacted that ‘‘the provis- 
ions thereof be carried into effect,” it directed that the 
college and academy tracts should be located ‘‘in such 
manner and in such places” as to contain, respectively, 
one hundred thousand acres of land ‘‘actually claimed 
by occupancy, or fit for cultivation and improvement,” 
and provided that the occupant claimants of lands, 
including those within these two tracts, should receive 
grants for their lands at the rate of one dollar for each 
acre, payable in ten annual installments, without inter- 
est, beginning in 1808. All the remainder of the land 
in the district south of French Broad and Holston, lying 
  
43. To have fixed the price of all the lands in the district at 
two dollars an acre would have been an unnecessary hardship on 
all the settlers ; to have fixed it at two dollars within the college 
and academy tracts, and at one dollar outside of these two tracts, 
would have been, in addition, great injustice as between the settlers 
within these tracts and those outside. It was furthermore imprac- 
ticable to have fixed the price of the occupant lands at one dollar, 
and then to have laid off the college and academy tracts in scat- 
tered parcels, aggregating 200,000 acres; for even if so much 
unoccupied lands could have been found, it would have been 
impossible to sell them for anything like two dollars an acre, the 
lands already taken up by the occupants constituting, undoubtedly, 
far the most valuable portions, at least for farming, practically the 
only purpose for which land had a value in those days.
-P-A-G-E-45
—- 36 — 
outside of the two educational tracts, was reserved to 
the State and to be sold for her own use and benefit; no 
provision was made for the sale of any lands in the dis- 
trict other than those claimed by occupants. “ 
The Legislature thus provided for the sale of only 
such part of the educational tracts as was claimed by 
occupants, and for the sale of this part at one-half of 
the minimum price fixed by Congress and upon long 
time, retaining unto herself all the remainder of the 
district. Thus, at one stroke, the college and academy 
fund was cut down to less than one-half. There is, as I 
have said, no apparent justification for this legislation. 
The State had, under the Congressional cession, 
received title to a vast area of land to which its previous 
claim had been, to say the least, of doubtful validity ; 
and having received the benefits of the cession, it had 
become bound, not only legally, but morally, to faith- 
fully discharge every obligation and trust imposed upon 
it as a condition of the cession. : 
While it must be conceded that the State had a right, 
at least morally, to vary the details by which the pro- 
visions of the cession were to be carried out, still in 
varying those details she was bound to do so in such 
manner as to accomplish the purpose of the cession. 
She might depart from the letter, but the spirit she was 
under solemn obligation to fulfill. 
‘The object and purpose of Congress had been to pro- 
vide from the sale of these lands south of the French 
Broad and Holston a fund of four hundred thousand 
dollars for the use of the colleges and academies, 
Whatever the details by which this was to be done, this

Land Laws of Tennessee, p. 341; Edward Scott’s Laws of the 
State of Tennessee, vol. 1, p. 915. It was not until 1819 that the 
lands in the district south of French Broad and Holston were 
opened to general purchase by others than occupants, and then at 
the price of fifty cents an acre.

was the object sought. The State received the land 
charged with this trust. If, out of sympathy for the 
settlers or from practical difficulties, she chose to depart 
from the method of compliance provided, to the detri- 
ment of the colleges and academies, she was bound to 
make good to them its provisions in some other way; 
otherwise it was her duty strictly to enforce the Act. 
She did not have the right to be charitable to the settlers 
at the expense of the institutions of learning; the char- 
ities of a State, like those of an individual, should be 
paid out of her own pocket. 
Especially was this true when, under the terms of 
this same cession, the State had received a large acreage 
of land in this very district south of French Broad and 
Holston ample to have satisfied the claims of the insti- 
tutions of learning, as well as of the settlers, to say 
nothing of the vast area which the State received out- 
side of this district, of which she retained the benefit. 
View the matter in what light we will, we are com- 
pelled to the conclusion that the State had no right, either 
legal or moral, to sell a single acre within the college 
and academy tracts at less than two dollars an acre, 
unless she at the same time set apart for the colleges 
and academies such an amount of the land out of the 
territory ceded her as was necessary, at whatever price 
she might fix upon it, to realize the fund intended for 
colleges and academies. 
A simple and just solution of all the difficulty would 
have been to fix the price of all lands in the district 
south of French Broad and Holston at one dollar an 
acre, and to have made the college and academy tracts 
each consist of two hundred thousand acres instead of 
one hundred thousand acres, “ 
I have thus far dealt generally with this subject. I 
now come to that time when the State legislation begins 
to affect specifically the fortunes of our own University.

‘The prospect of government aid had been most entic- 
ing. Small wonder it is that the General Assembly, 
after its acceptance of the cession, received memorials 
and petitions from the people of various counties and 
each of the colleges in East Tennessee, praying for the 
establishment of the eastern college. Blount county 
sought its location at Maryville; Hawkins county at 
Rogersville; and Greeneville College also desired the 
fund. * 
And so the trustees of Blount College, allured by the 
glittering rainbow of promise, were constrained to agree, 
by a resolution unanimously adopted, that if the Legis- 
lature would establish the eastern college within two 
miles of Knoxville they would surrender their corporate 
existence and transfer their funds to it.” 
To the trustees of Blount College, which had de- 
pended for so many years upon the uncertain assistance 
of the public, the assured support thus guaranteed, in 
spite of the diminution of the fund, must have seemed a 
vision as grateful as the green oasis to the desert traveler; 
and it is not surprising that they were easily deceived 
by a mirage and found the prospect that at first seemed 
so fair and beautiful, as they hastened toward it, gradu- 
ally vanish into nothingness. 
The Legislature accepted the proposition of the 
Blount College trustees, and in 1807 chartered the new 
college under the name of the ‘‘President and Trustees 
of the East Tennessee College ;” endowed it with that 
part of the Congressional fund designed for Hast Ten- 
nessee; appointed thirty trustees, of whom Archibald 
Roane and John Sevier had been in the original board ; 
repealed the charter of Blount College; transferred to 
the Kast Tennessee College all its corporate funds, prop-

erty and effects, thus merging the two into one; and 
located the new college ‘‘on ten acres of land within 
two miles of Knoxville, conveyed in trust for the use of 
said college by Moses White, at a place called the Rocky 
or Poplar Spring,” which was near the old Branner 
residence in Shieldstown; providing, however, that the 
buildings of Blount College should be temporarily used 
and that its trustees should remain in control of affairs 
until the new trustees might take charge. “ 
At the same time the Legislature also began with a 
flourish of trumpets to provide for the care of the fund 
to be realized for the support of the colleges, and ap- 
pointed a commission of six, among whom were James 
Park and John Overton, to superintend its management 
and investment.” 
‘The next year, the Trustees of Fast Tennessee Col- 
lege met and organized, retaining the Rev. Mr. Carrick 
as president.” 
And here, saith our Chronicler, feminine names dis- 
appear from the college record. 
During this year Mr. Carrick was stricken with paraly- 
sis, and passed into his well-earned rest, dying when the 
new college was in the first flush of hopeful anticipation, 
before the dark days of disappointment had come. He 
now sleeps beneath the myrtle and the elms in the his- 
toric graveyard of the First Presbyterian Church of this 
city, where also rest William Blount and James White, 
with the mysterious and unexplained inscription upon 
his head-stone: ‘‘Samuel C. Z. R. Carrick,” the three 
intermediate letters not being, so far as history shows, 
a part of his name. His head-stone recites that he first 
planted the Presbyterian religion in the wilds of Ten-

nessee, that he was the founder and first pastor of the 
First Presbyterian Church of this city, and the first 
president of Kast Tennessee College, and bears the ap- 
propriate lines: ‘‘T'ruly the last end of the good man is 
Peace. How calm his exit! Night dews fall not more 
gently to the ground; Nor weary, worn out winds expire 
so soft.” 
From this time until after the Civil War the history 
of the College is a story of struggle and repeated disap- 
pointment; of heroic effort on the part of successive 
presidents, conspicuous among whom are Sherman; 
Coffin, Estabrook and Cook; of alternating periods of 
advance and retreat. 
Yet in spite of obstacles and disappointments the 
college, conscious of its high mission, kept ever bravely 
onward. The record of those days is, on the whole, one 
of triumph, for it shows that the light of the higher 
learning can never be entirely extinguished, and that, 
though often temporarily enshrouded in gloom, the mist 
will at length pass away and the light shine again 
serene and clear. Education, like truth, though crushed 
to earth, will rise again triumphant; for it is one of the 
elemental and vital forces that shall and will prevail. 
The history of. the period before the war was largely 
taken up with the effort to realize the land grant fund, 
and to overcome the popular prejudice which was engen- 
dered against the college on account of this struggle. 
For the settlers were not content with having had 
the minimum price fixed upon their lands, and with the 
additional concession of long time payments, and there 
now commenced a bitter struggle that lasted for many 
trying years, beginning with their repeated and success- 
ful efforts to have the times of payment extended, grow- 
ing into a request for remission of part of the interest,

and culminating in a demand for the release of part, if 
not all, of the principal itself.” 
The long history of delay began, as if by an irony of 
fate, on that same day in 1807 on which the Legislature 
completed the organization of the college and appointed 
‘the commissioners of the college fund. On that day, at 
the first kindling discontent, the Legislature took the 
initial step in yielding to public clamor, by extending for 
‘one year the time for payment of all purchase money 
installments on all lands south of French Broad and 
Holston, * this being repeated by the next General As- 
‘sembly and a somewhat longer extension given. * 
Before the close of 1809, the settlers having become 
‘more imperious in their demands, the yielding Legisla- 
ture took the next step in dissipating the educational 
fund, by postponing indefinitely the principal of all the 
installments, and also somewhat extending the time for 
  
52. The Committee on Education, whose report is cited in note 
-40 supra, state that these lands were ‘‘ necessarily sold to the occu- 
pants upon extensive credits, the interest of which has been but 
partially collected, producing in the meantime all the vexations 
and costs, both to the government and people, that in the United 
States are known to exist, when the people are debtors to their 
government.”” . 
That the United States also has been obliged to indulge its. 
needy debtors by suspending forfeiture of lands for delay in making 
payments, see, for example, 5 U. S. Stat. at Large, pp. 261, 509 
and 555.

the payment of interest;* this legislation also being 
substantially repeated by the General Assembly of 1811.* 
Again, so far as this legislation affected the college 
and academy tracts, the State was indulging her sympa- 
thetic inclinations at the expense of the institutions of 
learning. 
It was during these days that the Legislature, in 
order to relieve the necessities of the College, which had 
not yet been able to open its doors, with an exceeding 
and ever memorable generosity, allowed the trustees, in 
lieu of the funds to which they were entitled, the privi- 
lege of establishing a lottery for the benefit of the 
College, at their own expense, and appointed Hugh 
Lawson White, Robert Craighead and others as trustees 
for that purpose. But in spite of the enticing adver- 
tisement of the trustees, showing that there were but 
little more than two blanks to each prize in the lottery, 
and appealing to the public to subscribe to the tickets 
‘to aid the funds of a seminary of education where the 
youth * * * may have their minds prepared in such 
manner as will make them ornaments to their families 
and useful to their country,” sufficient tickets were not 
sold and the lottery had to be abandoned.”

57. White’s Early History of the University, p. 20. In early 
days in Tennessee a lottery was a favorite method by which to raise 
funds for needy and deserving institutions, private as well as public, 
and individuals as well. Thus, for example, in 1824, at a single 
session of the Legislature, authority was given for lotteries for the 
purposes of building Masonic halls in Columbia and Franklin, of 
completing a public road from Jonesborough to the North Carolina.
-P-A-G-E-56
— 43 — 
About this time, also, a pleasing variety was given 
to the legislation by remitting altogether the interest 
that had fallen due in 1810 and 1811, on account of the 
neglect of the Legislature to appoint any one to receive 
it, thereby, as it was recited, having prevented the citi- 
zens from making payments.“ It being afterwards 
discovered, however, that certain energetic citizens had 
paid this remitted interest, nevertheless, it was promptly 
refunded to them.” 
Indefinite postponement of the principal and exten- 
sion of the interest now became the order of the day, 
and was re-enacted in 1813,” with the additional feature 
of remitting all interest which should accrue during the 
interval of postponement, this legislation, in turn, being 
repeated in 1815." Further extensions were made on 
both principal and interest by the Legislature of 1817.” 
In 1819 the Legislature for the first time provided for 
the sale of such lands as were not claimed by occupants, 
and authorized the general taking up of all vacant lands 
south of the French Broad and Holston at fifty cents 
  
line, and of benefiting Thos. White and Jno. McCracken and their 
respective creditors, and provisions were made in reference to a 
lottery for the erection of a hospital in Nashville. (Acts of 1824,

an acre.” As this applied, with the rest, to such lands 
in the college and academy tracts as had not already 
been granted to occupants, it was, as to these lands, a 
further reduction below the minimum price, which would 
well-nigh complete the ruin of the college and academy 
funds. Partly, perhaps, for this reason, the Legislature 
provided that the Act should not take effect without the 
assent of Congress, an assent which seems never to have 
been given. ; 
In this same year the principal due on lands was again 
indefinitely postponed, likewise interest extended. 
In view of this legislation it is not astonishing—-in 
spite of the privilege that had been given the settlers in 
most of these enactments of making payments on the 
interest at any time they might choose, and even on the 
principal itself, if they insisted upon it—that East Ten- 
nessee College was, from sheer poverty, never able to 
open its doors until the year 1820, when it united with 
the Hampden-Sidney Academy, that had been chartered 
at Knoxville in 1806 in pursuance of the same land grant 
Act, and which had been put into successful operation 
at Knoxville in 1817, and kept open by its able president, 
Mr. Sherman, for four years, supported by subscription. 
The college and academy, however, though united, each 
retained its own board of trustees and the control of its 
own funds. ®

The lax management of the educational fund and the 
deplorable condition into which it had fallen is forcibly 
illustrated by the message of Governor Joseph McMinn 
to the General Assembly, in 1821, in which he says: 
“Tt is incontestably true that even the officers of govern- 
ment are ignorant of many of the most material facts 
from which alone a tolerable estimate of the available 
character of the fund can be obtained. We all know 
that two hundred thousand acres of land, south of 
French Broad and Holston rivers, at the price of one 
dollar per acre, was appropriated to the establishment 
and support of colleges and academies; but in what 
manner collections on the sale of those lands have been 
made, and to what amount; how much of the principal 
or interest has been voluntarily or otherwise paid; or 
how much still remains due or to become due, is scarcely 
known to any individual within the State, and perhaps 
it would not be practicable for the Legislature to inform 
themselves satisfactorily on the various points connected 
with the subject by reports drawn from any department 
of the government. * * * Isubmit to you whether 
the desire of conforming your acts to the rules of con- 
stant right will not urge the expediency of devising 
some plan of acquiring a full knowledge of the manner 
in which the whole business has been conducted, from 
its first origin, so as to exhibit the true state in which it 
may be now found.” 
In pursuance of this recommendation the Senate 
adopted a joint resolution, introduced by Aaron V. 
Brown, for the appointment of a Select Committee to 
make an investigation of the matters embraced in the 
Governor’s message,” but the House refused to concur 
in this resolution, and there the matter dropped, in

spite of the fact that in the fall of that same year 
Governor McMinn’s recommendation was repeated by 
his successor, Governor William Carroll.” The Legis- 
lature, instead, passed another Act for the relief of the . 
settlers, repeating the old story of indefinite postpone- 
ment of the principal and extension of the interest ;” 
only to be again repeated in 1822.” 
In the midst of these dark days, however, there came 
one which Tennessee should note upon its calendar as a 
golden day in its dealings with the colleges. 
‘The president and trustees of the University of North 
Carolina, to whom the State of North Carolina had 
issued warrants for many thousand acres of land in 
Tennessee, founded upon military services that had been 
performed by certain officers and soldiers of the Conti- 
nental line of North Carolina, who had died, leaving no 
heirs in the United States, had presented a memorial to 
the Tennessee Legislature, praying that grants might 
issue upon these warrants, and that all their lands in 
Tennessee might be exempt from taxation, offering to 
give a fair equivalent for such exemption. 
‘There was, however, grave doubt as to the validity 
of these warrants,” and the Legislature directed the

by North Carolina in her cession of 1796, and the compact between 
North Carolina and Tennessee in 1804, ratified by Congress in 1806, 
and supplemented in 1818, it was the duty of Tennessee, in general, 
to issue grants upon land warrants issued by North Carolina for 
services rendered by her Revolutionary soldiers and officers. (See

appointment of two commissioners to investigate and 
adjust the claim of the University of North Carolina, 
authorizing them to enter into an agreement with the 
University concerning the warrants and exemption from 
taxation, which, it was provided, should be binding on 
" the State.” 
Governor Carroll having appointed Jenkins Whiteside 
and James Trimble as commissioners, they, on August 
26th, 1822, entered into a compact with the University of 
North Carolina, directing that grants should issue upon 
its warrants, and agreeing that all lands owned or 
acquired by the University within Tennessee should be 
exempt from all taxes until January 1, 1850; the Univer- 
sity, in return for this exemption from taxation and the 
settlement of the controversy, agreeing to transfer sixty 
thousand acres of its land warrants to two public semi- 
naries, designated by the commissioners, ‘‘as a fund for 
the support of education in said seminaries,” one-third, 
or twenty thousand acres, to East Tennessee College, 
and two-thirds, or forty thousand acres, to Cumberland 
College, which had been designated as the Western 
recipient of the land grant fund,“ the University further 
agreeing to assign to the two colleges, in like manner, 
  
Historical Note, Appendix B.) But Tennessee contended, apparently 
with justice, that after the death of the parties entitled to the war- 
rants North Carolina had no right to issue them to other persons, 
even so deserving as the trustees of her State University, and that 
grants ought not to issue on such warrants, or if issued, that they 
would vest in the State of Tennessee. (See recitals in Compact, 
Whitney’s Land Laws, p. 481.) 
73. Acta of 1820, chap. 3, p. 8, passed August 14, 1822; Whit- 
ney’s Land Laws, p. 480. The commissioners were especially 
authorized to direct. how these warrants should be disposed of, and 
to whom grants should issue; the lands, however, to be located 
- west of the Tennessee river. The agreement made by them was to 
be published with the Acts of the Legislature.

one-half of all military land warrants which might in 
the future be issued to it by North Carolina.” 
It was a generous gift on the part of the State, 
through its commissioners, none the less generous be- 
cause indirectly made, and one of which we should not. 
fail in fitting recognition. 
The prospect of this additional source of revenue, in. 
supplement of the depleted land grant fund, was most 
welcome and gave the trustees of East Tennessee College 
renewed-courage and stout hearts with which to carry 
on the struggle against opposing odds. 
In the following year the Legislature, as if conscious 
of the great injustice that had been done to the institu- 
tions of learning, and desiring to make some reparation, 
and yet at the same time solicitous of further indulgence 
to the settlers, * made a desperate effort to steer between

ment was made with Joseph H. Bryan, agent of the trustees of the 
University of North Carolina. 
No further warrants seem to have ever issued. The 60,000 acres 
were to be transferred, subject to contracts previously made for 
locating and procuring grants. The University was to warrant 
titles to 45,000 acres at $1.50 an acre, with interest, but Hability to 
terminate on all lands on which no adverse claim had been made 
by January 1, 1831; subsequent warrants to be assigned without 
any. guaranty of title. The compacts designated the specific war- 
rants which were to be transferred to each of the two colleges. 
(See, generally, Merriam’s Higher Education in Tennessee, p. 36.) 
76. It must not be forgotten that the necessities of the settlers. 
were, to a large extent, real; many of them being very poor, and 
the enforcement of the purchase money often a grievous burden. 
Thus, in 1821, as appears from a report of a committee of the House, 
there had been four hundred and sixty-six tracts advertised for 
sale, of which two hundred and five had been bid in by the State, 
and forty-five by individuals. The committee further reported that 
large numbers would be unable-to pay the interest next accruing.

Scylla and Charybdis. Twhe expediency hit upon was 
this: to remit altogether, in the first instance, one-third 
of the purchase money still due on all lands south of the 
French Broad and Holston, and then, by way of atone- 
ment to the institutions of learning, to vest in them the 
entire unremitted balance due upon all lands that had 
been previously sold within the district, whether without 
or within the college and academy tracts, together with 
all such lands as might be subsequently re-sold for default 
in payments and bid in by the State, or that had been 
previously sold, and should not be redeemed by the 
owners, this gift being, as was recited, ‘‘in consid- 
eration of the delays of payment heretofore or hereafter 
to be sustained by the colleges and academies,” and in 
order ‘‘to make a final appropriation and investiture 
of the moneys and lands aforesaid, * * * . * 
and put it out of the power of the Legislature to inter- 
fere hereafter by indulging the debtors or in any other 
way whatsoever.” 
  
partial releases would have been, perhaps, no more than right. 
The fundamental wrong consisted in the fact that the State post- 
poned and remitted funds in which she herself had no interest, and 
for the collection of which the National Government had made her. 
a trustee. Small wonder it is, however, that the settlers, knowing 
that the State was probably willing to forego its own claims, became 
embittered against the distant colleges and academies, for whose 
benefit the State was continually being urged to insist upon the 
collection of the purchase money; a bitterness constantly fed by 
demagogues for their own purposes. 
77. Acts of 1823, chap. 30, passed November 15, 1823; Whitney’s 
Land Laws, p. 878; Haywood & Cobbs’ Statute Laws of Tennessee, 
p. 184. The whole amount, principal and interest, due was to be 
calculated to May 1, 1824; one-third of this amount to be then 
remitted; one-fifth of the remaining two-thirds to be paid by the 
said May lst, and the remainder in six interest-bearing annual 
installments ; land to be sold on default in payment of any of these 
installments, but to be subject to redemption. 
Apparently this Act only applied to lands that had been already 
sold, and not to subsequent sales of lands that might be made by 
the State for its own benefit outside of the college and academy
-P-A-G-E-67
— 50 — 
Thus did the State make effort to compensate the 
institutions of learning for all the past and to partially 
atone for the original wrong of 1806. For this effort it 
should be given due credit.% Unfortunately it was but 
partial at the best; and came too late. ‘There are no data 
from which to-day we can ascertain exactly the fund thus 
transferred by the State to the institutions of learning ; 
probably it was small. 
Furthermore, so unaccustomed were the settlers to 
making payments upon their lands that it was too late 
to make a change of habit. A few days later the last 
step in reducing the educational fund was taken, by an 
Act which made all of the territory that had been 
acquired by Tennessee east and north of the Congres- 
sional line subject to entry at twelve and one-half cents 
ati acre, the Act being so broad in its terms as to include 
the lands south of the French Broad and Holston, and 
even those within the college and academy tracts; and 
this was the melancholy ending of the provision in the 
Cession Act of 1806, requiring these lands to be sold at 
not less than two dollars an acre.” 
  
‘tracts. The proceeds due for lands within the college and academy 
tracts, and the defaulted lands within those tracts bid in by the 
State and not redeemed, were vested in the colleges and academies 
according to the tracts in which they were located. Other defaulted 
lands and the balance then due the State on lands outside of these 
two tracts were vested one-fourth in each of the colleges and one- 
half in the academies. 
78. This effort at compensation has generally been overlooked 
in the discussion of this subject. Thus Mr. Merriam recites the 
fact that one-third of the purchase money was remitted in 1823, but 
does not refer to the counter gift from the State. (Higher Educa- 
tion in Tennessee, p. 39.) 
79. Acts of 1823, chap. 49, passed November 22, 1823; Whitney’s 
Land Laws, p. 308; Haywood & Cobbs’ Statute Laws, vol. 2, p. 113. 
Mr. Merriam states, without giving his authority, that Congress 
in 1823 repealed the clause of the Act of 1806 fixing a minimum 
price on the college and academy lands. (Higher Education in 
Tennessee, p. 38, note.) 
The only Act of Congress upon this subject was one repealing
-P-A-G-E-68
— 51 — 
“Considerable payments,” we read, ‘‘were made in 
1824, but in 1825 the occupangs of the lands refused 
almost unanimously to pay any more;” a statement 
corroborated by the fact that at this time there appear 
various acts of legislation authorizing the trustees of 
the University to further extend the time for payments. * 
In this latter year there appears an interesting bit of 
legislation, apparently intended to carry out the gen- 
erous gift made the colleges in 1822 in connection with 
the compact made with the University of North Carolina, 
by which, however, in certain respects the intended gift 
appears to have been somewhat reduced and partly 
changed from a gift into a payment on the land grant 
fund. 
' Under the compact of 1822, it will be remembered, 
  
so much of the Act of 1806 as had provided “that the lowest price 
of all lands granted or sold within the ceded territory should be the 
same as should be established by Congress for lands of the United 
States.” (Act of Congress, February 23, 1823; 5 U.S. Stat. at L., 
p. 729.) This proviso of the origina] Act had been inserted between 
the provisions as to college and academy lands and that as to the 
settlers’ rights of pre-emption. While the exact construction of the 
Act of 1806 is one of some little difficulty, raising the question, for 
example, whether or not it was intended to prevent the sale of the 
pre-empted lands at a less price than those fixed by the United 
States upon its lands, still it is clear that the repeal of this clause 
did not, in any way, repeal the minimum limit on the college and 
academy lands, but merely authorized the sale of other vacant 
lands north and east of the Reservation line at less than $1.50 an 
acre, the price at which public lands of the United States were then 
selling. (5 U.S. Stat. at L., p. 566.) 
Previous to 1820 public lands of the United States had sold at 
$2.00 an acre. (See 5 U.S. Stat. at L., pp. 407, 410, 466 and 522.)

interest, provided the trustees of the two colleges consented.

the University of North Carolina had agreed to assign 
to the two colleges ong-half of all military warrarits. 
which might thereafter be issued to it by the State of 
North Carolina. Probably between 1822 and 1825 a con- 
siderable number of such additional warrants were 
issued, whose validity had never been adjudicated by 
Tennessee. Accordingly, in 1825, an Act was passed, 
providing for a commissioner to examine all military 
land warrants laid before him by the University of North 
Carolina, East Tennessee College or Cumberland College, 
which had been issued to the University of North Caro- 
lina, and to adjudicate their validity, not exceeding in 
the aggregate one hundred and five thousand acres, upon 
which adjudication a corresponding amount of land 
should be sold by the State at certain specified prices, 
one-third of the proceeds to be paid to the University of 
North Carolina, one-third to be appropriated to the use 
of common schools, two-ninths to be paid Cumberland 
College, and the remaining one-ninth to East Tennessee 
College. All sums so paid to Cumberland College and 
East Tennessee College were to be treated as made “‘ for 
the relief of the people residing on the college and acad- 
emy lands south of French Broad and Holston,” and 
were to be credited as payments upon their purchase 
money; it being further provided that out of the moneys 
thereafter collected from the college and academy lands 
the academies should first be paid an amount equal to 
that received by the two colleges from the proceeds 
of these warrants, and that East Tennessee College 
should then be equalized with Cumberland College. *

this Act a commissioner was appointed to examine all military land

hundred and five thousand acres, for which amount certificates 
should be issued for land west and south of the congressional reser- 
vation line, in 25 acre tracts, which should be sold: first, to any occu-

Apparently this Act of 1825 only applied to the unadju- 
dicated warrants that had been issued since the compact 
of 1822. As to these warrants, it will be noticed, it 
reduced the proportion which the colleges were to 
receive and limited the total acreage and the price at 
which the lands could be sold. Furthermore, the prefer- 
ence that had been given by the compact to Cumberland 
College over East Tennessee College, which had been 
proper in a gift, became discrimination when treated 
as a payment on debts due them. ® 
  
pants of unappropriated land in this territory at fifty cents an acre; 
next to general purchasers for a time at one dollar an acre; then at 
fifty cents an acre; and lastly, the residue at public auction: one- 
third of the proceeds to be paid to the University of North Carolina, 
one-third to be appropriated for the use of common schools forever, 
and of the remaining one-third, two-thirds to be paid to Cumberland 
College and one-third to East Tennessee College. The sums paid 
to the two colleges was to be treated as made “‘for the relief of the 
people residing on the college and academy lands south of French 
Broad and Holston,’’ and to be credited as a payment upon the 
sums due from purchasers of such land south of French Broad and 
Holston as should thereafter be adjudged to be of the third-class 
in value. No reference is made in this Act to the compact of 1822. 
83. The Act of 1825 had provided that it should not take effect 
untess the President and Trustees of the University of North Carolina 
should send to the Secretary of State of Tennessee their written 
consent to the Act before the first day of the succeeding February. 
This is not now on file in the Secretary of State’s office, but I have 
been informed in a letter received from Dr. Kemp P. Battle, former 
President of the University of North Carolina, that this written 
consent, as appears from the University records, was given and 
sent to the Secretary of State on January 19, 1826. 
There is much confusion as to the relation of the Act of 1825 to 
the compact of 1822, as to which our histories fail to enlighten us. 
Thus Merriam discusses the compact in detail, but does not even 
mention the Act; and other authorities are likewise silent on this 
point. 
I was at first of the opinion that the Act of 1825 was intended to 
supplant the compact of 1822, but after much reflection have reached 
the conclusion stated in the text that the Act of 1825 was intended 
to carry out the compact as to warrants issued subsequently, and 
that ‘a large number of warrants were probably issued after the
-P-A-G-E-73
—54— 
compact of 1822. The. statement made in note 75, supra, should be 
corrected accordingly. 
The Act of 1825 is in its terms very obscure. However, its basic 
provision as to the adjudication of warrants, manifestly, could not 
apply to those warrants that had been issued prior to 1822 and were 
adjudicated by the commissioners at that time. 
Furthermore, from extrinsic sources we learn that the University 
and Colleges subsequently received moneys from Western lands in 
the two methods provided for by the compact and the Act, respect- 
ively. One main difference between the compact and the Act was 
the fact that by the compact the grants were to issue directly to the 
University and Colleges, the lands to be their property and disposed 
of by them in the ordinary way, while by the Act the lands were to 
be sold by the State and the proceeds paid over to the University 
and Colleges. 
It, therefore, would appear that the compact was carried out from 
the fact, stated by Merriam, that Cumberland College, which had 
become the University of Nashville in 1826 (Merriam’s Higher 
Education, p. 31), received as her share of the Western lands 
33,3634 acres, after the locators had received their portion, which 
was sold in 1834 for $1.00 an acre and interest, but from which the 
College eventually realized only $15,000.00. (Higher Education in 
Tennessee, p. 87.) So, also, Robert N. McEwen, State Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction, in his annual report, 1837, referred 
to the funds of Cumberland College (or Nashville University, as it 
was then called) as amounting principally to about $32,000.00, in 
notes for the sale of her Western district lands, due in one, two, 
three, four and five years, from April 8, 1836. (House Journal, 
1887-8, p. 654.) I have also carefully examined the Day Book of 
East Tennessee College, covering the period from 1830 to 1858, in 
which the cash accounts were kept (the earlier account books being 
lost), and from this it appears that the College sold to various per- 
sons at various times portions of its Western district lands, often 
taking notes therefor, and receiving on this account from April 30, 
1832, to February 22, 1859, inclusive, $19,112.98, less expenses, the 
exact amount of which cannot be now ascertained. (See Day Book, 
folios .76, 86, 101, 104, 112, 119, 124, 127, 182, 133, 186, 152, 153, 154, 
179, 180, 181 and 385.) This is more than could, by any possibility, 
have been obtained under the Act of 1825. 
On the other hand, we would infer that the execution of the Act 
of 1825 was at least begun, from the fact that in 1825 and 1826 com- 
missioners were appointed to examine the lands south of the French 
. Broad and Holston and adjudge which were of the ‘‘third and, last 
class:in value,’? to be credited with the payments made the two 
colleges. (Chap. 78, Acts of 1825, and chap. 34, Acts of 1826; 
Whitney's Land Laws, pp. 492 and 499.)

It is impossible to ascertain exactly how much East 
Tennessee College realized from the Western lands under 
both the compact and the Act of 1825; probably, how- 
ever, the total amount was not far from twenty-four 
thousand dollars. * 
The hostility to the colleges, at this time, was exceed- 
ingly bitter. As an illustration of the influences that 
during all this period were brought to bear against them 
and an explanation of a popular prejudice, which has 
only recently been destroyed, or at least driven to take 
hidden refuge in our mountain fastnesses in its flight 
before a growing public intelligence, let me cite the 
  
Furthermore, in 1829, Daniel Graham, Secretary of State of 
Tennessee, replying to an inquiry from George Graham, Commis- 
sioner of the General Land Office, among other things, as to the 
value of vacant lands in the Western part of Tennessee, states that 
‘in the summer of 1826 a large stock of 91,000 acres, claimed by 
the University of North Carolina and the colleges and common 
schools of this State, was, by direction of the Legislature, divided 
into small parcels of 25 acres each and sold at 50 cents per acre, 
eash.”? (Amer. State Papers, Pub. Lands, vol. 6, p. 32.) 
So, too, Dr. Battle writes me, that the University of North Caro- 
lina received the proceeds of her Western lands, partly by direct 
sales made by the University, and partly through the State govern- 
ment, receiving about $14,000 directly from the State of Tennessee 
(almost the exact proportion coming to the University of North 
Carolina from the 91,000 acres said by Grabam to have been sold in 
1826), and about $160,580.00 from sales of lands made by the Univer- 
sity direct; $111,399.00 during the land boom of 1835, and the rest* 
before. 
On the whole, therefore, while there is much obscurity in this 
legislation, and it is impossible with the data now at hand to reach 
an entirely satisfactory conclusion, I think the opinion expressed 
in the text is probably correct. 
84. As shown in note 83, supra, it appears from the College 
Day Book that subsequent to April 30, 1832, the College received 
$19,112.98 from lands obtained and sold by her under the compact. 
I think it probable that if the old books could be found it would, 
also appear that in 1826 the College received about $5,000.00, or 
one-ninth of the proceeds of the 91,000 acres sold by the State in 
that year under the Act of 1825.

speech of Thomas D. Arnold, a prominent lawyer of 
Knoxville, who, when a candidate for Congress, in ad- 
dressing the people south of the river, speaking of the 
college building, which had recently been erected on 
Barbara Hill (that had been bought in 1826 for six hun- 
dred dollars), denounced the trustees as ‘‘having used 
; the people’s money to build light-houses of the sky on 
: them for the sons of a few great'men to go up and star- 
gaze,” and for having had ‘‘a law passed for their special 
| benefit, which authorized these gentlemen, when your 
lands have been sold, because you had not the money to 
pay your installment, and when, perhaps, you have sold’ 
, your last cow to get the money, to charge you ten per 
; centum instead of six.”* 
And so, in 1829, Dr. Jno. C. Gunn, the author of 
Gunn’s Domestic Medicine, a great medical authority, I 
am told, in olden times, when a candidate for the State 
Legislature, thus referred to the modest brick central 
building, which in its unadorned and weather-beaten 
, simplicity still crowns the summit of our college hill: 
“Behold that great rotunda—that monument of folly—

' building which closes its doors against the poor man’s 
child, * * * this temple of aristocracy; why do they 
forget that the south-of-the-river people paid drop by 
drop of sweat to erect this tomb of extravagance—this 
wild goose scheme—this fanciful—this melancholy build- 
ing raising its proud front on an isolated hill until you 
become exhausted to reach the summit? * * * * *

In 1829 the State, weary of its arduous, persevering 
and heroic efforts to secure for the colleges that which 
was justly their due under the national land grant, offered 
to give one-half of a township of land in the country lying 
south of the Hiwassee river, to which the Indian title 
had not then been extingtished, to East Tennessee Col- 
lege and the University of Nashville, the name that had 
been previously given to Cumberland College, provided 
they would execute a written instrument releasing all . 
their claims south of the French Broad and Holston and 
all rights which they had acquired to any of the lands 
in that section. *

sity, p. 27.

The preamble of this Act was as follows: ‘‘ Whereas, a contro- 
versy has existed for many years between the colleges and academies 
in this State, and the citizens residing south of French Broad and 
Holston and west of Big Pigeon rivers, in regard to large sums of 
money claimed by said colleges and academies to be due and owing 
from said citizens; and, whereas, the subject matter of said contro- 
versy has frequently been brought before the Legislature of this 
State, to the great detriment of other business; and also has been 
productive of much expense and perplexity in the examination 
thereof; and for the purpose of producing harmony and quiet be- 
tween a respectable portion of the citizens of this State and the
-P-A-G-E-79
— 58 -—— 
The Trustees of East Tennessee College, weary of 
the unequal struggle and compelled by poverty to give 
up the fight, consented, and executed the prescribed 
deed of release, placing of record however, in this instru- 
ment, their sense of the obligation of the State to pay 
the balance of the congressional donation.” 
However, neither the Western academies nor the Uni- 
versity of Nashville would yet assent to this inadequate 
substitute for the magnificent gift intended for them by 
the Government of the United States; partly no doubt 
because of the imperfect title of the lands to be given, 
  
literary institutions therein, and for the purpose of avoiding all 
future legislation respecting said subject.”’ 
The Act provided that before the land should be located or 
granted the trustees of the two institutions ‘‘in their legal capacity 
shall make, sign, seal and deliver to the Secretary of State such a 
deed in writing as will forever acquit, discharge and release citizens 
residing south of French Broad and Holston and west of Big Pigeon 
rivers, from all judgments, debts, dues, demands, claims, rents, - 
issues, or suits of any kind, character or description whatever, 
either in law or equity, and also all rights that they may have 
acquired by, through or under the sale of any of the lands in said 
section of country.”’ 
89. Deed of Release, Trustees of East Tennessee College to the 
citizens south of French Broad and Holston, dated April 20th, 1830. 
Executed by Wm. Park, President pro tem., Board of Trustees. 
Recorded April 28th, 1830, in Register’s office, Blount County, in 
book 24, p. 9. 
In this deed the Trustees express their desire to settle the con- 
troversy with the citizens, and rejoice in the prospect of the com- 
plete discharge and release of their lands from the demands of the 
literary institutions, but add: ‘‘ We hereby protest against any- 
thing in said Act, or in this deed contained from being construed to 
operate as a release to the State from its obligation to pay this insti- 
tution the balance of its proportion of the congressional donation. 
We hold it bound in equity and good conscience to make good to 
this institution the donation of the congressional government, and 
relying on the Legislature to hereafter provide for the more exten- 
sive usefulness of this literary institution, we cheerfully comply 
with the provision of the Act of Assembly.’”’? Then, following the 
language of the Act, they release their claims against the citizens 
south of the French Broad and Holston and all rights in the lands.

but largely because, being further removed from the 
settlers, they had not felt so keenly or so grievously the 
bitter animosity that had been engendered in the long 
struggle. They therefore refused to accept the condi- 
tions of settlement and persevered in their efforts to 
obtain justice. In 1834 Cumberland College prepared a 
memorial to Congress ‘‘giving a history of the Land 
Grant Fund, and praying to be indemnified by another 
grant,” but in vain.” 
In 1835, however, the lands south of the Hiwassee 
river, having been acquired by treaty from the Indians, » 
and the ceded territory having been established as the 
Ocoee District of Tennessee,” the University of Nash- 
ville, wearied into submission, at length-also consented 
to the settlement, and in 1838 the Legislature directed 
the setting apart of the half township in Ocoee District 
for the use of the College and University." 
  
90. In the report by Robert N. McEwen, Supt. of Public In- 
struction, 1837, he says, speaking of the legislative offer of 1829, ‘‘it 
is understood that the College of East Tennessee and perhaps some 
one or two academies there agreed to the arrangement, but that the 
Nashville University and the other academies have not agreed to it, 
in consequence of which-no location was made.”’ (House Journal, 
1837-8, p. 655). So, in a report of the select committee on the Ocoee 
District, Oct. 30, 1837, it is stated that inasmuch as the Trustees of 
the colleges and academies ‘‘have not as yet signified their accept- 
ance of the provision of the Act by complying with its requisitions, 
the tracts for the use of colleges and academies have never been 
located.” (House Journal. 1837-8, p. 800.)

By the terms of the Act it is doubtful whether the College and 
University were to receive a half township each, or a half township 
jointly, as the Act directs the entry taken of the Ocoee District, 
before the first Monday in November, 1838, to select and designate 
“‘the two half townships of land which have been reserved by law 
for the use of colleges and academies, the money arising from the

It is noteworthy that in this final settlement no 
compensation was made to Hast Tennessee College for 
the excess of western lands that had. been given to 
Cumberland College. . 
Out of these Ocoee lands, which were almost imme- 
diately sold, East Tennessee College realized in cash 
something over thirty-four thousand dollars.® And this, 
after thirty years of conflict, was the realization of that 
bright vision which had induced the trustees of Blount 
College to surrender their independence. The one hun- 
dred thousand dollars which Congress had intended the 
College to receive, if put at simple interest, would, at 
the time the Ocoee land was sold, have amounted, prin- 
cipal and interest, to about three hundred thousand 
  
entry of which shall be paid over to the Trustees of East Tennessee 
College and the Nashville University in equal proportions, upon 
their agreeing to receive the same in full satisfaction of all claims 
which they have against the State or the citizens residing south of 
the French Broad and Holston rivers.”’ 
Mr. A. J. White, Register of Ocoee District, writes me that on 
November 14, 1839, 72 Grants for 160 acres each, issued to Nashville 
University and East Tennessee College, in all 11,520 acres, or exactly 
a half township. 
(It will be noticed that the Act apparently intended that the 
designated land should be sold to individuals as other lands, and 
the proceeds paid over to the institutions, instead of being granted 
directly to them.) 
On the other hand, Merriam states that the State gave the Uni- 
versity of Nashville a half township in the Ocoee District, or 11,500 
acres, and that in 1839-40 it received $40,000 from the sale of these 
lands. (Higher Education in Tennessee, p. 39.) So, Col. White 
implies that East Tennessee College received a half township. 
(Early History of the University, p. 34.) 
This is possibly tie correct construction of the Act instead of 
that stated in the text. I regret 1 have not sufficient data at hand 
from which to reach a satisfactory conclusion. 
95. The Day Book of East Tennessee College shows cash receipts 
in 1839, from the sales of lands in the Ocoee district, of $34,397.29. 
(Folio 124.) 
I have been unable to find any record of further cash receipts 
from this source.

dollars. In other words, the College ultimately received 
‘from both the wéstern district and the Ocoee lands about 
‘one-fifth of that which Congress had promised.” 
From the contest over the land grant fund, and ‘the 
hostility thereby generated in the public mind, supple- 
mented by the fact, as already stated’ in reference. to 
Blount College, that there was at that time no efficient 
public school system in Tennessee, and that the college 
had no organic connection with even such public schools 
as then existed and was not supported by them to any 
great extent, being chiefly regarded as a rich man’s col- 
lege, it came about that the natural tendency of colleges 
in those days to a purely classical course of training, was 
intensified, and we are uot surprised when we read the 
programme, of the Commencement Exercises in 1827, 
under its scholarly and energetic President, Dr. Coffin, 
(our historian having preserved for us this programme 
verbatim)” to find that they were of a highly academic 
nature, embracing four English Orations, two Forensic 
Debates, two Conferences, a Salutatory Oration in Latin, 
a Latin Dialogue, a Syllogistic Disputation in Latin, a 
a French Oration and a Greek Oration. 
That Commencement Programme of 1827, I hazard 
the opinion, would almost bear comparison with a Com- 
mencement Programme of to-day. 
And when we read in the list of participants the 
names of Charles J. McKinney, John H. Crozier, Samuel 
  
96. Itis a matter of great regret that no records exist by which 
it can be ascertained how much the College had received directly 
from the settlers. There can now be found, however, no records 
earlier than 1830. The auditing committee’s report on October 21, 
1880, shows that the College then had on hands $3,249.25 in cash, 
and $9,080.00 in well secured notes for money loaned (Day Book, 
folio 12). How much of this was the proceeds of the college lands 
south of French Broad and Holston, how much had come from the 
lands in the western district, and how much from the sale of its 
former site near Poplar Spring, it i@ impossible at this date to 
definitely determine.

became a member of Congress; one, a Judgeof the State 
Supreme Court; one, a minister to Constantinople; one, 
a Chancellor of Mississippi; two Judges of the State 
Circuit Courts; and one, Comptroller of the Treasury of 
Tennessee, we know that the college that educated such 
students was a great institution, no matter what its 
fund or its pecuniary fortunes, and we are not astonished 
to read that, after these Commencement Exercises, the 
Trustees should have issued a valedictory address to the 
public, in which ‘‘they felicitated themselves with the 
idea that ‘a day of science had fairly dawned’ upon 
them.”* 
If history had preserved for us no other record of East 
Tennessee College than this one programme, we would 
know that her days were those of usefulness, and that 
her life was well spent and rich in the achievements of 
the sons whom she educated. 
The college, it will readily be seen, during all these 
years occupied a peculiarly anomalous and unfortunate 
position. Ostensibly it was to receive Government sup- 
port; practically it did not, but the belief that it was 
dependent upon the Government naturally tended to 
deprive it of the support of private individuals. ‘This, 
chiefly, I believe, together with the theological zeal that 
has always characterized Tennesseeans, causing the 
up-building throughout the country of the large number 
of flourishing denominational schools, established by 
Baptists, Methodists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians and 
others, has tended to prevent the concentration of funds 
and teachers in. a great central University which could, 
by combined force, educate the youth of the State more 
adequately than could each of these separate institutions. *

Iam not well versed in theological matters, ‘but it is, 
to say the least, a debatable question in my mind, 
whether the God of all Mankind, who loveth one denomi- 
nation equally with another, would not be as well pleased 
if we should cease our efforts to educate good Baptists, 
good Presbyterians and other good denominationalists, 
and should devote our united energies to educating good 
men and good citizens. It has come to pass, in Ten- 
nessee, as has been said, that ‘‘of the making of colleges 
there is no end,” and that nearly ‘“‘every cross roads 
hamlet has, not its academy or high school, but its col- 
lege,”. of which, by the way, the denominational col- 
leges have attained, generally, no little excellence. And 
now to-day, we have in prospect colleges where our sons 
are to be educated, not only to be good denominational- 
ists, but to be good Prohibitionists, or good Free Masons, 
ot good Odd Fellows, or the like. 
Icannot but believe that this is all wrong, and that 
this diffusion of energy and scattering of forces is unwise 
and injurious, and that instead of having for the educa- 
tion of our sons scores of colleges, none of which rise to 
rank of a high-grade university, it would be ten-fold 
better to make our local colleges into academies, and to 
concentrate into one great university, worthy of the 
name and dignity of the State, the twnited resources 
which would give the sons of Tennessee the best educa- 
tion that these times will afford and make it unnecessary | 
for them to leave the borders of their State in order to 
complete their education. 
Before I pass from the ante-bellum records of East 
Tennessee College, let me note that in 1840 the name of 
the college was changed by an Act of the Legislature to 
the trustees of East Tennessee University.” 
In 1860, Dr. Carnes, then president of the college, 
obtained a joint resolution of the Legislature requesting

the Judges of the Supreme Court to report at the next 
session the facts in regard to the appropriation of the 
college Jands under the Act of Congress of 1806, and to 
state their opinion as to the equitable right of the two 
utiversities to further compensation on this account.’ 
The trustees appointed John H. Crozier and T’homas C. 
Lyon to present the claim of the University to the 
‘Supreme Court. 
‘There was much hope of success in this matter, but 
the war came up, and the matter has been sleeping ever 
since. Is it yet too late for an awakening? Is it yet 
too late for the State of Tennessee to do equity to the 
institutions of learning which are its brightest orna- 
ments; to do justice, not only to them, but to its own 
fair name and fame? 
It was in speaking of the acts of the Tennessee Leg- 
islature in reference to her college fund, that one of 
Tennessee’s most distinguished and patriotic sons, the 
Honorable John Bell, many years ago, said: ‘I will 
not enumerate them. I would rather cast the veil of 
eternal oblivion over them; but it should sink deep 
into the mind of every true friend of his country, that no 
temporary expedient, no short-lived applause of the peo- 
ple, can justify a legislative body in violating those rules 
of honor, propriety and justice in the discharge of a 
public trust, which individuals are bound to respect. 
The good that is obtained is generally fleeting, and can 
never weigh in the balance against public credit im- 
paired and public confidence destroyed.”™ 
It was not until after the Civil War and the election to 
the Presidency of the late Reverend Doctor Thomas W. 
Humes, that cultured and Christian gentleman to whose 
energy the University owes so much, that the next great 
step was taken in the history of the University.

In 1862, the United States had, by the so-called Mor- 
rill Act,” granted to each State a certain amount of the 
_public lands within its borders, or if there was not such 
. quantity of public land, then land scrip for a correspond- 
- ing acreage, to be sold by the States, and the moneys 
derived therefrom invested in ‘‘safe stocks,” consti- 
tuting ‘‘a perpetual fund,” remaining “forever undi- 
‘minished,”’™™ whose interest should be ‘‘inviolably 
appropriated” to the endowment and maintenance of 
at least one college whose ‘‘leading object” should be, 
‘“‘ without excluding other scientific and classical studies, 
cand including military tactics, to teach such branches of 
learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic 
arts, in order to promote the liberal and practical educa- 
‘tion of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and 
_ professions of life.” 
The Civil War having prevented the acceptance of 
this gift by Tennessee until 1865,"° at which date the 
time originally limited by Congress for its acceptance 
had expired, Congress was induced to extend the original 
Act, so as to still allow Tennessee to obtain its benefits, 
and the legislature, in 1868, for the second time, accepted 
the donation and made provisions for obtaining and 
selling the land scrip, which, by reason of the lack of 
‘public lands, the State was entitled to receive, and

directed that the proceeds should be invested in bonds 
of the State to await subsequent disposition.” 
However, Congress had provided as one of the express _ 
conditions of the Land Grant, that any State claiming 
its benefits should, within five years, provide a college 
to receive the endowment, ' or the grant to such State 
  
106. The Act of Congress was first accepted by the Tennessee 
legislature June 6th, 1865. (Chap. 22, Acts of 1865, p. 42; Whit- 
ney’s Land Laws, p. 516.) 
However, the Act of Congress, which had been approved July 
5th, 1862, had specifically provided that ‘‘no State shall be entitled 
to the benefit of this Act, unless it shall express its acceptance 
thereof by its legislature within two years from the date of its 
approval by the President’’ (Appendix G.; sec. 5, sub-sec. 7), and 
hence this acceptance by Tennessee came almost a year too late to 
be effective. 
By Joint Resolution adopted December 14th, 1866, our representa- 
tives in Congress were ‘‘instructed ’’ and our senators ‘‘ requested ”’ 
to ‘intercede for Tennessee and use all reasonable and laudable 
efforts to have said sub-section * * so amended as to enable the 
State of Tennessee to accept the provisions of said Act.” (Acts of 
1866-7, Joint Resolution No 51, p. 281; Whitney’s Land Laws, p. 
516.) 
Their ‘‘laudable efforts’? were crowned with success, and by 
Joint Resolution of Congress, February 28th, 1867, the provisions 
of the Act of 1862, and of an amendment of July 23rd, 1866, were 
extended and made applicable to the State of Tennessee. (Land 
Laws of the United States, Vol. 2, p. 1098.) 
Tennessee, thereupon, again accepted the provisions of the Act 
on February Ist, 1868. (Chap. 32, Acts of 1867-8, p. 38; Whitney’s 
Land Laws, p. 515.) 
107. The State was to provide and equip the college; Congress 
furnishing the endowment fund whose interest should thereafter 
support and maintain it. 
Congress had specifically provided, not only, that the proceeds 
of the sale of the land scrip should “‘constitute a perpetual fund, 
the capital of which “‘should remain forever undiminished,” (except 
“a sum not exceeding ten per centum of the amount received, * * * 
for sites or experimental farms’’); but also that ‘‘no portion of said 
fund, nor the interest thereon,’’ should be applied directly or indi- 
rectly, under any pretense whatever, to the purchase, erection, 
preservation or repair of any building or buildings”; and that the
-P-A-G-E-92

should cease, and it should be. bound to refund the 
amounts received from any lands previously sold. 
And hence, as the State had obtained and sold its 
quota of land scrip and invested the proceeds in its bonds, 
it was imperative that it should provide the required 
college. Owing to the condition of the State finances 
' it would perhaps have been difficult, if not impossible, 
for it then to have made out of its own Treasury a suf- 
ficient appropriation to fitly supplement the generous 
gift of the United States. , 
The University of East Tennessee, which was already 
somewhat of a State institution, fortunately, was in a 
position to assist the State, and was, furthermore, desir- 
ous of securing the location of the Agricultural college. 
It, therefore, under the energetic leadership of’ Dr. 
Humes, made application to the State for the Congres- 
sional appropriation, offering, if given the fund, to 
provide the necessary college. Various other institutions 
and localities made like application, but the efforts of 
our University were at length crowned with success, and 
in 1869 the Legislature appropriated the proceeds of the 
sale of the land scrip to the East Tennessee University, 
making it the express ‘duty of the Trustees of said 
‘University to establish an Agricultural College, so as 
to strictly conform with the Congressional enactment,” 
and providing that the fund appropriated should be used 
only according to the terms of that enactment. 
  
interest of the fund should be ‘‘inviolably appropriated” to ‘“‘the 
endowment, support and maintenance”’ of the college to be pro- 
vided by the State. Appendix G; Sec. 4, and Sec. 5, Sub-Secs.

May I not be permitted, in this connection, to refer to the fact 
that under date of February 12, 1869, the Board of Trustees of the 
East Tennessee University passed a resolution tendering the most 
- hearty thanks of the Board of Trustees to E. J. Sanford “for his

I cannot here forbear from mentioning the historical 
fact that the city of Knoxville, having been anxious to 
secure the location of the Agricultural College here, its 
Board of Mayor and Aldermen, to aid in securing this 
result, had previously, with commendable alacrity, voted 
to appropriate fifteen thousand dollars for the purchase 
of a library for the University when the College should 
be so located, and that now, this having been accom- 
plished, our excellent city, with an alacrity equal to that 
with which it had formerly voted to give the library, 
changed its mind and was only compelled to do so 
by the Supreme Court at the end of a lawsuit.” 
The State, it is to be observed, did not in the Act of 
1869 appropriate a dollar from its own treasury to aid in 
providing the Agricultural College, this being made the 
task of the University. And not only did the State 
require the Trustees to complete buildings for the accom- 
modation of two hundred and seventy-five students, fur- 
nish them with appropriate school furniture, and provide 
at least two hundred acres of suitable lands, making the 
whole property worth at least one hundred and twenty- 
five thousand dollars, before the Government should 
issue to them the bonds, but it was furthermore made a 
condition of the Act that the University should at all 
times be required to give free tuition in the Agricultural 
College to three students from each county of the State, 
that number being, in 1873, increased to two hundred 
and seventy-five students from the entire State," with 
  
faithful and very efficient services as our agent in securing the loca- 
tion of the Agricultural College at Knoxville, as a branch of the 
East Tennessee University.”

in city bonds in settlement of the decree against it.

      the additional requirement that the profits arising from 
crops on the Agricultural farm should be applied towards 
"paying the expenses of indigent students.” 
The University thereafter not only shouldered all the 
purden that had devolved upon the State under the Act 
of Congress——a burden that well nigh impoverished the 
University and tied up nearly all the little property it 
-“ possessed in unproductive lands and buildings,” but it 
did so with the additional condition as to free students 
which, ‘‘under easy appointment laws * * deprives 
_ the University practically of all tuitions.”™ 
Icall attention to these facts to-day, not by way of 
- complaint, for the University was glad to obtain the 
. appropriation under these conditions, and has no com- 
-- plaint to make in this regard, but as a matter of simple 
=~ justice to the University, that it may be known how 
“heroically it has struggled, how bravely it has dis- 
charged, unassisted, all the duties that have devolved 
upon it, and to correct an impression often, though 
erroneously, entertained, that the State, in some way, 
contributed to the support of the University, and that 
its appropriation is due to the generosity of the State 
instead of the United States,‘ an impression, doubt-

118.. Quoted from a very valuable report on the history, 
condition, needs and objects of the University made to the Board 
of Trustees by President Charles W. Dabney, in 1888, in which it is 
also said: ‘The fact is, it took all the slender resources of the 
University of that day, with the exception of about ten thousand 
dollars to acquire the additional land and put up the additional 
buildings necessary to meet the terms of the proposal which looked 
so favorable to the friends of the institution who had struggled with 
severe poverty for over fifty years.” 
(Biennial Report of Board of Trustees to the General Assembly, 
1887-88, p. 45.) 
Iam informed that since this address was delivered, in December, 
1894, the Trustees have made tuition free to all students. 
114. Even the Legislators of 1869, themselves seemed to have 
shared in this mistaken idea, as appears from the recital of the Act 
 
-P-A-G-E-95

less arising from the fact that the University is known 
to have received and to hold State bonds. 
The fact is, however, as has been stated by our Presi- 
dent, that ‘‘the State which gave it birth, and has 
undertaken to preside over its destinies, has given 
it, during three-quarters of a century, not one dollar 
of support, voluntarily and from its own Treasury. *” 
Others have bestowed gifts upon it by permission of the 
State; it has been repeatedly the recipient of Congres- 
sional or Federal aid,” which the State has merely trans- 
mitted, ‘‘ but the State itself has never once put its hand 
into its own vaults and drawn hence a gift for this child 
of its creation. The interest paid the University * * * 
by the State is not a gift, but merely rent for the use of 
funds, which the State pays and would be required to pay 
to any other,” owner of its bonds. ‘*’I‘he only money now 
received by the University from the State treasury is 
this interest money paid in settlement of coupons cut 
from bonds which she holds, just as any private person 
might hold them.”"* 
The University, however, as I have said, does not 
complain of the conditions attached to the vesting in 
her of the appropriation for the Agricultural College; 
on the contrary, she rejoices in the fact that her halls 
have been officially set apart for the free education of 
the youth of the State, as well as in the fact that in the 
same Act of 1869 the State made the Governor and other 
high officials ex-officio members of her Board of Trustees, 
and added to the Board six new Trustees from Middle 
and West T'ennessee,”” because these provisions marked 
  
that the University receives ‘its foundation and endowments by 
the munificence of the United States Government and that of the 
State Government.’ (Appendix H, sec. 10.) 
115. There was, of course, the indirect gift of the lands of the 
Western District.

the fact, so full of glorious meaning, that the University 
had become essentially the State University and the 
official head of its educational system. 
Shortly after the passage of the Act of 1869 the 
Trustees accepted the trust which it imposed and agreed 
to establish the Agricultural College. They at once took 
‘steps to carry out the provisions of this Act, and in May 
of the same year were able to notify the Governor that 
they had complied with all the conditions of the appro- 
priation. In June the Board organized the Industrial 
College, and in September following it went into opera- 
tion." 
Iregret that I must again pause, while dwelling on 
these auspicious events, to note the fact that even under 
_ the Act of 1862, the State has been in certain particulars 
unfaithful to its trust. 
The first instance apparently originated in careless- 
ness. Both the Acts of Congress and of the State had 
specifically provided that all expenses incurred in the 
sale of the scrip and investment of its proceeds should 
be paid by the State out of its own Treasury." Never- 
theless, in spite of these plain provisions, the State, in 
  
118. See White’s Early History of the University, p. 118, and 
chapter on the ‘‘ University of Tennessee” in Merriam’s Higher 
Education in Tennessee, p. 71. This chapter was written by Prof. 
T. C. Karns, and is a scholarly contribution to the history of our 
University, fittingly supplementing as to the later period the work 
done by Col. White for the earlier. Iam indebted to Prof. Karns’ 
article for most of the information gathered as to the history of the 
University since the Civil War. 
“119. The act of Congress had contained this express provision, 
to the end that ‘‘the entire proceeds of the sales of said lands 
shall be applied without diminution whatever ’’ to the endowment 
of the Colleges (Appendix G, Sec. 3), and the Tennessee Legisla- 
ture had directed in the Act of 1868, accepting the Congressional 
grant, that all the costs and expenses incurred in obtaining and set- 
tling the land scrip and investing the proceeds in bonds should be 
paid out of the State treasury.’’ Acts of 1867-68, chap. 82, p. 33.

1868, allowed items aggregating over thirty-three hun- 
dred dollars, for brokerage fee, express charges and 
other expenses incurred in selling the scrip and buying 
the bonds,” to be deducted from the proceeds of the 
scrip, retaining also in her own hands a cash balance 
of over four hundred dollars, that had remained unex- 
pended. The amount of these expenses and cash balance 
was not paid over to the University until 1881, and then 
without interest,” so that the University lost on these 
two items the interest for about eleven years, or roundly 
speaking, about twenty-two hundred dollars. 
But far more serious, and without justification, was 
the conduct of the State in regard to the payment of the 
interest on the State bonds, constituting the endowment 
in which the Agricultural fund had been invested. 
The Act of Congress had provided that the proceeds 
of the sale of the scrip should be invested in ‘‘stock of 
the United States, or of the State, or some other safe 
stocks * * the interest of which shall be inviolably 
appropriated * * to the endowment, support and 
maintenance of the College,” and the State itself, under 
its Act of 1868, had directed that the interest on the 
bonds should ‘‘be paid over semi-annually.” 
Nevertheless, impartial history must relate the fact, 
though she fain would drop a tear to blot out the record, 
that in spite of this sacred obligation to preserve 
inviolable the interest on this fund, again and again, 
  
120. From a memorandum entitled “Manhattan Company of 
New York, in account with Agricultural College Scrip,’ now in pos- 
session of James Comfort, Esq., treasurer of the University, and 
written, as he informs me, by the late Robert Craighead, a former 
treasurer, it appears that the Manhattan Company sold 1,875 pieces 
of scrip for the State and bought $396,000 bonds with the proceeds, 
after deducting the following items: $3,292.80 expenses of counter- 
signing, affixing seal, etc.; $420.75 expressage; and $495 commis- 
sions, making total expenses of $4,208.55, and leaving a cash bal- 
ance of $466.45.

especially in the years just after the establishment of 
the Industrial College, when the University’s Treasury 
-was well nigh depleted with the drains made upon it in 
complying with the conditions of the appropriation, and 
‘when most of all the Agricultural College needed sup- 
. port and maintenance, the State not only repeatedly and 
injuriously delayed the payment of the interest on its 
bonds, oftentimes forcing the University to borrow 
money to meet its current expenses, but when it did pay, 
frequently paid, not in cash, but in depreciated State 
warrants, which the University was obliged, at great 
-loss, to peddle upon the open market for what they 
would bring.” 
The Treasurer’s report shows that between the years 
1873 and 1877 the University lost over twelve thousand 
dollars by this payment in depreciated warrants alone. 
In 1875 the Legislature appointed a committee to 
inquire into this matter, but nothing was ever done; no 
reparation has as yet been made to the University. ™ 
The State is bound by every principle of simple jus- 
tice, and of trust obligation to make good this loss to 
the University. It is furthermore under strict legal 
obligation so to do by virtue of the provision in the Act 
of Congress that ‘‘if any portion of the fund invested

Biennial Report of Trustees, cited in Note 118, supra, p. 50. 
124. The committee was required to investigate both the matter 
of the expenses deducted from the proceeds of land scrip and the 
failure of the State in payment of interest, and to obtain the opinion 
of the Attorney General of the State as to whether the State had 
fully performed its obligation. (Resolution No. 33, adopted Feb. 15, 
1875, Acts of 1875, p. 298). Nothing was done in regard to the 
expenses until partial compensation was made, as we have seen in 
1881, and nothing whatever in regard to the interest.

any action or contingency, be diminished or lost, it shalt 
be replaced by the State to which it belongs, so that the 
capital of the fund shall remain forever undiminished; 
and the annual interest thereon shall be regularly applied, 
without diminution” to the support of the College. 
Financial trouble at the time may, perchance, be 
urged in palliation of the conduct of the State in these 
matters; but this reason can no longer delay the making 
of reparation. 
It is a relief to turn from this melancholy page to 
the story of that auspicious year of 1879, ever memor- 
able in the history of our University, in which the 
Legislature, by changing her name to the ‘‘ University 
of Tennessee,”™ giving her the proud privilege of 
bearing the name of the State, and by also providing 
for the more general distribution of the Trustees 
throughout the entire State, and for a Board of Visitors, 
three from gach Grand Division of the State,” sol- 
emnly attested, under the Great Seal of State, that the 
University had in name, as well as in fact, become the 
State University, of the entire State and for the entire 
State, and was no longer a mere academy of one of its 
geographical sub-divisions.

127. Resolution No. 88, adopted March 24, 1879 (Acts of 1879, 
p. 888). This Act provided that no further vacancies should be 
filled in the Board of Trustees until the number should become 
reduced under thirty, and that in filling subsequent vacancies pref- 
erence should be given to Congressional districts not represented in 
the Board, until each district should have at least one representa- 
tive. (Sec. 1). 
In a resolution adopted by the Legislature January 24, 1893, it is. 
stated that the appointment of the Board of Visitors has lapsed, 
and is no longer necessary on account of the election of the Trustees. 
from the different Congressional districts. (Senate Joint Resolution 
No. 19, Acts of 1893, p. 459.)

We also rejoice in the fact that in this same year the 
Legislature, by providing for the appointment of State 
students in the University, by public examinations of 
the candidates for scholarships under the supervision of 
the superintendents of public schools of the various 
cities and counties, and the selection of the appointees 
from the candidates thus qualified, took the last and 
most important step in bringing the University into 
harmony with the public school system of the State, 
making the University what it should be, the cap-stone 
of the public school system of the entire State, drawing 
its support from the public schools, on the one hand, 
and, on the other, forming the natural complement to 
the education of these schools. 
Small wonder it was that at the commencement exer- 
cises of 1879 the inaugural ceremonies of the new 
“University of Tennessee” were celebrated with much 
pomp and ceremonial in connection with the installation 
of the distinguished Board of Visitors that had been 
appointed by the Governor.

condition that it should carry out all the provisions

served to increase the solemn obligation of the Uni- 
versity to the National Government, to fulfill in its 
Agricultural College the purpose of these gifts, and to 
faithfully maintain the College as one whose leading 
object shall be to ‘‘teach such branches of learning as 
are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts * * *

* He has made so many more of them. It is the ‘‘com- 
ton people” whom these agricultural colleges are 
intended primarily to reach; the industrial classes who 
constitute the strength and bulwark of the State. By 
‘the wise legislation of Congress, supplemented by the 
-- wise legislation of the State, bringing the University 
of Tennessee into close harmony with the public school 
“system, it is the manifest destiny of the University to 
"give an education to every industrious youth within her 
borders who shall deserve it and desire it. 
The correct aim of the University is nowhere so well 
expressed as in the words of Dr. Charles W. Dabney, the 
forceful thinker and capable executive to whose revivify- 
ing energy and ability the University owes so much of 
its present prosperity, who in speaking of the objects of 
“this class of colleges as expressed in the Act of Con- 
gress, says: ‘‘As interpreted by the best authorities 
. and illustrated by the best institutions,” the language of 
the Act ‘‘means that these colleges are to teach the 
sciences, and train the youth in the methods, of the two 
* “great producing industries, farming and manufacturing, 
including planting, stock raising, mining, engineering, 
both mechanical and civil, and general business. ‘They 
were to be polytechnic institutes, not mere manual labor 
or industrial schools—though scientific men, engineers 
and farmers should all be trained to work with their 
hands—but schools of the natural sciences, of engineer- 
ing and technology; not schools to train farm laborers, 
miners, mechanriics, and mere artisans, for these can be 
trained best on the farm, in the mine, or the shop, but 
institutes for the education, in the broadest sense of that 
word, of the future scientific agriculturist, the mining 
engineer and metallurgist, the mechanical engineer and 
the manufacturer, of our country.” ™

that the best resource of the South is its people, that 
the best way to develop its wealth is to develop the 
capacities of its people; to train and educate our own 
youth so that we shall not need to import foreign 
engineers, foreign mineralogists and other foreign men 
of science, but shall obtain from among our own chosen 
youth those who shall lead in our industrial future. 
These schools protest that the South, in ante bellum 
days, in the education of her favored sons, devoted her 
attention too exclusively to classic literature and the 
polite arts, and that it is folly to continue as Huxley 
says: ‘‘in this age of full modern artillery to turn out 
our boys to battle in it, equipped only with the sword 
and shield of an ancient gladiator.” ™ 
It would be inappropriate for me to fail to-day to 
make some reference to that formidable enterprise which 
was undertaken with such fear and trembling and reluc- 
tance one year ago: the admission of blue eyes and rosy 
cheeks within the academic halls. We have had one 
year’s experiment. The reports of the professors, if 
they have not been bewitched by the brightness of those 
eyes, indicate not only that Tennessee yet has daugh- 
ters as bright and fair as charming Barbara Blount, and 
who, like her, are entitled to be classed as not only 
attentive, but also diligent, and also ingenious, but they, 
furthermore, indicate that the experiment has been most 
successful, and are full of encouragement to those who 
believe that the daughters of the State are entitled to 
be educated as thoroughly as her sons, and that the 
giving to them of this education, side by side with their 
brothers and the brothers of the other girls, will not 
detract from their feminine charms, nor deprive them of 
their graces, but will, on the contrary, in the generous 
tivalry of the schools, stimulate both the young men 
and women to higher excellence.

  My tongue, however, doth not, I fear, trip easily in 
this new and double academic language, and if, in what 
“LT have yet to say, I shall fail to make mention of the 
young women every time I speak of the young men, I 
can only make the same apology as the preacher who 
had excited the ire of the female portion of his congre- 
- gation by his apparent neglect of their sex in beginning 
his Sermon simply: ‘‘My dearly beloved brethren,” his 
justification being that ‘‘the brethren always embrace 
the sisters.” 
‘There is one anomaly in our University affairs of 
which this is also an appropriate time to speak, the fact 
that its Alumni have, as such, no voice or participation 
in its management. There is not, I believe, a successful 
large university in America in which this anomaly exists. 
Ican speak with certain knowledge of but one—Harvard. 
There the Board of Overseers are elected by and from 
the graduates. It is certainly most fit and appropriate 
that part, at least, of the management of the affairs of 
a university should be entrusted to her sons, devoted to 
her by the ties of filial gratitude, and interested above 
all others in her welfare and prosperity; for who shall 
care for a mother, if not her sons? 
It is a difficult thing to inspire Alumni enthusias- 
tically to come to annual conclaves under the stimulus 
merely of dry speeches and equally dry dining. Let 
them feel that at their annual meetings they shall have 
some voice in the affairs of the University. We do not 
ask to control the University, but we respectfully urge 
that consent be given to some provision by which at least 
a certain proportion of future Trustees shall be selected 
from the Alumni and elected by them; and, mark my 
word, no step will ever be taken that will more redound 
to the prosperity of the University. 
And now, before I close, may I be permitted to con- 
fess that while I believe that the opinions I have quoted
-P-A-G-E-109
—80— 
from Dr. Dabney are sound, and that our young men 
need, most of all, and especially at the present day, the 
education which he has outlined; yet, in my heart of 
hearts, Iam glad that Congress, in defining the leading 
objects of our College, still retained the words, ‘‘with- 
out excluding * * * * classical studies.” 
I say this, because I believe that there comes 
from the study of the classics, and the familiar com- 
munion with the world’s great thinkers which it involves, 
that rounded and symmetrical development of the entire. 
mental man, which the mere specialist never gets, and 
which is essential to real strength, so that, in the end, it 
will often, if not generally, happen, that the broadly 
educated man will, even in practical things, outstrip the 
specialist in his own specialty. I cannot forget that 
Gladstone, greatest statesman of modern times, received 
the highest classical training that England’s universities 
could give. 
But I say this yet more earnestly because I do not 
believe the world is yet prepared to forget the classical 
literature, and because I believe that the youth who has 
been trained only in strictly scientific and technical pur- 
suits, who has closed his ears to the beautiful songs of 
antiquity, who has refused to open his mind to the great 
thoughts of the world’s great masters, as expressed in its 
deathless literature, even if he achieve material success, 
will yet miss the best of life; for he will never have 
walked in that ‘‘right path of a virtuous and noble edu- 
cation,” of which Milton wrote, ‘‘so smooth, so green, so 
full of goodly prospects and melodious sounds on every 
side, that the harp of Orpheus was not more charming,” 
and he will go down to his grave, not having heard the 
music that murmured all around him, nor seen the 
pictures of ineffable beauty that lay open in every noble 
book. 
One word more and I am done. As the University 
to-day reviews her past history, her voice may well have

the ring of triumph and achievement, for in spite of all 
obstacles, she has steadily been true to her ideal and 
faithful to her precious trust; she has ever kept trimmed 
and burning the lamp of learning and of scholarship. 
She will start upon her second century as a victor 
that hath lived down all popular prejudice; exalted as 
the official head of the educational system of the State; 
the venerable and dignified institution, upon whose 
future, more than any other of the State, hangs the wel- 
fare of generations yet unborn; qualified in the amplest 
manner to give the very best education that the age 
affords ; stronger than ever before; rich in students, but 
‘ richer yet in wisdom and ripened experience; with 
bright visions of future usefulness before her eyes, asa 
great and magnificently equipped State University, 
whose ramifying influences shall extend into every 
village and hamlet within the border of the Common- 
wealth; who shall not only give to each youth that 
training for which he hath greatest need and which 
shall.do him most valiant service, but shall also, ever 
faithful to her high calling, by her tradition and teach- 
ings, inspire her students with the ideal of those scholars 
described by Milton: ‘inflamed with the study of learn- 
ing and the admiration of virtue; stirred up with high 
hopes of living to be brave men and worthy patriots, 
dear to God and famous to all.” 
And as our University shall train her youth in those 
pursuits that make for wealth, so too, as wealth shall be 
developed in the community, bringing with it, as it 
always does, well earned rest and more attention to the 
polite arts, to the graces and luxuries of life, to those 
things that lift life above mere money-getting and make 
it a thing of joy and beauty, it shall be that those arts 
which make for culture and refinement shall also keep 
their homes within the walls of our University, which 
shall ever be the abiding place, not only of that which 
is practical, but also of that which is ideal. 
And so it shall come to pass that when the harmoni-
-P-A-G-E-113
— 82 — 
ous voices of all the universities in the land shall swell 
loud and triumphant the national anthem of true educa- 
tion, there will be realized the prophetic words of 
Emerson: ‘‘I see in all directions the light breaking. 
Trade and government will not alone be the favored aims 
of mankind, but every useful, every elegant art, every 
exercise of imagination, the height of reason, the 
noblest affection, the purest religion, will find their 
home in our institutions and write our laws for the 
benefit of men.”

APPENDIX B. 
HISTORICAL NOTE as to the controversy between the United States, Tennessee, 
and North Carolina, as tothe owneiship of vacant lands in Tennessee, and 
the right to perfect titles therein, with special reference to the Congressional 
Cession Act of 1806, 
By various enactments from 1782 to 1784, inclusive, North Caro- 
lina, whose Western boundary then extended, subject to unextin- 
guished Indian titles, to the Mississippi River, provided for the 
issuance to the soldiers and officers of her continental line, as com- 
pensation for their services in the Revolutionary war, of warrants 
of survey to be located in the western part of the State, in what is 
uow Tennessee, on a tract reserved for that purpose around Nash- 
ville, known as the Military Reservation, or, if there was not suffi- 
cient tillable land in this reservation, then upon any other unappro- 
priated lands in the State. *3¢ 
In 1783 also, in order to redeem the large amount of specie cer- 
tificates which she had issued to defray the expenses of the war and 
to dispose of her surplus western lands, North Carolina opened an 
entry taker’s office, afterwards known as John Armstrong’s office, 
for the entry of land west to the Mississippi River, except within

a certain tract reserved for the Cherokees, 18” the price of the land 
being payable either in cash, specie, certificates or certain other 
designated certificates. +** 
‘‘ Nearly all the holders of specie certificates, and many others, 
embraced the provisions of the Act, and obtained incipient titles to 
lands +to be laid out in the Western territory of the State, and to 
which grants were subsequently to issue. * * * 
“Tn the month of December, in the year 1789, the State of North 
Carolina ceded to the United States all that portion of the Western 
territory which now constitutes the State of Tennessee. * * * 
At the period of the cession many of the military land war- 
rants of the officers and soldiers of the North Carolina line, had 
not beenissued. Other claims were floating and unlocated to any 
particular spot or parcel of land, and their number and amount 
were unascertained. Many other claims had been located and 
entered upon particular spots or parcels of land, to the claimants of 
which no grant had issued, and thus the titles remained incom- 
plete.’’ 189 . 
It was in view of this state of affairs that North Carolina in her 
Act of cession specifically provided, among other express condi- 
tions, that her officers and soldiers should have the right to lay off 
any lands to which they were entitled within the limits of the 
reservation already allotted them, and that if the reservation should 
not contain a sufficient quantity of lands fit for cultivation, such 
deficiency should be made up out of any other portion of the ceded 
territory; that when lawful entries previously made within the 
territory had not been perfected by grant, the Governor of North 
Carolina should, from time to time, perfect such titles; that all 
rights of occupancy and pre-emption should be preserved ; and that 
all entries previously made in John Armstrong’s office which inter- 
fered with prior entries, might be removed and located on any other 
part of the ceded territory. Subject, however, to the foregoing and 
other expressed conditions, North Carolina ceded to the United 
States all her right, title and claims ‘‘to the sovereignty and terri- 
tory’? of the ceded lands, and declared that they should ‘ be con- 
sidered as a common fund for the use and benefit of the United 
States of America, North Carolina inclusive, and should be faith- 
fully disposed of for that purpose, and for no other use or purpose

whatever,’ one of the purposes of the cession, as expressed in 
the Act, being to give the United States further revenues for extin- 
guishing the National debt. 14° 
In 1796 Congress admitted Tennessee into the Union, the Act 
declaring her ‘‘to be one of the United States of America, on an 
equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever',”” but 
being silent as to the ownership or right of disposition of the vacant 
and unappropriated lands lying within the boundaries of the State.*#* 
As might have been expected in this state of affairs, it was not 
long before a tripartite controversy arose as to the right of disposi- 
tion of these lands. 
North Carolina, even after the admission of Tennessee into the 
Union, actively ‘‘ continued to exercise the powers which she had 
reserved to herself in the cession act, from its date in 1789 until the 
year 1803, and continued to issue grants and perfect titles to lands 
lying within the State of Tennessee, according to the reservation 
which she had made to herself in the act of cession.’’ 142 It was not 
long, however, before Tennessee, in the exercise of her new sov- 
ereignty, began to assert title to the vacant land within her bor- 
ders and to insist that North Carolina was exceeding her reserved 
powers. 
The causes of the dispute between North Carolina and Tennessee, 
and the grounds of the contention on the part of Tennessee, are 
stated in a memorial made to Congress by the Tennessee Legisla- 
ture, as follows: 
“At the time this (cession) act was passed. by North Carolina 
and accepted by the United States, the time limited by the laws of 
. that State, within which the claimants of land were required to 
have their surveys finished and to procure grants, expired in the 
year 1792, and there was no reservation in said act of cession that 
North Carolina might enlarge the time of making surveys and 
issuing grants; and it would seem as if North Carolina had no other 
‘right to perfect titles on unsatisfied claims, except such as she 
could exercise within the time limited by her laws, which expired 
in the year 1792. 
“The State of North Carolina, after the year 1792, discovered 
that from the Indian wars, and the unsettled state of the country, 
but small progress had been made towards completing and return-

ing the surveys by her officers, and, being unwilling that her citi- 
zens should lose their claims, extended the time by different acts 
for making and returning surveys, until about the year 1800. 145 
‘In the meantime the State of Tennessee was admitted into the 
Union, in the year 1796, as an independent State and her constitu- 
tion accepted by the United States. Upon the admittance of this 
State into the Union, and the acceptance of her constitution, no 
condition was imposed which would deprive her of the right to the 
ungranted lands within her limits. Tennessee, accordingly, in the 
year 1799, asserted her right to the ungranted land as a consequence 
of her possessing an independent and sovereign government. The 
holders of warrants issued by North Carolina, she insisted, had no 
right to survey and obtain grants for lands unless these grants had 
been issued within the time limited by the Jaws of North Carolina 
when the cession from the State was made, in 1789; and that the 
United States had ceased to possess any right to the vacant land by 
not reserving her claim when Tennessee was admitted into the 
Union as an independent State.” 144 
The Tennessee Act of 1799 referred to in the memorial was an 
act passed January 5th, 1799, for the purpose of ‘‘ establishing 
offices for receiving entries of claims for all vacant lands within the 
several counties of the State.1** This act was, however, never 
enforced by Tennessee, its operation being from time to time sus- 
pended by successive acts passed in 1799, 1801, 1803 and 1805. ++¢ 
_ On November Ist, 1801], however, the Tennessee Legislature 
passed an act reciting that ‘‘it appears by communications made 
to this General Assembly, by the Senators of this State in the Con- 
gress of the United States, that the United States claim a right to 
dispose of the vacant and unappropriated soil within the limits of 
this State,’ and, in order that a determination might be made 
whether the United States or Tennessee had this right, vesting the 
Senators and Representatives from Tennessee, or a majority of

inclusive, in regard to lands in Tennessee, including various extension acts.

them, ‘‘ with full power and authority as agents on the part of this 
State to claim the absolute right of disposing of the vacant and 
unappropriated soil within the same, and to have the claim of the 
United States and the claim of this State examined and deter- 
mined,” and ‘‘in order to prevent all future disputes,”’ authorizing 
them ‘‘ to procure from the United States a relinquishment of: their 
claim to said land, in such manner and upon such terms as to the 
said agents hereby appointed may deem proper.” 347 
Pending the settlement of this dispute with the United States, 
the Legislature, by an act passed November 14, 1801, confirmed all 
prior lawful entries made and warrants and grants issued by North 
Carolina for lands in Tennessee, as reserved by the act of cession, 
and provided for the issuance of Tennessee grants on such North 
Carolina warrants as had not been ripened into grants, but at the 
same time laid a penalty of $5,000 upon any person subsequently 
surveying any land in Tennessee ‘‘for the purpose of obtaining a 
title for such land from the State of North Carolina,” and provided 
that any grant so obtained from North Carolina should not be 
admitted as evidence in the Tennessee courts.!4# 
In 1802, the Tennessee Legislature adopted a joint resolution 
giving its Senators and Representatives instructions in regard to the 
dispute with the United States, 14° and on December 5, 1808, they 
submitted to Congress a written communication, in which they rep- 
resented ‘‘that the State of Tennessee, being particularly desirous 
to preserve that harmony which hath hitherto happily subsisted 
between the United States and that State,’’? had appointed them 
“commissioners, with full power to settle the disputes between the 
United States and said State, respecting the vacant and unappropri- 
ated lands lying within the limits of the State of Tennessee,’ and 
suggested the propriety of appointing commissioners on the part of 
the United States, with power to adjust and determine with them 
“all interfering claims of the United States and Tennessee to said 
vacant and unappropriated lands.’’ 15° . 
The claim of Tennessee to these vacant lands rested solely upon 
the shadowy and untenable ground, already quoted from the memo- 
rial of the Tennessee Legislature, that having been admitted by 
Congress in 1796 as ‘‘one of the United States of America, on an 
equal footing with the original States, in all respects whatever,”’

the ownership of the soil had passed to her, by implication, as an 
incident of political sovereignty. 15+ 
_ The United States, on the other hand, insisted that the ‘terri- 
tory of the lands’ having been expressly transferred by North Car- 
olina to the United States in 1789, subject only to certain specified 
conditions and reserved rights, as a common fund for the use and 
benefit of all the States in the Union, for the purpose of paying the 
national debt and otherwise, and Congress having never relinquished 
the title to the soil, either in the act admitting Tennessee into the 
Union or otherwise, this title still remained in the United States for 
the purposes expressed in the original cession, subject only to the 
rights and conditions specified in the cession, and that Tennessee, 
having been given no right of disposition of these lands in the act 
admitting her into the Union, this right was still retained by Con- 
gress. 
It is needless to say that no Western State would, to-day, think 
of making the claim then made by Tennessee under similar circum- 
stances, it being now familiar law that upon the admission of a ter- 
ritory as a State, the United States, nevertheless, retains title to all 
vacant lands within her borders, not expressly ceded to the State. 
While this dispute between Tennessee and the United States was 
being arbitrated, Tennessee, in the meantime, endeavored to adjust 
with North Carolina the rights of that State within the borders of 
Tennessee, and by an act passed November 8, 1803, reciting that 
“justice, the genius of our confederated government, and the prin- 
ciples of intercourse which should govern sister States, require, 
that any difference of opinion between North Carolina and Tennes- 
see respecting their essential interests should be terminated by 
friendly explanation and adjustment,’’? appointed John Overton, 
Esq., as ‘‘ an agent on the part of this State, to confer and agree 
with the Legislature of North Carolina, or such agent or agents as 
they might think-proper to appoint, respécting the land titles of this 
State, or any circumstance or case relating thereto, and to make 
such agreement, compromise or stipulation with the eaid State 
respecting the same as may be necessary to do justice to the citizens 
of both States,’”’ such stipulation to become the law of both States 
when agreed to and enacted by their respective legislatures. 252 
  
151. Thus it is stated in a report made to the U. 8. House of Representatives, 
January 24, 1882, on the “+ Cession of the Public Lands in Tennessee,” that the 
contention of Tennessee was “that with sovereignty the right of coil passed by 
the act of her admission into the Union, there being no reservation by Congress 
of that right in said act.” (Amer. St. Papers, Pub, Lands, vol. 5, p. 552.) 
"152, Acts of 1803, chap. 82; Scott’s Laws, vol. 1, p. 816; Whitney’s Land Laws, 
p. 54.
-P-A-G-E-122
—91 — 
By a subsequent act of the same session, outlining the duties of 
our agent and providing means for carrying his mission into effect, 
it was made ‘‘the duty of the said agent, if practicable, to settle 
the said differences conformable to the obligation of the law of 
nations by consulting the interests of both States.’ 15% 
On December 22, 1803, the Legislature of North Carolina, as 
a result of John Overton’s negotiations, passed an act, subject to 
the agreement and ratification of Tennessee, and to the assent of 
Congress, giving Tennessee “‘full power and authority to issue 
grants and perfect titles to all claims of lands ’’ lying in Tennessee, 
which, under the terms of the North Carolina cession act of 1789, 
remained and were reserved to be issued and perfected by North 
Carolina ‘‘in as full and ample a manner as the State of North Caro- 
lina possessed the same,’’ subject to certain specified conditions and 
restrictions, one of which was that North Carolina ‘‘ reserves exclu- 
sively the right of issuing military warrants.”’ 
On August 4th, 1804, the Tennessee Legislature passed an act, 
agreeing to and ratifying the said act of North Carolina, ‘‘as an 
agreement between this State and the State of North Carolina, 
vesting this State with full power and authority to issue grants and 
perfect titles to all claims of lands lying in this State in as full and 
ample a manner as the said State of North Carolina possessed the 
same, to all intents and purposes whatsoever, anything to the con-

However, the Committee of the United States House of Repre- 
sentatives, to whom the North Carolina act had been referred, 
recommended that Congress assent thereto only upon the express 
conditions that the same should not, in any manner, “affect or 
impair any right whatever, which accrued to the United States in 
virtue of ‘‘the North Carolina Act of Cession;’’ and, for the time 
being, Congress did not give its assent. 155 
In the meantime, however, pending these negotiations with 
North Carolina, our Representatives in Congress had continued 
to urge the claims of Tennessee to the vacant lands within her 
borders. On April 18, 1806, their efforts resulted in the act men- 
tioned in the text (p. 24), whereby Congress, ‘‘ for the purpose of

“a In July, 1806, Governor John Sevier called a special sessiun of 
the Legislature, to take action in reference to the settlements with 
the United States aud North Carolina. The following extracts from 
_ his message show clearly the spirit in which the Congressional 
claim was received, and the value put upon the relinquished lands, 
especially those south of French Broad and Holston, as well as the 
tenderness of sentiment then felt for the occupants in that region: 
‘In compliance with request at the last session, I have deemed it. 
expedient to convene the Legislature, in order to lay before them 
for their consideration, the Acts of Congress and State of North 
Carolina, together with the result of the mission of your agent to 
the latter, respecting the landed interest of the State of Tennessee. 
It must afford great satisfaction to discover this business brought so 
far towards a final and amicable adjustment with those govern- 
ments. The proposed liberal modifications by the national legisla- 
tion to our State, is such, if conceded to, I entertain no doubt, you 
will avail yourselves, will, in my opinion, ultimately ensure a per- 
manent security in all its relations touching the claims of the State, 
and individual citizens holding Jands under the laws of North Caro- 
lina, the basis on which the real property of this State has been 
derived. * * * * Among the very great objects you will have 
before you for legislative consideration, will be the situation and 
circumstance of the people settled on the south side of French 
Broad and Holston and west of Big Pigeon rivers. They are 
respectable and worthy inhabitants, who have suffered by Indian 
depredations in a manner too deplorable to relate—they are justly 
deserving the patronage and indulgence of a liberal and patriotic 
legislature ; and I entertain every hope that the paternal care of the 
Assembly will be tenderly exercised towards such a deserving and 
worthy class of citizens. * * * * 
The lands conceded to this State by the national government, 
especially those lying on the south of the French Broad and Hol- 
ston, and West of Big Pigeon rivers, will alone, inevitably, in the 
course of no distant period, furnish the treasury with considerable 
and ample funds, sufficient to enable the government to facilitate 
all the desirable and beneficent improvements calculated for the 
happiness and prosperity of the most opulent and long established 
republics. No additional burdens of taxation need ever be required 
or imposed on our feHow-citizens, and we may safely contemplate, 
-under the care of Divine Providence, with mild and salutary laws, 
on always continuing to be a free, happy and independent people. 
Very liberal and ample donations are now procured for the estab- 
lishment and support of several of the most ornamental and instruc- 
. tive seminaries of learning. I am sensible of your good disposition 
- to forward and promote so noble a work, and yield it all the aid and

dispatch within your power, and will readily discover the sooner » 
the same can be brought into operation ‘the greater will be the 
utility of such inestimable and useful institutions.’’ 15 
On September 6th, 1806, the legislature passed an act whereby 
it was enacted that the act of Congress of 1806, ‘‘be and the same 
is hereby accepted, ratified and confirmed to all intents and pur- 
poses by and on part of the State of Tennessee, and that the pro- 
visions thereof be carried into effect.”? 15° 
And on January 23, 1807, Tennessee’s Senators and Representa- 
tives in Congress, except Senator Joseph Anderson, who was absent, 
executed a written instrument, making known that in pursuance of 
the power vested in them by the Tennessee act of 1801 and the reso- 
lution of 1802, and in consideration of the provisions made in the 
act of Congress of 1806, they, ‘‘for and in behalf of the State of 
Tennessee, agree and declare, that all right, title and claim, which 
the State of Tennessee hath to the lands lying west and south’ of 
the Congressional reservation line, within the limits of Tennessee, 
‘shall hereafter forever cease, and the lands aforesaid * * * 
shall be and remain at the sole and entire disposition of the United 
States, and shall be exempt from every disposition or tax,’’ as 
specified in the act of Congress. This instrument was approved by 
the United States Senate on February 17, 1807, and ordered to be 
entered upon the journal, the original to be deposited in the office 
of the Secretary of State, 1%° 
In a report made to the Tennessee Legislature in 1821, by the 
Committee on Education, in which the history of this cession is 
cited, the committee express ‘‘the belief that the cession of the 
vacant soil made to the State of Tennessee, north and east of the 
reservation, resulted as much from a spirit of compromise, and to 
quiet the conflicting claims of the parties concerned as from an act 
of grace on the part of the Government of the United States.” 
The only ground stated by them for the faith that was in them, was 
the fact that Tennessee had been admitted into the Union on an

159, Acts of 1806, chap. 10, p. 53; Scott’s Laws, vol. 1, p. 936; Whitney’s Land 
Laws, p. 58. 
In this act the act of Congress is set out in full. It had been originally pro- 
posed to authorize the Senators and Representatives in Congress to execute the 
instrument of release provided for in th2 act of Congress, but this pian seems to 
have been dropped, (Senate Journal, July 29th and 30th, 1806, p. 8, eb seq.), and 
the act of September 6th substituted therefor. Oa August 2nd, 1806, a resolution. 
‘was adopted giving the thanks of the Legislature to their Senators and Repre- 
santatives in Congress ‘for the faithful discharge of the trust imposed in them.”

equal footing with the original States, supplemented by the peculiar 
argument that Tennessee had claimed these lands as early as 
1798, 163 
There can in fact, however, be little doubt but that the United 
States had the better title, and that the cession was intended by 
Congress and accepted by the State more as a gift than as a compro- 
mise. This is indicated not only by the relative strength of their 
claims, and by the language of Governor Sevier’s message, but by 
various incidental expressions of our judges and statesmen. Thus, 
in a decision of our Supreme Court, in the case of Lowry vs. Francis, 
2 Yerger’s Tennessee Reports, 588 (decided in 1881), Judge Catron 
states that the United States, before the cession, held the legal title 
to the public lands in Tennessee, and that Tennessee acquired 
the land east and north of the reservation line by the compact of 
1806 (p. 587), subject to the conditions of the North Carolina session 
(p. 589), and in the case of George vs. Gamble, 2 Overton’s Tenn. 
Reports, 170, at 172, Judge White, in delivering the opinion, states 
that the constitutional convention of 1796, were ‘‘aware that the 
United States would ultimately have the disposal of the vacant 
land within the State of Tennessee.’’ 
So, in a report made to the Legislature in 1837, by the select 
committee on the Ocoee district, referring to the lands in that 
district, which were part of the ceded lands east and north of 
the Congressional line, it is said that the title to these lands was 
ceded to the United States by North Carolina and ‘the title thereto 
remained in the General Government until 1806.”” 162 
Tbe Congressional Reservation Line began where the main 
branch of Elk River crosses the southern boundary of the State; 
thence due north (following almost exactly the present line of the 
L. & N. R.R) to Duck River (near Columbia); thence north- 
westerly, down Duck River, (nearly to Centreville): thence due 
west to the Tennessee River; thence northerly down the Tennessee 
River to the northern boundary of the State. It is sometimes called 
the Elk River Line, on account of the point of beginning. (Memo- 
rial of Tennessee Legislature, Amer. State Papers, Pub. Lands, 
vol. 8, p. 236.) 
The territory west and south of this line, title to which was 
reserved by the United States (subject to unextinguished Indian 
titles), included all that portion of the State lying te the extreme 
west of the Tennessee River, and the territory east thereof com- 
prised in the present counties of Hardin, Wayne, Lawrence and 
Lewis, and portions of Perry, Hickman, Maury and Giles.

The territory ceded to Tennessee, east and north of the line, 
comprised, broadly speaking, the eastern two-thirds of the 
State, +°* embracing, approximately, from sixteen to seventeen 
million acres, of which, after satisfying all North Carolina claims 
that were located east and north of this line, there remained un- 
located in 1838, according to a memorial made by the Legislature of 
Tennessee to the Congress of the United States, about eight million 
acres, the most of which the memorialists declared, in language 
that sounds strangely enough to-day, ‘‘is mountainous, unfit for 
cultivation, uninhabited, and must be so for centuries.’’ (Joint 
Resolution No.1, passed Jan. 5, 1838, Acts of 1837-38, p. 443; 
Whitney’s Land Laws of Tennessee, p. 522.) 
There. was, however, a considerable portion of the territory 
ceded to Tennessee lying in the south-eastern portion of the State, 
and mainly within the tract reserved by North Carolina in 1783 for 
the Cherokee Indians, to which the Indian title had not been, in 
1806, extinguished, but as this territory, with other lands, was 
gradually ceded by the Cherokees in successive treaties made with 
them by the United States at the Cherokee Agency in 1817, at 
Washington City in 1819, and at New Echotain 1835, the benefit 
accrued to Tennessee by virtue of the Qongressional cession of 1806, 
and the unencumbered title to the soil became gradually vested in 
the State. 764 
The territory obtained by the two treaties of 1819 and 1835 was 
created into the Hiwassee and Ocoee Districts of Tennessee, re- 
spectively. 16> 
Immediately upon the acceptance of the Congressional cession the 
Tennessee Legislature authorized all the vacant land that had been 
ceded to her, except that south of French Broad and Holston, to be 
entered and granted for the purpose of satisfying the reserved North 
Carolina claims, 1°* and kept open her offices continually for this 
purpose.

report cited, supra. Note 40, p. 33.

In 1811, however, there being still many unsatisfied North Caro- 
lina claims, and most of the vacant arable land east and north of 
‘the Reservation Line having been granted, North Carolina, pro~ 
ceeding on the theory that since by the compact of 1804 she had only 
relinquished to Tennessee the right to perfect titles in Tennessee 
subject to the assent of Congress, and that Congress had in the Act 
of 1806 only consented to the compact so far as the territory east and 
north of the Reservation Line was concerned, she, therefore, still 
retained her_original right to perfect titles west and south of this 
- line, without requesting Tennessee to permit her to resume the power 
vested in Tennessee by the compact, passed an Act authorizing 
surveys to be made in Tennessee west and south of this line on her 
unsatisfied claims, and proceeded to perfect titles on such sur- 
veys. 167 
The first notice given to Tennessee ‘‘ was the appearance of a 
surveyor to do the duties of his office.” He proceeded at once to 
receive warrants and make surveys, and prior to October, 1812, 
North Carolina had issued grants for about 50,000 acres of the best 
land in Tennessee, lying west and south of the Reservation 
Line. 168 
At once the Tennessee Legislature passed a prohibitory Act 
. declaring that the North Carolina Act was ‘ not only a direct viola- 
' tion of the contract aforesaid, but an infringement of the right of 
sovereignty possessed by the State of Tennessee, declaring all 
grants issued under the North Carolina act to be void, forbidding 
them to be read in evidence in her courts, imposing a penalty of 
$5,000 on any surveyor who should survey land under the North 
Carolina act, or register who should record such grant, and a fine 
of $1,000 and disbarment for ten years upon any lawyer who should 
begin a suit upon such North Carolina claim. 169 
Thereupon North Carolina apparently desisted from her efforts 
to enforce the act of 1811. But about the year 1815 her Legisla- 
ture presented a memorial to Congress claiming the right to perfect 
titles in Tennessee south and west of the reservation line, complain- 
ing against so much of the act of 1806 as authorized the appropria- 
tion by Tennessee of 200,000 acres for the use of colleges and acade- 
mies, and seeking the partial repeal of the act of 1806. 17°

To this the Tennessee Legislature replied by a counter memorial 
in 1817, denying the right of North Carolina to perfect titles in any 
part of Tennessee, and ‘protesting against the repeal of any part of 
the act of 1806, but stating that ‘‘all, or nearly all of the vacant 
land fit for cultivation ’’ east and north of the reservation line had 
been already granted, leaving ‘‘ yet remaining, many warrants un- 
satisfied ’’ without land out of which to satisfy them, and praying 
Congress to pass an act supplemental to the act of 1806, authorizing 
Tennessee to. perfect unsatisfied North Carolina claims out of any 
vacant land south and west of the reservation line. In this memo- 
rial Tennessee insisted that North Carolina had no cause to com- 
plain of the “‘ liberality of the United States’ in regard to the appro- 
priation for the colleges and academies, upon the ground that as no 
North Carolina statute had ever authorized grants to issue south of 
the French Broad and Holston, and Tennessee had, by the North 
Carolina act of 1803, been prohibited from issuing grants in this 
' territory, the permission given by Congress to Tennessee to make 
an appropriation for the support of educational seminaries in this 
territory was no injury to the citizens of North Carolina. +71 
The cession act of 1806 had contained the express proviso that if 
the territory ceded to Tennessee ‘‘ shall not contain a sufficient 
quantity of land fit for cuJtivation, according to the true intent and 
meaning of the original (North Carolina) act of cession, including 
the lands within the limits reserved by the State of North Carolina 
to the Cherokee Indians, to perfect all legal existing claims charged 
thereon, by the conditions contained in this act of cession, Congress 
will hereafter provide by law for perfecting such as. cannot be 
locuted in the territory aforesaid, out of the lands lying west and 
south of the before described line. 7? 
Accordingly, on April 4th, 1818, “after the Indian title, by a 
treaty made with the Chickasaw tribe of Indians, had been extin- 
guished to all that portion of the country south and west of the 
Congressional reservation line, to which that tribe had previously 
claimed title, and over which they exercised dominion,’’ Congress 
passed an act authorizing Tennessee to issue grants and perfect 
titles within the territory south and west of the reservation line to 
all valid special entries and locations that had been made in this 
southwestern territory under North Carolina laws prior to the deed 
of cession, and also to issue grants within said territory on all valid 
warrants of survey, interferring entries, certificates, grants and 
locations that had not been actually located or granted east and

north of the reservation line, and that were removable under the 
North Carolina cession act, in the same manner as Tennessee then 
issued grants to lands east and north of said line. ‘This act made 
no provision similar to that of 1806 for the benefit of children’s 
- schools. 174. 
In pursuance of this: act of Congress, Tennessee, in 1819, opened 
& land office for the satisfaction of all valid North Carolina claims 
south and west of the reservation line, the time for the adjudication 
- and satisfaction of such claims being extended in 1821, 1823, 1827, 
» and from year to year thereafter until 1839. 174 
In 1825 the Tennessee Legislature memorialized Congress, repre~ 
senting that, owing to a large number of North Carolina claims 
which had to be satisfied out of the territory east and north of the 
Congressional reservation line, she had been able to set apart only 
22,705 acres for ber school fund instead of one thirty-sixth part of 
the entire territory, as contemplated by the cession act of 1806, (see 
note 80, p. 26, supra), and requesting Congress to cede to her the 
remaining vacant land south and west of the reservation line for 
the parpose of making good her school fund, pledging the State to 
appropriate the lands to this purpose, 17 
But although Mr. Polk, as chairman of the select committee to 
whom these memorials were referred, recommended that they be 
granted, and reported a bill to that effect, no action was taken. 176 
From.a report made by 8. T. Ingram, Secretary of the Treasury» 
to.the United States House of Representatives in 1830, based upon 
a report of the Commissioner of the general land office, and a letter 
from Daniel Graham, the Secretary of State of Tennessee, it 
appears (there being slight discrepancies in the figures as given 
by the different officials, and also errors in their calculations), 
that the total area south and west.of the reservation line was 
estimated at 6,840,000 acres, of which 942,375 acres had been 
granted by North Carolina previous to the cession of 1789, and 
3,567,801 (or 4,567,801) acres had been adjudicated by Tennessee 
since the act of 1818, leaving, subject to the disposition of the

United States, 2,353,824 (or 3,353,824) acres of unappropriated 
lands, which were supposed to be of little value, Daniel Graham 
estimating that one-twentieth of them could be sold at 12}¢ cents 
an acre and one-fifth at one cent. 177 
Mr. Polk said of this vacant land: ‘‘ Twelve and a half cents 
per acre is believed to be a fair price for much the greater portion 
of it that is worth appropriating at any price. Much of it consists 
of* barrens and hills that are not worth the annual taxes required to 
be paid by the State, and will not be taken up at all. *7° 
‘ But although in 1830 and 1832, committees of the United States 
House of Representatives recommended a cession to Tennessee of 
the vacant land south and west of the reservation line for the pur- 
pose of creating a school fund, +7° and although, in a memorial of 
the Tennessee legislature, in 1838, Tennessee offered to refund to 
the United States all sums the State might receive ‘‘ over and above 
648,961, the number of ‘acres of school lands, deficit to the State 
(calculated on the basis of one section to every thirty-six), after 
paying the expenses necessarily incurred,”’ 1*° such legislation was 
not enacted. 
Finally, however, in 1848, Congress, finding that the remainder 
of the public lands would scarcely pay for the expense of sale, made 
Tennessee its agent for the disposal of al! unappropriated lands 
south and west of the reservation line, authorizing Tennessee, after 
satisfying all valid North Carolina claims and pre-emption rights, 
to sell the residue, paying over the proceeds annually to the United 
States, 1#1

APPENDIX C. 
HISTORICAL NOTE as to the legislation and treaties of North Carolina, the 
United States and the Government of Franklin, in regard to the Indian 
boundary line so far as relates to the territory embraced in the tract reserved 
by North Carolina for the Cherokees in 1788, 
So-early as 1777, by a treaty held at Fort Henry, near the Long 
Island of the Holston, between commissioners of North Carolina 
and the Cherokee Indians, there had been established, as the 
_ boundary between the whites and the Indians, an irregular line 
running across the northeastern corner of the State, midway 
between the present sites of Greeneville and Jonesboro, the Chero- 
kees retaining title to all lands south and west of this line, and the 
whites being forbidden to build, plant, improve, settle, hunt, or 
drive stock below it.1** This treaty was transmitted to the North 
Carolina legislature but never recorded or formally ratified. 185 
In November, 1777, the North Carolina legislature passed an act 
establishing Washington county, with the present boundaries of 
the State of Tennessee, extending westward to the Mississippi, 
without any reservation as to Indian boundaries. 18° At this same 
session an act was also passed establishing offices for the entry of 
lands in all the counties of the State. 1%” Under this act various 
entries were made in. Washington county southwest of the Indian 
boundary line as fixed by the treaty of 1777. 18® Accordingly, the

North Carolina legislature, in April, 1778, passed an amendatory 
and so-called explanatory act, forbidding for the future any person 
“to presume to enter or survey any lands within the Indian hunt- 
ing grounds, or without the limits of the land heretofore ceded by 
the Indians or conquered from them, which limits westward ’”’ were 
declared to be the boundary line established by the treaty of 1777 
(though without naming it), declaring all entries and surveys which 
had been, or might be made within the Indian boundaries to be 
utterly void, and ordering the entry takers to refund all monies 
previously paid them for the purpose of obtaining such entries. 1*° 
In 1781, the further entry of land was forbidden. 19° 
But, in 1788, the act of 1781 was repealed, and by an extraordi- 
nary exercise of arbitrary power, perhaps based upon the‘ idea 
of actual conquest, without consultation with the Cherokees, 
or so much as saying by your leave, and in violation of the 
treaty of 1777 and the act of 1778, the western boundary of North 
Carolina was declared to be ‘‘enlarged and established’”’ so as to 
extend westward to the Mississippi river, there being, however, 
“reserved ”’ unto “the Cherokee Indians and their nation forever”’ 
all the territory in the present State of Tennessee, lying west of the 
Big Pigeon river, south of the French Broad and east of the Ten- 
nessee, together with some lands in the present State of North Car- 
olina. By this arbitrary exercise of power by which North Caro- 
lina attempted, as it were, to make a treaty by its own legislative 
fiat, the Cherokee possessions were reduced to one-tenth of the 
area conceded to them by the treaty of 1777 and the act of 1778. In 
this act North Carolina forbade all persons, under heavy penalty, 
from entering or surveying lands within the bounds set apart for 
the Cherokees, or from purchasing, leasing or taking any gift of 
lands therein from the Indians, declaring all such entries, grants 
thereupon, purchases, leases and gifts to be utterly void, and for- 
‘bidding, under heavy penalty, the whites from hunting, ranging, 
or driving stock within the Indian lands. 19!

In an *‘address and remonstrance” of the Tennessee legislature to Congress 
in 1797, itissaid: ‘tis believed that, by this act and line, * * * * no re- 
linquishment of right of territory is made, but that the said line was declared 
for certain ;olitical reasons,” It is also insisted in this memorial that if the 
Indians have any kind of claim to the larid it is believed to be of the lowest 
kind of tenancy, namely, that of tenants at will. (Amer. St. Papers, Indian 
Affairs, vol. 1, p. 625.) :

This arbitrary action on the part of North Carolina, in reducing 
the Indian boundaries, was undoubtedly largely the cause of the 
subsequent Indian hostilities. 19? 
In spite, however, of this legislation, white settlers, as stated 
in the text (page 28), persistently encroached within the bound- 
aries even of the ‘‘ reservation,’’ especially in the territory south of 
the French Broad and Holston. Thus, in 1784, the Indian agent, 
Joseph Martin, writing of the encroachment of the whites, grad- 
ually extending closer and closer to the Indian towns that lay 
along the southern shore of the Little Tennessee river, said: ‘ The 
people from franklyn have actually settled or at least built houses 
within two miles of their beloved town of. Chota, one of their 
principal towns. * * * There has a number of families moved 
(on Little river) and talk of Building forts, and Say they will Hold 
it in defiance of Every power.’’ 19% 
In 1785 the revolutionary State of Franklin negotiated a treaty 
with the Cherokees at Dumplin Creek, beginning May 3lst, at 
which the Cherokees ceded to the whites all lands lying ‘“‘east’” 
{north) of the ridge dividing the waters of Little river and the 
(Little) Tennessee, this being followed by a quasi treaty between 
the State of Franklin and the Cherokees, held at Chota Ford and 
Coytoy, beginning July 31st, 1786, at which, under threats of virtual 
extirpation, the Indians gave up all their lands north of the (Littley 
Tennessee river and west to the Cumberland mountain. 1°+ 
These Franklin treaties were, of course, not recognized by North 
‘Carolina. They were furthermore virtually repudiated by the 
United States in the treaty held at Hopewell on the Keowee, 
November 28th, 1785, by which also the North Carolina act of 1783 
was. utterly abrogated, the boundary line between the Cherokees 
and the United States in East Tennessee being declared to be an 
irregular line running across the northeastern part of the State from 
Cumberland Gap, and passing between the present sites of Jones-- 
boro and Greeneville. 1° In a “talk”? made during the negotiation 
of this treaty by the Cherokee chief, Old Tassel, the Beloved Man of 
Chota, he stated that the whites had already settled on Little river

page 444, 
I use the word “reservation” in default of a better. It was merely a “re3-_ 
ervation” vi et armis, and was never recognized by the Cherokees.

aod Nine Mile creek, nine miles from the Cherokee towns on the 
southern banks of the Little Tennessee river, and had marked out 
lands across the river from the town of Chota itself and in the fork 
of the Tennessee and Little Tennessee. 19° 
In 1788, the Franklin Government having collapsed, and North 
Carolina failing to recognize or protect the people who had settled 
upon the Indian lands, they organized for themselves ‘‘a rude gov- 
ernmental machine, on the model of the Commonwealth of Frank- 
lin,”? which lasted until the formation of the territorial government 
in 1790. (Roosevelt’s Winning of the West, vol. 8, p. 202.) 
By the treaty of the Holston, made with the Cherokees by Gov- 
ernor Blount on the present site of Knoxville, July 2nd, 1791, and 
procldimed February 7th, 1792, the Cherokees ceded to the United 
States in Tennessee, among other lands, all that portion of their 
“reservation ’’ in Tennessee, lying north of a line, running from 
a@ point just above Kingston southeastwardly, passing near the 
present site of Maryville, to the State line. 1°97 
In a report made to Congress, November 10th, 1791, by Thomas 
Jefferson, then Secretary of State, on the unclaimed lands in the 
northwestern and southwestern territory, he states, in speaking of 
that portion of the Jands south of the French Broad and Holston, 
which had been acquired from the Indians at the treaty of Holston: 
“‘They are supposed to amount to about three hundred thousand 
acres, and we are told that three hundred families have already set 
down upon them without right or license.’ 198 
The Cherokee boundary line, established by. the treaty of Hol 
ston, was confirmed by the treaty concluded at Philadelphia June 
26th, 1794, and proclaimed January 2st, 1795. 19° 
By the treaty held in the Cherokee council house, near Tellico, 
concluded October 2nd, 1798, the Cherokees ceded to the United 
States, among other lands, all the remaining portion of their orig- 
inal “reservation ’’ in Tennessee lying south of Hawkin’s line and 
west of the Chilhowee mountains, except a small portion just west 
of the mountains on the north shore of Little Tennessee river, 2°°

It must be remembered in reading this and other treaties that the Little Ten— 
nessee river was then considered the main branch of the Tennessee above the 
junction at what is now Lenoir City,and was called the Tennessee river, while 
the branch passing by Knoxville, now styled the Tennessee, was then called 
the Holston.

and also to something over 100,000 acres north of the river lying 
mainly in that portion of Blount county east of the Chilhowee 
mountains, perhaps partly also in Sevier, and in that detached 
portion of Monroe county which lies north of the Little Tennessee 
river and west of the Chilhowee. It was not in fact until the treaty 
coneluded at Washington February 27th, 1819, proclaimed March 
10th, 1819, that the Cherokees ceded to the United States, among 
other lands, the remainder of their ‘‘ reservation’? in Tennessee 
lying north of the Little Tennessee river, together with about one- 
half of their ‘‘reservation’’ south of the river, the land so ceded 
being afterwards established as the Hiwassee District of Ten- 
negsee. 7°? » 
The remainder of the ‘‘ reservation’? was ceded to the United 
States by the treaty made at New Echota, December 29th, 1835, 
proclaimed May 23rd, 1836, by which, in consideration of $5,000,000 
the Cherokees conveyed all their lands east of the Mississippi river, 
this portion being afterwards established as the Ocoee District. 2°? 
APPENDIX D. 
HISTORICAL NOTE as to Tennessee enactments from 1799 to 1805, inclusive, 
in reference to occupant claims south of French Broad and Holston. 
In 1799, Tennessee had provided that these lands claimed by 
occupancy and pre-emption, should be subject to taxation. *°# 
_ In this same year, in the act opening land offices for the general 
sale of land at twenty-five cents an acre, it had been expressly 
provided that the occupants south of French Broad and Holston 
should have preference of entry; ?°¢ and in an act in 1801 these 
occupants had been authorized to locate certain North Carolina 
warrants on their improvements and obtain grants thereon. 2°° 
But as will more fully appear by reference to historical note, 
Appendix B, supra, Tennessee never sought to enforce either of 
these acts.

And so as to an act passed in 1805, ‘directing the mode of 
ascertaining the bounds of improvement and occupant claims”? in 
this territory. ?°* Sections 1 to 4 of this act are not contained in 
any of the compilations, and the original act is not in the Secre- 
tary of State’s office, having been lost or destroyed; neither is there 
any printed copy in the State library. Section 5 provides for 
recording bills of sale of pre-emption rights in this territory, and 
section 6 forbids any surveys in this district or any warrants or 
entries on warrants ior the purpose of obtaining grants (thus 
repealing the provisions of the act of 1801), and excludes from evi- 
dence any grant that may issue to these lands. 
In the case of Shields vs. Walker, 2 Overton’s Tenn. Reports, 
114 at 116 (decided in 1811), it is stated by Judge White that ‘‘ the 
first and perhaps the only material acts of Tennessee,” in reference 
to persons entitled to preference south of French Broad and Hol- 
ston, is chapter 1 of the acts of 1806, sections 1, 8 amd 9. 
Since writing. the note 38 on page 32, supra, in which it is stated 
that the North Carolina Assembly of 1789 seems not to have opened 
an office for the entry of pre-emptions south of French Broad and 
Holston, under the power vested in the cession act, I have found it. 
stated as a fact by Judge White, in this same case of Shields vs. 
Walker, that North Carolina ‘‘never did exercise that power;’” 
that there had never been any North Carolina legislation prior to 
1789 giving pre-emption rights to the settlers in this district; ‘‘and 
that so far from it, we find the legislature continually striving to 
reserve this country for the use of the Indians.’ 2°”

‘hundred thousand acres of land should be appropriated in such 
way by the legislature of this state that the profits thereof 
should be applied to the support of two colleges in this state, 
the one in East and the other in West Tennessee, to be 
established by the legislature of this state; And whereas it is 
expedient, that this General Assembly should establish a college in 
East Tennessee, capable of receiving that part of .said donation,

said, be capable in law, to purchase, receive and hold to them and 
their successors forever, or for any less estate, any lands, tenements, 
goods, or chattels, which shall be given, granted, or devised to them 
or purchased by them to the use of said college, and to,use and dis~

be impleaded, in any court of law or equity in this state or elsewhere, 
2. Be it enacted, That no less than seven of said trustees 
shall constitute a board, to determine upon any matter relative to 
said college, nor shall any of the real or personal estate belonging to 
said college be disposed of or appropriated at any session of said 
board, except a stated session ; nor shall any president or professor in

therein, asin their opinion may be expedient or necessary ; Provided, 
such by-laws, rules and regulations are not inconsistent with the 
constitution and laws of the United States, or of this state.

same county, in which the one deceased, resigned or removed, 
resided ; which appointment shall remain until the expiration of the 
next session of the General Assembly ; within which time, the Gen- 
eral Assembly shall supply such vacancy. 
5. Be tt enacted, That the said trustees shall have two meet-

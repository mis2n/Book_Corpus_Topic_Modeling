PREFACE 
ADOLESCENT boys and girls are constantly engaging 
in activities that affect their knowledges, interests, atti- 
tudes, and habits. For good or for ill, the reconstruction 
of experiences constantly goes on. If the community 
neglects to direct the activities of its youths, and leaves 
them to the haphazard influences of inferior homes and 
neighborhoods, commercialized recreational enterprises, 
and questionable propaganda, progress toward the attain- 
ment of the ideals of our republic must be slow. Only 
when the school is intelligently conceived, can it perform 
adequately the function delegated to it for the safety and 
improvement of society. 
This book is written to promote the realization of the 
conception of the school as a purposefully controlled and 
idealized community. In such an environment, boys and 
girls may achieve desired experiences analogous to those 
of extra-school life. By a repetition of these experiences, 
and by their elaboration and consequent reconstruction, 
pupils gain in knowledge, develop attitudes, and attain 
powers essential to social efficiency, to general good will, 
and to worthy uses of leisure-time. Such experiences are 
the true curriculum; they constitute the initiation into 
the Great Society. 
But is such an all-inclusive program feasible? Can 
the school secure the wholehearted participation of adoles- 
cent boys and girls in such a broadly conceived curricu- 
lum? The duty to try to find an affirmative answer is 
incumbent upon everyone engaged in the profession of 
public education. It calls for reflection and cogent reason- 
ing, dealing with such problems as these:

INTRODUCTION 
THE most important problem in secondary education 
is that of the curriculum. Whatever merits there may be 
in organization, administration, methods, and measure- 
ment, they are largely ineffective, unless what is taught 
is soundly determined by the needs of society. 
Nowhere has tradition been more potent than in the 
curricula of secondary schools. It has conserved the 
best that has been thought, said, and practiced in the 
world, but it has tended to perpetuate elements long after 
their relative value has by changes|in social and economic 
life been materially lessened. At any time one may find 
sporadic curriculum changes that are based on empiricism, 
and periodically there are demands, resulting from cumu- 
lated dissatisfaction, for radical reorganization. One 
would not go far wrong in asserting that the history of 
secondary education is found in curriculum changes. 
For the most part, however, changes have resulted 
from what Charles Hughes Johnston called “ curriculum 
tinkering.” They have doubtless resulted in some good; 
but real progress can be made now only if workers begin 
with principles soundly established on philosophy, psychol- 
ogy, and a comprehensive knowledge of contemporary life. 
Such principles Doctor Cox has attempted to present. 
His contribution should be of great value in affording a 
foundation on which workers of independence, invention, 
and courage can build. It will be of value also in stimu- 
lating others to present similar fundamental theses. Let

‘IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
CHAPTER I 
WHAT IS THE SECONDARY SCHOOL TRYING 
TO DO? 
School Education is a Social Process.—The aims of 
education are from time to time formulated and popular- 
ized by socially intelligent leaders—those thoughtful 
members of society who have been able to see in advance 
the direction in which social institutions should move. 
Chiefly through formal education they hope (1) to keep 
democracy from degenerating into mobocracy, as Aristotle believed it would, and (2) to direct progress to the end_ 
that the ideals of democracy may be more nearly attained. 
~— To accomplish this resuttthe—modern—state—as—the— 
formal instrument of the dominant social groups, under- 
takes to develop ever greater numbers of youths and adults 
who will make the most of themselves, who will not only 
fit in with their fellows, but who will actively codperate 
for common desirable ends, who will, by competing with 
each other individually and in groups, promote the selec- 
tion and use of special aptitudes. The end in view in this 
process is the continual increase of that common welfare 
which is necessary to the welfare of the individual.* 
Since the last decade of the Ninteenth Century, forward- 
looking men and women have become more and more 
conscious of the seriousness of the economic, political, and

  4 WHAT IS SECONDARY SCHOOL TRYING 
social problems that civilization is facing—problems that 
must be met and solved. These problems grow out of 
urbanization of population, out of international rivalries, 
out of antipathies between social and economic groups, 
out of the destruction of natural resources, and out of 
many other results of the Industrial Revolution. Theoreti- 
cal formulations of remedies and preventives based on 
philosophies, on sociological analyses, on statistical studies 
have been forthcoming. 
Thus, there has been projected an emancipated second- 
ary school, the aims of which are those implied in the 
aspirations of the democratic movement ; that is, they must 
promote the welfare of society and the adjustment of the 
individual in society. What is sought is not a traditional 
culture for all pupils, but effective membership in society ; 
not a so-called high standard of literary scholarship, but 
an intelligent appreciation of the immediate and remote 
environment—social, utilitarian, esthetic—and a codper- 
ative activity in improving it. The purpose is not prep- 
aration for college entrance-requirements only, but 
preparation for the larger life as well; not a mind disci- 
plined by activities removed from life, but by successful 
response to actual life-situations. 
The Scope of Secondary Education—The secondary 
school, like all social institutions, is in a process of evolu- 
tion ; it is expanding laterally, including more subjects and 
more curricula ; it is being extended downward to include 
the seventh and eighth grades, and upward to include the 
thirteenth and fourteenth grades, the junior college. 
As a result secondary education in America is rapidly 
becoming an upward extension of elementary education; 
it tends no longer to select only the more capable, the more 
scholarly, the more socially favored children. To an

ever-increasing degree, it makes provisions for great num- 
bers of adolescent boys and girls, taking account of their 
great diversity of natural abilities, aptitudes, native and 
acquired interests, and social backgrounds; it gives to 
each according to his needs, and demands of each a stand- 
ard and quantity of work according to his capacity. 
Practice lags somewhat behind theory, not because 
school administrators and communities do not desire to 
deal earnestly with their problems, but rather because of 
the complexity of the problems, and the difficulty of 
putting general principles into practice. 
In order to bring together (1) the purposes and 
problems now commonly recognized, (2) such scientific 
knowledge as is now available, and (3) examples of suc- 
cessful practices of accepted principles, to the end that sec- 
ondary school practice may be improved, this study of 
the secondary curriculum has been undertaken. 
The Plan of the Book—Part I consists of chapters 
dealing with the purposes and problems of secondary edu- 
cation, and with the factors that complicate the problems 
at this time. 
Part II deals with the procedure and results of scien- 
tific method in the field of curriculum-making. 
Part III consists of sixteen principles, each one ex- 
plained in terms of educational theory, and all the factors 
affecting the curriculum so far as they fit in with the prin- 
ciples discussed. The practical applications of each prin- 
ciple are emphasized under the headings (A) What has 
been done by secondary schools (1) in conventional 
schools, (2) in more progressive schools; and (B) What 
can be done by secondary schools,

CHAPTER II 
WHY IS THE PROBLEM OF SECONDARY 
EDUCATION SO COMPLEX? 
Any practical consideration of the secondary school’s 
problems of readjustment to meet the changing condi- 
tions of social, economic, and political life must first give 
careful consideration to the factors that control secondary 
education, Let us therefore list some of these concepts 
and conditions that are most potent in affecting secondary 
education at the present time. This statement of impor- 
tant factors will then be followed by some interpretations 
of their significance for the educational engineer who 
would adapt the institution and procedures to the condi- 
tions that must be met. 
What are the Outstanding Factors that Control or 
Affect Secondary Education?—1, Public education is an 
investment by the state on behalf of the social groups that 
the state represents. 
2. Like other social institutions it has now become 
so generally accepted in America that it is protected by 
inertia and conventionalized conception. It tends to be 
reproduced in each generation just as it was in the pre- 
vious generation. 
3. Parents and the public generally are convinced that 
the secondary schools offer opportunities by which pupils 
may obtain a better chance in the competitions of life than 
they otherwise would obtain. 
4. Increasing numbers of boys and girls of high 
school age are preferring the life involved in school-attend- 
ance to that of employment. 
6
-P-A-G-E-17
  
  OUTSTANDING FACTORS 7 
5. The outstanding characteristic of the increased 
enrolment is the greater range of abilities, interests, racial 
and economic backgrounds represented among the pupils 
who now attend secondary schools, as compared with those 
of the last decade of the nineteenth century. 
6. There is a constantly increasing demand for young 
men and young women in professions and vocations, pre- 
paration for which requires a secondary school education. 
Not only does society require larger numbers of lawyers, 
doctors, dentists, stenographers, secretaries, teachers, 
accountants, engineers, salesmen, and other specialists, but 
it is also tending to demand graduation from high school 
as a minimum qualification for these occupations, while for 
many of them education of collegiate grade is necessary. 
7. The cost of secondary education is increasing with 
an impressive rapidity, not only because of the increase 
in number of pupils being educated, but also because the 
cost per pupil is far greater, the equipment is more expen- 
sive, teachers are better paid, the curriculum is enriched 
by the addition of expensive subjects, and many small 
classes are often necessary in the later years of the 
high school. 
8. The new conception of learning, as a modification 
of behavior in meeting situations of many kinds, carries 
with it the implication that subject-matter shall be con- 
ceived as experiences which may be most readily and 
satisfactorily used to stimulate wholehearted, purpose- 
ful activity. 
9. Many informal activities, some connected with 
the school and some quite divorced from it, are potent 
for good or for ill. Whatever the merits and faults of 
the secondary curriculum, the total experiences of the 
pupils are controlled by many other agencies. The influ-
-P-A-G-E-18
8 PROBLEM OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 
ence of the home, the church, the library, the Y.M.C.A., 
the poolroom, the newspapers, and magazines, professional 
baseball, the moving pictures, the dance-hall—these and 
many other influences are reinforcing or competing with 
the habits, attitudes, ideals, and interests fostered by 
the curriculum. 
io. The nature of the society for which secondary 
education is fitting pupils, the problems with which that 
society will have to struggle in the next decades, are final 
determining factors affecting the curriculum. 
A CONSIDERATION OF THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED 
IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING FACTORS 
1. Education is a State Investment—A democratic 
social organization can be achieved only if the people who 
are to compose it have a keen appreciation of its desira- 
bility, a knowledge of the factors that favor or hinder it, a 
sympathetic understanding of its purposes, a willingness to 
subordinate, in some degree, self-interest to the public 
welfare. Social welfare requires a readiness to participate 
actively to preserve the gains so far made toward attaining 
it, and the ability to plan and execute further steps looking 
to the improvement of society. 
Society is in a process of evolution; social institutions, 
industrial processes, political organizations are in a state 
of flux ; democracy is frankly an experiment, a great adven- 
ture on an uncharted course, with ideals, aspirations as 
the goals. It is because the American people, responding 
to the urgings of forward-looking leaders in many aspects 
of community life, have been made to realize this, that 
they have willed that public education be adequately sup- 
ported by general taxation.
-P-A-G-E-19
  
SOCIAL CHANGE AND INERTIA 9 
2. Social Change and Social Inertia—Social progress 
seems, like biological development, to grow out of the 
adjustments that have been found workable up to the 
present. While some periods have perhaps been more 
fruitful for progress than others, the state, as the chief 
social agency controlling education, is reluctant to cut 
loose from the moorings of the past, to risk confusion and 
ruin in ventures that are uncertain. And so, state edu- 
cation tends always toward the perpetuation of the present 
approved knowledge, attitudes, ideals, and skills. Forces 
more powerful than the state, however, make constantly 
for social change. The industrial revolution is still in 
process; new processes of manufacture, new means of 
communication, the increase of material well-being, the 
growth of cities, the changes in rural life, the centraliza- 
tion of government, the demand for legislation restricting 
child-labor, conservation of natural resources, and many 
other manifestations of social change challenge the educa- 
tive system to prepare the oncoming generations for the 
problems with which they must surely be confronted, 
Here, then, are two great conflicting factors controlling 
all school education—social inertia and social change. The 
conflict is, perhaps, more keenly felt in secondary than 
in elementary education, because of the greater maturity 
of the pupils, the decreasing potency of other social con- 
trols—the family, the church—at the high school age, and 
the increasing intellectual curiosity and freedom from 
restraint of adolescents. On the one hand, the public 
secondary school that does not modify its program of 
studies and its provisions for the social life of its pupils 
manifestly fails, the pupils are frequently disgusted and 
leave school or become disciplinary problems, and the par- 
ents and tax-payers are disappointed and dissatisfied as  
-P-A-G-E-20
  to PROBLEM OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 
they become conscious of the futility of the conventional 
curriculum in the new age. On the other hand, inertia 
or momentum of all social institutions makes it difficult 
for secondary education to conform to new needs, or to 
free itself from vestiges of earlier educational practices 
and needs. School practices generally evolve from what is, 
though in rare instances sweeping changes are successful. 
3. Public Faith in Education—The faith of the Amer- 
ican people in secondary education has not been based on 
a discriminating study of just what it has done for those 
who have received it. Pupils who have attended high school 
have seemed happy, have made desirable friendships, have 
frequently gained in self-confidence, physical appearance, 
and social adjustments, and have acquired many interest- 
ing or unusual bits of knowledge—in short, parents and 
other adults have realized that high school graduates have 
received something that their elders had missed. 
High school graduates have commonly entered voca- 
tional activities of a type that seems to many parents to 
involve less disagreeable tasks and permit greater leisure 
than vocations which are recruited from boys and girls 
who have not attended high schools. 
Parents properly desire for their children the educa- 
tion that makes possible these more desirable positions, 
but they often discount or ignore the factor of selection. 
They do not realize that these young men and women who 
graduate from high school generally have greater natural 
endowments than non-graduates, and so are more capable 
of filling desirable positions effectively. Parents too often 
have faith in a magic of education to free children from 
disagreeable tasks and hard work, and to convert very 
mediocre ability into unusual capacity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES Ir 
4. Increased Enrolment.—The social life of the high 
school has been increasingly attractive to boys and girls 
who have aspired to play on athletic teams, to participate 
in school entertainments, and to enjoy the generous leisure 
allowed by the conventional twenty-five hour week of the 
high school. 
For those pupils who attend high school merely because 
they prefer high school life to remunerative work, the con- 
ventional curriculum has little to offer. Abstract scholar- 
ship makes little appeal to them. Many have not the 
types of mental abilities to master mathematics or Latin; 
most of them have no desire to do so. 
Even the practical courses, bookkeeping, stenography, 
and mechanical drawing, if they are to be carried on at a 
high level of efficiency, must make demands on a pupil’s 
time and energy that are not willingly given by many 
boys and girls, and that are not insisted upon by those 
parents who do not themselves have scholarly interests. 
Consequently in subjects for which high standards have 
been maintained, the less able and less studious pupils have 
been eliminated very rapidly, whereas those subjects that 
have been made more flexible, the standards of which have 
been adapted to the work produced by the less able and 
less vigorous ones, have been completed sometimes with 
so little mastery of subject-matter and skills as to be of 
small value to those who have taken them. 
5. Individual Differences.—The ever greater range 
and variety of individual differences in ability, aptitudes, 
interests, ambitions, social backgrounds, and the like,   
“ * The recent Philadelphia Survey reports a dictation test at the rate 
of 80 words a minute, on which twelfth grade boys of the stenography 
courses averaged only 51 per cent. of the words right; the girls 
averaged 67 per cent. right.
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 PROBLEM OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 
make the curriculum-problem of the secondary school very 
difficult of solution. 
The best high schools have sought, by means of 
exploratory courses _ _and_educational_guidance, to. offer 
educational Opportunities to pupils o f varying bilities and 
social backgrounds ; they have permitte u 
if ere fields of activity, but have insisted “upon seri- 
é chosen fields. The more successful the 
Ty sical is in solving its problems of adapting 
educational opportunities for the less capable or less 
interested, the more intensive and extensive become the 
very problems the school has attacked; for this adaptation 
makes the school attractive to pupils who are still less 
able and less interested in scholarship and in the con- 
ventional school program. 
The rhe pupil population has not increased so rapidly in 
rural’as in urban high schools; the heterogen 
4 fer of the pupils and the diversit of vocation 
/ fies; the selective factor still plays a large part in the pri- 
vate preparatory schools; but even in these situations the 
need of new curriculum-opportunities, though not so easily 
recognizable, may be very real. 
The pupils who attend secondary continuation-schools 
are of such types as to call for curriculum-changes so radi- 
cal that it is difficult to recognize them as of secondary 
character at all. The problems involved are such that 
the work must be organized into short-unit courses, each 
planned to run for a few Saturday mornings, or Thursday 
afternoons. Instruction must be highly practical, the 
knowledge or skill readily applied to social situations or 
vocational activities; the attitudes, interests and ideals to 
be fostered, must not be too much removed from the daily

  INCREASING SOCIAL DEMANDS 13 
lives of the boys and girls in store and factory, from 
their evenings in their homes, at the dance-halls, at the 
'Y.M.C.A., or in the poolrooms. The continuation-school 
finds it necessary to codperate more actively with the 
library, the city officials, and other social agencies; else 
its work with boys and girls of secondary school age, in- 
volving as it does the direction of their informal activities, 
cannot be accomplished. 
The increasing of the compulsory ages for attending 
school (already 16 years of age in many states and 18 
years of age in some) means that greater and greater num- 
bers of boys and girls of secondary school age will have 
to be cared for in public day-schools suited to adolescent 
pupils, Experiments in adapting instruction, classroom 
procedure, and school organization to pupils so compelled 
to attend school is already a pressing problem in many 
schools. It calls for the surrender of many inherited con- 
ceptions of “ high school standards,” an acceptance of the 
relatively new conception that what meets the immediate 
needs of each pupil of high school age at the level of 
instruction at which he can profit by it, constitutes a valid 
standard of secondary education for the individual. Homo- 
geneous grouping according to native abilities and probable 
future vocation or further education must be supplemented 
by homogeneous grouping according to educational needs, 
Thus, the school can best overcome shortcomings in oral 
expression, in computation, in social inheritances of dress, 
manners, and recreations, and exploit special aptitudes and 
social inheritances of taste in literature, musical and 
artistic ability and interests, and the like. 
6. Increasing Social Demands for High School Gradu- 
ates——To prepare lar; e

diverse pupils for increasingly varied social demands_is 
her Hick: more here ave-indieationsthat society now demands more 
graduates than the-high-schools-are-sending_out, or are 
likely to send out, in the-near—future, Certain types pes of 
commercial positions now utilize, perhaps, one-third of 
the high-school graduates. One-third to one-half go to 
college for general or technical preparation for engineer- 
ing, law, medicine, business. Some states which demand 
graduation from college or normal school for certifica- 
tion of teachers, as do Pennsylvania and New York, may 
find that they have set up a requirement that can be met 
only if two-fifths or one-half the high-school graduates 
should enter normal schools or colleges preparatory to 
becoming teachers. 
It may not be true that present tendencies to demand 
high-school graduates for positions of social significance 
will continue ; it may well be that the premium on gradua- 
tion has been justified by the higher native ability of 
graduates, by their social superiority rather than by any 
virtue gained from high school education. But if increas- 
ing numbers of graduates are demanded, then there must 
be much modification of curriculum-content and method, 
to supply them in requisite numbers. 
7. Increasing Cost of High School Education.—De- 
spite the cost and the wrench to preconception, this new 
educational program must be commonly accepted for 
secondary education in general. To do what needs to be 
done by the secondary school, according to the new con- 
ception of education, for all the young people between the 
ages of 12 and 19, will cost so much that some people who 
are sympathetic with all that the school is trying to do, 
nevertheless do not believe that communities can willingly

  NEW CONCEPTION OF LEARNING 1s 
pay for it unless new adjustments in the revenue system 
be made. Indeed, there are people of influence in many 
communities who are very critical of the cost of secondary 
education, which has increased so rapidly in the past three 
decades.? If the conventional curriculum of the academic 
high school could be utilized for the large numbers who are 
now reached by the secondary schools, the expense would 
not be nearly as great as it is coming to be. But the new 
curricula required for the new types of pupils, such as 
are being given by progressive high schools everywhere, 
require specially qualified teachers, who must be paid ade- 
quate salaries, and make necessary expensive equipment 
and more elaborate provisions in the newly con- 
structed buildings. 
8. New Conception of Learning.—Not only does the 
secondary school face the problem of educating ever larger

rapidly in recent years, and that relatively they have outstripped

_also readjust its subject-matter and methods and prejudices to comply with the ne i << ihe 
traditional view of subject-matter, the conception all but 
universally accepted in practice in academic secondary 
school subjects, is that subject-matter is set out to be 
learned, to be tested by recitation hearing, or by written 
examinations. Frequently the subject-matter has had no 
justification except that of mental discipline, or the sanc- 
tion of custom; at best and infrequently, subject-matter 
has included the facts, processes, skills, needed by efficient 
adults, made interesting for pupils by means of projects 
that call for the development of the desired trait, or by 
setting up immediate goals—scores to be equalled, tests 
to be passed, accomplishments to be checked off. Kilpatrick 
calls this “ extrinsic subject-matter, since the subject-mat- 
ter enters but extrinsically into the life of the learner while 
he is thus learning.” ® “we 
ject-matter,” is that learning situations (subject-matter) 
octir when some activity of the learner is hindered, so that. 
some new mode of behavior is needed in order to get the 
baiked activity going again. The attention of the teacher 
is thus on the present growth, but that does not mean that 
the future needs are disregarded. The teacher approves 
and rewards the development of traits that he knows will 
be useful in the future. 
2 At the secondary school level, probably no one sees his 
way clearly enough to propose that all the subjects of the 
program of studies should be reorganized to be taught 
_..according to this new conception of the curriculum. But 
at the junior high school level, this is precisely the concep-

tion that in progressive schools underlies the project-work  - 
of the general shop, the commercial-arts work, the home- ‘¢ 
arts activities, the informal library-periods, the publication 
of the school paper, and similar activities. If the school is 
to educate the pupils who “are not interested in scholar- 
ship,” who have not the traditions, the ambitions, the 
docility that make them willing to perform tasks that are 
of no present importance or significance to them—as 
demonstrative geometry, Latin translation, English gram- 
mar, and Greek art, certainly are not to some pupils—then 
it must set aside some classes in which pupils can do things 
that seem to them worth while now. 
9. Many Influences Other than the Curriculum Affect 
the Education of High School Pupils—Many “ extra- 
curriculum ”’ activities of the past decade are becoming 
curriculum activities in some high schools. The school 
paper is frequently edited by pupils in connection with the 
English classes; debating is fostered in connection with 
social study and English courses of study, the athletic 
teams are sometimes organized in connection with the 
physical training departments; teachers of mathematics, 
science, and other subjects act as sponsors of clubs of pupils 
interested in some phases of their subjects. 
The school itself is reaching out into the community 
to codperate with beneficent social agencies, and to com- 
pete with or to offset any influence considered detrimental 
to the welfare of the pupils or of the general community. 
Thus the educational program of the school, including 
both curriculum and extracurriculum activities, is fre- 
quently profoundly influenced by the interests and impulses 
fostered by the Boy Scouts, the public library, the 
Y. M. C. A., the art museum, the Red Cross, the Park 
Commission, the Chamber of Commerce, and similar

official or unofficial agencies. The school wisely utilizes 
such interests and activities to direct participation by 
pupils in the more socially significant and esthetically 
superior forms of activity that the community fosters. 
On the other hand, the school takes account of, and 
endeavors to counteract, the habits and attitudes of adoles- 
cents that are the product of immoderate eating between 
meals, attending too many theatres, reading cheap novels, 
hanging about poolrooms and drug-stores, careless use of 
money, contact with the ugliness and dishonesties of life, 
the low ideals of some professional athletes, and un- 
healthy sex-consciousness encouraged by many modes of 
social behavior. 
The recognition of these opportunities for socializa- 
tion of the curriculum-content and method has led some 
enthusiasts to insist that the school should become, is 
indeed destined to become, the directive instrument of 
community improvement. Whether this is to be its func- 
tion or not remains for the future to determine ; but, certain 
it is, that as boys and girls begin to participate in the experi- 
ences of grown men and women, and as the influence of the 
home wanes, the opportunity of the school grows. It can 
put itself in touch with all the activities in which the adoles- 
cents of the community engage.

CHAPTER III 
WHAT IS SCIENTIFIC METHOD? 
The effort to put education on a scientific basis com- 
parable to that of medicine and engineering is one of the 
outstanding movements of our times. But there is much 
indefiniteness in the conception of what constitutes scien- 
tific procedure in curriculum-construction and educa- 
tional practices. 
The Broad Conception of Scientific Procedure.—The 
term “ scientific method ” in relation to curriculum-modifi- 
cation and -construction is sometimes conceived so broadly 
as to include all careful systematic thought, whether sub- 
jective, experiential or objective. Judd, in fact, frankly 
states that “all careful systematic studies of school prob- 
lems are scientific.” + 
Thorndike states five problems for scientific study 
of education: 
(1) The Aims of Education: The changes that should be made 
in human beings by schools and other educative forces. 
(2) The Material or Subjects of Education: The original nature 
of the human beings and the principles of human nature and behavior. 
(3) The Means and Agents of Education: The forces at our 
command in the task. 
(4) The Methods of Education: How these means and agents 
should be brought to bear upon the subjects. 
(5) The Results of Education: The actual effects of different 
methods, means and agents acting upon different kinds of human beings. 
The nature of science and its place in human affairs 
have thus been stated by Dewey:

  24 WHAT IS SCIENTIFIC METHOD? 
“ By science is meant . . . that knowledge which is the outcome 
of methods of observation, reflection, and testing which are deliberately 
adopted to secure a settled assured subject-matter. It involves an 
intelligent and persistent endeavor to revise current beliefs so as to 
weed out what is erroneous, to add to their accuracy, and, above all, 
to give them such shape that the dependencies of the various facts 
upon one another may be as obvious as possible.” * 
“Science represents the office of projection and control in new 
experience, pursued systematically, intentionally, and on a scale due 
to freedom from limitation of habit. It is the sole instrumentality of 
conscious, as distinct from accidental progress.” * 
Such conceptions of scientific procedure as those 
just cited are broad enough to include any carefully 
thought-out program of action regarding educational 
problems. Such a scientific method may involve the appli- 
cation of the principles of sociology, psychology, physi- 
ology, and the like, to the problem at hand, followed by an 
evaluation of the results obtained by the experiments. On 
the other hand, it may require the collection of concrete 
data to be organized, generalizations induced, and pro- 
posed procedure based on these generalizations to be put 
into practice. : 
Perhaps we may best understand what may legitimately 
be called “ scientific procedure,” by reference to some 
common unscientific procedures. Subjects are sometimes 
maintained in the program of studies on the plea that they 
train the mind, or are necessary for culture. Frequently 
the introduction of a new device or subject is based on the 
presumption that it will train for citizenship, or educate the 
taste. But in neither case is there often any effort to 
measure the results by any valid standard, or by compari- 
son of the effects of other educational methods or subjects.

RUGG ON COMMITTEE PROCEDURE 25 
HOW THE PROGRAM AND COURSES OF STUDIES 
HAVE BEEN DETERMINED 
The Transition to Scientific Method—The general 
organization and administration of the curriculum as a 
whole has largely been determined by convention and 
inertia, supplemented by college requirements, state depart- 
ments of education, national and local educational associa- 
tions. Administrative officers responsible for the programs 
of studies start necessarily from already established cur- 
ricula, subjects, courses, and methods. Scientific procedure, 
for them can mean only careful, systematic thinking of 
how best to meet observed needs of pupil-groups or com- 
munity-activities. For more specific guidance they look 
to higher authorities or to recognized experts. 
The contents of the various courses of history, science, 
English, mathematics, and foreign languages have fre- 
quently been modified by committees of specialists and 
educators who have been able to command the attention 
and respect of school administrators, supervisors, and 
teachers. Some of these committees’ reports have had 
very great effect the country over for many years. The 
‘National Education Association Committee of Ten, report- 
ing as far back as 1893, set forth recommendations that 
are still followed in many schools. 
The history courses recommended by the American 
History Association Committee of Seven have had so wide 
a following that the procedure of recommending modifica- 
tions through committees has led to many similar formu- 
lations and propagandas in behalf of other of the social 
sciences—political science, economics, sociology. 
Rugg on Committee Procedure.—The procedure of 
such committees has called forth a vigorous protest from 
Rugg, who sets forth the following criteria for sound 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 WHAT IS SCIENTIFIC METHOD? 
committee procedure in (scientific) reconstruction of the 
school curriculum: 
“a. The Committee should be a deliberative body of subject- 
experts and educational specialists stating (1) aims and outcomes 
of instruction and (2) criteria for inclusion, grading and teach- 
ing materials. 
“b. The Committee should organize investigations of social and 
psychological needs along five lines of study: 
1. Determine exact status of teaching of subject and related 
subjects. 
2. Evaluate critically and constructively scientific investigation of 
curriculum-making so far made. 
3. Make and publish an exhaustive evaluation of representative 
examples of experimental courses. 
4. Test objectively the results obtained from present instruction. 
5. Make scientific investigations. 
“c. The Committee should be a clearing-house and forum to 
stimulate controversial discussion by publishing and debating with 
school people generally its own better programs, hypotheses concerning 
selection and arrangement of subject-matter, theories of teaching, 
principles of organization and the like. 
“d. The Committee should be a continuing or standing body, 
studying the application of their recommendations in public schools.” * 
Scientific procedure, Rugg says elsewhere, includes: (1) the 
systematic inventory of current practices and theories, (2) the 
critical construction of hypotheses on the basis of it, and (3) the use 
of objective analysis and experiment.’ 
Bobbitt Seeks Objectives in Adult Needs.—Bobbitt 
seems to contemplate a sweeping reorganization in his 
chapter on “ Scientific Method in Curriculum-Making.” 
The curriculum, including both directed and undirected 
experiences, has as objectives the total range of human 
abilities, habits, systems of knowledge, that one should

possess. ‘‘ Those will be discovered by analytic survey 
The curriculum-discoverer will first be an analyst of 
human nature and of human affairs. His task at this 
point is not at all concerned with ‘the studies "—later he 
will draw up appropriate studies as means, but he will 
not analyze the tools to be used in a piece of work as a 
mode of discovering the objectives of that work.” 7 
In connection with the Los Angeles High School cur- 
riculum study, Bobbitt made subjective analyses of 
human activities to determine objectives; and then, in co- 
operation with teacher-committees, suggested pupil-activi- 
ties in each subject-field that might allow precise practice 
for the attainment of those specific objectives. 
Bobbitt conceives scientific curriculum-making pri- 
marily as “ finding the scholastic shortcomings of children 
and men.”’ Familiar as this procedure already is in case 
of the tool subjects, such as spelling, good usage, and 
computations that result in objective performance, it is 
more difficult to determine scholastic shortcomings in con- 
nection with such highly complex subjects as history, 
literature, and geography. For these subjects, he believes 
the scientific curriculum-maker must first discover those 
social deficiencies that result from a lack of historical, 
literary, and geographical experiences. Each deficiency 
found is a call for directed training. 
Charters’ Conception of Scientific Curriculum-making 
and His Procedure.—Charters has pointed out the difficulty 
of translating good general aims into specific activities of 
people, which must be improved if the aims are to be

achieved. Three things should be done, he says: (1) 
Determine the ideals of socially efficient individuals; (2) 
find the fundamental physical and mental activities carried 
on by people in the United States; and (3,) bya process of 
laborious analysis, discover exactly what important specific 
activities shall be taught and what ideals shall control in 
their performance.® 
Curriculum-makers can then select objectives based on 
“ sagacious and sensitive interpretations of the spirit of 
the generation.” But these objectives would need to be 
divided up into activities and ideals; i.e., what people do, 
and what better things they might do.?° 
After analyzing these ideals and activities into units that 
learners can handle “there is spread before curriculum 
makers a very long list of activities and a shorter list of 
ideals.” 14. These activities and ideals would then be 
arranged in the order of their value for children; thus, 
running games, dramatizations, and class-organizations 
have great value for children, though less for adults. 
Three steps remain: (1) “‘ Determine the number of 
the most important items of the resulting list which can 
be handled in the time allotted to school education, after 
deducting those which are better learned outside of school; 
(2) collect the best practices of the race in handling these 
ideals and activities; (3) arrange the material so obtained 
in proper instructional order, according to the psychologi- 
cal nature of children.” 1”

SCIENTIFIC CURRICULUM-MAKING 29 
Charters discusses eight bases for classifying activities 
that are to be analyzed. 
For each activity group, the curriculum-maker should consider: 
(1) Whether activities are sequential or non-sequential; i.e., 
whether the activities follow in a regular order ; 
(2) whether an activity is to be analyzed, or just the difficulties 
growing out of it; 
(3) whether a gross analysis to find the outstanding elements is 
made, as is usual in determining moral or mental characteristics, or a 
detailed analysis, such as has been made in spelling by Ayres, and by 
Williams to find the mathematics used in chemistry; 
(4) whether an analysis is made to determine job-specifications, 
or to determine curriculum-content; for if the latter, it is necessary 
not only to know what knowledge, skills, etc., the job calls for, but 
also to know how the job is to be done; 
(5) whether the school is determined to teach best methods or the 
usual methods of performing activities ; 
(6) whether or not the school desires to improve practices by the 
encouragement of ideals higher than the current practice; 
(7) whether the analyst is interested in getting content of a 
primary subject; i.e., one that prepares immediately for the activity; 
or of a derived subject; i.e., a subject necessary to master a primary 
subject, as physics to master mechanics ; 
(8) whether there is desired an analysis of vocational activities 
or of extravocational activities. The activities and interests of extra- 
vocational life, those problems and interests which all men have, 
irrespective of vocation, must be analyzed by the same methods as are 
used. in the vocational analysis. 
A single example of an effort to get specific activities 
may be given: 
“Salespeople were interviewed to discover their difficulties, but 
being neither introspective nor reflective, the bucket was drawn empty 
from the well. They did not know what their difficulties were. The 
executives of department stores were appealed to with no better results. 
So, consequently, a member of the staff, expert in selling, was delegated 
to secure an analysis by observation. For three months she spent two 
hours daily in the stores watching salespeople and listing the difficulties 
which she observed. By this method of observation some sixty
-P-A-G-E-40
  30 WHAT IS SCIENTIFIC METHOD? 
difficulties were obtained, which became the basis for collection.” * 
This list of activities and difficulties he would then classify as indicated 
ih the preceding paragraphs; and then would plan the instruction to 
develop the necessary knowledge and skills in the students. 
Snedden’s Conceptions of Curriculum-making.—So- 
ciety has faith that men and women can be improved 
through education. (1) Curriculum-makers can contribute 
much, says Snedden, if they will translate these faiths into 
practical objectives, of which he proposes four classes: 
physical, vocational, civic, and cultural, (2) These objec- 
tives should then be broken up into specific objectives to be 
attained and retained, specific knowledges, interests, habits, 
and powers, necessary for the attainment of larger objec- 
tives. (3) Some of these specific objectives determined by 
needs of adult life demand serious work—these he calls 
“alpha ” objectives. (4) Other specific objectives permit 
appeal to spontaneous interests—these he calls “ beta” 
objectives. Alpha courses should be broken up into clear- 
cut definite units, each with definite measurable outcomes. 
How shall scientific curriculum-makers find these 
practical objectives based on social criteria? By studying 
“selected social groups or grades now found in society.” 
Thus, he would urge the curriculum-maker to consider the needs 
of 100 home-makers, aged 30 to 40, with no servant help, with 3 to 5 
children per family, living in detached houses; of this group 30, who 
are of B-grade (in a scale from A to E) will show a certain degree 
of power and skill, obtained by informal education. 
Could their present attainments have been achieved (under a 
better system of education) more expeditiously, more economically, 
more surely? Could the home-making habits and knowledge of the 
C, D, and E grades of home-makers have been made as good as the 
present B-grade home-makers, by means of a better system 
of education? 
* Charters, W. W.: Journal Educational Research, v. v, No. 4, 
Apr., 1922, p. 198.
-P-A-G-E-41
    
EMPHASIZES LEARNING STUDIES 31 
What of the children from these B-grade homes? Will they 
need any help from the school in order to become good home-makers? 
Or, will they get more from informal instruction and inculcation of 
attitudes and habits than the school can give anyway? If not, what 
instruction, what content, what methods do they need? 
To indicate how Snedden would apply his case method 
of determining the curriculum-offering, two examples are 
quoted : “ Objectives of School Education, Normals, Ages 
Twelve to Sixteen.'* 
“Case A.—Thirty 7th grade boys, average intellectual abilities 
and interests, strong physical play and social interest, and good 
industrial arts interest. Are ready for scouting, band, current reading, 
etc. Fathers, wage-earners, economic burdens heavy. Have no 
foreign affiliations. Prognosis: Boys will not remain in school beyond 
fifteen, but could then be induced by prospects of position to go to 
short course, all-day vocational specialty school (for juvenile 
workers) for 30-90 days. Will be wage-workers in miscellaneous 
factories until 25, when a few will become foremen or high- 
grade specialists. 
“Case D.—Thirty girls of poor homes and moderate personal 
cultivation. Intellectually very keen and ambitious. Families can 
keep them in school to 18 or even 20, but at much sacrifice. Not well 
equipped with health and physical strength. Can probably not expect 
to teach because of alien ancestry. Will probably marry at 26. No 
household-arts interest now.” 
Thus he would define within his school population 
homogeneous groups, and plan the curriculum with them 
in mind. 
Judd Emphasizes Learning-studies.—Judd, in the 
introduction to “ Psychology of High School Subjects ” 
(1915), emphasizes as a fundamental of scientific cur- 
riculum-construction, the analysis of the pupils’ reactions 
and needs through careful observation and experimenta- 
tion. The teacher should modify his educational materials 
and methods by first selecting one definite point on which 
“Snedden, David: Digest of Educational Sociology, Chap. X,

  32 WHAT IS SCIENTIFIC METHOD? 
to make observations; and second, by making these obser- 
vations deliberately for a sufficient period of time to reach 
some conclusion. (p. 11.) Such observation and experi- 
mentation should be done with exactness, and there should 
be a rigid, scientific formulation of results. 
WHITHER SHOULD AMERICAN SECONDARY 
EDUCATION MOVE? 
Except as the University of Chicago High School 
program of studies may be said to reflect Judd’s broad 
definition of “ scientific ” procedure, none of the advocates 
of scientific curriculum-construction just cited has 
attempted to put his theory into practice fora program 
of studies. 
Snedden has suggested programs based on a priori 
reasoning that have been most thought-provoking, and in 
his “ Sociology,” his “ Vocational Education,” and his 
“ Civic Education,” he suggests certain units worked out 
to meet the needs of homogeneous “ case” groups. 
Rugg and Clark have developed a course in ninth grade 
mathematics around a core of processes, the social impor- 
tance of which is scientifically established. At present 
Rugg and his colleagues are at work on a social science 
course of study based on problems that are “ scientifically ” 
established as persistent and of great social importance. 
Charters has organized units of educational content 
and method for training for several specific efficiencies ; 
correct usage in oral English, arithmetic for salespeople. 
He frankly says that the total program cannot as yet be 
planned in this way. 
Bobbitt, in directing the work of curriculum-readjust- 
ment in Los Angeles, pools the judgments of himself, his 
graduate students, and the committee-members for each

course of study, to determine what individuals need, in 
order to lead socially effective and individually satisfying 
lives. If he is at all conscious of individual differences or 
the needs of pupils who may not be able to complete the 
courses that he advises for “ general training,’ he prob- 
ably considers it a matter to be cared for through adminis- 
tration of the,program of studies, after it has been put 
into operations? 
The Practical Schoolman Looks to Research-special- 
ists for Information Regarding Four Aspects of the 
Problem.—The curriculum-maker must know about the 
pupils to be educated. The practical curriculum-maker has 
much to learn from studies that have been made or that 
he can himself make for his own community, of the num- 
ber of adolescents of each age-group who are in public 
school, in parochial or other private schools, at special 
schools or institutions for the blind, the crippled, the men- 
tal defectives, or who are out of school at work, at home, 
or just idling. Of those who are in school he needs to 
know what pupils are accelerated and what ones retarded, 
the physical deficiencies likely to affect school work, the 
native intelligence and social characteristics of each pupil, 
and his skill and knowledge in the fundamental subjects, 
Such knowledge regarding the potential secondary 
pupils will cast much light on what subjects should be 
offered, and what ones need to be subdivided to provide 
for groups of pupils who would not find needed opportuni- 
ties in any one kind of mathematics or English or physical

education or other courses. The fundamental differences 
between the program as worked out by the writer and his 
associates at Solvay, New York, in 1913-1916,'° and that 
used at the Blewett Junior High School, St. Louis, 1917- 
20 17 and the secondary school program of the Washing- 
ton School of New York 1® where all of the pupils were 
above normal intelligence and all going to college, were 
based on the needs of each secondary population group with 
which it was the school’s function to deal. 
The curriculum-maker needs information regarding 
the relative worth of subject-matter. 
But this information tells only a part of the story. 
What are the activities of individuals and groups in social 
life that require educative experiences directed by the 
secondary school? What is the character of society for 
which the school must prepare the rising generation so that 
it may contribute most and do the least harm? Shall we 
be content in this field with such careful subjective analyses 
as Bobbitt has made? #9 What objective studies have been 
made that are of value, what ones can be improved upon or 
validated by curriculum-makers for their own communi- 
ties? For what other studies should we look to research- 
specialists for help? The answers to these questions will 
help the practical curriculum-maker in determining in what 
parts of his program he can proceed with the greatest 
assurance that he is teaching the skills and knowledge of

most certain social value, in what fields he must proceed

seems probably valuable, and in what fields it may seem

The third contribution of science that may be of value 
to the curriculum-maker is the measured results of differ- 
ent arrangements of subject-matter and of different 
methods of teaching. In this field, he may find the answer 
to the question concerning the quantity of subject-matter 
and its arrangement in any course of study, or the length 
of time that these units should be given in order to cover 
a given amount of content. On the other hand, it may tell 
him in what fields he is dependent on his own subjective 
judgment based on practical experience, or on the opinions 
of educational theorists. 
The curriculum-maker must understand the implica- 
tions of the contributions to educational science being 
made by psychology. 
Finally, the curriculum-maker can gain from the con- 
tributions of educational psychologists much help in adapt- 
ing the curriculum-content and method in harmony with 
the laws of learning, the nature of adolescence, the degree 
and methods of transfer of training, and the nature and 
degree of individual differences. Knowledge of educa- 
tional psychology helps in determining whether or not 
certain subjects should be offered, or if offered, whether 
they should be elective, advised, prescribed for some pupils, 
or for all. It helps greatly in determining the grade or 
age-placement of certain subject-matter and methods.

  36 WHAT IS SCIENTIFIC METHOD? 
An application to the teaching of English expression, of 
these four aspects of scientific attitude toward curricu- 
lum-reform. 
1. Uniform courses in English expression—oral and 
written composition, rhetoric, functional and formal 
grammar—are usually prescribed in secondary schools 
from grades seven to eleven, and frequently in the twelfth 
grade as well. But it is obvious that all pupils do not have 
the same shortcomings, indeed, that many pupils speak 
and write with sufficient accuracy and skill for all the 
exigencies of ordinary social intercourse, so that for them 
elective courses should be offered, but no prescription is 
necessary. English expression and reading-ability are 
closely related to native intelligence, so that the standards 
to be set for a bright pupil may be very different from those 
set for less able ones. 
2. The social justification for prescribed practice in 
spelling or punctuation is more certain than informal 
grammar, description, and playwriting, but how much 
more certain, must be determined by research. 
3. The relative wisdom of teaching a rational basis 
for the mechanics of expression, or of drilling to habituate 
correct forms, is a question that has not yet been answered, 
except by a priori judgments. Research-specialists must 
make carefully controlled experiments for the surer guid- 
ance of curriculum-makers. 
4. The curriculum-reformer must understand the 
application of the “laws of learning” to the setting-up 
and control of expression-experiences, projects, reviews, 
drills; he must appreciate the wide range of appeals to 
interest that must be made, the different types of activities 
and the flexibility of standard of attainment for pupils of 
different degrees and types of ability and of different social

inheritances ; he must know what can be expected of ado- 
lescents, what typical attitudes and impulses must be 
exploited, what ones overcome, and what ones tolerated 
or avoided ; and finally he must know what psychology has 
to say on the subject of formal discipline and the inference 
for the teaching of formal grammar, of demanding neat 
papers, of encouraging systematic statement of experiences 
in logical order. 
In the following chapters the attempt has been made to 
set forth some of the more significant contributions of 
scientists in the four fields just mentioned.

  CHAPTER IV 
WHO ARE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS? 
In this chapter will be given some typical data to show 
how rapidly the secondary school enrolment has grown 
since 1890. Two outstanding phases of these findings are 
(1) the break with the earlier conception of secondary 
education as a selective instrument for educating the more 
able and the socially more favored children; and (2) the 
change in quality of pupils entering secondary schools at 
the present time. That the present secondary schools are 
still selective along social and economic lines is shown, 
and the implications pointed out. 
Following this, abstracts of studies are given showing 
the range of abilities of secondary pupils, the limits of 
educational progress of pupils of different levels of intelli- 
gence, the fallacy of selecting pupils on the basis of verbal 
or abstract intelligence; and finally a study to show the 
difference between the aspirations and probable futures at 
junior high school pupils. 
' All adolescents are potentially secondary school pupite \ 
As the teachers of the Washington Irving High School 
of New York City stated in 1911 in regard to the scope 
of their school, a public high school differs from an ele- 
mentary school chiefly in the age of its children. 
Relatively, Secondary School Enrolments Have 
Grown More Rapidly than Population or than Elementary 
School Enrolments.—The more rigorous enforcement of 
compulsory-attendance laws and child-labor legislation, the 
increased respect for education, the economic well-being 
38
-P-A-G-E-49
  SECONDARY SCHOOL ENROLMENTS 39 
of many classes of people, the growth of urban communi- 
ties, the general appreciation of the potentialities of educa- 
tion (in part an outcome of the needs felt during the 
World War), the social and business success of high 
school graduates as compared with those who have not 
attended or completed secondary school, the recruiting 
campaign carried on by the schools and by social agencies, 
and finally, the broader offerings and more sympathetic 
attitude of better conceived secondary schools—these are 
some reasons why the secondary schools have grown 
out of all proportion to the growth in population or 
the growth of elementary enrolment. Numerous studies 
have recently emphasized the extraordinary growth of high 
school enrolments. 
The Massachusetts State Department of Education 
has made public interesting data concerning the growth of 
high school enrolments of 16.5 per cent. in 1922, as com- 
pared with 1921, while elementary education increased but 
2.1 per cent. In 1917, 70.3 per cent. of first year pupils 
returned the next year; in 1918, 75.7 per cent. so returned; 
in 1919, 82.7 per cent. so returned; and in 1920, 90.2 per 
cent. so returned. The same relative increase was main- 
tained through the junior and senior years of the 
high schools.?

son of the growth of high school enrolment, and of the 
growth of total population and the elementary school 
enrolment.

The index numbers are found by dividing the total population and the total enrolment for each date by the respec- 
tive averages for the eleven periods considered. (Adapted from U. S. Bureau of 
Education Bulletin, No. 19, 1920, p. 47.) 
Calculating on the basis of the total population of the 
age group representing the average age of each grade, 
Byrne publishes the following summary table: *

Thus for every one hundred children in the United 
States of sixth grade age in 1918, 92.1 pupils were in this 
grade; for every 100 boys and girls of one age normal for 
the ninth grade, 35.9 pupils are in the ninth grade. This 
is only an approximation, of course, since no one pretends 
that all ninth grade pupils are of ninth grade age, but 
whatever the error, it is reasonably constant from age- 
group to age-group, so that the comparisons are valid. 
Much Still Remains to be Done if We Aspire to a Social 
Democracy.—American secondary education has shown 
amazing percentile growths, but we must remember that 
in 1870, public secondary education was insignificant, so 
that even increases of several hundred per cent. still leave 
a half or two-thirds of our potential high school popula- 
tion with no high school education. In America we aspire 
to a social democracy, to an unstratified society, where 
rank and birth count for little except as they express them- 
selves in a greater ability and readiness to serve, and so 
to contribute to the welfare and happiness of all. We can- 
not patise to congratulate ourselves because one-third of 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
    42 WHO ARE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS? 
the children of secondary age are at least coming in con- 
tact with our secondary institutions. Rather we may note 
the fact, and be heartened by it to push onward toward 
the day, when all mentally normal children will enter 
secondary institutions before they become adolescent. 
Encouraged and given such opportunities, they will come 
into their inheritance, not only by “learning” processes 
and facts from instructors and textbooks, but still more 
from associated living in a controlled environment. 
The selective character of American secondary educa- 
tion coincides largely with social and economic classes.

population of four typical American cities—Seattle, Wash.,

“Tt is probable, for three reasons, that the proportion of children 
in high school from the laboring groups is somewhat smaller than this 
tabulation suggests. In the first place, the acceptance of the number 
of men over forty-five in each occupation as the basis for comparison 
gives a certain advantage to those occupations in which the proportion 
of such men is relatively small, because over thirty per cent. of the 
fathers of high school students are under forty-five. Since on the 
average the laboring classes are recruited less from the older men than 
are the other groups, it is apparent that the procedure followed here 
favors them. In the second place, the average number of children per

family among the manual laborers is somewhat larger than it is among 
the other classes of the population. In the third place, earlier marriages 
and a higher marriage-rate among the laboring classes than among the 
more well-to-do members of society work toward the same end.

without being complacent about the broader, but no less

definite, selection that is still going on. Wherever broadly 
conceived junior high schools are established,** they are 
succeeding in holding the pupils through the ninth grade. 
But to do this it has meant the establishment of core- 
curriculum courses from which all pupils of whatever 
mental or social status could profit, and the establishment 
of varying standards for advancement, and flexible cur- 
riculum-opportunities. Such provisions do not result in 
any decrease of opportunity for the more able and 
scholarly pupils. 
The senior high school and the four year high school 
likewise must adopt variable standards and varying oppor- 
tunities. They must see to it that all pupils of high mental- 
ity, and more favored social and economic parentage, do 
not, by electing college preparatory curricula, fail to mingle 
with the rest who elect commercial and practical curricula. 
Some of the same subjects must be prescribed and offered 
as electives in all curricula. And in music, art, physical 
training, luncheon-hours, and all occasions when homo- 
geneous grouping on the basis of mental brightness is not 
essential, deliberate effort should be made to cut across 
the divisions that probably cannot be avoided on 
other occasions. 
To speak of the high school as properly selective 
because its function is to train leaders is a peculiarly 
dangerous misconception. Leaders are developed through 
their application of social and mental qualities in social 
economic milieux. Secretaries of labor-councils, political 
leaders and shop-foremen will always be products of labor- 
activities, political campaigns, and factory-operation.

  MENTAL AND SOCIAL QUALIFICATIONS 47 
Leadership in practical-life situations will not be influ- 
enced by high school education until those who have 
attended high school long enough to be much affected by 
its influence enter our industrial life as workers, and our 
political life as members of political clubs. 
What are the Mental and Social Qualifications of High 
School Pupils?—Secondary schools are still selective agen- 
cies, though not to the extent that they have been in the 
past; the basis of selection is partly abstract or verbal 
intelligence, and partly the amount of social ambitions of 
parents and their willingness and ability to send their 
children to high school. This is not to say that second- 
ary schools consciously undertake any such selection; 
it is rather the result of too narrow curriculum-oppor- 
tunities, and insistence on traditional standards of 
abstract scholarship. 
Thorndike ® asserts that the number of high school 
pupils in 1918 was six times that in 1890; and that the 
pupils of today are different from those of twenty-five 
years ago, not only in their experiences and interests, but 
also in their inborn abilities. 
“We lack measures of the inborn capacities of the one in ten 
or eleven of a generation ago and have only very scanty measures 
. . of the capacities of the one in three of today. We have, however, 
excellent reason for believing that the one in ten had greater capacities 
for algebra and for intellectual tasks generally than the one in three 
of today. 
“We know that education is selective . . . Let us consider the 
effect of what seems a reasonable degree of this selective force, say 
that represented by a correlation of .70 . . . If only one in ten of each 
coming age-group enters high school, 95 per cent. of the pupils study- 
ing algebra will be above average in native intellectual capacity; in the

latter case (if one in three enters), only 83 per cent. In the former 
case seven-tenths of the pupils will be in the top fifth of human beings 
for intellect; in the latter case, only four and one-half tenths.”

Fic. 2.—Distribution of Alpha scores of high school freshmen and high school seniors compared with Alpha scores of literate recruits and officers of the United States army. 
Limits are set to educational achievement by limited intelligence. 
Miss Margaret V. Cobb® has presented the results of a number of 
studies of the intelligen-: of high school pupils, as measured partly 
by the Stanford-Binet Test, but chiefly by the Army Alpha test. In 
particular Miss Cobb presents the Alpha distribution for each grade 
of the several four year high schools of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and 
Michigan. These results are checked against the scores made by 
Michigan literate recruits and officers in the United States Army, 
during the war. 
“The influence of intelligence on continuance in school appears 
also when we look at the elimination that takes place among the fresh- 
men of least intelligence.” It has been shown in the article that a 
freshman who scores 77.5 on the Alpha test will as a senior score 90. 
By comparing the number in the freshman class scoring below 77.5 
with the number in the senior class that score below 90, a rough 
notion can be obtained of the extent of this elimination. In general 
about one in seven, at this lower level of intelligence, remains to 
graduate; such level is estimated to correspond to a mental age of 
14 years.

Fic. 3.—A, per cent. of recruits who had entered high school at different Alpha levels. B, per cent. of recruits who had become high school seniors at differ- ent Alpha levels. C, per cent. of recruits who had entered college at different Alpha levels. 
“Table IX shows the per cents. entering high school, college, 
etc, at each Alpha level. Figure 2 illustrates the first column 
of this table, and shows the situation for high school freshmen. Of 
those scoring less than 35 on Alpha, 4 in 100 reported that they had 
entered high school; of those scoring 155 or better, 93 in 100, or 23 
times as many, so reported. The comparison, based on Alpha scores, 
omits the illiterate group altogether. It is probable that, had they been 
included, the chance of entering high school would have been at least 
30 times as great for those over 155 as for those below 35.”

  50 WHO ARE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS? 
The distribution of literate recruits and enlisted men shown in 
the foregoing figure indicates a modal score of 40 in the Army Alpha 
test, whereas high school freshmen have a central tendency of 
between 80 and 95, and high school seniors a central tendency of about 
120. How much of these increased scores is due to school training and 
how much to native intelligence is a moot question. But there is 
essential agreement among psychologists that whatever the relative 
importance, native capacity is at least one of the factors affecting the 
scores on the Army Alpha Intelligence test, and, therefore, that the 
high school enrolment is more or less selected as compared with the 
general population. Whatever it is of nature and nurture that the 
Army Alpha test measures, it is worthy of note that although the 
high school freshman scores vary from 35 (mental age 11 years) to 
185 (a very superior adult score) fewer than 7% per cent. have less 
than the median intelligence of all the literate officers and men 
measured in the Army. 
The Vocational Aspirations of Junior High School 
Pupils and the Chances of Their Fulfilment.—If the reader 
will examine the three distributions in the diagram above, 
he will note the decrease in the percentages of all ability- 
groups who reached the senior year of the high school 
or entered college, as compared with those who entered 
high school; but he will note that whereas considerable 
numbers of the higher-ability groups did go through high 
school and enter college, very few of those who scored less 
than 115 did either. The question must then arise: If 
most pupils who score less than 115 (mental age 16 years 
6 months) cannot, or at least do not, succeed with work 
of college grade, what should the school do with pupils 
of less than that level of ability who aspire to professions 
that can be reached only through study at college or 
its equivalent? 
How many pupils do aspire for goals that can be 
reached only by pupils of above average intelligence has 
been shown by a recent study of 1581 junior high school

6 per cent., clerical 72, or less than 5 per cent., manufactur- 
ing 680, or over 40 per cent., trade 356, or 43 per cent., 
other occupations 207, or 12 per cent. 
In commenting on an earlier study of boys’ and girls’ 
aspirations, Ayres 11 points out the difference between the 
kind and amounts of education the boys and girls hope to 
secure, and that actually being secured at that time 
in Springfield. 
Yet both in the Baltimore study and the Springfield 
study, the really significant feature is that such large 
numbers did choose occupations for which they might 
reasonably aspire and for which the school, if it is resource- 
ful, can give preparation fitted to the needs and abilities 
of the pupils. 
Boys and girls of high school age, both within and— 
without the high school, who are not now benefiting as they 
might by secondary education present most pressing prob- 
lems to the curriculum-maker.

tive in curriculum-readjustments, though not generally 
treated by experts in scientific curriculum-making—the 
maladjustments of curriculum-standards to the ability and 
interests of many pupils. 
Many mentally normal pupils fail. Of course, much 
of the irregularity of progress and the concomitant elim- 
ination from school, is the result of low intelligence and 
the lack of modification of promotion-standards to provide 
for it. But probably many pupils of normal or superior 
intelligence fail in every grade from the first through 
college, because of unusual emotional reactions, poor 
health, outside distractions, defects of character, poor 
preparation in lower grades, artificial promotion-standards, 
and the like. In college, Colvin states, after studying the 
correlation of intelligence-ratings and academic standing, 
aman with high intelligence has two chances in five of high 
academic standing, four in five of at least satisfactory 
standing, and one in five of unsatisfactory standing.’? 
Is the school standard of success valid? The question 
of the social validity of a standard of success and failure 
is complicated. There are not lacking those who draw 
from their analysis of the community’s demands the justi- 
fication of failure for unsatisfactory work, regardless of 
causes, as the only true preparation for the world of actu- 
ality that must be lived in.1* 
Moral and emotional qualities are involved. On the 
other hand there are those who believe that failures are 
often, perhaps usually, needless. McCormick’* has

RETARDATION AND ELIMINATION 53 
recently pointed out that failures depend comparatively 
little on inherent ability, size of classes, subjects studied, 
or year in the high school; they depend much more on the 
attitude of pupils toward their work, their out-of-school 
study-habits, codperation between student and teacher, and 
between parent and teacher, and on the personality, pro- 
fessional preparation, and professional attitude of 
the teacher. 
Pupils Who Fail, and Those Who Leave, Present 
Complicated Problems to the Curriculum-maker.— 
Studies of elimination and failure have been common 
since Ayres’ study 1° was published. Since the publication 
of this book, and somewhat as a result of the great amount 
of discussion it aroused, more attention has been paid to 
the maladjustment of the pupils. The improved conditions 
have given a false sense of security, however. Burdge 
shows that six-sevenths of all the 16-, 17- and 18-year-old 
boys in New York State are out of school. 
The vast majority of these boys left school because they wanted 
to go to work and not because they were obliged to. Sixty five per 
cent., however, remained in school one or more years beyond the com- 
pulsory age limit. Over 30 per cent. left on or before reaching the 
legal age for leaving school. About 6 per cent. left school illegally. 
The report shows that there is a distinct correlation between fathers’ 
and boys’ occupations and between the last grade completed and the 
type of occupation. Most boys leaving school on or before completing 
the eighth grade enter and desire to enter the industrial trades 
and occupations. 
Burdge concludes that these boys are thoroughly averse to further 
schooling and that compulsory part-time continuation-school and night- 
school work will be practically valueless unless an interest in further

education can be awakened. “They must be convinced,” he says, 
“that by completing certain definite and practical short courses they 
can increase their earning capacity and secure promotion. The major 
part of the future training and education of these boys will be secured 
through business and social contacts, but this must be supplemented by 
carefully selected and well planned short continuation-school courses 
which are attractive to boys because of their practical value.” 
Intelligence-tests Most Adequately Forecast Success 
in Subjects Demanding Abstract Reasoning; But a 
School of Rich and Varied Opportunities Provides for 
Successful Work By Many Who Have Not High I. Q.’s.— 
While it is true that conventional preparation for the pro- 
fessions, and for colleges as professional-training schools, 
does depend on the intelligence measured by the Binet- 
Simon scale and its derivatives, it is also true that there 
are other forms of efficiency not measured by these tests 
of abstract or verbal intelligence. 
Stenquist 7 has shown for 275 seventh and eighth 
grade boys, that success with the Stenquist Mechanical 
Tests was not dependent on the types of ability measured 
by a composite of the National Intelligence Tests, A. & B., 
Haggerty 2, Otis Group Test, the Myers’ Test and the 
Thorndike Visual Vocabulary Test. There was a positive 
correlation of only .21. As between the same composite 
of intelligence-tests and the Stenquist Assembling Test, 
Series I for 267 boys, the correlation was + .23; for 
Series II (100 cases) the correlation was + .34; and for 
the Picture Test II, 296 cases, the correlation was + .34. 
Bird and Pechstein '* compared the shop-ratings of 
25 boys with their Binet Intelligence Quotients and found 
a positive correlation of only .14.

  INTELLIGENCE TESTS 55 
Ira J. Bright found a positive correlation of .36 
between the results on the Terman Group Intelligence Test 
and the pupils’ success in handicrafts. 
At the Lincoln School of Teachers College the pupils 
have awarded citizenship-insignia to those pupils who have 
shown superiority in social qualities: (1) honesty, (2) 
pride in the appearance of the school, (3) followership, 
(4) courtesy, (5) loyalty, (6) sportsmanship, (7) fellow- 
ship, (8) leadership, (9) sense of economic value, (10) 
obedience, (11) trustworthiness. The votes received for 
six of these qualities, most directly related to leadership, 
have been correlated with the Binet I.Q.’s for 75 pupils of 
grades 7-12. The result is a very low positive correlation. 
‘ The progressive school is furnishing more and more 
opportunities for pupils with relatively low abstract or 
verbal intelligence. The world has need of educated artists 
and mechanics, it has need of educated leaders, and second- 
ary schools that would serve society are offered opportuni- 
ties for development of social qualities and manual skills, 
independent of the abilities in abstract intelligence. 
Reciprocally, there is being asserted and recognized 
the right of pupils with low abstract intelligences to 
develop their mechanical, artistic, and social powers, so that 
they may realize their potentialities free from artificial 
hurdles demanding abstract intelligences. 
Intelligence-tests are most useful for prognoses of suc- 
cess in subjects in which the pupil’s activity depends on 
reading, and in which the response is verbal. This is indi- 
cated by their correlations with the results in reading- and 
vocabulary-tests.

| CHAPTER V 
CAN WE DERIVE THE CURRICULUM 
‘FROM LIFE? 
The Needs and Activities of What Groups are Impor- 
tant to the Curriculum-maker.—In Chapter IV, there have 
been presented typical studies of the boys and girls of 
high school age who, whether in school or not, are poten- 
tially members of the high school population. /The-most 
immediate problem of instruction is to satisfy the present 
needs of the pupils; but no well-conceived plan for the 
secondary curriculum can leave out of account the adoles- 
cent boys and girls who do not now attend school. The 
trend of state legislation regarding compulsory attendance, 
the increasing ability of parents to support their children 
for some years beyond the completion of elementary 
school, the changes in industry whereby much labor 
formerly done by fourteen- to sixteen-year-old children is 
_now done by automatic machinery, workman’s compensa- 
tion legislation that makes it expensive to have irrespon- 
sible young folks working with complicated machinery or 
| with chemicals that might affect them injuriously; these 
and many other considerations make it necessary to plan 
the curriculum for groups of pupils that have not hereto- 
fore given schoolmen much concern, 
Somewhat more remote, but nevertheless of more per- 
manent importance, are the needs of the adults, the activi- 
ties they perform and their failures of adjustment. These 
should serve as guides to determine the inclusions and the 
emphases of the school curriculum if the school is to help 
to correct social shortcomings.

  60 CURRICULUM FROM LIFE 
Analyses are Made of Activities in the Skill-subjects 
Sometimes for the Specialist and Sometimes for the Non- 
Specialist—It was pointed out in Chapter III that four 
authorities on scientific curriculum-making advocate the 
analysis of activities of human beings in order to find what 
activities must be experienced by pupils, and the situa- 
tions to which adjustment must be made. On the basis of 
such analyses, it is possible to select the traits and abilities 
that it is most important to develop, so that the situations 
may be met in a superior way. An example of such an 
analysis at elementary and junior high school level are the 
spelling-lists of Ayres, Ashbaugh, Pryor, and others. 
Adults write letters and reports, school-children write 
themes and notebook records. Counts of the actual words 
used can be made and those words that appear frequently 
form a gross spelling-vocabulary for the non-specialist. 
The words frequently misspelled would be those to be 
drilled until the right spelling is automatic. For pupils 
who have persistent difficulties, errors may be analyzed and 
special corrective drills devised. The elementary curric- 
ulum has the non-specialist in mind, as do general courses 
of the higher educational units. But in the high school © 
commercial curriculum or in the “ business college,” a 
much more extensive vocabulary would be taught to pupils 
who are training to become stenographers; for they are 
specialists. For them word-counts would be made of busi- 
ness letters and business reports. 
In handwriting, the studies of Freeman and of Koos 
give some suggestion of the quality of writing that is 
demanded by social usage, the minimal standard that the 
elementary school should strive to make its pupils attain. 
But a training school for bookkeepers might make a more 
extended study to find not only whether a better quality or 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
SUBJECTIVE ANALYSES 61 
greater rapidity is demanded, but also the relative impor- 
tance of writing figures and of writing words, the slant, 
size, length of line, and other factors that would be impor- 
tant in the specific training of a bookkeeper. 
And so for arithmetic. One needs to find out what 
arithmetic the non-specialist uses, what processes, what 
problems, what degree of skill he needs. This would 
govern the elementary course or the general prescription. 
But the accountant needs more processes, more facility; 
and to find what his arithmetical needs are, an analysis 
of his vocational activities would be required, on the basis 
of which the training courses for accountants could be 
built up. 
Other analyses of activities for the skill- and informa- 
tion-subjects have been made, and the scope of some of the 
most significant ones are summarized at the end of this 
chapter. Many such studies so far published have been 
collected and summarized in Charters’ Curriculum Con- 
struction, Chs. xvi-xx. 
Subjective Analyses of the Activities and Needs of 
Adolescents and Adults Still Constitute Good Practice.— 
The practical curriculum-maker must use a priori judg- 
ment. In a sense, practically all programs of study are 
based upon, or justified by, the opinions of administrators 
and teachers of what pupils and adults need to perform 
their work or to enjoy their leisure. Too frequently this 
subjective analysis is mere rationalization to justify inclu- 
sions or exclusions that tradition or extraneous conditions 
make necessary. But the programs in the most progressive 
schools are now and must be for many years in the future 
the result of careful thinking, based on general observation 
and on a knowledge of psychology and sociology, and ona 
sound working philosophy.

62 CURRICULUM FROM LIFE 
Such an analysis is not objective; the conclusions 
reached will be different according to the philosophy and 
erudition of the curriculum-thinker concerned. But among 
the ever-increasing number of educators who agree on the 
general principles of educational philosophy, sociology, 
psychology, organization, and the like, such subjective 
analyses may find general acceptance, even if there may be 
considerable disagreement on details. 
Bobbitt has analyzed subjectively the activities and 
needs of adults to obtain objectives. He has attempted to 
discover the knowledges, skills, habits, attitudes, desires, 
that are necessary to attain the accepted objectives of edu- 
cation. While these specific, immediate objectives are not 
scientifically determined, that is, no statistical count has 
been made, Bobbitt feels that common sense is sufficient 
guide for the analysis of routine activities of people, and 
that it is safe to base procedure for the correction and sup- 
port of these activities on conclusions drawn from such 
subjective analyses. The report of his first year’s efforts 
in directing the reconstruction of the secondary school 
curriculum in Los Angeles has been discussed in the School 
Review of February, 1923, Vol. xxxi, No. 2, by Charters 
and Snedden. 
Objective Analyses of the Activities and Needs of 
Adolescents and Adults May be Arranged, More or Less, 
in the Order of Complexity and Range—Only specific 
activities permit of accurate job-analyses. Few social 
processes are so simple and direct that objective evidence 
alone can be obtained such that conclusions as to objectives 
or curriculum-content and -method can be drawn with the 
exactness of mathematical logic. The same social facts 
would lead to many interpretations and, perhaps, to even 
more recommendations regarding education. But some
-P-A-G-E-73
  
OCCUPATIONAL ANALYSES 63 
activities do lend themselves very well to analysis and the 
laying-out of plans of instruction. Such are job-analyses 
of operatives or even skilled workers. Such an analysis 
deals with a man’s activity as a tinsmith, and is not to 
be directly concerned with his duties as a citizen, or with 
his leisure-time activities. 
Occupational analyses are useful in vocational educa- 
tion because objectives are clearly defined. There has been 
considerable advance in getting this kind of information, 
to be used as a direct control for the courses of study pre- 
paring for the vocations. Very few of these studies in- 
clude much more than a start at difficulty-analyses; they 
seldom contain more than mere suggestions that some 
processes, skills, attitudes, etc., are less frequently present 
or are harder to obtain than others. 
Indianapolis Vocational Survey: Under the direction of Mr. 
Charles H. Winslow, analyses were made in connection with the 
Survey in Indianapolis, Indiana, 1915-16, of the automobile industry, 
machine-shop work, blacksmithing, boiler-making, drop-forging, 
foundry industry, sheet-metal industry, woodworking industry, tele- 
phone-industry, heat-, light- and power-generation, transportation, 
building trades, salesmanship, printing, garment-making industries, 
canning industry, housekeeping, and apprenticeships. 
Such studies of the industries explain something of their history 
and present status, the union-jurisdiction, if any, the divisions of the 
trade and specialization of workers, the regularity of work, and a 
general statement of the tasks performed by the worker, “ occupa- 
tional analyses.” Thus “The bricklayer does any kind of brick 
work, plain or ornamental, inside or outside, that is required in the 
construction of buildings. He also sets stone trimmings in brick 
walls; builds walls with cement blocks, hollow tile, terra cotta, mack- 
o-lite, and other materials used as substitutes for brick and stone; 
sets hollow tile for reinforced-concrete floors; and fireproofing 
materials. The work is not limited to building construction but includes 
any class of construction work that involves the use of the materials 
just mentioned. The bricklayer must be proficient in building straight 
walls, both inside and outside, inside and outside corners, chimneys, air 
passages around door, window, and other frames. He must know
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 CURRICULUM FROM LIFE 
how to run arches and gables; how to lay terra cotta and other orna- 
mental trimmings; to cleanpoint the walls or other work he does; 
how to cut openings and make repairs in his work. The bricklayer 
should have a general knowledge of the many materials used in masonry 
construction ; the substitutes for brick and stone; different ingredients 
of mortar; modern building construction; modern methods of laying 
brick and handling material.”* 
In the Cleveland, Ohio, Survey, 1915-16, occupational studies were 
made, and reported in the following monographs: (a) Boys and Girls 
in Commercial work; (b) Department Store Occupations; (c) The 
Garment Trades, and Dressmaking and Millinery; (d) Railroad and 
Street Transportation; (e) The Building Trades; and (f) The Metal 
Trades. Summaries of these reports constitute part of a volume 
called “ Wage Earning and Occupation.”* The following excerpts are 
from Chapter XII in “ Boys and Girls in Commercial Work :” 
“The difference between boys and girls begins at the beginning. 
Boys are given a larger share of the positions which the youngest 
worker can fill, Boys are taken for such work and taken younger 
than girls, not merely because the law permits them to go to work at 
an earlier age, but also because business itself intends to round their 
training. Girls, on the contrary, are expected to enter completely 
trained for definite positions. This fact alone would in most cases 
compel them to be older. Furthermore, because boys in first positions 
are looked upon as potential clerks, miscellaneous jobs about the office 
have for them a two-fold value. They give the employer a chance 
to weed out unpromising material; and they give boys an opportunity 
to find themselves and to gather ideas about the business and methods 
which they may be able to make use of in later adjustments. 
“ Girls’ training, if it is to meet the present situation, must prepare 
for a future in specialized clerical work; boys’ futures must apparently 
be thought of as in mostly clerical and administrative fields. The 
term ‘clerical’ as here used covers bookkeepers, cashiers and account- 
ants, stenographers and typists, clerks and a miscellaneous group of 
younger workers such as messengers, office boys, etc. ‘ Administrative’ 
covers proprietors, officials, managers, supervisors, and agents, but it 
does not include salespeople. 
“ The essential difference between the clerkship which boys for the 
most part hold and the general clerical work which girls do is that the 
boys’ work is unified and is a definite, separate responsible part of the 
business, usually in line for promotion to some other clerkship; the

girls’ is a miscellany of more or less unrelated jobs and is not a 
preparation for specific promotion.” 
Junior Commercial Occupations: In 1919 the Federal Board for 
Vocational Education, in view of the necessity of providing for com- 
mercial education in part-time schools, made a study of junior com- 
mercial occupations, under the direction of F. G. Nichols, then 
Assistant Director in charge of Commercial Education.* The survey 
included the characteristics and duties of boys and girls holding 
office and store-positions, who were 14 to 17 years old inclusive. The 
brief job-analyses and records of previous training resulted in recom- 
mendations not only for the work to be offered in continuation-schools, 
but for modifications in the regular high school commercial curricula. 
More specific analyses for particular commercial occupations: 
More specific job-analyses of some junior commercial occupations were 
reported by the University of California in conjunction with the 
California State Board of Education. Three of these reports are 
entitled: (1) An Analysis of Department Store Occupations; (2) An 
Analysis of the Work of Juniors in Banks, and (3) Junior Employees 
in the Retail Drug Business.‘ 
For each occupation there are given general facts about the job, 
and there are listed the duties, knowledge required, teaching-content, 
and promotional possibilities. For example, the analysis of department 
store stock boys and girls duties include: 
Regular Duties 
“yt, Follow store-rules and regulations as to time of arrival, dress, 
disposition of parcels, relief-time, shopping-time, lunch-hour, etc. 
“2, Uncover and dust merchandise for a given department. 
“3, See that merchandise is in order—that parts match, or that it 
is correctly boxed and arranged according to price, color, style number, 
size, etc. 
“4, Bring new merchandise from stock-room or take merchandise 
to ‘bargain-pit’ or table. 
“ss. Keep department in good appearance, replacing articles after 
they have been examined or tried on by customers. 
“6, Report any merchandise not in perfect condition. 
“7, Make minor repairs, such as sewing-on buttons, mending 
purses, toys, etc. 
“8. Act as department-messenger. 
“o, Assist in putting away and covering stock at night.

were made of the opportunities for physically handicapped men in 
various occupations. The Division of Rehabilitation of the Federal 
Board for Vocational Education studied the machinists’ trades, poultry- 
raising, and other occupations from this point of view; the United 
States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation published a 
bulletin in 1919 on Opportunities in Shipbuilding for the Physically 
Handicapped,’ The American Red Cross, Division of Vocational 
Guidance and The Institute for Crippled and Disabled Men,’ studied 
the brush-industry, rubber-industry, optical-goods industry, the shoe- 
industry. The very purpose of these surveys was to discover the 
difficulties and to find out if training could offset physical disabilities 
in meeting these difficulties. 
Modifications of School Procedure Are Based on Job- 
analyses.—To reduce specific objectives to teachable units 
requires patience and resource without limit. For the 
present the great uses that can be made of activity-analyses 
are to discover from them subject-matter now included 
in the curriculum for which little positive justification 
can be given in the light of human activities, and to 
discover important activities of adults for which neither 
the school nor other educational agency is giving ade- 
quate preparation. 
Thus, to teach stenography and formal bookkeeping to 
junior high school boys as a preparation for immediate 
entrance to commercial offices or department stores is 
unjustified in the light of the findings of the Cleveland, the 
Indianapolis, the Federal Board for Vocational Education, 
and the University of California Surveys. And to neglect 
to give intensive reviews of fundamental operations of 
arithmetic, handwriting, typewriting, a knowledge of busi- 
ness organization, and practice in courtesy to these boys, in 
the light of these surveys, is indefensible.

DIFFICULTY-ANALYSES 69 
Similarly, for a city high school to offer only stenog- 
raphy and bookkeeping to high school pupils, when it has 
been shown that great numbers of high school pupils who 
leave school enter commercial positions requiring sales- 
manship-training, or general office-practice, is extremely 
inefficient. 
At the Cass Technical High School at Detroit, prep- 
aration for each specific trade is broken up to show what 
mathematics, what English, what trade-skills are needed. 
An example of this is quoted under Principles III and 
IV further on. 
Job-analyses are Most Useful if Difficulties of Adjust- 
ment as Well as Frequencies are Discovered.—Thorough- 
going, scientifically made, difficulty-analyses used as a 
basis of training are those made by Charters ® of salesmen 
and Sunday-school teachers, and by Stevenson of life- 
insurance salesmen. In elementary education, difficulty- 
analyses have been made for arithmetic and spelling by 
several investigators. 
In directing the training of insurance-salesmen, Stevenson, Vice- 
president of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, first made a very 
thorough inventory of all of the situations that salesmen actually meet 
in making contacts, arranging interviews, presenting the case for insur- 
ance, giving advice as to the best form of policy, etc. Along with this 
frequency-study, he made another study of best practices, the way the 
most successful salesmen acted in every situation. 
Sufficient skill to meet many situations could be taught to most 
intelligent men on the basis of the knowledge gained from those two 
studies. But for other occasions still more constructive instruction 
was needed. In order to get the information necessary to give this 
help, difficulty-analyses were made. Every error made by the salesmen 
calls for analysis to find the causes and discover what instruction is 
needed to avoid such errors. Therefore careful descriptions were 
made of every failure to make a successful interview, or to give 
adequate information or advice, and a course of study and method of

instruction developed, by which shortcomings could be overcome, or 
better, could be anticipated and avoided.” 
Analyses of Unspecialized Activities of the Community Help 
in Determining Some Objectives.—Fuller * undertook “ to determine 
what problems and processes would be involved in a manual-arts 
course, based upon work which is done or may be done around the 
home by a handy man with a common carpenter’s and painter’s tools. 
The problems of investigation were: first, to discover the jobs; second, 
to list and classify them; and third, to determine what processes 
were involved. 
“, By personal interviews with fifty people, I made a preliminary 
list of the things which they do or have done about the house. 
“2. I supplemented these interviews by personal inspection of 
twelve houses. 
“3, All the items were then grouped under general headings of 
painting, furniture-repair, etc. In all there were 328 items. These 
were printed in form of a questionnaire.” 
On the 430 blanks used and returned, 54 jobs were mentioned 
150 or more times, These supplied the activities to be taught. To 
decide what tool-processes should be taught, these activities were now 
analyzed. The processes required more than 5 times each, are given:

Screwing .... oe 5 
Nailing .. -14

Sawing . EE

  The determination of frequencies of processes safeguards the 
selection of projects which will provide skill in the desirable number 
of tool-processes. But whether this skill would be developed through 
the environment without formal instruction is not discovered by this 
type of study.

ment, there are needed more studies of what boys and girls 
are actually doing outside the classroom. 
Frequently alert teachers, critical of their own courses, make such 
simple studies as the following. Of some 500 girls of the junior high 
schools of Lincoln, Nebraska, the question was asked :7 “ What do you 
do to help in your home after school and on Saturday and Sunday?”

Two of the best known studies of extraschool activi-

Superintendent J. C. Engleman and Principal Jesse B. 
Newlon,* and the Recreation Survey of Ipswich, Mass., 
by H. R. Knight,** in codperation with Superintendent of 
Schools, F. B. Knight. 
At Decatur, a questionnaire was addressed to the high school 
pupils, from the answers to which information was tabulated regarding 
(1!) the pupils’ families; (2) their home duties on school days and 
on Saturdays; (3) their employments and earnings during term-time

and during vacations; (4) their home-study habits; (5) the books, 
magazines and papers read; (6) frequency of going to the moving 
pictures; (7) religious services attended (8) their present health and 
past illnesses; (9) the vocational aspirations and the plans for further 
education; (10) subjects desired by pupils, but not offered by the 
school; (11) the social organizations within and without the school 
to which pupils belonged and the amount of time given to each one, 
and (12) the qualities of teachers who had been most helpful to 
the pupils. 
General conclusions are drawn from the answers regarding needed 
changes in the high school, and proposed innovations were justified ; 
e.g., the need for a course in agriculture, the call for instruction in 
French, Spanish, electrical engineering, and pottery; the challenge to 
teachers of literature and history in the actual out-of-school readings 
of pupils. 
At Ipswich, Mass., during the hour and a half after school on 
two November afternoons, the investigators made careful observa- 
tions, called “ play soundings,” of the streets, vacant lots, yards, parks, 
and playgrounds, noting what all persons up to 21 years of age were 
doing. Of 696 young people observed, 262 or almost 40 per cent. were 
doing nothing, and of these 168 were idling in groups; 203 others were 
walking, a majority of whom were really idling, too. Only 11 per 
cent., or 78, were playing games, mostly football or baseball. In spite 
of the wealth of parks, playgrounds and vacant lots, few boys, and 
only 11 girls played there; back yards were more popular, but the 
streets were the chief places for play and idling. 
A questionnaire was filled out by high school pupils regarding 
athletics, attendance at moving-picture shows, parties, and asking 
for suggestions for improvement of the social and athletic life of 
the high school. 
The recommendations dealt chiefly with the need of a vital program 
of physical instruction and direction of play-activities, the wider use 
of the school plant, and more adequate schoolyards; but it also 
emphasized the need for greater codperation between the school and 
other social agencies, the churches, scouts, Y. M. C. A., Public 
Library, fraternal orders and clubs, and the town officials. 
Many pupils are at work at some form of employment before 
and after school. Frequently such employment is educative in the 
best sense, other times it may be quite vicious in its effects on health 
and morals, Jarvis’s* study deals with 14,391 children (boys and 
girls) of urban communities of 11 states, of the 6th, 7th, and 8th 
grades only.

Hours.” U. S. Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1917, No. 20.

ANALYSES FOR ACADEMIC SUBJECTS 73 
The most usual employments were farm-work (43 per cent. of 
the boys and 26 per cent. of the girls), housework (50 per cent. of the 
girls), messenger service (25 per cent. of the boys). The other 
frequent occupations were waiting on store, street selling, and for 
boys, rough work. 
Sixty per cent. of the pupils studied preferred work to school; 
eight and a half per cent. desired to leave school; inability to make 
normal school progress accounted for the large number who dis- 
liked school. 
Activity-analyses Have Been Used in Reorganizing 
Courses of Study in Academic Subjects—In the study of 
mathematics for high school freshmen, Rugg and Clark 
sought aid in determining what should be the content of 
the course by finding: (a) what mathematics is used in 
other high school subjects; (b) what mathematics is used 
in corporation-school courses; (c) in trade-school courses ; 
and (d) in new types of “ general” and “junior high 
school” mathematics books. 
The first of these was an immediate study of pupil needs. 
Thus in physics, multiplication and division operations, the equation 
and the removal of radicals were most important, and ratio and pro- 
portion, fractional equations, multiplication and division of fractions, 
and the least common multiple and highest common factor, all were 
prominent. In chemistry, multiplication, division, evaluation, and 
ratio and proportion were most important. 
The second and third studies were based on the assumption that 
vocational schools could not or would not teach any mathematics that 
did not function in the vocational activities, for which they prepared. 
Whether the mathematics actually taught belonged in the ninth grade, 
would depend upon the number of vocations to which it was common. 
Eight trade school texts and nine corporation school texts were ana- 
lyzed. The outstanding characteristic was the absence of any compli- 
cated forms of algebraic operations, the omission of factoring, radicals, 
quadratics, from all but three books; graphs were used but rarely, 
and of literal formule almost no use was made. On the other hand, 
ratio and proportion was common to all texts, and evaluation stood out 
as one of three most used operations. Verbal problem material was 
difficult, and too technical to use in a general high school course 
of study. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 CURRICULUM FROM LIFE 
Washburne,*® describes the scientific method used by 
him in constructing science-courses, involving (1) the 
selection of subject matter by means of a statistical study, 
and (2) the arrangement of the selected material in accord- 
ance with such laws of the psychology of learning as have 
been experimentally established. The following is the 
summary of his explanation of the method used: 
“The subject-matter of ‘Common Science’ was elected by 
statistical study of questions asked by children of common experiences 
explainable in terms of scientific principles, and of practical applications 
of science in daily life. This subject-matter has been arranged in an 
orderly manner which brings out the relation of the laws to one 
another. Each topic is developed by (1) awakening and stimulating 
the pupil’s interest in it, (2) setting him to work in the doing of simple 
interesting experiments to follow out his interest, (3) a discussion to 
bring results of the experiment and the questions raised in the intro- 
ductory paragraphs to a definite head, (4) specific practice in the 
application of this particular principle to the explaining of facts or 
solving of problems, (5) unifying the whole and giving the child 
constant exercise in applying the various principles he has learned, 
through the inference exercises at the close of each section.” 
Analysis of Needs in Actual Situations Indicates the 
Knowledge and Skill to be Developed in Preparatory 
Courses.—The preparatory (“‘ propedeutic’’) function of 
many school courses is frequently valid, but, as often much 
is included in preparatory courses that has no application 
in the advanced courses for which they are supposed to 
prepare, there is a great need for further studies in this 
general field. 
“ Analysis of Mathematical Needs in a College Chemis- 
try Course” by Williams of the University of Illinois is 
a valuable example. 
“This study was made to throw some light upon the criticism 
that high school students entering college with a year of algebra and

a year of geometry do not have sufficient mathematics to handle 
freshman chemistry. With this practical purpose in mind the book 
selected for examination was the text, ‘A Textbook in Chemistry,’ 
by Professor ‘W. A. Noyes, required in the freshman chemistry course 
in the University of Illinois.” 
“Tn the analysis of the expository portion a careful examination 
* of the text was made to determine what words or expressions were used 
which were distinctly mathematical or which implied mathematics 
. . . In the second part of the study the problems were solved and 
where more than one solution was possible, the simplest was selected. 
The operations and quantities were classified in the first part and the 
frequency determined.” 
“Tt appears entirely feasible to construct a simple set of exercises 
or preferably practice tests for chemistry students, who would be 
required to attain efficiency in them outside of the class.” 
Glenn’s Study of Questions Asked by College Entrance 
Examinations in Chemistry and Physics: Schools prepar- 
ing for Regents’ examinations in New York and for col- 
lege entrance board examinations have for a long time

The Standard or Type of Achievement in Some Cases 
is not Readily Ascertained.—In the effort to find the desir- 
able quality of achievement or essential knowledge in many 
activities, however, much less satisfactory criteria must be 
used. In the case of home-making, for instance, while it 
may be possible to find how the model home is conducted, 
what activities the home-maker undertakes, what ones she 
supervises, what services she buys outright, one can only 
depend on consensus of judgments to decide what practice 
is commendable. 
A study made by a group of specialists associated with 
Rugg, proposed, in addition to the usual textbook analyses, 
that committees of home-economics associations under- 
take researches: 
1. Studies of home-making procedure in typical homes, 
by means of detailed question blanks on which investigators 
who go to the homes and by careful questioning secure  
-P-A-G-E-88
  78 CURRICULUM FROM LIFE 
answers to definitely formulated questions, and tabulate 
these replies of individual home-makers.1® 
2. Studies of the judgment of home-makers who have 
had previous experience in teaching home-economics. This 
will throw light on the problem of what it will be possible 
to do in the home through a careful training of children in 
public schools. 
Rugg’s investigation to find insistent, permanent prob- 
lems and issues of the contemporary economic, social and 
political life.?° 
Dissatisfied with the a priori reasoning used by text- 
book writers and committees on courses of study in choos- 
ing the content for civics, history, and geography courses, 
Rugg has undertaken to determine what social problems 
the present secondary population will have to deal with now 
and in the years tocome. After his custom he reviewed the 
historic development and the present status of the content 
of the social studies. Attacking the problem directly, with 
his collaborators, he has read carefully more than 150 out-   
* “From such a blank one finds out, for example, what proportion 
of homes of various types handles the laundry-work in the home—in 
what proportion commercial utilities are used. A good illustration of 
types of facts collected is the extent to which the home makes clothing, 
as contrasted with its use of ready-to-wear clothing. Similarly the 
extent to which home-makers patronize bargain sales, how frequently 
they use commercial patterns, make their own patterns, alter patterns, 
use a form in dressmaking, renovate fabrics, dye fabrics, etc. Facts 
have been collected concerning the extent to which labor-saving devices 
are used—how many use bread-mixers, cake-mixers, dish-washers, 
sewing-machines, vacuum-cleaners, etc. It is important to note how 
many keep household accounts; how many really operate their homes 
ona budget. The attendance upon clubs, to which much consideration 
of home-making problems is given, should also be canvassed, and the 
amount and kind of reading in home-making magazines. These that we 
have named are illustrative of the types of facts which have been 
collected by personal investigations of various types of homes,” p. 118.

standing critical works on contemporary problems, From 
this work 300 contemporary problems and issues have been 
formulated. They are, in turn, grouped around nine out- 
standing phases of American life. 
A working bibliography has been developed of something more 
than 1500 titles from a canvas of several thousand available books in 
the Columbia and New York Public Libraries; of the Book Review 
Digest for six years; of the reviews in a number of weekly magazines, 
read carefully during more than two years; of the recommendations 
of 80 authorities, through personal correspondence in 1921. 
A card catalog of three thousand generalizations has been developed 
in the fields of geography, economics, political science, sociology, etc. 
The detailed statistical analysis of contemporary problems and 
questions leading to their consideration has been begun. The question 
analysis for problems of immigration, population, and Americanization 
has been carried furthest. In May, 1922, the full report of the study 
to date was made to a group of the faculty of Teachers College for 
criticism and suggestions. 
While there have been numerous scientific studies in the same field 
of social study, all have dealt with present shortcomings of society or 
the shortcomings of current textbooks or curriculum-offerings. 
“The studies referred to have two weaknesses. They tell the 
curriculum-maker a part, but only a part of what children need to 
know to participate in social, economic, and political life as it is. 
They do not give nearly all of the curriculum, however, even for a 
static society. Their greater weakness is that they fit for life as it is 
today. They tend to ignore the needs of a rapidly changing society. 
We need of course, to prepare our youth adequately to participate in 
life activities. That, the studies of current activities will help us to 
do. But we need also to prepare them to improve the situation in which 
they will find themselves as adults. We must equip them to be con- 
structively critical of our present social, economic and political organiza~ 
tion. To do this we need to know, in addition to knowing what current 
modes of living are, three vital types of information. First, how 
experts think the current modes of living should be changed; second, 
what the insistent problems and issues of the day are; third, what the 
problems and issues probably are with which the growing generation 
will have to grapple. * * * 
“But to make the curriculum for a troubled society—as ours 
surely is—we must bring the growing generation into contact with the 
most critical problems of that society. Yes, and we cannot be con- 
tent with just that, The present social and political organization is 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 CURRICULUM FROM LIFE _ 
changing rapidly. The most unusual political proposals of one decade 
become the basis of legislation in the next. So our society is not only 
troubled and faced with insistent problems, it is also dynamic and our 
curriculum must be correspondingly so. Hence, it appears that a 
fundamental basis for the curriculum in the social sciences is a state- 
ment of the insistent and permanent problems. It is not enough to fit 
our curriculum to the problems and issues of today—we must have the 
courage to use our curriculum to meet problems which experts predict 
will continue to be insistent in the adult life of the growing generation. 
This point of view says, implicitly at least, that the school is, among 
other things, our most important agency for the improvement of society. 
It asks: are we not delinquent representatives of that agency unless 
we not only make our curriculum keep pace with the changes in that 
society, but also anticipate what those changes are going to be and 
use the curriculum to prepare children to meet them? 
“That is precisely the basis for the experimental work in the

Summary of “ Scientific” Methods Used in Determin- 
ing the Subject-matter of Courses of Study?!.—a. A con- 
sensus of judgments of specialists in the field; e.g., music- 
courses planned by music-teachers or musicians, mathe- 
matics-courses by mathematicians. As a rule, such courses 
lack perspective; when committee procedure is used, they 
often reflect the opinions of the most determined member 
of the committee. 
b. Analyses of antiquated and current courses of study 
and textbooks. This gives an understanding of the present 
situation, how it developed, and the trend by which one 
might prophesy what changes are probable. It gives no 
criteria for desirable changes. 
c. Analysis of current newspapers, magazines, books. 
This furnishes one valid criterion, surely, that people need 
to know what they read about, and, by implication, what 
they talk about. But it makes no provision for social 
progress. 
d. Judgments of. practical schoolmen, and of adult 
citizens, men of affairs. This method looks toward judg- 
ment of future needs; both groups probably have definite 
ideas of what the youth of today will need in life. But 
this is different from provision for social progress. Both 
groups are likely to be interested in a world of practical 
action, to believe that an analysis of human needs is a 
visionary impractical approach. As a means of concen- 
trating support for the elimination of obsolete topics, this 
method is very valuable.

sis of “jobs,” whether vocational “ jobs,” citizenship 
“jobs,” leisure-time “ jobs,” to tabulate both the frequency 
of the activities represented, and the difficulties, errors,

shortcomings, and maladjustments found in their perform- 
ance. The principle involved is that if each generation 
does fewer things inadequately, and more things ade- 
quately, the world will improve gradually by a process of 
natural selection of desirable responses. 
f. The synthesis of a philosophy looking toward the 
future, and a scientific methodology for determining the 
problems of the future, to be solved, an analysis of what 
people ought to know, what it would be desirable for them 
to appreciate, what ideals they should cherish, what powers 
they could and should possess. 
g. A phase of scientific curriculum investigation 
emphasized in this chapter, but not frequently mentioned 
in discussions of the subject, is a study of pupils, their 
adjustments, interests, successes, and failures, home life 
and out-of-school activities. If pupils dislike or are bored 
by a subject, if large numbers fail, then the content and 
method must be examined critically; for no matter how 
much justification it may have in “ scientific” technic, it 
is useless if it does not educate, does not arouse the inter- 
ests of pupils. 
The next attack on the problem, therefore, is the psy- 
chological selection and arrangement of subject-matter 
and method.

  CHAPTER VI 
WHAT DO EXPERIMENTS ON LEARNING 
NOW IMPLY? 
In THE field of studies of learning which help in cur- 
riculum-organization there has been a considerable amount 
of discussion, but until the last few years there have been 
few or no attempts in the secondary schools actually to test 
materials or methods on the basis of criteria in other than 
teachers’ judgments. Two objective measures have been 
used, however : the rate of failures in each subject and the 
rate of the elimination of pupils in each grade, or year-of- 
age group; and the success of graduates in advanced insti- 
tutions, or in passing entrance-examinations or “ State” 
examinations. There are so many disturbing factors, how- 
ever, that the results of the studies may be considered 
challenges to experiment rather than measures of grade- 
placement of content or of methods of teaching. 
What is the Problem of the Curriculum-maker in this 
Field.—Assume that the curriculum-maker had before him 
the following: 
(a) The readily obtainable facts regarding the poten- 
tial student population, and 
_ (b) As precise as possible a knowledge of the activities 
and needs of these adolescents and of adults, both present 
and future. 
He would now wish to know what subject-matter 
would be best adapted to pupils of these social groups and 
ages and grades, and how it could best be presented to 
assure the knowledges, interests, attitudes, ideals, habits, 
and powers that would make them able to fit into their 
83
-P-A-G-E-94
  84 EXPERIMENTS ON LEARNING 
environments constructively—capable of active adaptation, 
alone and in codperation with their fellows, for the fur- 
ther improvement of social and physical environments. 
For the present, the curriculum-maker is dependent 
upon a priori reasoning on which to base experimental 
procedure. He recognizes certain defects in society, cer- 
tain social and individual failures of adjustment, and pre- 
scribes a remedy in a modification of the curriculum. If 
the results seem satisfactory, he assumes that the modifi- 
cation has caused the improvement, and adopts the inno- 
vation as a part of the definite policy, and perhaps adapts 
and extends the procedure to meet similar problems of the 
curriculum. He is at present able to measure objectively 
only a part of the results of any change. 
What is Scientific Procedure in Studies of Learning? 
—A truly scientific procedure must for the present be 
limited to problems so clearly defined as to permit of care- 
ful measurement of the chief traits to be affected, before 
and after the subject-matter or method investigated has 
been used. Such a scientific procedure, carefully controlled, 
can be abstracted from its setting and be used under new 
conditions ‘to test the validity of the first conclusion. 
Thus, a test of information or of skill might be given 
to four or more groups of pupils of the same intelligence- 
distributions; the teachers, using as nearly identical 
methods as possible, might teach the same subject-matter 
to the four groups, but each teacher using a conventional 
method with one of his groups, and the experimental 
method with his second group; then a re-application of 
the test or an equivalent standardized test, should show the 
superiority of one method over the other—but only for the 
traits measured. If one method were superior in both
-P-A-G-E-95
  SCIENTIFIC PROCEDURE 85 
cases; i.e., if teacher M’s section A, using the experimental 
method, made greater progress than his section B, using 
conventional method; and if teacher N’s section A, using 
the same experimental method, made similarly greater 
progress than his section B, using conventional method; 
then a tentative conclusion would be justified that the ex- 
perimental method is better than the conventional method 
for teaching that information or skill that the test 
measures. 
But two cautions are necessary; (1) such a conclusion 
would need to be verified by repeated experiments with 
nearly identical conditions to establish its validity; and 
(2) it must be recognized that the method, though super- 
ior for the development of the particular knowledge or 
skill, is not thereby shown to be the superior method for 
the total learning-process ; it might indeed develop attitudes 
or habits that would interfere with further learnings. 
Thus, a method that might best increase the knowledge of 
the provisions of the Constitution might lead to a distaste 
for the study of government, whereas a method that re- 
sulted in less knowledge, might result in a desired emotional 
attitude toward the achievements of the Federal Consti- 
tutional Convention. 
Scientific curriculum-studies, it will be seen, parallel 
Dewey’s analysis of reflective thinking: 
(1) The investigator finds his problem in what seems 
to him to be a maladjustment—subject-matter taught at 
the wrong time or by inferior methods. 
(2) He defines his problems; e.g., is it better to teach 
processes through abstract exercises or through experi- 
ences in project-situations? 
(3) He then lists the alternative possibilities, the 
options, and selects two of them (generally the conven- 
   
-P-A-G-E-96
ee ee 
86 EXPERIMENTS ON LEARNING 
tional method and an experimental dle) to test out with 
equivalent pupil-groups ; he uses identical subject-matter if 
method is being tested, or identical methods if subject-mat- 
ter is being studied. 
(4) He measures the skill or knowledge before the 
experiment and afterwards, with tests as adequate as possi- 
ble to measure what is being taught. 
(5) The experiment is repeated with other groups of 
pupils and other teachers to test the validity of the tenta- 
tive course of study. 
What “ Scientific” Procedure Has Contributed So 
Far.—Much of the earlier demands for change were chal- 
lenges of conventional and traditional subject-matter, aris- 
ing from the rugged common sense of such: thinkers as 
Herbert Spencer, F. M. McMurry, John Dewey, Paul 
H. Hanus. These protests found substantial support in 
the attacks on the dogma of formal discipline, the assump- 
tion that powers gained through one subject transfer 
automatically to all powers similarly named or belonging 
to the same “ faculty ” of the mind. 
The second phase has come about through scientific 
investigation of three types: first, the study of existing 
practices and of the judgments of experts and administra- 
tors concerning these practices ; second, through the testing 
of the results of teaching to find what degree of skill in 
each subject was actually attained by pupils; third, what, 
attainments are demanded by society. Typical of the first 
type of this phase was Jessup and Coffman’s study of topics 
included in arithmetical texts, in city courses of study, and 
of the topics that the consensus of opinion of schoolmen 
justified ; typical of the second and third types of this phase, 
were the studies growing out of the use of Courtis’s tests of  
-P-A-G-E-97
    RUGG-CLARK STUDY OF LEARNING 87 
arithmetical computations, of spelling-scales, of handwrit- 
ing scales, of reading, of composition, of mathematics, of 
history, and of other scales and tests, with a view to finding 
reasonable standards of achievement for each grade. 
These studies have been chiefly in the field of elementary 
education and in the determination of necessary attain- 
ments in minimal essentials for the junior high school 
grades, though for reading, composition, and mathematics 
they are serviceable in the high school, too. 
Rugg and Clark have experimented with ninth grade 
mathematics. 
In the preceding chapter reference has been made to 
the Rugg and Clark study so far as it affected the social 
worth of the subject-matter of ninth grade mathematics. 
The strictly scientific study included in this investigation 
was an effort to find the most economical way to teach the 
formal processes. 
After the study of ninth grade mathematics had been under way 
some years, during which the validity of subject-matter had been 
studied, and standardized tests to measure skill in algebraic processes 
had been developed and validated, the authors undertook to study 
the development of algebraic abilities through drill. Errors made by 
pupils were classified as accidental errors and recurring errors. Acci- 
dental errors are due to mind-wandering or day-dreaming; the timed 
drill tends to decrease them. The recurring errors were found by 
analyzing the errors made in test-results. 
The processes tested in which a considerable number of recurring 
errors were found were: (1) simple equations, (2) special products 
(one-fourth of all recurring errors), (3) exponents, (4) factoring 
(39 per cent. of the recurring errors). It was, therefore, decided to 
carry on a controlled experiment to discover whether the “experi- 
mental” method, the one proposed by the investigators, was really 
superior to the conventional methods, insofar as the re-application of 
the tests could show such superiority or inferiority. 
“Our most important illustration of economy of time in learning, 
To éin
-P-A-G-E-98
88 EXPERIMENTS ON LEARNING 
however, is shown by the comparative achievements of two sets of 
classes, the first set consisting of two experimental classes (55 pupils) 
taught by the writers, and the other set of four classes (112 pupils) 
taught by other members of the department. In the experimental 
classes the course of study suggested in the experimental course was 
used in place of the material presented in the regular text. In the 
other four classes the regular text was taught page by page with 
practically no omissions, additions, or deviations. The regular teachers 
of the department taught those classes with no knowledge of the work 
done in the other classes, and used their usual line of procedure follow- 
ing the textbook closely.” * 
The results of tests show a comparison of achievement in purely 
formal skills, in the learning of which the experimental classes have 
spent about 20 per cent. of their time in formal instruction and drill, 
and the other classes have spent more than 70 per cent. of their time.

In algebraic abilities, the “ Rugg-Clark classes” were shown to 
be superior to conventional classes. 
Let us restate the study at this point. The learning-investigation 
attacked the total problem. “The determination of the most direct 
approach to the learning of such algebraic and geometrical material 
as is necessary to use the equation, the formula, and the graph in the

Grade Mathematics, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Ill, p. 168.

RUGG-CLARK STUDY OF LEARNING 89 
stating of relationships.”* The studies indicated recurring errors, 
suggesting points at which specific, intensive, scientific studies might 
be made. Hence the specific defined problem: “Shall we teach the 
“types” or ‘cases’ separately, or is it possible to find one underlying 
process which if taught will lead to economical learning of all of the 
others? The traditional method which is followed by practically every 
textbook is to teach special products and factoring by types or cases 
(p. 162). . . . These cases are arranged in such a fashion that the 
learning of any one tends to inhibit the learning of any other. 
“But really to apply psychology to our instruction we search 
through the various types to see if there is one general type, the 
learning of which by a given method can be made to fit all the others. 
Psychological analysis proved that there is one: the general trinomial 
of the form ax*+bx+c. Again “psychology” and teaching sense 
tell one to analyze the difficulties in manipulating such an operation to 
discover the mental processes which are involved in its working, and 
to work out devices by which the processes can be aided. In this par- 
ticular case we find that visual imagery is predominant, and to 
facilitate its use in the handling of this operation, we make a device 
to aid the pupil in fixing cross-products. 
“Now pupils can be taught to factor rapidly and effectively all 
types but the monomial factor by just one method, the teacher using 
a procedure about as follows: first, present to the pupil the product of 
two general binomials for example, he would be taught to expand 
(3x +5) (2x+ 4), emphasizing all the time the importance of the 
correct middle term. If this type of special products is introduced as 
a tool or device in finding the areas of rectangles, pupils have an 
adequate motive” (p. 163). 
So far the reasoning has been, perhaps, largely a priori; 
it has been assumed that if the learning method were 
altered in accordance with a cogently reasoned plan, the 
results would be better. But now the method selected for 
experimentation was taken as a hypothesis, the scientific 
study applied the hypothesis, and proved it valid, insofar 
as variables were eliminated, for the skills measured. 
All pupils were tested before the study began, and after 
the study ended, in order to get a measure of growth.

  90 EXPERIMENTS ON LEARNING 
These tests not only measured formal skill, but also the 
degree to which pupils’ ability in reasoning improved with 
their improved work in factoring. 
Schorling and Clark study subject-matter and methods. 
A somewhat similar investigation has been undertaken 
by Clark, in collaboration with Schorling, at the Lincoln 
School, in connection with the junior high school courses 
in mathematics.? 
The method of procedure set up is to use as a point of departure 
the fifteen principles agreed upon by the exponents of the reorganization 
movement in education, as indicated by the report of the National 
Committee on Mathematical Requirements; then to propose two types 
of investigation: (1) a series of classroom studies (psychological 
studies) calling for codperative effort and (2) a series of researches 
and investigations designed to determine a body of curriculum-material 
which can be defended on a basis of social worth. In this chapter 
we are concerned with the first of these two investigations. 
The principles referred to are to be considered hypotheses, on the 
basis of which an experimental course of study and methods in junior 
high school mathematics is developed which it is assumed will give 
superior results in knowledge, interests, attitudes, and skills than do the 
conventional junior high school subject-matter and methods. The 
scientific procedure calls for the adequate measuring of pupils before 
either the experimental or the conventional materials and methods 
are used; then after the two teaching processes have been carried 
through, it calls for a retesting and comparison of the result- 
ing growths. 
For this established tests have been used, the Woody-McCall tests 
in fundamental processes, and the Buckingham reasoning test. In 
addition an elaborate inventory test has been developed covering 
knowledge and processes that are contained in most texts used in the 
first six grades, and much generally desired knowledges and skills that 
might have been learned in classes or informally, or through other 
subjects; e¢.g., graphic representation. This inventory test together 
with the compilation of results from widely used existing tests, will 
yield a reasonably complete account of the results of mathematical 
instruction at the close of grade six. 
The experimental course has been printed and distributed to

codperating school systems in which some classes are using conventional 
materials or other junior high school mathematics series of texts. The 
reapplication of the tests will show comparative growths for pupils 
using various materials and methods, and will give a rough measure 
of relative merit. 
No carefull studies with balanced sections, such as 
Rugg and Clark carried on, is included in the Schorling- 
Clark investigation, but the course is worked out by the 
actual teaching of the subject-matter by one investigator 
under the critical observation of the other, who notes the 
pupil responses, and through conference better presenta- 
tions are worked and applied. 
Thorndike has measured the influence of first year 
Latin upon ability to read English. 
One phase of the general investigation carried on by 
the American Classical League attempted to discover the 
influence of first year Latin upon the ability of pupils to 
read English as measured by the scores attained on the 
alternative forms of the Thorndike-McCall Reading Scale, 
the forms being of approximately equal difficulty. 
Form 2 was given to several thousand pupils in over a hundred 
different high schools at or near the beginning of the school year 
1921-22. Form 8 was given in many of these schools at or near the 
end of the half year. 
Form 4 was given in many of them at or near the end of the year. 
In all save a few of these schools the group of pupils tested comprised 
some who were studying Latin and some who were in the same school 
grade (almost always the first year of high school) but were not 
studying Latin. . . . The tests were usually conducted in connection 
with the classes in English where the Latins and non-Latins 
were mixed. 
The results are expressed in terms of the gains made in reading- 
scores at the end of the year on form 4 over the score made at the 
beginning of the year on form 2. Comparisons are made of the 
improvement of pupils who made the same scores on form 2. Table 
I compares just those pupils who made score 56 on form 2.“

of the reader unacquainted with the technique of educational measure-

one tenth of the mean square deviation of twelve-year-olds. 
“Form 4 minus form 2 differences for the Latins and for the non- 
Latins who scored 58 in the beginning test have been obtained from 
a table similar to Table 1. They are 5.3 to 4.1. In the same way we 
have compared Latins and non-Latins who scored in the beginning test 
49, 51, 53, 60, 63, and 67. 
“Tn general there is a superior gain of about 1.7 for the Latins, 
This is about half of the general gain made by the non-Latins, In 
other words, the gain made by the Latins is about one and one-half 
times as great as the gain made by the non-Latins. 
“The investigators then studied the midyear scores made on Form 
8, comparing the gains made by Latin and non-Latin groups from 
September till February, with the gains made by the same groups 
from September till May. The superior gain made by the Latin group 
for the whole year was found to be 1.81, and for the first half-year 
to be 1.95. 
“Tt thus appears that whatever caused the superior gains of the 
Latins was a feature of the first half-year. This fact increases the 
difficulty of finding a satisfactory explanation. Assume first that the 
study of Latin in grade 9 excels other studies that were taken in its

stead in improving these pupils’ abilities in reading or care in using 
these abilities, or both. It is then hard to find adaquate reasons why the 
second half-year of the study of Latin should have had zero effect. 
Assume on the other hand that, since the second half-year of Latin 
had zero effect, the Latin of the first half-year had none also. It is 
then hard to find any probable associate of the study of Latin to 
cause the superiority in gain. We may therefore best leave the 
search for an explanation to be renewed when further data are 
available” (p. 168). 
This study is not, of course, a learning-study in the 
sense that the Rugg and Clark investigation is; but it does 
fulfil this condition: the measurement by means of a 
standardized instrument of the effects of two kinds of 
subject-matter pursued for the same period of time, by 
groups that started with equal abilities. 
Finley has studied pupils’ interests in science-materials. 
Finley collected the questions asked by pupils before 
whom he had exhibited in an aquarium a small animal, 
a “water-puppy,’ unusual enough in appearance to 
arouse curiosity. 
The experiment was carried on in all eight grades of seven 
elementary schools, each typical of a more or less unique community. 
Over 1700 pupils participated, the average number of questions in each 
grade ranging from 2.3 per pupil in the first grade to 5.3 per pupil 
in the eighth. 
These questions were then tabulated according to the phase that 
they indicated, interested the children; e.g., identification, classification, 
environment, food, life-history, etc. By means of graphs he then indi- 
cated the changes in interests as pupils advanced through the grades, 
As a check on this experiment Finley asked the children of one 
of the schools, The University of Chicago Elementary School, to write 
a composition on the mud-puppy just 40 days after they had discussed 
it. In all grades there was a remarkable similarity in the lines of 
interests shown by the compositions and by the questions. 
Finley also reports another study of pupils’ interests in 
a plant, a bird, and a pendulum. In all but three of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 EXPERIMENTS ON LEARNING 
twenty-five classes with which the materials were used, the 
bird aroused children’s interests most.® 
Scientific Studies of Learning Based on Educational 
Psychology.—One phase of scientific learning-studies re- 
mains, the use of the conclusions of educational psychol- 
ogists in “ psychologizing methodology.” This appears 
frequently in the justification of proposed organizations 
of subject-matter and method, as when it is proposed by 
Bobbitt to write the courses of study as pupil-activities, 
or by Wells to plan the curriculum as a series of proj- 
ects rather than as a number of more or less indepen- 
dent subjects. 
The validity of this use of psychological “laws ” or 
beliefs, depends largely, of course, upon the validity of the 
laws. The general observation or common sense on which 
the doctrines of interest, or apperception, the “law ” of 
effect, or the five steps of reflective thinking are based, 
may not satisfy a rigorous definition of objectivity, or 
scientific procedure. But in the absence of adequate, objec- 
tively determined facts about learning, adolescence, trans- 
fer of training, or individual differences, it may be proper 
to speak of procedure based on psychology as “ scientific.” 
But no one pretends that this use of the word is identical 
with that implied when we speak of scientific procedure in 
the solution of a physics-problem, or of mathematics. 
For the purposes of scientific curriculum-making such 
deductive reasoning as underlies Kilpatrick's formulation 
of method, or McMurry’s statement of principles of cur- 
riculum-making, are necessary. Thorndike’s® recent

articles on elementary algebra are cases in point. An 
authority on psychology takes the textbooks and courses 
of study in use, and analyzes them, showing wherein 
scientific principles have been complied with and wherein 
violated. He states that if different material and methods 
were used, the results would be different; he cites unsatis- 
factory conditions and recommends eliminations, inclu- 
sions, and modifications, which, he believes, would improve 
the results. This a priori “scientific” procedure is the 
best that he or anyone else can offer at present.

  CHAPTER VII 
WHAT CAN WE DRAW FROM EDUCATIONAL 
PSYCHOLOGY? 
Educational Psychology Makes Important Contribu- 
tions to the Curriculum-maker.—Curriculum-making in- 
volves the applications of the generalizations or principles 
abstracted by scientists, as a result of observation and 
measurements of physical and mental traits of human 
beings and other forms of animal life. While the science 
of educational psychology has made many contributions 
that are of interest to the curriculum-maker, there are four 
of them that are so instructive and to which secondary 
curricula frequently conform so inadequately, that they 
are discussed briefly in this chapter, together with some 
suggestions of what significance each contribution has for 
the curriculum-maker. 
The conventional secondary program of studies, it 
should be pointed out, has had chiefly a preparatory aim, 
it has endeavored to give those skills and knowledges that 
were necessary for college admission and for success in 
college. It was recognized that many secondary pupils 
were not going to college, but it was believed that one 
important function of the secondary school was to select 
those who could and would do the preparatory work, and 
who, therefore, should go on to college. Criticism of the 
lack of social value of the subject-matter offered or pre-

ties, the judgments and the memories of the pupils, and

that there was time enough to learn useful things when 
their minds had been given sufficient general discipline. 
By the process of trial and error, and by the intuitions 
of men and women of broad sympathies many adaptations 
have been made to the natures of adolescents, to the natural 
learning-processes, and to the individual differences of 
pupils. And again and again practical subjects taught for 
specific objectives; e.g., surveying, bookkeeping, have ap- 
peared in the programs of conventional schools. Neverthe- 
less, it is a generally true statement that the conventional 
program of studies—mathematics, pure science, foreign 
languages, chronological history, English classics and rhet- 
oric—has not been planned with much thought concerning 
the learning-processes (except that facts and processes are 
fixed by drill), the variations in types and quantity of 
ability (except to select the best), the characteristics of 
adolescence (except to combat their restlessness), or the 
failure of habits and attitudes built up for one field of 
activity, to transfer automatically to other fields involving 
the same “‘ faculty.” 
1, LAWS OF LEARNING 
Thorndike names three major laws of learning—vreadi- 
ness, exercise, and effect. 
What Learning Is.—The fundamental concept of 
learning is that the human nervous organization has many 
unlearned reactions called reflexes, instincts, tendencies, 
or capacities according to the degree of uniformity, cer- 
tainty, or complexity. These unlearned reactions some- 
times, but not by any means always, produce or affect 
consciousness, and sometimes through interaction with the 
environment, change the nervous organism permanently, so 
that it tends to react in new ways thereafter. This is learn-

ing! Whenever the normal state of a person is undisturbed, 
the neurones act according to inherited patterns ; but when 
the life-processes are disturbed, the neurones tend to make 
whatever changes that are in their repertory (readiness). 
If the results of such changes are satisfying (effect), the 
same changes are likely to be made again and again to meet 
the same or similar situations (exercise), until the changed 
| reactions become automatic; they are then habits or atti- 
tudes, if consciousness is not essential to the reaction, or 
ideals and knowledge, if it is involved. 
Through inculcation or indoctrination we may build 
up habits and attitudes. But the simple rule of Thorndike * 
for habit-formation applies also to the building-up of 
ideals, interests, and knowledge. This fundamental rule 
is stated in two parts: 
1. “ Put together what should go together and keep 
apart what should not go together. 
2. “ Reward desirable connections and make undesir- 
able connections produce discomfort.” 
These rules operate whether one is teaching a baby to 
take its naps at regular hours, or a school-boy to multiply 
27x54, or to analyze out of a gross total situation the 
elements to which he should pay special attention, or to 
solve an intricate problem in chemistry or economics. 
Learning is Cumulative.—All learned reactions modify 
the fundamental instinctive attitudes, interests, or mind- 
sets, which thus affect the readiness to act, and so to learn 
in any situation, new or old. This attitude or mind-set 
is, of course, more likely to function, if the same or very 
similar data or objects are evident than if strange 
materials challenge the attitudes. The mind-set predisposes 
* Thorndike, E. L.: Educational Psychology; Briefer Course, 
Teachers College, 1920.  
-P-A-G-E-109
WHAT IS LEARNED IN CLASS 99 
one to be satisfied by the accustomed outcomes (or less 
often by the unexpected outcome, if the mind-set predis- 
poses one to welcome new problems). And so learning is 
cumulative, right attitudes beget choice of right satisfac- 
tions and annoyances, which strengthen right bonds and 
make more probable right attitudes, and even better atti- 
tudes in the future. Conversely, wrong mind-sets, if not 
interfered with, grow constantly worse. 
“The same state of affairs may be welcomed or 
rejected, and so have opposite effects on learning....... 
according as one is competing to throw a ball to the utmost 
distance, or is competing to throw a player out at the plate.” 
But what makes up satisfactions and annoyances, is 
much more complicated than the mere immediate outcome 
of the act; the presence of spectators, for example, might 
make even a good performance annoying, if they were 
not impressed by it. 
What is Learned in Class.—Kilpatrick has called atten- 
tion to the many incidental lessons that are being learned in 
a class period, besides the one in which the teacher may be 
primarily interested. Thus, if a class is learning to factor 
a trinomial, the members of the class are learning 
methods of study, affection for the teacher (or the 
reverse), interest in algebra, pleasure in attending school, 
courtesy, sustained effort, and many other reactions are 
being strengthened or weakened, or otherwise modified. 
Thorndtke’s five subsidiary laws of learning. When a 
human being meets an accustomed situation, he responds 
with the accustomed behavior, knowledge, acts, and atti- 
tudes. If some elements are new, or if the general situa- 
tion is new, he may make several false starts (multiple 
response), feel a bit uncertain’ (mind-set), respond to one 
likely element and then to another (piecemeal activity), 
LIBRAKY 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEGE 
MURPREESBORO, TENNESSEE
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
according as the element seems identical with or analagous 
to previous mastered situations (analogy) ; he may learn 
to apply the reactions learned under one set of conditions 
to meet the needs in a new situation (associative shifting). 
An Example of Class Procedure Illustrates These 
Laws.—Thus pupils in a social study class that has pre- 
viously debated with interest the good and bad effects of 
the growing urbanization on the United States, takes up a 
comparison of England and Russia to see what the effects 
have been in each country of the different distributions 
of populations. 
If left to their own devices, several false starts will 
probably be made; there will be much uncertainty as to 
what should be done; some will study the maps, some the 
pictures, some the statistics, some the railroad lines, some 
the graphic representations of crop-productions, imports 
and exports, some the government, all of which had been 
effective for some pupils in the former study. Thus they 
illustrate Thorndike’s subsidiary laws of multiple response, 
piecemeal activity, mind-set, and analogy, and finally by 
applying ready-made solutions or generalizations to the 
new situation, they illustrate the law of associative shifting. 
As the lesson proceeds they see the differences between 
the situations in the three countries. They analyze the 
situation in each country; ¢.g., the present hunger-plight 
of agricultural Russia, and the condition of unemployment 
in England. Then they select with some discrimination 
those elements which are to be explained by post-war 
readjustments, or “ bolshevism,” or other extraneous 
causes, from those which are to be explained by factors 
of transportation, commerce, industry, climate, mineral 
and agricultural resources, general social institutions,

  THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER Io 
government, and the like. This analytical treatment of the 
data to solve a problem is reflective thinking. 
The Réle of the Teacher.—The effectiveness of such 
a problem depends in part on the interest developed in the 
previous problem, and in part in other elements of the total 
gross situation, the comments on Russia and England 
carried in the newspaper, or on the “ Movie” screen, the 
approvals of teacher and parents. The teacher sees that 
data are available, encourages the mind-set, and manipu- 
lates some of the approvals and disapprovals, and other 
satisfactions and annoyances; he helps, he challenges, he 
heads off leads that are so wrong that they would lead to 
undue discouragement—but he permits reasonable amount 
of trial that may lead to error. He does this if he under- 
stands, or at least applies, the laws of learning. 
In a word, he so guides the activities of the class that 
desirable connections are rewarded, and that undesirable 
connections are prevented or made dissatisfying. He does 
this (1) that the knowledge possessed beforehand or now 
gained for the first time may be used and some of it fixed ; 
(2) that the interests aroused by previous class-work or by 
the general social environments may motivate the work on 
this problem and render its results satisfying or annoying; 
(3) that the attitudes and ideals of investigating, reflecting, 
considering values, searching for the truth, willingness to 
give up assumptions and preconceptions, may be exercised 
and found satisfying; (4) that the power of each one 
individually to do these things and to organize the findings 
so as to warrant and support the conclusions, and the power 
of each one to contribute his findings and best thinking to 
a committee report, may be increased. These are some of 
the desired outcomes of wisely selected subject-matter and 
methods that are in harmony with the laws of learning.

2. INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
In the Past, Individual Adaptations Have Been Made 
Only for Selected Groups of Pupils—Although the facts 
of easily observed inherent individual differences have 
been recognized for a very long time, school practice 
has not been generally modified to meet these differences, 
though sporadic attempts to do so have been made in 
America for more than a century. Only recently have 
psychologists given the matter the attention it deserves, 
and have schools modified this procedure consciously to 
provide for the varying capacities, aptitudes, and interests 
of adolescents, Hitherto the school has rather blindly, 
and almost unconsciously, selected the more able or more 
academically inclined pupils, educated them, and elimi- 
nated the rest. For these selected pupils, many high schools 
and before them the academies, have made rough adapta- 
tions in terms of outcomes sought; e.g., the election 
of commercial subjects, manual training, science, lan- 
guages, etc. 
It is trite to note that adolescent boys and girls differ 
from each other in many ways. There are differences in 
native intelligence, and in learning ability of many specific 
kinds. Pupils come to the high school with widely vary- 
ing powers, not only in the degree of achievement in 
learned abilities, such as reading, but also in inherent 
abilities, such as acuity of vision, sensitiveness to rhythm, 
interests in linguistics, and the like. Physical differences 
are analogous—and more evident; some are taller than 
others of the same age, some broader, healthier, higher 
cheek-boned, and some more naturally active than others. 
Those who have somewhat exaggerated characteristics, 
and those who lack the usual amount of these traits, are 
more easily noted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 103 
The more recent impulse in America to take account of 
inherent and environmental differences had its origin in 
Thorndike’s chapter on Individual Differences in his 
“Principles of Teaching,’ which is still the best single 
chapter on the subject, according to Parker.2 Thorn- 
dike demonstrated clearly, on a. statistical basis, just how 
great the amount of difference between the fast and the 
slow members of an ordinary class really is. This 
he illustrated by examples of translations, and algebra 
papers. Many modifications in school organization and 
administration have come about because of this recognition 
of individual differences. 
More recently the widespread use of intelligence-tests, 
together with the growth of high school enrolments, has 
resulted in greater modifications of the program of studies, 
the requirements for promotion and graduation, and the 
grouping of pupils according to general intelligence, 
specific abilities, interests, expectancy of stay in school, 
and shortcomings in their informal education. 
The Conclusions of Science in Regard to Individual 
Differences.—1. General abstract or verbal intelligence of 
individuals, as measured by the Binet-Simon and derived 
scales, varies very widely among pupils of high-school age, 
General intelligence is closely related to learning-power, 
and is the product of native intelligence and of formal and 
informal education, “nature and nurture;” but which is 
the more important element no one knows. 
2. The abilities of pupils differ in degree rather than in 
kind. The assumption that clean-cut divisions exist, that 
one pupil is hand-minded, another eye-minded, and a third 
ear-minded, that some are gifted in foreign-language study 
2 Methods of Teaching in High Schools, p. 16, Ginn and Co., 1915. 
8  
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
and others in science, is untrue. In any. ability measured 
for large numbers of pupils, it is found that they distribute 
themselves about a central tendency, many have only a 
little more or a little less of the quality, and a few have 
much more and a few much less than this central tendency. 
3. “Correlation not compensation is the law of 
nature ;” thus, pupils with more than average ability in one 
mental trait will seldom have much less than average ability 
in any other trait: 
4. In most physical traits, the variability between indi- 
viduals and the variability of specific traits within any 
individuals increases during adolescence. It is generally 
believed that a similar increase of variability takes place 
in mental and emotional traits, though this assertion is 
made somewhat less confidently, in the light of recent 
studies by means of achievement tests. 
5. Inherent individual differences in mental traits due 
to sex are important only as selected and emphasized by 
social controls and learned reactions. 
6. Inherent individual differences due to race are much 
less in amount than has been generally assumed. 
7. Individual differences due to immediate ancestry 
are far more marked; but it is not at all certain how 
important similarity of social control is as compared with 
inherited traits. 
Implications of These Conclusions for the Secondary 
Program of Studies—1. In academic subjects there should 
be different levels of achievement demanded of those of 
differing abilities. The subject-matter given the more able 
should provide more experiences in generalizing from data, 
and require finer intellectual discrimination and more 
subtle reasoning than that given the less able pupils.
-P-A-G-E-115
  CHARACTERISTICS OF ADOLESCENTS 105 
2. No pupil’s curriculum should be so highly special- 
ized as not to include opportunities to develop a reasonable 
degree of skill of many kinds—motor, auditory, visual, 
verbal, generalizing, and the rest. 
3. In subjects requiring similar types of ability pupils 
may well be grouped homogeneously according to ability. 
In general, pupils of high degree of abstract intelligence 
can do successfully a large quantity and higher quality of 
work in all academic subjects than can be demanded of 
pupils of low general intelligence. 
4. There is need for richer curriculum-opportunities in 
the junior and senior high schools than in the ele- 
mentary school. 
5. Differences in intellectual, educational opportunities 
for the two sexes should be based on desired differences 
in outcomes rather than on assumed differences of native 
interests and endowments. 
6. Differences in secondary school opportunities for 
different races have justification only as differing social 
demands on different races make them advisable. 
7. The program of studies of any secondary school 
may well reflect, to a limited degree, the social and eco- 
nomic character of the local community from which its 
pupils are drawn. But it would not be justified in the 
denial of college preparation to children of mill-operatives, 
nor in the total neglect of trade training for the children 
of bankers and lawyers. 
3. CHARACTERISTICS OF ADOLESCENTS 
More and more, American secondary education is 
attempting the new and difficult function of preparing all 
adolescents, not better provided for otherwise, for par- 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
    106 EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
ticipation in community life, and for the richest personal 
satisfactions of which they are capable. 
What Nature Furnishes for the School to Deal With.— 
If this is the rdle of the curriculum, then it behooves us 
to look more carefully than we do at our boys and girls 
of early adolescence, to find out how our stage must be 
set to minimize the difficulties, and exploit to the full the 
advantages that nature presents to us in the emotional, 
mental, and physiological peculiarities of adolescence.*® 
Colvin,* for example, sets forth as the first of the 
important characteristics of adolescence, that it is a period 
of mental and physical change. These changes do, he 
asserts, sometimes appear with considerable abruptness. 
The bodily changes are marked increases in height and 
weight, growth in bones, and various bodily parts; and the 
relative size of these parts changes at the onset of puberty. 
Although there is no marked increase in brain-weight, it 
is probable that there is rapid development of the brain- 
cells and their connections.® 
*For a brief but very adequate treatment of this subject, one 
should read Whipple’s Chapter VII of Monroe's Principles of 
Secondary Education. Inglis’ Chapter dealing with this subject seems 
more cold and cautious ; to one who has dealt intimately with adolescent 
children, it seems as though he may be so accurate that he misses the 
truth. Colvin in Chapter II of Introduction to High School Teaching, 
has given a sympathetic and valuable presentation of the topic. 
Pechstein and McGregor’s Psychology of Junior High School Pupils 
contains summaries of the significant investigations of adolescence, and 
practical applications of scientific knowledge to school organization 
and instruction.

*«. . there occurs during a year or two of early adolescence a 
remarkable and significant cell-development in the form of functional 
maturing, and probably awakening of brain-tracts hitherto dormant.” 
Pringle: Op. cit., p. 50.  
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  ACCOMPANYING ADOLESCENCE 107 
But he goes on to say that these marked physical 
changes are actually “as a rule overshadowed by the 
mental changes with which they are associated.” Feeling 
and emotional life appear in new forms, sometimes 
attended by marked upheavals. Intelligence and mental 
grasp show a considerable growth also. 
The interaction of physical changes and mental func- 
tions is such that it is particularly difficult for the adoles- 
cent to hold his mind to a task for any great length of time. 
This is particularly true of adolescent girls, whose physical 
changes result frequently in marked self-consciousness and 
in emotional disturbances, such as giggling, boisterousness, 
bashfulness, absent-mindedness, and day-dreaming, and 
evident restlessness. 
Similarly the boy, growing “ like a colt, one part at a 
time”? (as Dean Briggs remarks), his voice changing, 
with his consciousness of his own sexual maturity, may 
have many mental lapses, may stammer and hesitate to 
speak, may be alternately noisy and restless, and very 
bashful and reserved. 
Changes Accompanying Adolescence.—How far-reach- 
ing may be the emotional “ long-circuiting ” of the mental 
states accompanying the maturation of the sexual func- 
tions, is evident in the well-recognized forms of dementia 
preecox, a psychosis that tends to develop at the age of 
puberty. While actual enfeeblement through deteriora- 
tion of the brain is not usual, there are frequently “ retarda- 
tions, deviations from normal mental development in the 
adolescent period. It is safe to assert that the reconstruc- 
tion of attitudes and interests that constitutes the real 
psychology of adolescence may exhibit all degrees of
-P-A-G-E-118
    108 EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
incompleteness. The reconstruction is at bottom a recon- 
struction of feeling rather than one of intellect.” ° 
This emotional reconstruction accompanies (partly as 
a cause and partly as a result) the increasing physical and 
mental variability of both boys and girls of the same age. 
Girls mature earlier, on the average, than do boys. They 
are physically larger, and perhaps mentally more advanced 
than boys of the same ages from 11.5 to 14.5 years. But 
at any age between 11,5 and 14.5 years, there are many 
girls who are less tall and less heavy than the average for 
the boys. Increased individual differences at puberty are 
generally recognized; but there is pretty widespread dis- 
agreement as to how much of the differences are due to 
maturity and how much are due to environmental forces.? 
At the onset of puberty, it would seem that children are 
sometimes sickly, because of physiological maladjust- 
ments; but during the period of most rapid growth, the 
capacity to resist chronic diseases is high. Nevertheless, 
the unevenness of development between heart and arteries 
and the physical needs, makes this a period when the great- 
est care must be taken to control physical activity. The 
growing muscles and bones, the changing nervous develop- 
ment, the circulatory disturbances, the changing voice, 
raise many questions of hygiene, diet, posture and regu- 
lated exercise. 
Of more immediate importance to secondary educa- 
tion is the growth in variability of interests—vocational, 
esthetic, idealistic, physical. Colvin notes that closely 
associated with the maturing instincts are various adoles-

cent interests that from time to time express themselves 
with great force, often in exaggerated, intense and con- 
tradictory forms. He describes and discusses the voca- 
tional interests, idealistic interests, intellectual interests 
(“a burning desire to know’’), esthetic, moral and 
religious interests.® 
There is less agreement as to the so-called instincts— 
social, migratory, desire for approval, fear of scorn, and 
the rest. The present tendency is.to break down the dis- 
tinctions between the instinctive manifestations of original 
nature. The presence of the sex-instinct at puberty is 
questioned by none, and the manifestation of gregari- 
ousness by the formation of self-organized gangs is 
always recognized. 
The Onset of Adolescence is of Great Importance in 
Education—The outstanding importance. of adolescence 
to formal education is that the culmination of many factors 
is synchronous—puberty, compulsory school age-limit, a 
change from school to school with new teachers, methods, 
and organization, the physical growth, the putting on of 
adult clothes and adopting of adult manners and customs: 
all these are accompanied by and to some extent result in 
almost unpredictable manifestations of bashfulness, for- 
wardness, boisterousness, giggling, absent-mindedness, 
sullenness, obstinacy, intense interests, and outstanding 
accomplishments. 
The many instinctive tendencies that have been 
developing in a kind of humdrum manner, become organ- 
ized, as it were, under the influence of the developing sex- 
instinct ; and even sensory powers that have reached maxi- 
mum development years before become modified. Adoles- 
* Colvin, S. S.: An Introduction to H. S. Teaching, The Macmillan 
Co., 1921 (p. 35). Quoted by permission of publishers.   
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
cent children become more attentive to, more interested in 
many sensory activities that furnish a medium for earning 
social approvals, and the promise of adventure. 
Adolescents, if they have an interest or talent, make 
surprising progress in brief time. But this intellectual 
spurt does not automatically carry over to school work 
unless the opportunity is given. The same boy may flunk 
his physics who accomplishes wonders with his own wire- 
less outfit, made and to some extent invented by himself. 
If, on the other hand, the school can make this contact, can 
exploit the pupil’s out-of-school activities, and the “ long- 
circuitings ’’ of his changing nature, in conjunction with 
his school work, the response will be such as to vitalize the 
class procedure, and to assure that the school’s influence 
will carry over into the daily, out-of-school life of 
the pupil. 
With bright children, the change from preadolescent, 
insignificant sex-love (often for older persons) to con- 
scious sex-love is generally a minor matter. If it is violent, 
it is masked ; but it emerges so gradually that it is not half 
so exciting as a school election, or a base-ball game. 
With mentally inferior children, the sex-relationship 
may be more difficult, sometimes amusing, sometimes 
embarrassing. Here the temporary drawing-apart of the 
sexes noted by Bell is very real, amounting in fact to sex- 
antipathy, for a period, followed by somewhat dangerous 
and more violent courtships. The question of sex-hygiene 
instruction also becomes a very vital one at this point. 
Pubescence Occurs During the Junior High School 
Period.—If the junior high school admits all children at 
twelve and three-quarters, it may be expected that about 
70 per cent. or 75 per cent. will be immature or prepubes- 
cent, and that only 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. will be mature
-P-A-G-E-121
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL PERIOD III 
or postpubescent. If it holds these children till they are fif- 
teen and three-quarters years old, only 5 per cent. will then 
be prepubescent and 85 per cent. will be postpubescent.? 
While girls generally mature a year or more earlier 
than boys, the emotional changes are usually less violent or 
are better masked, so that they do not outwardly present 
so difficult a problem. If the school does accept children 
on the basis of such chronological age, it will be seen that 
most children will pass through the period of the onset of 
puberty in the junior high school. 
When pupils of normal age and development enter the 
seventh grade, most of the girls and practically all of the 
boys are active, self-centred, interested in present activi- 
ties, immediate purposes rather than in ulterior or remote 
goals. The adequately planned junior high school provides 
through its curriculum and “ extracurriculum ” activi- 
ties, for opportunities which permit this natural self-activ- 
ity reasonably free scope, directing it toward desirable 
ends of which the educators are conscious. Thus 
the home room or advisory group is essentially a gang of 
which the teacher is a‘ loyal member ; physical education 
emphasizes free play and such simple contests as relay 
races, hop, skip and jump, “ make-believe ” wood-chopping 
or canoe-paddling ; in music spontaneous singing of simple 
melodies, popular songs, rounds find generous provisions ; 
in oral English, debates, four-minute speeches, dramatics 
give opportunities for guidance of natural impulses for 
self-expression. 
But there is no surrender to mere spontaneous, aimless 
activities of children. Indeed, frequent, brief, organized 
drills in all subjects are in place; and in assemblies, in the   
°Estimate based on tables of Crampton and Marro cited by 
Whipple: Op. cit., pp. 247, 248. 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  i112 © EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
corridors, in brief study periods, reasonable decorum is 
insisted upon and readily accepted by the pupils. But in 
all such arbitrary controls, the actual administration and 
achievements make generous use of pupils’ participation, 
so that their activity is utilized for constructive purposes ; 
they act as corridor-officers, they take charge of assemblies 
and football-crowds, they enter into partnership with the 
teacher to reach the grade standard in reading, spelling, 
arithmetic, and the rest. For the younger junior high 
school pupils, standards of behavior and achievement may 
be arbitrarily set by the teachers; for the more mature 
pupils, most of whom are already adolescent, the judg- 
ments should be put more and more into their hands. 
The Senior High School Deals Chiefly With the Pupils 
Already Adolescent—The senior high school finds its 
problem largely in supplying opportunities for a normal 
social and intellectual life of boys and girls who have rather 
marked interests and preferences. But it has the no less 
important task of codperating with or combating the 
activities that the communities supply, consciously or 
unconsciously, for boys and girls in their ’teens. This 
can be done only by setting up social approvals and inteHec- 
tual satisfactions within the control of the school and of 
coOperating community agencies—homes, churches, 
women’s clubs, chambers of commerce, newspapers, and 
the like—such as will overbalance the approvals of the 
street-corners, public dance-halls, and secret fraternities. 
It is an almost impossible task to make scholastic achieve- 
ment, in which limited groups in a community take only 
spasmodic interest, compete with social achievement and 
athletic achievement which bring almost constant attention 
and approval from a far larger fraction of the community. 
There is need for concrete outcomes, each resulting in
-P-A-G-E-123
  SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 113 
a sense of accomplishment; there is need for modifica- 
tion of content and method so as to make of mathematics 
and foreign languages, of science and English, a series 
of experiences, something tangible attempted and some- 
thing tangible done. There are required opportunities for 
social approval from the school group and the community, 
through assembly-exercises, exhibits, reports in the papers ; 
there should be as many opportunities as possible for 
social organizations of pupils with similar interests, mathe- 
matics-clubs, choruses, radio-clubs, and the like, for mu- 
tual-admiration purposes, as well as to give an opportunity 
for normal self-expression of interests of a less formal and 
directed sort than the classroom provides. 
While the period of rapid growth and physical awk- 
wardness for the over-aged and physically precocious boys 
and for many girls of normal age has occurred in the ninth 
grade or earlier, it is in the tenth grade, the first year of the 
senior high school, that this becomes most characteristic 
of the pupils. The clumsiness, awkwardness, boldness and 
bashfulness, obstreperousness and self-consciousness of 
the boys and girls of early adolescence, calls for all the 
tact and resource of the wisest and most patient teacher. 
This is the true ‘‘ growing up” period. Body and mind 
grow in segments, moods alternate, at one moment the 
boy has the poise and outlook of a grown man, the next 
he is a mischievous and perverse child, his interests fluc- 
tuate, new ones are born and die. They may seem mere 
whims and fads, but they are frequently intense while 
they last. 
The self-assertiveness, the know-it-allness, the resent- 
ment of arbitrary rulings are mere assertions of that indi- 
viduality which counts for so much in democratic society. 
Without a doubt for a time the influence of sex-maturing 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  114 EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
naturally occupies in the mental life of the adolescent a 
central and dominant place ; but, if his life is hygienic, his 
social surroundings wholesome, and if he has opportuni- 
ties for normal self-expression, the instincts expand and 
become diffused, irradiating many allied fields and inter- 
ests ; they enrich the life in later youth and are the elements 
from which are built up the more pleasing phases of 
personality.*° 
Contrary to oft-expressed opinion, this seems to the 
writer the very time when school instruction in sex-hygiene 
ought not to be given. Individual friendly talks between 
teacher and pupil are helpful in special cases. Conscious- 
ness of sex is already too potent a cause of worry and dis- 
tress. Rather is there needed a rich life of physical and 
intellectual activity—athletic, radio-clubs, overnight hikes 
and camping parties, public-speaking contests, dances, shop 
and laboratory experiences, companionship with adults. 
The school that can encourage fathers and boys and 
mothers and daughters to find common interests, the hold- 
ing of “ dads’ dinners,” mothers’ and daughters’ sewing 
circles or dancing classes, is giving the best solution of sex- 
problems. The writer has succeeded in two senior high 
schools with which he has been connected in reading over 
with groups of men parents and men teachers Moll’s book 
discussing school aspects of the sex-life of adolescents. 
In the later years of the senior high school, the problem 
generally grows beyond the school’s reach; the boys and 
girls have become young men and young women, who

* Much harm may be done by the adult who does not understand, 
or does not know the facts thoroughly. He should not attempt any 
advice on sexual matters unless he has read Moll’s The Sexual Life 
of the Child, or an equivalent frank authoritative book.  
-P-A-G-E-125
  TRANSFER OF TRAINING 115 
mingle so freely outside of school hours that the home 
rather than the school must exert the major influence. 
The school can and should encourage all possible normal 
social activities within the school, set standards of gentle- 
man-like and gentlewoman-like behavior, and give much! 
opportunity for practice of such approved behavior. It 
must see to it, of course, that school gatherings for classes 
and extraclass functions are not such as to encourage im- 
proper relationships between the sexes. There is still much 
opportunity for the friendly counsel of wise women 
teachers to young women pupils, and of robust men 
teachers to young men pupils. But the best general instru- 
ment is the encouragement to lead in intellectual and social 
affairs, to accept responsibility for the success of student 
activities, to find expression in athletics, in student council, 
in Latin class, or chemistry laboratory, for the potential 
leadership and superiority which each one may have in 
some segment of the total life of the school. 
4. TRANSFER OF TRAINING OR 
FORMAL DISCIPLINE 
No psychologist doubts that there is a considerable 
spread of training, that habits, methods, ideals, and general- 
izations built up in one field of knowledge or abilities, 
result in increased ability in other fields. 
How Probable is Transfer of Training?—Since there 
have been made the actual studies of the amount and 
methods of transfer, and critical examinations of the gen- 
erally accepted assumptions regarding general powers, psy- 
chologists are now agreed that transfer is not automatic 
or inevitable.
-P-A-G-E-126
  116 EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
It is now generally agreed that there are not general 
faculties of the mind. The mind is normally characterized 
by special functions, which may become generalized by 
purposeful practice in a great number and variety of 
related situations. An identity of facts, of setting, of ideas, 
of method, of attitudes and ideals is essential, if transfer 
is to take place to any appreciable degree. Practice of the 
specific act, development of the specific habit, attitude, 
ideal, encouragement of the specific impulses, experiences 
in generalizing with the specific material most likely to be 
used in the situations for which education is preparing, are 
the most certain and economical means of attaining the 
ends sought, so that the power to act, to think, to feel, will 
function when necessary. 
Inglis, after a presentation of the matter, generally 
very favorable to the theory of: transfer of training, says 
that subjects whose primary aim in the secondary school 
looks toward specific ends, can provide but a limited 
amount of transfer-value. Subjects of study whose pri- 
mary purposes are the development of generalized traits 
can produce but limited specific values. Subjects of study 
which aim at both ends at once are likely to produce limited 
results in both.!? 
No one, according to Sleight, should study one thing 
in order to learn another, unless he has one hundred and 
forty-four times as much leisure and energy to devote to 
the indirect practice, as he needs for the direct practice. 
Whatever of truth remains in the doctrine of formal 
‘discipline, the patrons of the school are settling the matter 
for themselves, according to Betts, who cites the disappear- 
ance of Greek, the rapid falling off of elections in Latin,   
“Inglis: Principles of Secondary Education, p. 411-12, Houghton 
Mifflin, 1918, 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
APPLYING CONCEPTS AND MODES 117 
the tendency to omit third semester algebra and solid: 
geometry, and the gradual modification of college entrance 
requirements, as changes due to the waning faith in 
formal discipline. 
Specific Practice in Applying Concepts and Modes of 
Behavior Alone Assures Transfer.—How one reacts to a 
learning-situation and how one will react to social situa- 
tions later, are interdependent to the extent that they have 
identical elements, or that ideals are set up in one situation 
that will carry over to the other, or that methods of react- 
ing in one situation will carry over, or that one will develop 
generalized attitudes from the learning experience that will 
make him tend to respond in new situations in desir- 
able ways. 
For the development of such identical elements, atti- 
tudes, ideals, generalizations, generalized habits as will 
most effectively promote general mental discipline, the 
choice of subject-matter has, no doubt, much importance. 
But its importance lies not in any mystic quality of the 
traditional “ disciplinary ” subjects, but in the degree to 
which these subjects or other subjects provide experiences 
that assure the use of the desired traits, with concomi- 
tant factors as similar as possible to those the pupils will 
meet in the other experiences of life. Thus the formal 
disciplinary value of Latin will depend not only on the 
degree to which it gives practice in developing a general 
mode of behavior—translating the ablative absolute by 
means of an appropriate clause—but also on whether, else- 
where in adolescent or adult life, one performs activities 
so closely analogous to those of Latin that associative 
shifting will take place, and the desired reactions will 
follow. Even if Latin is now or can be so taught, its 
place in the curriculum will depend on whether or not the  
-P-A-G-E-128
    118 EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
general powers it may develop are relatively important for 
many people, and on whether or not it develops those 
powers more surely or more economically than 
other subjects. 
If general science, English composition, or community 
civics give, in the same amount of time for the same 
amount of effort, more experiences than Latin, which as- 
sure desired general modes of behavior, and if the data 
used and the concomitant factors of the experiences 
are more frequently very similar to those of actual life 
situations than in the case of Latin, the effectiveness of 
these studies for general discipline will be greater than that 
of Latin. Thus if one is likely to read books, write reports, 
identify trees, appreciate the relation between epidemics and 
an unclean milk supply, than he is to select words on the 
basis of their etymology, and if the conditions under which 
he would perform the former activities are more nearly 
similar to conditions set up by the school during the teach- 
ing process than in the case of Latin, then the chances of 
general discipline resulting from English, general science, 
or community civics is greater than the likelihood of 
developing general functioning powers from Latin. 
A Broad Conception of the Learning-process is Neces- 
sary to Appreciate What Will Be Transferred From 
School to Life.—But the.transfer-value of powers devel- 
oped by the school will depend on more than subject-matter 
or even on recitation-method. It will be much more 
dependent on social approvals that are similar, on practice 
in codperation or friendly rivalry, in square dealing, in 
earnest effort, in suspending judgment, in accepting cor- 
rection, in taking defeat bravely and success modestly, 
in a friendly attitude toward social institutions, in living 
the life of the school. These and many other attitudes and 
   
-P-A-G-E-129
A BROAD CONCEPTION 119 
habits will be far more powerful in enriching future exper- 
iences than will carefully selected or efficiently taught 
subject-matter. And so the term “ curriculum ” must be 
so conceived as to cover all pupil activities; because, 
whether we will it or not, the boy in Cesar class is learning 
much else beside Latin; for good or for ill, he is becoming 
an efficient, helpful member of society, or the reverse; he is 
responding to a gross total situation of which the Com- 
mentaries is only one small part.

' CHAPTER VIII 
WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM 
TRYING TO DO? 
Preliminary statement. In Parts I and II the most 
significant conclusions reached are these: 
Seven Fundamental Concepts of the Purposes and 
Functions of the Secondary School Curriculum.—1. The 
American high school is conceived to be a social institu- 
tion. It is a consciously controlled environment, wherein 
pupils undergo such experiences and develop such habits, 
powers, ideas, attitudes, ideals that a democratic com- 
munity may be assured of stability, and may give direction 
to its own progress from generation to generation. In 
this process the school endeavors to reinforce all other 
social agencies that are striving for the same general end. 
But it finds its peculiar functions in assuming responsi- 
bility, so far as possible, for the socially desirable educa- 
tion that other social institutions fail to provide. 
2. The social inheritance with which the dominant 
social groups in adult society would endow the youth, 
includes essential standardized modes of behavior for all, 
but, within limits, it encourages individual variations; it 
assures to all as much of the world’s store of knowledges, 
interests, skills, as each one is capable of receiving; it 
encourages the practice of codperative thinking and acting, 
an intelligent appreciation of big social groups, a desire 
for reasonable liberty and independence of action. Each 
generation not only learns to respond to inherited problems 
by inherited solutions, but it meets new problems calling 
for new solutions. Furthermore it improves on the old 
solutions of inherited problems, in the light of the new 
123 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
      124 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
knowledge gained in each generation, and of the better 
conception of the attainable goals that a democratic society 
can gain through the modifications of human character. 
3. The general aims of education are the same for all 
stages of education, just as the educative process is con- 
tinuous. But the peculiar function of secondary education 
is conditioned by the nature of boys and girls maturing 
through adolescence, and by the social and physical 
environments with which the pupils are now or so soon 
will be in direct contact. 
4. Secondary education is becoming an upward exten- 
sion of universal elementary education. It is expected to 
reach all children of early adolescence who are not actually 
subnormal. Enrolments in the public secondary schools 
are increasing rapidly, and the pupils are becoming more 
and more heterogeneous in abilities, aptitudes and 
social background. 
5. The learning-process is being reconceived ; the inade- 
quacy of the conventional subject-matter, and of the mem- 
orization- and recitation-methods are being appreciated. 
6. Meantime the social and economic demands for 
high school graduates increase more rapidly than the school 
can possibly satisfy them, because of the impossibility of 
educating many of the new pupils with the time-honored 
subject-matter and methods. The problem is further com- 
plicated by the increasing expensiveness of secondary 
education, and by the more and more intense extraschool 
activities in which so many adolescents participate. 
7. The subject-matter and methods of the curriculum, 
the social experiences to be participated in, must have posi- 
tive justification. “The modern school should include 
nothing for which an affirmative case cannot now be made 
out.” + Such a positive justification should, of course, take 
+ Cf, Flexner, A. F.: 4 Modern School, General Education Board.   
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  SEVEN FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS 125 
into consideration all the factors just reviewed; and the 
contributions of research-specialists and investigators as 
explained in Part II. The affirmative case for each topic 
and activity should be built on such important contribu- 
tions of educational psychology and social theory as 
the following: 
(a) The brain is now thought of as a reacting rather 
than asa receiving mechanism. The child thus becomes an 
active agent in the educative process, he “ learns the reac- 
tions he gives birth to.” He is not a vessel into which 
education can be poured, nor a cold-storage warehouse 
which can receive knowledge and have it ready for use 
when needed. Still less is he able to absorb abstractions, 
principles, generalizations, formule, and unfailingly apply 
‘them to varying situations and problems that arise. 
(b) The socialization of the individual has become a 
matter of increasing importance, owing to the increasing 
tendency (1) to conceive the individual as a member of 
many social groups, some of which are likely not to under- 
stand each other sympathetically, unless they are purposely 
helped to do so; and (2) to recognize his need for a social 
environment for the fullest development of his self. There 
is an insistent demand of democratic theorists that there 
shall be an ever-increasing number of activities or experi- 
ences consciously shared by the different members 
of society. 
(c) The nature and significance of individual differ- 
ences necessitate the adaptation of subject-matter and 
methods to the needs of individual pupils. 
(d) General transfer of mental powers is not auto- 
matic and inevitable ; there is no general desirable discipline 
from what is merely difficult.
-P-A-G-E-136
    
126 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
Part III consists of a series of guiding principles that 
may help curriculum-makers in the organization and 
administration of the secondary program of studies, or 
students of the curriculum to decide the validity of the 
claims made for various subjects or topics, and methods 
for places in the curriculum. 
Principles I and II underlie the conception of what 
constitutes the secondary curriculum, why it is set up, 
what its purposes are, and the general nature of curriculum- 
activities that would fulfil the demands of the principles. 
Principles III, IV and V affect the actual organization 
and functioning of the program of studies to fulfil the 
purposes set forth in the first four principles. 
Principles VI, VII and VIII deal with the subjects that 
should be prescribed for all pupils, the core-curriculum. 
Principle IX deals with the prescriptions peculiar to 
a curriculum. 
Principles X and XI indicate the place and purposes, 
and suggest the administrative measures needed to provide 
for elective courses of study. 
Principles XII and XIII deal with the procedure neces- 
sary for the wisest and most successful modification of the 
secondary program of studies. 
Principles XIV, XV and XVI are statements concern- 
ing secondary school graduation, certificate of completion, 
and admission to college. 
The principles as stated are not to be considered as 
mutually exclusive, but rather as different methods of 
approach to the same problem in question. Each principle 
is explained and justified, and then further interpreted 
through its application to school-curriculum problems; 
first, as regards present practice in secondary schools, and, 
second, as suggesting what schools can do to bring their © 
practice into conformity with the principle.  
-P-A-G-E-137
  
FIRST PRINCIPLE 127 
FIRST PRINCIPLE 
THE SECONDARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM COMPRISES ACTIVI- 
TIES AND EXPERIENCES PROVIDED BY THE COMMUNITY 
THROUGH THE SCHOOL TO PREPARE ALL THE NORMAL CHIL- 
DREN OF EARLY ADOLESCENCE FOR PARTICIPATION IN CIVIL 
LIFE, AND TO SECURE FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL THE MAXIMUM 
SELF-REALIZATION CONSONANT WITH THE WELFARE OF THE 
GROUP. THIS MEANS, ON THE ONE HAND, THE SELECTIVE 
PRESERVATION OF THE SOCIAL INHERITANCE; ON THE OTHER, 
THE GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT OF SOCIETY. 
1. There is Needed a Broader Conception of the Cur- 
riculum.—The curriculum defined as experiences and 
activities is a relatively new conception. The conventional 
curriculum is thought of as so many theorems in geometry 
to be mastered, so many pages of history to be learned, 
such and such a facility in French to be attained through 
a certain period of class attendance and outside prepara- 
tion. But a curriculum according to the conception set 
forth in this principle is the activity—the building of the 
radio apparatus, the reading of the story, the solution of 
the social-study problem. Subject-matter according to 
this conception consists of the raw materials possessing the 
possibilities of knowledge, experiences, and activities.” 
Real knowledge can result only from active experience 
with the means or materials provided.   
2? Thus, if a pupil undertakes to report to a class on the water- 
supply of New York City, he must first find the sources of information, 
acquaint himself with the facts, the importance of abundant supply of 
pure water, the history of New York’s epidemics, its fire-protection, 
its sewage- and street-cleaning system, the engineering-problems 
involved in bringing water to New York, of keeping it pure and 
properly aerated; he will need to organize his material, to make charts, 
and to present his report. Learning thus involves purposing, use, and 
comprehension of the implications of the knowledge. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
    128 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
Many of the most valuable educational experiences 
more recently brought under the control of the school are 
termed “extracurriculum activities,’ because the con- 
ception of the curriculum stated in this principle has not 
as yet become sufficiently accepted in practice to include 
debating, assembly exercises, publication of the school 
paper, athletics, student societies and the like. But the 
newer conception of learning makes it inevitable that the 
curriculum must either include them or be so codrdinated 
with them, as to supplement and exploit the total educa- 
tive environment of pupils. 
The curriculum should promote respect for the achieve- 
ments of the past, understanding of the present, and a 
critical but open-minded attitude toward future develop- 
ments. It should be so planned and carried out that pupils 
will be prepared for an ever-changing, ever more complex 
social-economic community life. 
Secondary Education as Indoctrination—The use of 
the high school curriculum as a means of indoctrinating 
adolescent children into the acceptance of the institutions 
or faiths of the present or past, or of any specific plan for 
the future, has very narrow limits. For inculcating in the 
pupil a respect for the rights of others, a belief in democ- 
racy, a tolerance and patience toward those of differing 
opinions, an insistent attitude toward orderly and legal 
methods of change, a willingness to follow loyally but not 
blindly those properly chosen to lead in all group-activities, 
a detached point of view in judging questions that affect 
him or his friends—for these and similar ends the curric- 
ulum may and should be used as an instrument of propa- 
ganda and training. 
The Secondary Curriculum is an “ Engine for Social 
Betterment.”—The secondary curriculum has a positive 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  SCHOOL AND SOCIETY 129 
function; it is conceived in terms of the conditions of the 
present, and such conditions as we may judge the future 
to hold in store. 
It is difficult enough to understand the political, eco- 
nomic, social and cultural conditions that obtain at present ; 
they are so complex, so many-phased, so restlessly active 
in their ever-changing relative importance. Even if the 
concrete facts are discovered, it is almost impossible to get 
a perspective that promises to be accurate even for a brief 
time. The flood of books, magazines articles, lectures, 
endeavoring to explain current problems of immigration, 
finance, engineering, biological science, exploration, inter- 
national rivalries, religion, art, the home, community, 
health, social service, and the rest is indicative of the 
compass of the field. 
It is all but impossible to prepare for a future condition 
of society, because the forces that will control the future 
are not known, and the psychological, sociological, spirit- 
ual, economic, and physical forces and resources that we do 
know, are sure to vary in intensity and potency. 
But education as the agent of a democratic society has 
no alternative. Through the pooling of knowledge and 
judgments of specialists, and the reflections and interpre- 
tations of philosophers, educators must try to know the 
present, and to prejudge the future with sufficient clarity, 
to enable them to plan the experiences that will prepare 
the growing boys and girls of this generation to meet the 
conditions that the world will offer them five, ten or fifteen 
years hence—conditions that these very boys and girls will 
help make possible through acquiescence, codperation, par- 
ticipation, or rebellion. Thus it may be hoped that the 
generations, as they pass on, may each contribute some- 
thing toward permanent betterment.
-P-A-G-E-140
  
  130 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
Prussia Has Shown How Education Can be Used to 
Fulfil a Social Purpose.—It is a comparatively easy task 
for an intelligent autocracy or oligarchy to decide to what 
experiences it desires to expose its subjects, for it knows 
what knowledge, habits, attitudes, and ideals it wishes the 
people to have. As Dean Russell ® has so clearly pointed 
out, Prussia, through a highly intelligent, if woefully mis- 
guided policy, has proved for all time, how a compulsory 
universal educational system can be made to turn out 
highly skilled, earnest, even intelligent men and women, 
who will, under conditions desired by the ruling class, be 
docile, obedient, and loyal to the point of their undoing.* 
Prussia’s example, valuable as it is, has such a different 
basis from that of America, that it gives only a feeble indi- 
cation of the general plan that must be followed. The 
virtues that dynamic democracy must develop in its grow- 
ing boys and girls are not the virtues of a static mili- 
tary oligarchy. On the contrary, they are the impulse and 
ability to think carefully and act bravely in dealing with 
such contradictory tendencies as legislative control and 
demands for personal freedom from restraint; inter- 
nationalism and national rivalries; nationalism and 
economic or geographic sectionalism; control of the 
governmental policies by “ big business,” and their control 
by “labor” or “ farmer” organizations; academic free- 
dom and the suppression of freedom of speech; feminine 
independence and feminine parasitism. These and many 
other trends are developing genetically so fast that no man 
can be sure whether they are leading to salvation or 
to destruction.

NEEDS OF COMMUNITY LIFE 131 
The Task of the Curriculum-maker.—The task of the 
curriculum-maker demands that he be a social engineer, 
that he search out such undramatic general wrongs as self- 
ishness, inertia, indolence, narrow group-loyalties. He 
must calmly try to foresee possible catastrophes and 
attempt to forestall them; he must rise triumphant over 
the prejudices of his time and community, and so con- 
struct that, through the curriculum, society may explain 
itself to and incorporate the will of the individuals.® 
2. What Must be Taught in the Secondary School 
Should be Determined First of All by the Needs of Com- 
munity Life—The term “community” is not here used 
narrowly, but includes any group of people with common 
interests, not only the neighborhood and town, but also 
the state, the nation, and all humanity. The term “ needs ” 
includes among others such desirable traits and conditions 
as are presented below. 
The community in taxing itself to provide educa- 
tional opportunities for the growing boys and girls, does 
so to assure itself that the social inheritance may be pre- 
served and improved, that the community may be bene- 
fited by the intelligent development and application of 
the physical, intellectual, and spiritual resources inherent 
in the population. 
Free Public Education is a Community Investment.— 
Dividends in terms of more intelligent and zealous par- 
ticipation in promotion of the community welfare ought 
to be forthcoming. In terms of the seven objectives set 
up by the Commission on Reorganization of Secondary 
Education: 
°Cf. Wells, H. G.: Joan and Peter, The Macmillan Co., 1918. 
° Op. cit.
-P-A-G-E-142
132 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
(1) There should result an improvement in com- 
munity health and community sanitation. 
(2) There should be general control and a high stand- 
ard of command over the fundamental processes, which 
are such essential tools in continuing education outside 
and beyond the school. 
(3) The home should become a more satisfactory 
social institution through the contribution to its cultural 
activity of all its members; for the home environment of 
intimate and repeated experiences is probably the most 
potent of all factors affecting our education. The educa- 
tional experiences of the home are so oft-repeated, the 
approvals and disapprovals, encouragements and inhibi- 
tions are so unvarying on the habit- and attitude-level, 
that the automatic reactions, the emotions and habits, of 
almost everyone reflect the influence of home life. 
(4) All future citizens should be helped to find a 
vocation for which they are suited and in which they may 
find the joy of productive effort, both because of the 
increased community economic resources therefrom, and 
also because of the increased social stability and proba- 
bility of ordered progress. 
(5) There should result a more critically responsive 
public opinion, a united and determined effort for a better 
community, and a more intelligent readiness to contribute 
to the general welfare. 
(6) The ever-increasing leisure-time of great num- 
bers of the population may be used for harmless recrea- 
tion, for self-improvement, or for vicious idleness, waste, 
and even crime. The school should set up higher stand- 
ards of employments of leisure, if such leisure is to be an 
asset rather than a liability to the community.  
-P-A-G-E-143
    
NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES 133 
(7) Finally, the supreme outcome of the community 
investment in secondary education must be the higher 
ethical character of the maturing boys and girls, that they 
may perceive clearly their relations to their fellows and to 
the institutions with which they deal, and be accustomed 
to subordinating selfish desires to the welfare of others. 
If the first six objectives, stated above, are met to the 
fullest extent, ethical character is assured. 
The Curriculum and the Needs of Local Communities, 
and of Large Social Groups—The curriculum of any 
local community’s secondary schools should not only 
reflect the general needs of democratic life, but also inter- 
pret the more specific characteristics of the locality, its 
industrial and commercial life, its political organizations, 
its geography, its history, and the cosmopolitan character 
of its population. 
Even though the final authority and supreme interest 
of the state in educational policy be acknowledged, and 
though the local boards of education be legally recognized 
state officers, it is the practice in America for a large 
share of the support of the schools to be derived from 
local taxation, and for boards of education to be locally 
elected, and therefore responsive to local opinion. Local 
advisory committees on special educational problems, the 
encouragement of local parent-teacher associations, the 
school’s requests for codperation of municipal officials and 
civic organizations are acknowledgments of the imme- 
diate interests of the local community in the education of 
its oncoming generations. 
The function of the state is rather to determine broad 
general policies, compulsory-attendance laws, minimum 
length of the school year, the inclusion of certain oppor-
-P-A-G-E-144
  134 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
tunities, the qualification of teachers, the adequacy of 
school-buildings, the keeping of proper records and mak- 
ing of reports, and the like. The local community is inter- 
ested in its unassimilated foreign population, in its jobless 
young men, its unmanned jobs, its high death-rate, and 
its own vigorous growth, and it expects the school to help 
solve these problems. 
The readiness to learn, the fulness of concept, and the 
permanence of learning depend largely on the reality of 
the experiences by means of which the learning takes 
place. The pupil who takes part in a milk-fund campaign, 
learns the food value of pure milk more readily, more 
permanently, and acquires certain community attitudes 
that would probably not be set up through a textbook 
study of milk. 
The same reasons that lead us to use or consider 
specific local community activities make it desirable also 
to select experiences shared by larger social groups, such 
as the state and the nation. The direct relation between 
the readiness with which subject-matter can be lived, used, 
and experienced, and its importance in the environment, 
should be given weight in the selection of activities that 
look forward to the pupil’s later membership in state and 
nation. Thus, though one may memorize a Latin para- 
digm or the binomial theorem in algebra, it is hard to 
experience these facts so as to make them meaningful, 
because of their remoteness from life-activities of the 
social environments to which most people are accustomed. 
Whereas, if one learns to read the Atlantic Monthly with 
satisfaction, to understand the city water-system, to com- 
prehend the theory of the graduated income-tax—the

quency with which the learner comes into contact with 
them, make it more likely that these learnings will be 
experiences now and in the future. 
3. What Each Pupil Needs for His Fullest Develop- 
ment Should Decide What Opportunities He is to Get.— 
By “ pupil ” is meant potential pupil, each, one who would 
profit more by being in high school than by remaining in 
elementary school or by going to work or by hanging 
around the poolrooms. The girl or boy who might be but 
is not in high school, is not getting from the school the 
opportunities for his fullest development. 
Democracy is a codperative commonwealth of indi- 
viduals. Each pupil should be encouraged to develop his 
special abilities and aptitudes, in order to attain the richest 
life for himself and, at the same time, contribute most to 
the welfare of the community. It is an error to suppose 
that the most desirable social solidarity can be brought 
about by so educating pupils that they will become alike. 
It may be desirable to inculcate like attitudes, like loyal- 
ties, like honesties, like ideals, and yet there remains a 
great field in which individuals will contribute most to 
social solidarity by retaining or increasing their individual 
characteristics and capacities. 
To this end, the school should adapt its educational 
methods in the case of each child to his capacity for serv- 
ing society, and so preserve the integrity of society. The 
spirit of individual initiative and resourcefulness, of indi- 
vidual fearlessness and responsibility, has made such 
abundant contribution to our social and national progress 
that we may feel certain that any educational policy that 
denies the individual opportunity to exercise his specific

-P-A-G-E-146
136 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
abilities and aptitudes, fails to fulfil its function in a dem- 
ocratic society.7 
The Pupils Are Investing in Their Education —Not 
only is the maximum development of each individual 
sound social policy, and therefore justifiable as a com- 
munity investment, but it also must be considered as an 
investment in which the pupils have a large share them- 
selves. By remaining non-wage-earners or at most only 
partial wage-earners during four-fifths or the whole of 
each year, the students are contributing toward their edu- 
cation a very considerable amount. But in a more positive 
sense, the actual effort put into lesson preparation and 
participation in school activities is as true an investment, 
and is as deserving of definite assured return in physical, 
intellectual, vocational, and moral improvement, as would 
the same effort put into digging ditches deserve finan- 
cial return. 
Provisions for Individual Aptitudes Aim at More 
Purposeful and Serious Work, Not at the Indulgence of 
Whims.—The satisfyingness of hard work along the lines 
of interests and capacities, the joy of earnest participation 
in leadership whether in politics, science, literature, char- 
ity, or some other field—this is the moral basis of indi- 
vidual development for which the school curriculum 
should strive. 
Children as well as adults differ from each other in 
many ways and in varying degrees. Native mental capac- 
ity determines the upper limits of development, though few 
human beings ever realize their fullest development. There 
are specific natural abilities or lack of them, the special 
endowments that may make one a successful lawyer

SOCIALLY DESIRABLE DIFFERENCES 137 
though a mediocre musician, or another a designer of 
merit though an utter failure as an accountant. Of nearly 
as great educational importance are the pronounced indi- 
vidual variations growing out of the home and other 
environments in which each child lives ; the economic status, 
the traditions and attitudes so inculcated may reinforce 
or may offset the school’s effort. How widely the abilities 
of seventh and eighth grade children in fundamental opera- 
tions and knowledge vary, has been shown many times.® 
The high school must attack its problem by building on 
abilities that actually exist. On one hand, it reaches down- 
ward to assure each one such grade of achievement as all 
should have. On the other hand, it seizes upon each child’s 
potentialities, his manual dexterity, his interest in science, 
literature, economics, or business, his musical, artistic, 
physical capacities, his power in composition or mathe- 
matics, and gives him every encouragement and opportu- 
nity to progress along the lines of his interests and 
capacities, and to prepare for further education at college 
or elsewhere. 
All Socially Desirable Differences Should be Encour- 
aged, While Mere Peculiarities and Idiosyncrasies Should 
be Levelled—Moderate interests and impulses, whether 
inherited biologically or socially, may lead to more com- 
plete self-expression of the individual. Enjoyment of 
music, or color, or rhythm, or living in the woods, or 
composing poetry, do not harm others and may be of 
general help in broadening the interests, and in uniting cir- 
cles of friends. 
Sometimes, however, the impulses are so marked that 
they interfere with the welfare of others, and they may

  138 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
interfere materially with the social effectiveness of the 
“peculiar” individual. Thus a pupil may follow his 
hobby so intensively that he becomes very selfish or 
becomes a recluse. The reader, the experimenter, the nat- 
uralist, each needs direction of his interests into social 
environments. So, too, the school must temper the zeal 
of the pupil whose gregarious impulses and love of the 
unthinking approval of the athletic “‘ fans,” the poolroom 
hangabouts, the corner-loafers, or the devotees of modern 
dancing, lead him to neglect all study and more perma- 
nently valuable activity for the sake of the ephemeral 
popularity of specialized skill in these less socially useful 
activities. Then there are the hot-tempered, the dishonest, 
the sexually overdeveloped children, and those with other 
antisocial impulses or habits. The function of the school 
in decreasing and offsetting these individual differences 
is obvious. 
The need of encouraging every resource of the individ- 
ual for his own fullest self-expression, and guaranteeing 
him his right to be unique, sometimes leads enthusiasts to 
forget that each of us must live amid social customs, 
taboos, approvals, and that it is our instinctive desire to be 
thought well of. Children with unusual bashfulness, or 
reticence, which they express in unusual ways, need most 
careful direction. Class- or group-ideals of behavior or 
customary reactions, tend to clamp all people by means of 
approvals into uniform behavior. Uniqueness must not be 
out of keeping with socially approved behavior, unless one 
is ready to defend his uniqueness at great cost to his hap- 
piness. The “ queer ” individual in order to make up for 
his own suffering, and for the discomfort his non-con- 
formity gives other people, must have a precious gift 
indeed to make to society. Of course the “ queer twist ” 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLE * 139 
that results in exaggerated “ uniqueness ” is often accom- 
panied by a secret liking for public attention that makes 
the unfortunate individual enjoy even public disapproval, 
rather than public unconcern. 
Not Individual Perfection, But Maximum Self-real- 
ization is the Goal.—On the other hand, the child’s marked 
special abilities, if capable of use for society or for his 
own pleasure, should be sought through educational guid- 
ance and through opportunities in the curriculum and 
school organization for self-exploration. Where the indi- 
vidual with specific gifts in music, art, composition, phys- 
ical activity, is found, he should be given every oppor- 
tunity to develop his capacity to the maximum for the 
glory of his school and college, or his family, rather than 
for his self-delectation and glorification. The effort to build 
upon drives furnished by nature is more effective than the 
imposition of new desires. 
Finally, each one must be encouraged to find self- 
expression and worthy achievement along the lines of his 
probable future as it will be determined by the economic 
and social demands of society. For almost all people, the 
ability and readiness to render such economic services as 
will assure a comfortable living, is essential to a successful 
and enjoyable life. 
APPLICATION OF FIRST PRINCIPLE 
A. What has been done by secondary schools. 
1. The More Conservative Schools Are Not Con- 
scious of Their Problems.—Secondary school opportunt- 
ties are still given to too small a fraction of the adolescent 
population. Three-quarters to four-fifths of adolescent 
boys and girls do not come into direct contact with the 
educational opportunities of the last two years of sec-
-P-A-G-E-150
140 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
ondary school. Those who favor the upward extension of 
the compulsory-education age sometimes urge that all 
children should be retained throughout high school, and 
laws are proposed to that end. But seldom is the fact 
faced, that the high school curriculum as at present 
planned and carried out is too difficult for nearly half of 
adolescent children to master. There must be included 
opportunities for adolescent pupils of less than normal 
ability (70 I. Q. to 90 I. Q.), if we are to carry them 
through high school, or if we are to give them worth-while 
educations up to the age of eighteen. This would call for 
very radical modifications in the curriculum. 
Emphasis in the secondary curriculum is generally on 
a social inheritance of knowledge and skills rather than on 
co6perative living and thinking, and the self-realization of 
individuals. The pupil’s chief purpose in learning these 
facts and processes is to answer questions asked about 
them in recitations and on examinations. Teachers often 
want to discover what the pupil “knows,” that is, has 
memorized from the text or from previous recitations; 
they are not interested in what immature boys and girls 
“think.” But while it is true that facts are necessary to 
thinking, it is also true that precise practice in thinking 
about problems of social importance, can alone prepare 
one to do such thinking.® 
Complaints are frequently heard that pupils do not 
retain in later life the knowledge and skills learned in 
school; but what other outcome could be expected it is 
difficult to see. Surely the law of exercise sufficiently 
°Even “thought questions” frequently call for mere organization 
of arguments to prove a thesis true; e.g., such an assignment as “ Show 
that the institution of private property is essential to democracy” 
precludes any independent thinking that might result in a conclusion 
that the thesis itself may not be true.  
-P-A-G-E-151
  FORMAL DISCIPLINARY AIM 141 
accounts for the atrophy of situation-response bonds that 
are so seldom used as are those concerned with a Latin 
vocabulary, English rhetoric, Egyptian dynasties, simul- 
taneous quadratic equations. So far as these conven- 
tional items of knowledge or skill affect our daily lives at 
all, they do so in ways and with concomitant factors that 
are quite dissimilar to those characteristic of school learn- 
ing, so that the transfer of learning to the new situations 
is not easily made. 
Pupils cannot learn everything that may possibly be 
useful or ornamental. Careful thought is needed to dis- 
cover what elements of the social inheritance are most 
likely to function in normal life-situations for large num- 
bers of adolescents and adults. These must, then, be taught 
so thoroughly that they will be retained. 
In Practice the Formal Disciplinary Aim is Given 
Excessive Importance.—The secondary school program of 
studies and curricula, and the enrolments in each curricu- 
lum and course of study would furnish data for interesting 
speculation as to what curriculum-purposes really function 
in practice. Bobbitt 1° has made a study of the proportion 
of daily classes contributing to each objective offered in 
high schools of different sizes, and widely distributed over 
the country. The results of this study must challenge any- 
one who is smugly satisfied that the high school curriculum 
offerings are going to help solve democracy’s problems. 
He found that the median number of daily classes in all 
vocational subjects and practical arts per 100 daily classes 
in all subjects was 27.8. In all subjects aiming to con- 
tribute to citizenship—history and “ social studies,”—the 
median number was 10.7. In all health education, includ-

  ing physical training, the median number of classes was 
4.5. In all subjects training in part for leisure-activities 
(including English, physical training, drawing and design, 
and music) the median number of classes was 28.4. In 
disciplinary subjects, foreign languages, mathematics, his- 
tory, science, the median number of classes was 43.6. 
The classifications used by Bobbitt were not mutually 
exclusive, some subjects appeared twice as having two 
different aims; e.g., English, science, history. It is evi- 
dent, however, how great was the emphasis in 1920-21 on 
the disciplinary aim of education, implying either great 
faith in indirect values, or, more likely, the conservatism 
of human institutions. 
In 1917-18 ninety-one per cent. of the rural high school 
pupils of New York State were studying academic cur- 
ricula very remotely connected with their out-of-school ex- 
periences, as compared with fifty-six per cent. in academic 
curricula in city schools. In some schools, some of these 
courses consisted of the memorization of Regents Exam- 
ination Review Books, with no study of the subjects at all 
that permitted individual interpretations or contribu- 
tions.1? In rural high schools it was found to be the rule for 
the first two years to be made up of prescribed academic 
studies, with electives appearing only in the eleventh and 
twelfth grades, and these electives were frequently addi- 
tional units in mathematics and foreign languages. But 
only one-half of rural high school pupils ever reach the 
eleventh grade, and only two-fifths reach the twelfth.1?

  PROGRESSIVE SCHOOLS 143 
Briggs describes an agricultural high school in North 
Carolina, in which the prescribed courses for the first two 
years were of such an academic character that the inferior 
pupils were unable to pass, and so remained in the com- 
munity. The superior pupils, after completing the agricul- 
tural courses offered only in the last two years, went on to 
agricultural college and seldom returned to the local com- 
munity. Thus, this local community, through its school, 
selected the inefficient for its own next generation. 
2. But Progressive Schools Are Modifying Their 
Offerings Purposefully.—In wealthy suburban. cities such 
as Cleveland Heights, Ohio,'* and University City, Mis- 
souri, almost the entire adolescent population is found to be 
attending secondary schools, either the public high school, 
or private preparatory schools. In some large cities, Los 
Angeles, for example, the high schools are being planned 
to provide educational opportunities for the entire popu- 
lation of high school age, according to their various levels 
of abilities, their interests and vocational futures. As a 
result of the administrative and curriculum-readjustment 
of the Solvay (N. Y.) schools, the junior high school 
enrolment was increased from 151 to 314, and the senior 
high school enrolment from 70 to 124 in three years.1* 
The obvious lack of adjustment of the “ grammar 
grades’ and the secondary school to community needs, 
and the ignorance and inaptitude of secondary school 
pupils regarding affairs of importance in the world of 
practical affairs, have resulted in a general restlessness 
among laymen and educators. Hence, the junior high 
school has been developed, the opportunities for commer-

cial and industrial education have been increased, and con- 
tinuation-schools have been established. 
Elective curricula and some election of subjects within 
each curriculum are increasingly common in schools of a 
hundred or more pupils. The large elections of commercial 
curricula show the readiness of the pupils to take advan- 
tage of these opportunities. 
In the academic curricula there is often evidence of 
pressure brought to bear to direct undue numbers of boys 
and girls to follow the traditional foreign language and 
mathematics courses because of inertia, of traditional col- 
lege requirements or recommendations, or of the belief in 
“general mental training.” Though schools have not 
progressed as one might wish in making adaptations, they 
have nevertheless made considerable progress in grouping 
children homogeneously with regard to abilities or inter- 
ests, thus giving an approach to individual adaptations.® 
Intrinsic Subject-matter in Public High Schools.— 
Very many high school subjects are being so conceived as 
to make much use of purposeful activities; indeed, such 
characteristic courses as community civics, practical arts, 
fine arts and commercial arts, and general science are in 
some schools largely made up of projects, intellectual and 
concrete problems to be solved, information and skills to 
be attained because they are needed, rather than because 
they are to be tested. Of senior high school subjects, 
office practice and salesmanship, and advanced stenography 
are sometimes so organized that students deal with intrin- 
sic subject-matter ; i.c., they perform tasks for some more 
immediate reason than to get a mark. Classes in fine and

applied arts, home arts, industrial arts, physical training 
and music are frequently engaged in purposeful activities ; 
and occasionally even English literature and composition 
classes and modern foreign language classes, do more than 
learn lessons to be recited. 
In Experimental Schools.—Thoroughgoing modifica- 
tions of some phases of the secondary curriculum have 
been carried on in this country in such private experi- 
mental schools as the University of Chicago High School, 
the Lincoln School of Teachers College, the Park School 
of Baltimore, Maryland, the School of Organic Education 
of Fairhope, Alabama, the Francis Parker School of 
Chicago. In European countries, France, Switzerland, 
Germany, England, Belgium, are schools listed as ““ New 
Schools ” by the International Bureau for New Schools of 
Vaud, Switzerland, all of which carry a program based on 
pupil activities, through the grades for adolescent boys and 
girls. The significance for public secondary education 
of such “hot-house” experiments remains yet to be proved. 
In the Danish Folk High Schools.—Most significant 
of all, however, are the Folk High Schools of Denmark, 
codperative community schools for youth and adults, pri- 
vately organized, subsidized by the government, but con- 
trolled almost entirely by the communities in which they 
are situated and by which they are chiefly supported. 
These schools have been a most important influence in the 
progress of the codperative democracy and the universal 
economic well-being, of which Denmark is the outstanding 
example in the world. These schools, inspired by Bishop 
Grundvig and introduced by Kristen Kold, are a revolt 
against medizval classicism, and against all examination- 
passing. They seek to “inform,” to animate, to inspire, 
rather than merely to impart information to the students.

  146 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
The experiences involved in sharing a common life of 
work and recreation, lectures without note-taking or text- 
book study, experimenting, testing, measuring, explaining, 
debating, these constitute the methodology of the Folk 
High School. Vital curriculum-offerings of history, sci- 
ence, statistics, sociology, economics, government, to stu- 
dents of sixteen to forty years of age who are actually 
using these subjects to control and modify civic, social, 
economic, and patriotic conditions in their communities— 
these are the instruments by which this school prepares for 
life by abstracting desired aspects of community life and 
reproducing them so as to give practice, as precise as pos- 
sible, in the activities needed for the better life in an extra- 
school community.1¢ 
The Curriculum is Absorbing Extracurriculum 
Activities—Most progressive secondary schools have 
included in their courses of study provisions for codpera- 
tion with or direction of many potentially educative activi- 
ties that have previously been considered extracurriculum

or even extraschool activities. Athletic teams that twenty- 
five years ago were very frequently school organizations 
largely in name only, have been brought generally to the 
status of extracurriculum activities; the educational ex- 
periences afforded are accepted by the school as respon- 
sibilities and opportunities. In some schools tne athletic 
training is an integral part of the physical education 
courses of study. 
Similarly glee clubs, debating societies, dramatic clubs, 
student publications are sponsored by one or more sub- 
ject departments that are most directly interested in the 
types of activities involved. These clubs give much oppor- 
tunity for individual expression. Some of this activity 
can be provided within the school day and in connection 
with the courses of study.17 At Tulsa, Okla., Central

INTRINSIC SUBJECT-MATTER 149 
B. wHAT CAN BE DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
Extrinsic Subject-matter Should be Subordinated so 
Far as Feasible to Intrinsic Subject-matter—As children 
approach adolescence, they change physically, and emo- 
tionally, they seek new experiences, partly intellectual, but 
more frequently social and physical. Many of the adjust- 
ments are so subtle that any agency may well fear to give 
much direction to them. But the school should provide all 
possible opportunities for group organization, for boy and 
girl companionship, for exploring new fields and develop- 
ing new interests. This means more than merely bringing 
richer content into the secondary school courses ; more than 
permitting or even encouraging social clubs, student pub- 
lications, and the like. It means that secondary school 
courses should be so planned and taught that pupils will 
educate themselves by doing purposeful things, forming 
social organizations, instituting and carrying out exper- 
iments, solving problems that need solution in order to 
present a unit of work to the school in assembly, financing 
the publication of a school paper, planning and building 
a bungalow, designing and making a dress for a little sis- 
ter, developing a more effective offensive for a football 
game, accepting responsibility for an extensive review in 
order to pass College Entrance Board examinations.?° 
Any subject that cannot be defined so that at least a 
large share of its pupil-direction is made up of pupil 
activities rather than “‘ subject-matter, set out to be learned 
and tested,” should be given a very subordinate place in 
the program of studies; certainly it should not be pre- 
scribed for all pupils at any level. For those pupils who do 
study the conventional abstract subjects, their social and 
zesthetic applications should be made clear. This may be

done through the activities of the pupils in using the 
knowledge and skill gained, to comprehend their applica- 
tion to social development—the enrichment of vocabulary, 
astronomic measurements, designing of buildings, and 
the like. 
America must depend chiefly on socialized organiza- 
tion of classes to inculcate those habits, attitudes, and 
ideals of unselfishness, adaptability, and responsibility, that 
must be developed, if the next generation is to deal advan- 
tageously with the conditions it will meet. 
Method is Most Important for Socialization.—If{ the 
recitation and study periods are characterized by means of 
problem-assignments, committee or individual reports, 
encouragement of pupil initiative and judgment; if diver- 
sity of decision is encouraged when honest and cogently 
reasoned; if the teacher distinguishes between his own 
mere opinion, and his knowledge of the laws of science or 
grammar in trying to get acceptance of a conclusion by the 
whole class; if the teacher can reinforce the class activities 
through the encouragement of parental, Boy Scout, or 
other codperation; then, the school-curriculum expe- 
riences will themselves be the most effective propaganda 
for, as well as a preparation for, democratic institutions. 
How local history may be used to motivate school work 
is described by Reavis ?* as follows: 
Learning is Accelerated and Better Secured if Features of the 
Local Environment are Utilized—‘* The pupils were given the task 
of gathering the pioneer history of the community in the form of 
reports on specific topics. The particular form in which these reports 
were to be written was left to the originality and ingenuity of the 
pupils ; however, they were free to consult the teachers for suggestions 
at any time. The pupils were encouraged to interview the older citizens 
of the community, to examine monuments and relics, and to consult

  ADAPTATION TO LOCAL CONDITIONS 151 
the county and city records, newspaper files, and printed matter relating 
to the early history of that particular section of the state. In every 
case the source of the information was to be acknowledged, and quota- 
tions when used were to be properly marked. 
“The reports covered such general topics as: The Character of 
the Earliest Settlers; Their Language; Occupations; Modes of Life; 
Clothing; Amusements; Social Customs; Institutions; The Develop- 
ment of Leading Industries; Notable Historic Undertakings; and 
Biographies of the Citizens Who Had Contributed Most to the Develop- 
ment of the Community. Out of these general reports, such specific 
topics as the following were chosen for individual themes: The 
Nationality of Our Pioneers; A Chat with the Earliest Settler; The 
Making of a Settlement; Cooking in Pioneer Days; The Spelling Bee; 
The Husking Bee; The Singing School; Courtship in Pioneer Days; 
Fashions in Pioneer Times; The District School; The Village Church; 
A Pioneer Lawsuit; The Digging of the Old Canal; The Building of 
the First Railroad; Trade Barons of the Early Community, etc. 
“After the reports were finished, plots were submitted from 
various pupils for the historical play. These plots were turned over 
to the pupils of the Senior Class, with a view to working out a suitable 
plot for the type of play to be written. The plots were discussed and 
criticised and the suggestions were utilized by the class in making a 
plot that would meet the conditions determined by the material at hand. 
This was done.in a round-table discussion, and the play was written in 
the same manner.” 
Another Example of Adaptation to Local Conditions.—“ The 
general principles of adaptation to (local) community needs affected 
the teaching of every subject in the curriculum. Take for example 
mathematics. The students of the agricultural curriculum took neither 
algebra nor geometry. In the first year they had a course in advanced 
arithmetic, which aimed to be distinctly practical. Such processes 
were taught as had a direct relation to the afterlives of the pupils. 
Problems were selected which dealt with actual situations and which 
grew out of the pupil’s experiences. In the place of the geometry of 
the second year, agricultural students took a course called practical 
mathematics, which included three lines of work: (a) the algebra of 
the equation; (b) the application of geometry to practical measure- 
ments; (c) the elementary principles of surveying.” .. . “ Social needs 
vary between different groups within the same community or institu- 
tion; subject-matter should vary accordingly.” *

  152 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
The opportunities for satisfactory active participation 
in doing and making are perhaps greater for rural sec- 
ondary school boys and girls because of the relative 
absence of snobbish restrictions, and the similarity and 
simplicity of social experiences of all children. Cleaning 
up the school grounds, painting and decorating the build- 
ing, serving noon-time lunches, building booths for the 
Grange fair, cleaning up the breeding-places of flies and 
mosquitoes, and the like, are projects that interest all and 
serve the entire community. If poultry, or potatoes, or 
milk, or preserving is discussed, every child has a home 
experience to serve as an apperceptive basis. Household 
arts, home sanitation, farm-shop practice have their 
sources, their applications and practice, and even their 
instruction-exercises carried on in their natural surround- 
ings, with the school acting as a centre for special help. 
Progressive rural high schools are gradually departing 
from city-made syllabi and city-planned equipment. 
Community Studies or Surveys Are Needed on Which 
to Base Plans for Adaptation.—Secondary schools should 
make at least a hasty study of the character of the com- 
munity served by the school and should compare the obvi- 
ous needs with the school’s provisions for meeting them. 
Such obvious needs are not necessarily those that are lim- 
ited to the local community; indeed they may frequently 
be almost universal. But the emphases in the program of 
studies of the activities corresponding to the needs depend 
on several factors. Such needs as more beautiful school 
grounds and parks, or better understanding between social 
groups, are for some localities of primary importance to 
the school curriculum; in other communities the emphases 
will have to be placed on different needs. Schools that 
adapt their curricula toward the attainment of objectives
-P-A-G-E-163
  COMMUNITY STUDIES 153 
in terms of the needs of local communities, generally are 
the very schools that are contributing most toward their 
attainment in terms of the needs of wider communities— 
state, nation, and all mankind. 
The population of the locality served by any secondary 
school includes many more or less homogeneous groups 
whose needs can be defined, and for whose improvement or 
benefit the curriculum should make provision. Thus, if a 
community contains a considerable number of Italian fam- 
ilies living in squalid tenements, each family with one or 
more adult male lodgers, who use the “ homes ” chiefly for 
sleeping purposes; if the sanitary conditions are unsatis- 
factory, the moral codes contrary to good citizenship, the 
children kept in school only because of the vigilance of 
the school authorities, then the junior high school curric- 
ulum has the definite function to improve conditions 
through purposefully planned courses in practical arts and 
practical science, in community civics, in educational guid- 
ance, in physical education, and in social organization. 
To prescribe courses in art, in technical grammar, in 
geometry, rather than practice in care of the home, in 
proper selection and preparation of food, is tofail to meet 
the obligations to the community that the school ought to 
serve. It is the business of such a school to teach habits of 
hygienic living as well as biological evolution; the funda- 
mentals of good usage rather than the technicalities of 
grammar; machine-shop practice as well as water-color 
painting ; how to keep clothes clean and in repair as well as 
how to select becoming apparel; responsibility for the care 
of the school grounds as well as a knowledge of the Con- 
stitution of the United States ; the habit of using the com- 
munity playgrounds rather than the ability to read French; 
the readiness to “ play fair” in baseball, and to lose in a  
-P-A-G-E-164
154 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
  sportsmanlike way, as well as to understand John Alden’s 
altruism in “‘ The Courtship of Miles Standish.” 
Social Shortcomings or Difficulties Present Chal- 
lenges to Education.—Secondary schools must increas- 
ingly differentiate between desirable community activities 
that are already well enough done, and those needs that are 
not adequately provided for; schools should accept as a 
challenge every need not being met. 
The secondary school curriculum should prepare pupils 
for active adaptation. “ An ideal democracy,” says Bryce, 
“ may be taken to mean a community in which the sense of 
public duty and an altruistic spirit fill the minds and direct 
the wills of the large majority of the citizens. . . . In 
it the average citizen will give close and constant atten- 
tion to public affairs, recognizing that this is his interest as 
well as his duty. He will try to comprehend the main 
issues of policy, bringing to them an independent and 
impartial mind, which thinks first not of his own but of 
the general interest.” 
An outstanding challenge of this kind has developed in 
many states as a result of recent child labor and compul- 
sory-school-attendance laws.*4 The purposes of the state 
in passing these laws are to insure the best possible citi- 
zenship, and to enforce the educational rights of the child; 
but both purposes look to the best interests of the com- 
munity—one directly, the other indirectly. A notable 
example is the Ohio act of 1921, permitting children over 
sixteen years of age to be employed if they have completed 
the seventh grade, with some exceptions; but if not 
employed they must attend school until they are eighteen or

-P-A-G-E-165
  SOCIAL SHORTCOMINGS 155 
until they have completed high school. If between sixteen 
and eighteen years of age and employed, they must attend 
continuation school if one is maintained. The laws of Cal- 
ifornia and some other states are almost as comprehensive 
and drastic. A result of such laws is an almost over- 
whelming increase in junior high school enrolments, and 
to a less extent in senior high school enrolments. The 
needs of these new pupil groups obviously cannot be met 
by mere academic, college-preparatory subjects. States 
give generous state aid to high schools—the states are sup- 
plying the pupils, the states have a right to a higher type of 
intensive professional thinking than is often in evidence. 
Similar challenges of the state to the school are 
involved in all special grants; e.g., for physical education, 
for vocational education. The state, or the nation, makes 
these investments because it believes that by these means it 
can best insure its physical resources, and its economic 
welfare. Each secondary school must know what physical 
needs are well enough met for the majority of its pupils, 
what vocational efficiencies that will be needed are “‘ picked 
up” incidentally, what physical and vocational shortcom- 
ings there are that need be met purposefully. 
Consolidated high schools, township, or union district 
high schools are created by the state’s authority to satisfy 
the diverse needs of several small communities; and it 
behooves the secondary school administrator to seek out 
the needs of all the communities his school is expected to 
serve, to find those lacks of adjustment in the rural district, 
and manufacturing area, with which the secondary school 
might help if it could make the right contacts. 
The needs of pupils who are now in the continuation- 
schools, or of boys and girls of fifteen or sixteen who are 
now out of school, give a foretaste of the greater provi- 
sions for individual needs that must be made by the high
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
school, if the present tendency is to continue, for larger 
numbers of adolescents to attend secondary schools for 
two or three years, until they are sixteen or even seventeen 
years of age. It is significant that an outstanding charac- 
teristic of these boys and girls who have left is an aversion 
for school. (cf. Chap. VI). 
In Small High Schools Better Pupil-grouping and 
Subject-grouping are Possible.—In the administration and 
curriculum-organization of a large high school, provision 
for differentiation is relatively simple. To the school enroll- 
ing fifty to seventy-five pupils in the seventh to twelfth 
grades, the simplest solution of the program-difficulties is 
to enrich offerings actually needed in the seventh to the 
tenth grades, and then to send the more advanced pupils to 
the larger schools of nearby centres where they can find the 
more advanced opportunities that they need. 
This was the plan developed by Hillegas, while Com- 
missioner of Education of Vermont;?° and such a plan 
has recently been advocated in the report of the Indiana 
State Survey.”° 
“A satisfactory system would provide elementary 
schools within easy reach of all children, a number of 
junior high schools properly located, and a smaller number 
of senior high schools so situated as to cover a still larger 
area. The elementary schools would thus be so coérdi- 
nated and articulated with junior and senior high schools 
that, with a minimum of difficulty, a pupil, having passed 
through the neighborhood elementary school could without 
interruption continue his education in good high schools.”

be used both in connection with that just explained and as

that of alternation of subjects. The recently published

  A pupil entering in 1923 would get, in the next four years the 
opportunities enclosed by lines; one entering in 1924 would get in the 
next four years the opportunities, not enclosed. Not less than four 
units of work must be followed each year,
-P-A-G-E-169
  
CORRELATION OF COURSES 159 
Graduation depends on the completion of the required courses 
and sufficient electives to make 16 units, including at least two major 
subjects of 3 units each, and 2 minors of two units each. 
An unfortunate omission in this tabulation is physical education— 
doubtless an oversight. 
A third means of decreasing the number of subjects 
that need to be taught in any one year is to distinguish 
carefully between subjects that are necessarily sequential, 
such as the first years of a foreign language, and the 
beginning of mathematics; and those that are only con- 
ventionally sequential, such as the advanced classes of 
Latin, or algebra and geometry, succeeding general mathe- 
matics, or the different grades of English, the social sci- 
ences and history units. In general, preparatory courses 
which are of value only if advanced courses are taken, 
should be avoided. Preliminary or “ first ”’ courses should 
be of value even if no further work in the subject is taken. 
Some of the college preparatory courses can be 
arranged in three-year cycles. In the practical or applied 
subjects—industrial arts, home economics, commercial 
arts, physical education, art, and the like—there is little 
difficulty in the development of projects calling for what- 
ever grade of ability the individual pupils possess. 
The Correlation of Courses Aids the Less Able Indi- 
viduals——Much generally desirable skill, knowledge, and 
appreciation that might be unintelligible or unattractive to 
a pupil if organized in a course by itself, may become very 
meaningful and satisfying if organized as a component 
part of an applied course, such as shop-mathematics or an 
applied-art course. Such experiences may be stimulating 
to many pupils who find in them much aid in comprehend- 
ing other subjects of their curriculum ; whereas more gen- 
eral courses in science, art, or mathematics might arouse 
yery little enthusiasm,  
-P-A-G-E-170
160 WHAT IS THE CURRICULUM TRYING 
Available knowledge regarding individual pupils should 
be utilized. 
In general, secondary schools need to know and to 
utilize the knowledge regarding each individual that might 
be made available through records of elementary school 
marks in his various subjects, through general intelligence- 
tests, tests for motor codrdination, tests of visual acuity, 
auditory acuity. 
Such knowledge should be used in connection with the 
determined school policy concerning the rigidity and 
selectiveness of elective courses, and the vocational or 
other demands for reasonable outcomes of various courses. 
Thus if success in advanced Latin is known to require an 
LQ. of 115 -++ on the part of the pupil (and if this policy 
be considered final), then pupils with less than 115 I.Q. 
may well be refused permission to take the subject. If 
school marks indicate that arithmetic has always been 
peculiarly difficult for a pupil, he may be refused permis- 
sion to elect algebra, if taught in the conventional manner. 
If a girl has very defective hearing, she may be refused 
permission to study advanced stenography. It may well 
be, however, that the courses as taught are unreasonably 
selective, and such knowledge may be a basis for a recon- 
struction of the courses. 
Conversely, tests and records may indicate peculiar 
native abilities, and so help the guidance of pupils’ elections. 
Each maladjustment of pupil and curriculum is a chal- 
lenge to find the point of contact; e.g., the bright pupil who 
lacks persistency, the pupil who does well in some subjects 
and poorly in others, the pupil who works earnestly but 
fails in all of his subjects, etc. Further consideration is 
given to this recommendation under Principles X and XI.
-P-A-G-E-171
CHAPTER IX 
HOW SHOULD THE SCHOOL CONNECT WITH 
LIFE? 
Preliminary statement.—In the explanation of the first 
principle, it has been emphasized that the curriculum is a 
controlled environment representing and, to an extent, 
duplicating all educative life situations. But there are 
other educative instruments and agents that are potent in 
children’s lives. 
One fundamental problem of the curriculum is, there- 
fore, to codperate fully with those educative agencies that 
can be approved, and to guide or offset the activities of 
those that cannot be approved. 
SECOND PRINCIPLE 
THE SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAM OF STUDIES MUST BE 
SO CONCEIVED AND OPERATED AS TO REENFORCE, GUIDE, 
AND DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF PUPILS, BOTH WITHIN THE 
SCHOOL, AND IN RELATION TO OTHER EDUCATIONAL ACTIVI- 
TIES OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL. 
The Need for Reénforcement and Guidance of Activi- 
ties in Most Situations Involving Children’s Activities 
Raises Little Question—For school activities the main 
responsibility is the school’s. School officials should get 
what codperation they can from the home, the civic organi- 
zations, and other agencies, to stimulate interest and effort 
in school work, and to give social approval for success in 
it. The school in turn should be alert to capitalize all out- 
of-school interests and activities of the pupils. Such influ- 
161 
2 as a 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
    162 SCHOOL CONNECT WITH LIFE 
ence as the school may exert over the pupil during his 
activities outside of school, will largely depend upon the 
extent to which it encourages the precise practice of desir- 
able forms of activity in the place of those that are 
not desirable. 
How much responsibility the school should take is of 
course influenced by the capacity and willingness of other 
agencies to accept the responsibility : a high school, receiv- 
ing children of immigrants or of Kentucky mountaineers 
would have to direct such activities as table-manners and 
personal hygiene to an extent that would be quite unnec- 
essary in a community of greater culture. 
Some types of behavior and attitude, such as courtesy 
and tolerance, are so certainly right forms that the school 
is bound to reénforce, guide, and direct most actively the 
right, as against the neutral or wrong attitude or behavior. 
Some types are so certainly wrong, such as dishonesty or 
priggishness, that the school is bound to discourage them, 
and to substitute right forms for them. But there are 
many economic and social questions that society can settle 
only by trial and error. To direct pupils toward “ final 
solutions ” of such questions, in the sense of indoctrinating 
them, is intolerable. In the sense that the encouragement 
of an attitude of open-mindedness, of a tendency to see all 
sides of a question before making a decision, is directing 
pupils toward final solutions of difficult questions, this 
function of the school is indisputable. 
1. Before All Else, Pupils Should be Prepared “To Do 
Better Those Desirable Things that They Will Perform 
Anyway.” 1—The task that the school faces begins here 
*Briggs, T. H.: The Junior High School, p. 157, Houghton 
Mifflin Co., 1920.  
-P-A-G-E-173
  
PRESENT DESIRABLE ACTIVITIES 163 
and now in the actual world of realities. The pupil already 
has many needs that will follow him throughout life. To 
neglect these definite, known needs while trying to foster 
some “higher” and often illusory activities, is truly a 
will-o’-the-wisp chase. This is, indeed, the fundamental 
conception underlying the recommendations of the 
National Commission on the Reorganization of Second- 
ary Education. 
The physical welfare of each one, and the imposition of 
standards of sanitation to protect the community health 
are certain to be problems all pupils meet. 
Everyone must inform himself and communicate his 
thoughts through reading, writing, reporting, questioning. 
Unspecialized activities almost universal among intelligent 
people include computation, graphical and pictorial repre- 
sentation, musical appreciation, familiarity with common 
mechanical and electrical devices. Further education, both 
formal and informal, depends on one’s command of funda- 
mental knowledges and skills. 
Family life and home membership, the earning of 
income and its expenditure, the activities involved in civic 
participation, the use of leisure for self-improvement and 
for harmless enjoyments, all are of primary importance in 
determining the opportunities to be offered by the second- 
ary school. 
To Reinforce Present Desirable Activities is the Most 
Important, Task of the School.—What one does with his 
life depends on his habits, attitudes, ideals, inherent ten- 
dencies, and on his environment throughout life. The 
school can affect the future environment only indirectly, 
but it surely should do what it can now to build up desir- 
able habits, attitudes, and ideals, and so to modify the 
original tendencies that each one’s ethical character may  
-P-A-G-E-174
    
164 SCHOOL CONNECT WITH LIFE 
best cope with the inevitable experiences that do now, and 
will in the future, confront all. 
By adapting itself to this immediate task of meeting 
known certain needs of present and future, the secondary 
school curriculum makes certain that both the individual 
and the community will gain, and that the inevitable activi- 
ties of people will be performed better. But to accomplish 
this effectively, the curriculum must include, not only the 
facts, processes, and principles abstracted from the activi- 
ties of life; it must contain the very activities that the life 
prepared for contains, as little changed in adaptation as 
possible. The likelihood that mere statements of principles 
and precepts on general methods of work will be applied in 
extraschool situations, if their application to such situa- 
tions is not practised first in school, is very remote. 
Inglis Discusses in Connection With Values of Sub- 
jects Four Fallacies Too Frequently Overlooked.—In 
assuming that abilities and knowledges resulting from a 
study are directly and immediately applicable in certain 
phases of activity in life, there is frequently one or more 
of the following fallacies : ? 
(1) The failure to recognize a distinction between 
(a) fields of knowledge or skill which are of inestimable 
value to society and to civilization in their extended 
development through relatively few specialists, and (b) 
fields of knowledge or skill which are directly valuable for 
all or a majority of individuals. 
(2) The failure to distinguish between values of pro- 
duction and values of consumption, between values of 
accomplishment and values of utilization. Many subjects 
of study which are of almost universal value from the

392, Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918.
-P-A-G-E-175
  
FALLACIES OFTEN OVERLOOKED 165 
viewpoint of a development of efficiency in consumption, 
utilization, and appreciation, have but very restricted value 
from the viewpoint of a development of efficiency in pro- 
duction and accomplishment. 
(3) A failure to distinguish between certain and con- 
tingent values, based on the probability that circumstances 
will occur in the lives of given individuals, in which speci- 
fied kinds of knowledge or skill may be of service. 
(4) A failure to distinguish between the values attach- 
ing to certain parts only of any given subject, and the 
values attaching to the whole related field of knowledge 
as organized into a logical system. 
2. The Secondary School Curriculum Should “ Reveal 
To Pupils Higher Types of Activities, and Make Them 
Both Desirable and, to an Extent, Possible.” >—Many or- 
dinary life-activities of individuals and of communities are 
not on as high a plane as may well be desired ; they need not 
only to be improved, but to be supplemented by new and 
better forms of activities. One task of the high school 
is, therefore, to lead pupils to know and practice more 
games and hygienically better forms of physical exercise, 
than they might otherwise enjoy; to appreciate and de- 
mand higher standards of neighborhood and municipal 
sanitation than those now in practice; to acquire the 
power to present the results of their thinking in orderly, 
pleasing and convincing fashion to audiences; to contrib- 
ute to their homes greater refinement and superior culture 
than they otherwise would; to appreciate the social impli- 
cations of their vocations ; to be positive contributors and 
leaders in some civic activities; to enjoy and prefer such 
books, pictures, and music as represent high ideals of sen- 
"Briggs, T. H.: The Junior High School, p. 157, Houghton 
Mifflin Co., 1920.    
-P-A-G-E-176
    166 SCHOOL CONNECT WITH LIFE 
timent and workmanship ; and to adopt for themselves and 
demand for others, the highest possible standards of un- 
selfish service. . 
To be artistic or “higher,” an experience must be 
appealing. The person who is able to be appealed to in as 
many socially harmless ways as possible, and to as great an 
extent as possible, is most fortunate. It is to broaden 
the appreciations of activities, to make more discriminat- 
ing the choices and enjoyment of activities in terms of 
their functions, that the high school must strive. 
There is, of course, a very real need to separate the 
truly higher forms of activity from the mere shallow 
pretences that are attributes of “‘ High Society,” the out- 
comes of excessive leisure. Graceful carriage may be 
a higher form of activity than walking erectly, but a 
studied “aristocratic ” pose may be insolent. The fussi- 
ness of household decoration and regimen is merely a 
symptom of the decadence of the home as a place where 
useful activities take place.* 
The school will best make such higher activities desir- 
able by placing the pupils in environments where they are 
socially approved. We would fail to include a very benefi- 
cent and desirable influence if we did not recognize the 
importance of admiration and imitation of certain man- 
ners, courtesies, attitudes, and ideals, that the socially 
more favored groups do frequently typify. The urbanity, 
unwillingness to offend, kindly frankness, unostentatious 
dress and action, agreeable voices, chivalrous treatment 
of the weak and unfortunate, scorn of deceit, stoical 
behavior in personal discomfort, self-sacrifice in time of 
danger, and all that is meant by the phrase “ noblesse

oblige,” are very potent influences in the informal edu- 
cation that both children and adults get from their social 
environments, 
A distinction should be made between a desire for 
refinement and for the manners and attitudes characteris- 
tic of “good breeding” on the one hand, and on the 
other the opportunities to learn the knowledge and man- 
ners, and to develop the interests and ideals characteristic 
of “ gentle-folk.” The former comes chiefly through inti- 
mate contacts with those who possess these higher forms 
of activity; the latter can be obtained from the curricu- 
lum, but only if the drive is present. It would be futile 
to try to superimpose these refinements on pupils who 
have not first come to appreciate that courtesy and mod- 
esty are not synonymous with cowardice and effeminacy. 
The core-curriculum—the prescribed courses in literature, 
composition, art, music, civics, science, physical training 
—permits pupils to come in contact with higher types of 
activities in several fields. Dependence must be had on 
the elective courses for most of the intensive experiences 
leading to higher activities. 
APPLICATION OF SECOND PRINCIPLE 
A. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
1. The Traditional School Program of Studies Has 
to a Considerable Extent Put Emphasis on Things Apart 
from Community Life.—Secondary school officers have 
followed commonly a reasoning that was plausible 
enough. Cultured people characteristically have certain 
formal knowledge and skills; therefore, to give children 
culture, the school should give them the same formal train- 
ing. The argument for mental training has been in large 
part mere rationalization to justify the teaching of a con- 
12 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 SCHOOL CONNECT WITH LIFE 
ventional curriculum of subject-matter that had little in- 
trinsic justification. But general mental training from 
experiences that are of little direct value is extremely 
improbable.® The learned reaction and the reaction called 
for in any new situation must be very similar, for trans- 
fer of training to be probable. 
The curriculum has in the past frequently neglected 
activities that pupils do perform anyway. Current liter- 
ature, written reports of practical situations, caring for a 
gasoline engine, purchasing clothes, selecting one’s food, 
balancing one’s budget, and similar practical activities have 
been subordinated to analysis of classics, “ creative litera- 
ture,” Avogadro’s hypothesis, embroidering underwear, 
solving examples in complex fractions, and similar activi- 
ties of much value for some pupils sometimes, but not 
generally of immediate importance. On the other hand, 
the school has in some cases given abundant practice in 
activities that many pupils already do quite well enough— 
penmanship, oral reading, posturing, “fixing up” for 
parties; or, what is even less excusable, practice in doing 
what used to be, but is no longer done, by the majority of 
intelligent people—extensive reading of Victorian authors, 
drafting dress patterns, embellishing conversation with 
Latin and Greek phrases. 
In general, the more practical subjects have been less 
frequently divorced from life-needs than abstract subjects. 
In the commercial subjects, and to a larger extent in art, 
home economics, and industrial arts, there have been spo- 
radic attempts to base school practice on actual procedures 
in the world outside the school. In formal science, in his- | 
tory, and in choral music, however, there has been too fre- 
quently the effort to direct the pupils’ learning toward 
* Cf. Chapter VII supra.  
-P-A-G-E-179
SOCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL SELECTION 169 
things that a few specialists do, or toward artificial ideals, 
rather than toward better practice in what they are going 
to do, anyway. 
Teachers of the newer subjects unfortunately do not 
always typify the refinements either in appearance or in 
manners that generally distinguish teachers of the tradi- 
tional subjects. The teachers of the more practical subjects 
frequently come from environments that lack the abundant 
leisure and social incentive which are the most powerful 
factors in developing this refinement of manners and 
appearance. 
There is frequently apparent a superior refinement; 
better taste, a greater consideration for others, among 
pupils of the last years of the high school who are studying 
Latin or art, than among those who are taking commercial 
branches or science. The obvious but wholly unjustified 
assumption, frequently made, is that this refinement is a 
product of the studies. The more probable explanation is 
the importance of social traditions in leading those of 
superior culture to elect the traditional subjects, and the 
selective power of these subjects, because of their very 
remoteness from applicability, to eliminate all who have 
little social urge, or who demand practical results for 
their efforts.* ; 
While we have no method of measuring the social 
superiority of those who elect Latin and mathematics, a 
recent study by Powers indicates that only four students 
from the lowest quartile as compared with twenty-seven 
from the highest, of a general intelligence distribution, 
°Cf. Thorndike, E. L.: “Mental Discipline in High School 
Studies.” Journal Education Psychology, Jan.-Feb., 1924.

School Subjects.” The School Review, v. xxx, No. 6, June, 1922.   
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  170 SCHOOL CONNECT WITH LIFE 
elected third- and fourth-year Latin. Modern foreign lan- 
guages show a similar but less marked tendency to attract 
students from the highest quartiles. General science, phys- 
ics, and chemistry seem to be more popular with the 
students of highest ability. Domestic arts was elected by 
nearly twice as many pupils in the lowest quartiles as in the 
highest. All commercial subjects also were popular with 
the lowest quartile students. 
Frequently secondary schools are adversely criticized 
because pupils are frivolous, because they seek crude forms 
of enjoyment, are rough, noisy, undignified, adopt extreme 
and unbecoming fashions, prefer to pose as “ men of the 
world ” and worldly-wise women. This criticism is gener- 
ally quite unfair, for certainly the secondary school does 
not intentionally encourage these less worthy activities and 
attitudes. The search for new experiences so natural for 
adolescents, together with the approvals found in the social 
groups—family, neighborhood—and those implied by 
newspaper-publicity and magazine-literature, are influences 
too strong for even the most effective secondary school to 
offset entirely. 
Nevertheless, the school may properly be challenged to 
show in what ways it is endeavoring to compete with the 
“cheaper” and “ flashier” approvals and interests, by a 
program of appealing activities, interests, and approvals 
controlled by itself and by the more refined elements of 
the community. One must recognize that the high school 
by its neglect does sometimes virtually encourage some 
pupils to do worse those things that they will perform 
anyway ; lower types of activities are sometimes revealed 
in the high school and made desirable to some degree. 
Thus bitter rivalry, personal dishonesty, selfish pride, 
priggishness, emotional orgies, savage tabus, unhealthy
-P-A-G-E-181
MORE PROGRESSIVE PRACTICES 171 
sex-consciousness, too frequently bring rewards of social 
approval from some group or other within the school. 
In judging the success of the secondary school in this 
field, one should compare the actual interests and activities 
of pupils and graduates, with those of young men and 
women of similar social background and intelligence who 
go to work in factories, stores, and offices instead of attend- 
ing secondary school. No judgment based on a com- 
parison of the pupils of today and of a decade or more 
ago, or based on any absolute standard can probably 
be fair. 
2. There is Much Activity Apparent Among Pro- 
gressive Educational Practitioners Looking to the 
Redirection of the Secondary School Curriculum.—The 
objectives set up by the National Commission have been 
generally accepted, in principle at least, by a great major- 
ity of progressive secondary school principals, as was 
shown by the report of the Committee on Curriculum of 
the National Association of Secondary School Principals 
(March, 1921).8 This showed that of 142 principals 
responding to the question of the validity of the objectives, 
138 approved them. This approval is a very different thing 
from making them function; yet it does indicate that the 
schools’ officers are ready, if they can be shown how, to 
put the principles into effect. 
The earnest effort to modify the secondary school pro- 
gram of studies purposefully is seen in the introduction 
of several subjects that have been added recently. Com- 
munity civics, general science, fine and practical arts, 
physical education, and appreciation-courses in English, 
music, all contribute much toward the attainment of 
* Fifth Year Book, Nat'l Ass’n of Secondary School Principals,1921.  
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 SCHOOL CONNECT WITH LIFE 
the objectives—health, home-membership, use of leisure, 
and the rest. 
Junior high school courses in such school arts as com- 
position, reading, spelling, functional grammar, arithme- 
tic, and the like, are frequently affected by such scientific 
studies as are explained in Part II. The newer textbooks 
based on scientific studies of actual social practices are 
helpful. While schoolmen must look to the educational 
experts who have the skill and resources for careful inves- 
tigation, nevertheless progressive schools are everywhere 
endeavoring, in the more restricted fields and through less 
precise methods, to discover what children and adults are 
going to do anyway, in order that the school may help 
them perform those activities better. 
Within the curriculum, the problem of wasteful dupli- 
cation has been increasing with the greater socialization of 
purposes and contents. When algebra was algebra, French 
was French, and Latin was Latin, the experiences may 
have been of little value, but at least there was a minimum 
of duplication. But now that reorganized mathematics, 
science, foreign languages, English, art, home economics, 
and industrial arts, all emphasize the civic and general 
informational aims, there is very necessary the application 
of sound principles of reénforcement, codrdination, and 
correlation, if we are to make the instruction count for as 
much as possible. 
It is customary for progressive schools to give much 
attention to encouraging pupils to codperate with city 
departments and civic organizations, to respect estab- 
lished law, religion and other “ settled ” questions, and to 
reénforce and direct many other activities that the home 
and community also often endeavor to perform. In most 
communities there are other social organizations besides
-P-A-G-E-183
  
MORE PROGRESSIVE PRACTICES 173 
the school that are endeavoring to bring about the same 
types of behavior as the school. The Boy Scouts and 
Girl Scouts, the churches, libraries, public playgrounds, 
and the Junior Red Cross, for example, are frequently 
reénforced both directly by teaching or codperative efforts, 
and indirectly, in that the school by; its own means stim- 
ulates and rewards the same forms of behavior that the 
extraschool organizations do. 
Other agencies, such as the moving-picture houses, 
dance-halls, “ parties,” are less certainly educative. The 
opportunity of the school to guide, through approval and 
disapproval, through competition and codperation, is 
clear ; but when and to what extent it is feasible to do so, 
isnot clear. In the case of reading, music, and other such 
forms of behavior, the school has frequently overshot its 
mark, and has simply missed its opportunity to guide, 
because it sought a standard, either too high or too 
artificial; that is, it has tried to guide into or reénforce 
lines of activity that general social taboo or neglect had 
already closed. 
Some secondary schools have succeeded to a marked 
degree in influencing pupils’ out-of-school activities by 
some or all of the following means: 
(a) Through codperation with the homes reached 
through parent-teacher associations, visiting teachers, con- 
ferences with parents at the school, circular letters, infor- 
mational report-cards, they make the home aware of the 
problems, and make it possible for parents to become part- 
ners of the school. Rural-school home-economics courses 
have sometimes been conducted in homes of the pupils,® 
agriculture is frequently taught by the instructor on the

York State, 1915.   
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  174 WHAT SCHOOLS CAN DO 
parents’ farms;?° on the other hand, parents have been 
brought into the school to give demonstrations in cooking 
and agriculture. 
(b) Schools frequently codperate with the Y. M. C. A. 
(particularly through the organization of Hi-Y Clubs), 
with the churches’ boys’ clubs, public libraries, and some- 
times even with the management of moving-picture houses, 
(c) By conducting late afternoon, evening, and Sat- 
urday activities at the school-building, in the gymnasiums, 
auditoriums, or on playgrounds, and permitting the use of 
the building for many community activities—dances, club- 
meetings, orchestral rehearsals, and the like—the influ- 
ence of the school is frequently extended and made more 
effective. 
(d) By forming advisory committees of parents to 
consider what new courses might be offered, or what 
existing courses might be improved, the needs of the home 
for better management, for beautification, and for im- 
provement of dietary, hygiene, etc., have been understood 
and remedial measures taken; and the sufficiency of home 
training in many lines has been made clear to school 
administrators and teachers. 
The greatest advancement in taste, and in desires and 
powers results from courses that emphasize activities 
rather than mastery of facts and technique. 
B. WHAT CAN BE DONE BY THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
There Are in Every Community Many More Oppor- 
tunities for Codperation Than the School Can Possibly 
Utilize—There should be a continuous survey of both the 
local and the wider community to discover approved

-P-A-G-E-185
  OPPORTUNITIES FOR COOPERATION 175 
movements that surely should be supported, problems that 
the school can help solve, and to ascertain what codpera- 
tions are no longer vital. A faculty-committee on public 
relations is peculiarly valuable in this field, as are parent- 
teacher associations. By exploiting these practical inter- 
ests of civic importance in which the socially intelligent 
and active adults are interested, social activities of pupils 
both in school and out of school can thus be utilized, 
guided, reénforced, and directed. 
In attempting to guide the reading, amusements, and 
tastes of high school boys and girls, there are needed com- 
mon sense, patience, and faith in the adolescent’s ability 
to select, to a considerable extent, experiences appropriate 
to himself. Stimulation and familiarity with higher forms 
of literature, music, and art are important ; but the teacher’s 
respect for honest differences in taste is essential. Coercion 
is of little value, and many frequently foster distaste for 
experiences that under skilful guidance might have been 
pleasurable. To study and appreciate the works of Shakes- 
peare, Galsworthy, Shaw, Wells, Cervantes, Kipling, Con- 
rad, Rembrandt, Da Vinci, Maxfield Parrish, Tschaikow- 
sky, or Chopin when these names are “ before the public” 
as they are right now, is easier and more effective than to 
follow some logical or chronological grouping as laid out 
in a syllabus. Knowledge about these creators brings 
satisfactions each time one reads a paper, or converses 
with people of culture. 
In the field of social evolution, with which social 
studies deal directly, and other subjects less directly, we 
have problems of such vital interest to great numbers of 
people that they are most difficult of solution. Teachers 
with convictions as to the closed or open shop, socialism, 
the protective tariff, the federal government’s control in 
education, the sanctity of the decisions of the Supreme 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  176 SCHOOL CONNECT WITH LIFE 
Court, sometimes tend to teach children their answer, either 
by approving a desired reply, or by waxing sarcastic at 
an unwelcome attitude. To this great mass of disputed 
questions, society has no final answer. One person’s phi- 
losophy may make him tend toward the one side, another’s 
to the other. But to the extent that teachers are intelligent 
and helpful members of an evolutionary democracy, they 
must themselves keep open minds, and certainly must 
encourage pupils to develop such impulses to avoid “‘stereo- 
typed solutions ” that they can and will bring to the prob- 
lems a sympathetic open-mindedness, which makes them 
look for the other side’s point of view before becoming 
positively convinced. 
The capitalization of previous and current educational 
experiences of children is difficult with class procedure, 
but very important. Individual instruction, as in the 
Winnetka and Dalton plans, meets this problem some- 
what, but may be open to other objections. The chief 
objection is, of course, the lack of education in social 
adjustments. At Winnetka, there is definite effort to 
offset this lack by providing for the many social phases 
of the classroom procedure. Bobbitt points out that some 
out-of-school activities like dressmaking are easily trans- 
ferred to the school; but that others such as cooking are 
transferred with great difficulty, because the number of 
identical elements in home and school situations is bound 
to be small. 
One means of codrdinating the school’s efforts and util- 
izing extraschool experiences, is through launching a 
series of social problems; such as care of public property, 
thrift, safety, study of the locality, its industries, stores, 
parks, institutions, property values, and the like, to which 
each subject studied can contribute. In this way, the work
-P-A-G-E-187
  
PROBABLE DESIRABLE ACTIVITIES 177 
of each class would reénforce that of all others. A more 
thoroughgoing radical procedure is to set up series of 
curriculum-experiences with distinctive purposes, to organ- 
ize courses in terms of these aims, and so to avoid much 
indefiniteness and unnecessary duplication. (See Appli- 
cation, Principles III-IV.) 
The Most Probable Desirable Activities of Life Should 
be Discovered and Precise Practice Given Preparatory for 
Doing Them Well.—To teach pupils to do more effec- 
tively those desirable activities that they are now doing 
anyway, is the most important single task of the school; 
first, because what they learn now to do well or poorly 
determines what they will do throughout life far more 
certainly than any learning for later activity can do; and 
second, because self-activity in modifying behavior, ideals, 
and knowledge can be stimulated and directed best if the 
outcomes are immediate. To practice typewriting, sewing, 
speaking French, drawing, writing compositions, in order 
that one may some time in the uncertain future perform 
the real activities purposely, demands a moral foresight 
and strength of will that few adolescents or even adults 
in the midst of a busy life can have. Deferred values are 
rightly present in all school activities, and pupils are 
properly made conscious of them ; but there must be present 
also more immediate goals—letters to be typed for the 
parents’ association, a dress to be altered for a little sister, 
a French play to be given, a social occasion involving danc- 
ing, editorials for the school paper, and the like—if the 
activities are to be purposeful and earnestly carried on. 
Credit toward graduation for educative out-of-school activ- 
ities is a very effective means of encouraging pupils to do 
better what they are now doing.
-P-A-G-E-188
  178 SCHOOL CONNECT WITH LIFE 
Typical of the provisions for giving credit towards 
high school graduation for educational work done outside 
the school is the following excerpt from the Ohio High 
School Standards, 1923 revision, pp. 58 and 59: 
“ Qut-of-School Projects. In order to be a feature of any 
curriculum the out-of-school projects must meet the following 
conditions : 
“ Beginning in the school year 1922-23, one-fourth unit of high 
school credit will be granted for the successful completion of out-of- 
school projects, carried on during the student’s high school course, 
under the direction of the Agricultural Extension Division of Ohio 
State University or under school direction. The following’are standard 
projects that will be recognized: 
Food Club Projects—One for each of four years. 
Under Extension Division plan 70 points is a minimum for 
success. 
Clothing Club Projects—One for each of four years. 
70 points necessary for credit. 
Livestock Projects— 
Pig Club—(a) Market or breeding. 
(b) Sow and litter. 
Calf Club—(a) Beef Calf. 
(b) Dairy Calf. 
Sheep Club. 
Poultry Raising. 
Egg Laying. 
Crops— 
Potato. 
Garden. 
Corn. 
Any other type of well organized project, plan of which has been 
approved by the Department of Education. 
GENERAL RULES 
“1, No high school credit for any one of the above shall exceed one- 
fourth unit. 
“2. Not over one unit of credit may be earned by any pupil during 
the high school course. 
“3. A pupil may not be granted additional credit for duplicating a 
project. 
“4. A pupil may not receive credit for more than one project in one 
year. A project started in the summer preceding entrance to high 
school may be counted for high school credit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  THREE STEPS MAY BE ADVISED 179 
“5. Credit may be granted only to students who have received a certi- 
ficate of achievement from the Agricultural Extension Department 
or from the school authorities who may be promoting recognized 
junior projects. 
“6. A project carried on in connection with a Smith-Hughes voca- 
tional-agriculture or home-economics department shall receive only 
vocational-agriculture or home-economics credit and not club- 
credit also. 
“7, If a pupil is carrying on a vocational-agriculture or home-eco- 
nomics project of one type and a club-project of a different type, 
he or she shall have credit only for the vocational-agriculture or 
home-economics project.” 
Only such subjects as can and will be so redirected 
as to conform to this principle should be either prescribed 
or advised for large numbers of pupils of secondary school 
age. This situation can, be only partly met by introducing 
new courses specifically planned to meet the newly recog- 
nized needs. To meet it more adequately, the entrenched 
subjects must be modified to the same end. 
Three Steps May be Advised for Studying the Cur- 
riculum to Bring it Into Accord with This Principle— 
(1) A good point of departure for such curriculum-studies 
is to justify to a critical group such subject-matter and 
method as it is proposed to retain in each course, by show- 
ing that each learning-situation corresponds to actual life- 
situations. Such subject-matter as it is proposed to retain 
should be checked, up against the four fallacies stated by 
Inglis, to determine the relative likelihood that it will be 
worth while for large numbers of pupils. 
(2) Constructively, it is most valuable to write the 
course of study in terms of such pupil activities as will 
surely function. Examples of such activities proposed 
by Bobbitt follow: 
» Bobbitt, Franklin: Curriculum Making in Los Angeles, Univ. of 
Chicago, June, 1922,
-P-A-G-E-190
  
  180 SCHOOL CONNECT WITH LIFE 
“Pupils will read rapidly for the story value certain novels, or 
books of travel.” 
“The primary experience in using history for general training 
is reading it—abundantly—with enjoyment—under normal reading 
conditions.” 
“Economic surveys, together with the fact-organization and 
-presentation, done by the students for responsible community purposes, 
should provide much experience on the work-level.” 
“ The ability to do civic thinking and to arrive at civic judgments 
is to be developed in youth in ways and under conditions as nearly like 
those in which it later is to function during adulthood as practicable.” 
“The ability to act in civic ways is to be developed in youth by 
acting in the ways desired—except for a few effectuating functions 
like voting, paying taxes, doing jury service, etc., which, clearly, imma- 
ture youths can not be trusted to perform.” 
“Pupils should do part-time work along with the adults of their 
community in performing tasks involved in directorial and inspector- 
ial civic functions, as necessary concrete civic experience. (Work 
experience.) ” 
“The basis of all science learning must be abundant experience 
with the concrete realities, 
1. Working with them. Using them. Controlling them. 
2. Play that involves them. 
3. Observations of them. 
4. Abundant revealing reading.” 
(3) Immediate attainable goals to be reached by 
pupils through their own activities should be set up. 
Teachers who desire such zeal as football candidates show 
in doing the hard disagreeable drill-work in getting 
ready for “ the season,’”’ may well borrow the methods of 
the football coach in setting up immediate desired goals to 
be attained by pupils through their own activities. Such 
goals may be determined by social standards, as in hand- 
writing or computation, by the arbitrary fixing of stand- 
ards by teachers, as is frequently done for typewriting, or 
by a judgment of the pupils regarding the reasonable 
speed and accuracy of filling in a map or answering a 
true-false test, or surviving elimination-contests for four- 
minute talks, and the like. 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
DISCRIMINATING ENCOURAGEMENT 181 
Secondary school faculties should more generally keep 
in touch with all scientific studies ; particularly should each 
subject group of teachers evaluate or check the findings 
and recommendations of scientists, against needs and work 
of their own classes. Such scientific studies as are pre- 
sented in Part II should give administrators and teach- 
ers much help in adjusting both the curricula and courses 
of study so as to prepare pupils for definite known activi- 
ties in the field of each objective. 
There is Needed a Discriminating Encouragement of 
Pupils and Teachers Who Carry on Forms of Activity in 
Any Field Accompanied by a Recognition of Reasonable 
Achievement for the Majority of Pupils.—It is peculiarly 
necessary to select as teachers of social study, science, com- 
mercial subjects, household arts, and industrial arts men 
and women of broad scholarship and of natural refinement ; 
such teachers will then transmit a refinement both by per- 
sonal influence and by the interpretation of their subjects. 
Higher forms of activity are not to be sought by having 
pupils elect subjects chosen by those who already have 
superior culture, but by modifying the subjects that 
pupils of less mental power and less social selection do 
take, so that they will provide experiences leading to fur- 
ther activities, involving higher forms of appreciations 
and behavior. 
Subjects that have great cultural value should appear 
in every pupil’s curriculum; but the inclusion of such cul- 
tural courses should be based on clear-cut analyses of what 
constitutes the difference between “ good enough ” health 
and superior health, reasonable command of fundamentals 
and superior command, ordinary home membership and a 
higher type of home membership, adequate vocational 
skills and an appreciative vocational efficiency, honest duti- 
   
-P-A-G-E-192
  
  182 SCHOOL CONNECT WITH LIFE 
ful citizenship and intelligent aggressive participation in 
matters of civic welfare, harmless enjoyment of leisure 
and productive uses of leisure-time. In terms of such 
analyses, pupils should include some courses that promise 
most return in higher types of activities, according to 
their natural endowments and previous experiences and 
interests. 
Such a well-rounded program of social and intellectual 
activities,* encouraged and controlled by the school’s fac- 
ulty as carried on in the Lincoln, Nebraska, High School, 
can be duplicated in large part by most secondary schools 
that set themselves to the task. At Lincoln, a positive 
program under a faculty-committee on student affairs has 
done away with narrow cliques and fraternities ; the com- 
mittee has fostered vital assemblies, the student councils, 
the formation of new clubs and societies in accordance 
with regulations adopted by the Board of Education. 
There are many departmental clubs; such as Mummers 
(a dramatic society), Writers’ Club, Meristem (nature 
club), Chemistry Club, Glee Club, and the like. And there 
are many general clubs and societies; such as the Forum, 
All Girls’ League, Hi-Y, School Social Hours, Students’ 
Standard Club, and others.

CHAPTER X 
WHAT ORGANIZATION BEST ACHIEVES 
OUR ENDS? 
' THIRD, FOURTH AND FIFTH PRINCIPLES 
Preliminary statement: 
If the program of studies is to do its work adequately, 
there are needed certain guides for its operation. These 
guides deal with its organization and administration, and 
have been already implied. They are, however, so impor- 
tant that they deserve independent statement as formal 
principles to be set up, justified and explained, and their 
application pointed out. 
In the past there have been many more or less satis- 
factory attempts to state the aims or objectives of educa- 
tion. During the last decade our educational philosophers 
and curriculum-experts have passed beyond generaliza- 
tions, to attempts to make specific statements of the needs 
.of education, and of what types of activities must be 
offered to pupils, if the goals set up are to be reached. 
Nevertheless, the great difficulty still remains: it is 
the painful process of putting theory into practice. How, 
the administrator asks, shall we organize and administer 
the offerings of the school that such desiderata as those 
stated in the foregoing principles shall be attained? No 
sure statement can be given. 
The principles stated hereafter, however, should guide 
in making the adjustments. More specifically, the next 
three principles deal with the organization of the second- 
ary school’s offerings, and with provisions and precau- 
tions that must be cared for, if the interests of society and 
of the individual are both to be adequately safeguarded.

184 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
THIRD PRINCIPLE 
THE TOTAL PROGRAM OF STUDIES SHOULD BE BROKEN 
UP INTO CURRICULA, EACH WITH A DEFINITE AIM TOWARD 
GOALS THAT ARE SOCIALLY DESIRABLE, AND THAT OFFER 
COMPLETEST SELF-EXPRESSION TO PARTICULAR TYPES OF 
INDIVIDUALS. 
Curricula Offered Should Correspond to Community 
and Pupil Needs.—What curricula should be offered in a 
given local community will depend upon the character of 
the community and the probable future of its children. In 
an agricultural community, the high school might offer 
several vocational or prevocational agricultural curricula. 
An urban school would doubtless require one or more 
commercial curricula. But in all communities reasonable 
provisions should be made for college preparation, for fur- 
ther general education by means of academic curricula. 
The Core-curriculum.—All of these curricula would 
prescribe some subjects in common, the “ core-curricu- 
lum,” or “ constants.” Thus there would be assured to all: 
(a) A common culture of experiences, ideas, attitudes . 
and ideals; (b) a mastery of minimal essentials of knowl- 
edge and power subjects; e.g., English composition, civil 
government; (c) experience with general data, materials, 
and applications of the specific-subject studies; (d) an 
appreciation of the possibilities of the higher phases of 
desirable activities of many kinds; and (e) a broad basis 
for guiding the choice of each pupil’s special curriculum. 
The core-curriculum is further discussed hereafter. Prin- 
ciples VII, VIII, and IX deal with the core-curriculum. 
Curriculum-prescriptions—Each curriculum would 
prescribe some courses in each year, contributing directly 
to the purposes for which the curriculum was organized. 
Such curriculum-prescriptions, while they have specific
-P-A-G-E-195
  
PRESCRIPTIONS AND ELECTIVES 185 
goals as primary aims, nevertheless would have as their 
major aim the maximum contribution to the curriculum- 
purpose. Thus, business training frequently prescribed in 
the commercial curriculum would not only aim to increase 
the knowledge and skill regarding business procedures, 
but also would stimulate and guide pupils so that they 
would elect wisely, and study purposefully, the variables 
and electives of the later years of this curriculum. 
Curriculum-variables—Curriculum-variables permit 
specialization within a curriculum; thus, an agricultural 
curriculum might offer a choice of sequential courses in 
poultry- or in vegetable-raising. 
Free Electives.—Free elections should be guided by 
teachers or advisers with a view to broadening and deep- 
ening the interests and experiences by which the pupil will 
probably profit to the greatest extent. Thus, pupils who 
have little talent for learning foreign languages or mathe- 
matics should not be advised to elect them just because 
they are traditional high school subjects. 
Just as the curriculum-prescriptions were shown to 
have a general cultural aim as well as a curriculum-aim, 
so the electives, to whatever extent possible, should be 
given a curriculum-aim as well as a cultural aim; thus, a 
home-economics girl who chooses chemistry as a free 
elective, should be permitted and encouraged to empha- 
size, or extend somewhat, the phases of the subject that 
deal with food-adulterations, aniline dyes, and the like. 
And so, dressmaking elected by a commercial pupil offers 
opportunities for curriculum-reénforcement. It is recog- 
nized, of course, that some free electives are quite properly 
so unrelated to the purposes peculiar to a given curricu- 
lum, that any correlation would be forced and futile; for 
example, music elected by a stenography-pupil.
-P-A-G-E-196
    186 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
FOURTH PRINCIPLE 
THE CONTENTS OF CURRICULA AND COURSES OF STUDY 
SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY THEIR PURPOSES, AND THE 
NAMES GIVEN TO THEM SHOULD DESCRIBE AS ACCURATELY 
AS POSSIBLE THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES SOUGHT. 
Curriculum-prescriptions and Curriculum-variables 
Lead to Definite Outcomes.—For every more or less 
homogeneous group of pupils, there are normal, major, 
desirable outcomes which the community should encour- 
age by making available adequate preparation for them. 
Thus, in an urban community, there are sure to be many 
girls and boys of secondary school age who will be aiming, 
at least temporarily, at clerical vocations. For them there 
should be provided, in addition to the core-curriculum, a 
grouping of studies in parallels and sequences,.for serious 
vocational preparation. The courses included as prescrip- 
tions and as curriculum-variables should be such as con- 
tribute directly to vocational preparation; free elections 
may be offered for other purposes. But the specific aims 
of the curriculum, supplementing the general social aim, 
should be apparent from the names and natures of the 
courses of study, peculiar to the curriculum. 
Education is a continuous process; it does not cease 
when a pupil leaves school. For good or for ill, he goes 
right on learning. Secondary education may be compared 
to a stairway onto which nearly all children may step prior 
to adolescence and the legal minimal age for going to 
‘work. At different levels, pupils may leave the stairway, 
and, it is to be hoped, step on other ascending stairways in 
offices, stores, factories, farms, building-trades, homes, 
private schools, and colleges. The secondary school’s func- 
tion is, indeed, to make it possible and probable for them
-P-A-G-E-197
  
APPLICATION PRINCIPLES III-IV 187 
to get off at landings where other opportunities for prog- 
ress may best be obtained. Differentiation of opportunity, 
postponed till after pupils who might have benefited by it, 
have left school in disgust, is well-nigh senseless, though 
it isa very widely recommended procedure—recommended 
in the name of democracy! 
Spaulding’s Conception of Preparation for Life at 
Each Level of School Education—The functions of the 
program of studies of the four-year high school to give the 
best possible preparation of pupils who leave school without 
completing secondary school, was set forth by Spaulding 
in the 1911 Report of the School Committee of Newton, 
Massachusetts. The first of two diagrams, which are too 
complicated to reproduce here, shows the conventional 
grades from primary school to college, surrounded by a 
black line called the “ No Preparation Barrier,’ broken 
only at the top when professionally trained young men 
and women get their chance to apply what they have 
learned, to earning a living. Formal history, grammar, 
classics, mathematics, pure science—all that the Newton 
Schools offered prior to 1905, were of little vocational 
help, except, perhaps, to college graduates. The second 
diagram shows the same range of grades, but the “no 
preparation barrier’ has vanished. At every grade above 
the seventh, the pupil has had opportunity for such voca- 
tional preparation as he can best utilize at that stage 
of development. 
APPLICATION OF THIRD AND FOURTH PRINCIPLES 
A. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
1. The Preparatory Curriculum Has Dominated the 
Program of Studies——The Latin school was a college 
preparatory school. The academy had at first a far
-P-A-G-E-198
    
188 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
i 
broader aim, but later came to be a preparatory school, 
also. The public high schools as they replaced the 
Latin schools and academies, came under the domination 
of the colleges, and the curricula until 1895 or later’ 
were generally mere variations of a linguistic, mathemat- 
ical curriculum.? 
Many schools have enriched their programs of study 
with electives of art, commercial work, manual training, 
household arts, but frequently there has been so much 
preliminary academic prescription that many pupils have 
had no opportunity to take advantage of the electives.? In 
small schools, particularly, there persist foreign-language- 
and-mathematics prescriptions that have minor educa- 
tional significance. Rural high school curricula have 
frequently been differentiated, not by the different pur- 
poses served, but by the quantity of foreign language or 
mathematics prescribed.* 
With the development of the new secondary unit, the 
junior high school, the force of inertia has been so strong 
that mathematics is frequently a general prescription in 
all grades, and a foreign language sometimes the only 
elective.* 
Present terminology and practice are often confusing, 
as the following examples indicate: 
(1) For no other reason than the strength of tradition, 
the college-preparatory curriculum frequently includes

-P-A-G-E-199
TERMINOLOGY CONFUSING 189 
prescribed Latin, although a negligible number of colleges 
now require Latin for admission, and still fewer make 
it a required study in college. 
(2) The general curriculum is often either (a) an 
unjustifiable way of providing for aimless pupils, or (b) 
the preparatory curriculum for advanced educational insti- 
tutions that make no arbitrary entrance-requirements. In 
the first case, it should have no place in the program of 
studies; in the second, it should be called a preparatory . 
curriculum. If it fulfils another function, that of oppor- 
tunity for try-outs for ninth-grade pupils who are not yet 
ready to select a curriculum, then it should be given an 
appropriate name; e.g., a “ guidance-curriculum.” 
(3) The commercial curriculum is frequently an office- 
practice curriculum, sometimes with requirements such as 
algebra or a foreign language, that have no fundamental 
connection with the purposes of the curriculum. 
(4) Similar criticism might be made of the other cur- 
ricula ; in every case there is needed a careful study of the 
relation between the purpose of the curriculum and the 
provisions by means of which it is to be carried out. The 
conventional curriculum ends with the twelfth grade, 
though two-year commercial curricula, Smith-Hughes 
curricula, and postgraduate teacher-training curricula 
are common. 
The terminology for courses of study is not less con- 
fusing, and is more firmly fixed by tradition, even though 
‘the purposes and contents of some courses have been made 
much more intelligible in recent years. As a result, there 
is a lack of definite educational aim at the very point where 
greater definiteness of aim would be effective in modifying 
the teaching so as to cause a better adjustment of pupil to 
environment. If each course aimed.at one main objective, 
then the pupil’s failure to attain one or more of the:sec-
-P-A-G-E-200
eR a ee 
190 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
ondary objectives which are quite properly included in 
addition to the main objective, would not count heavily 
, against him. Thus, a course in art-appreciation might 
encourage skill in representation ; but success in the course 
would be measured primarily by the pupil’s growth in 
, attainment of the chief objectives—desires, habits, and 
powers of appreciation. 
(1) English is a term that covers a group of subjects, 
clearly divided between technic of expression, knowledge 
about the language, and appreciation of literature. 
(2) Mathematics covers the fields of computation, cul- 
tural knowledge and appreciation, and an exact science. 
(3) History is often a social science, a literature-sub- 
ject, a civic-training subject, and a body of chronologically 
sequential facts. 
(4) Science frequently covers the fields of the exact 
science including laboratory-practice, but aims also at civic 
training, health-habits, and sometimes at appreciation of 
the beautiful in nature, and of the cultural significance of 
the history, and applications of science. 
(5) Similarly, courses in art, music, home economics, 
practical arts, frequently lack definite primary goals, for 
which each course as a whole attempts to prepare pupils. 
2. Much More Purposeful Planning of the Program 
Has Been in Evidence in Cities and Districts that Have 
Addressed Themselves to the Problem.—Some cities have 
differentiated high schools containing curricula leading to 
more specific goals within a broad field. Thus Boston and 
New York have commercial high schools, industrial or 
vocational schools, manual-arts schools, academic high 
schools, etc. In other cities, the cosmopolitan high schools 
_are developed, offering within a single administrative unit, 
curricula leading to many different goals. St. Louis, for
-P-A-G-E-201

example, has six four-year schools all offering nearly iden- 
tical curricula and courses of study. 
In smaller cities and districts, the single school is the 
rule; and it sometimes offers a wide range of opportunities

they have not completed the sixth grade. Pupils ready for seventh

SPECIAL TRADE-SCHOOLS 195 
Special Trade-schools Have Defined Their Purposes 
Clearly, and Have Worked Out Curricula and Courses of 
Study to Accomplish These Purposes.—The inclusion of 
real vocational curricula within the cosmopolitan high 
school program of studies is very recent, though practical 
stenographic and bookkeeping courses have been success- 
fully operated for fifteen or twenty years. Special trade- 
schools and special commercial schools have defined the 
purposes of the vocational curricula better, and have been 
less hampered by traditional academic attitudes. 
The announcement of the Lane Technical School of 
Chicago for 1916 © states: ‘‘ The Lane Technical School in 
answer to the insistent demand that the public schools give 
more adequate preparation for making a living as well as a 
life, has broadened the character and scope of its work to 
include the following departments which may in many 
respects be considered separate schools: 
Four-year technical Plumber apprentice 
Two-year technical Summer school 
Prevocational Evening school 
Junior college 
“Tts main department, of course, is the regular four-year high 
school with its technical courses preparing for direct entrance to 
technical colleges. But in consideration of the large number who drop 
out of school prematurely, two-year machine, electrical, mechanical 
drawing, carpentering, pattern-making, and printing vocational courses 
have been introduced. These save for the schools and for skilled labor 
or the professions hundreds annually, who otherwise would drop out 
upon graduation from the eighth grade. Elementary school graduates 
are admitted without examination, and by special permission of the 
superintendent of schools, applicants from parochial and other private 
schools. Students may enter at the beginning of either semester in

September and February, and at other times if they submit evidence of 
satisfactory preparation.” 
In addition the school has added up to 1920 the following Smith- 
Hughes Courses: architecture (4 years), machine-shop practice (2 
years), architectural drawing (2 years), and agriculture (2 years). 
Stuyvesant High School in New York City, in adjusting its cur- 
riculum to meet the demands of its community offers in addition to 
the more conventional curricula, instruction in: 
Qualitative and quantitative analysis. 
Topographical drawing. 
Power-plant drafting. 
Machine-design, ship-design and -construction. 
Instrument-making. 
Milling and building construction. 
Surveying. 
Water-analysis (applied biology).° 
Junior high schools have sometimes been planned as 
prevocational schools, and when they have had real employ- 
ment-problems to face, they have functioned very success- 
fully in this way. 
At the Oliver Ames Junior High School’ at Easton, 
Mass., there was developed in 1912, a State-aided agricul-. 
tural curriculum in codperation with committees of the 
local granges, that not only kept boys in school who would 
otherwise probably have left, but to some extent affected 
agricultural technic on the farms of the community. At 
Solvay, N. Y., Junior High School® the prevocational 
industrial curricula for both boys and girls aroused the 
effort and ambitions of pupils, who were not enthusiastic 
about remaining longer in school, and led to their employ- 
ment in apprenticeship-schools of local concerns.

The tendency for junior high schools in suburban or 
residential districts is, however, to organize their programs 
of studies on the basis of one general curriculum for the 
seventh and eighth grades, with all subjects prescribed in 
the seventh, and with “ variables” elective in the eighth 
grade. In the ninth grade the variables become the bases 
of differentiated curricula. The Pennsylvania State High 
School Manual, 1922, prints a suggested program for 
junior high schools illustrating this principle, which is 
appended in a somewhat modified form so as to relate it to 
the proposed senior high school program. The program 
for the junior high school recommended in the Ohio High 
School Standards (1923 revision) is also given.

Groups II, III, IV to meet pupils’ special needs.

If we subtract from the total of teaching periods which the pro-

teachers or which could be eliminated by alternation of subjects, the 
net number of periods per week would be 83 to 89. “Three teachers 
would handle under normal requirements thirty periods per week 
each, or ninety periods altogether, so the above curriculum falls within 
the possibilities of a three-teacher school.” 
B. WHAT CAN BE DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
A Thoroughgoing Reorganization of the Program of 
Studies is Called For—There are required to carry out 
this principle new purposeful curricula and courses of 
study each with a significant name, and so planned and 
executed that it prescribes nothing that does not contribute 
directly to the fulfilment of the purposes. This statement 
does not imply any underestimate of the many valuable 
supplementary and contingent values such curricula and 
courses would have. 
Not only are there many pupils among those who per- 
sist in the secondary schools, who do not find in the cur- 
ricula or courses of study offered any challenge sufficient 
to arouse their purposeful activity, but also there are groups 
of boys and girls of secondary school age not now in any 
school, many of whom might be attracted to return to high 
school if sufficiently specific and concrete educational cur-

WHAT SCHOOLS CAN DO 203 
ricula were offered. The success of evening high school 
“ short unit courses” gives a hint as to the type of cur- 
ricula that must be developed.# 
The Changes that are Taking Place in Other Educa- 
tional Institutions of Secondary Grade are Worthy of 
Study in this Connection.—In private commercial schools, 
the 902 schools reporting to the Bureau of Education in 
1920 }® enrolled 336,032 students, an increase of 16 per 
cent. over 1918. During the same two years, the general 
commercial (bookkeeping and office practice) “ course ” 
increased. 54 per cent. ; accountancy ‘‘ course,” 87 per cent. ; 
secretarial “ courses,” 66 per cent. ; and salesmanship, 280 
percent. Stenographic courses show a decrease of 17 per 
cent., due partly to the abnormally large enrolments during 
the war period. It is easy to overestimate the importance 
of these figures, of course ; but they do indicate the demand 
for intensive purposeful instruction preparatory for com- 
mercial vocations, a demand that public secondary schools 
should be meeting more adequately than they are generally 
doing at present. 
In 1910, there were 103,369 boys and 15,595 girls 
serving apprenticeships in mechanical trades, skilled fac- 
tory-occupations, dressmaking, and millinery. In industry, 
this older form of apprenticeship is supplemented, and in 
times of labor-shortage, considerably replaced by “ vesti- 
bule-schools,” for rapid training of mature workers in the 
best methods of performing operations, and corporation- 
schools for younger workers who spend one or more years 
combining practical experience with technical and general

Private Commercial and Business Schools,” 1919-20.

  204 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
training. Codperative or part-time schools offer practical 
work in the factory or store, which is alternated week by 
week, or month by month, with technical and general edu- 
cation in public vocational or general high schools. Classes 
conducted by the public-school system in stores, office- 
buildings, or factories, give general and technical training 
to employed boys and girls. 
The adjustments of administration, and of content and 
method found necessary in these schools to give the desired 
instruction, the elimination of all but functional subject- 
matter, the uses of dramatization and of project-methods 
to give the desired concrete experiences, the setting up of 
definite goals to be attained through short units of work, 
have lessons that the public high school administrators and 
teachers may well learn. The study of these types of educa- 
tion is peculiarly necessary as legislation raises the age for 
leaving school, so that the boys and girls cannot be elimi- 
nated so soon from school, and thereby relieve it of the 
task of teaching them.** 
Such changes as are becoming necessary, interfere with 
the conventional unit-courses given five prepared periods a 
week for a year. They call for the inclusion of some 
courses given less frequently than every day, or briefer in 
extent than the full year, or than the half-year courses. 
The six weeks’ or ten weeks’ “ try-out ” courses offered in 
many junior high schools in shop-work and even in foreign 
language are cases in point. 
The length of time necessary to complete a curriculum: 
would properly vary also. Perhaps it would require the 
equivalent of twenty or more units of high school work to

SURVEY RECOMMENDATIONS 205 
give adequate training and general education in secretarial 
curriculum or a teacher-training curriculum, so that 
the curriculum would normally require five or six years 
beyond the eighth grade. On the other hand, prevoca- 
tional preparation for machinists’ helper or stock clerk, 
might be given in a curriculum completed at the end of the 
tenth grade or even earlier. A purposeful curriculum 
would be completed when the immediate purposes are 
achieved. 
The Junior College Trend—The demand for educa- 
tion beyond the high school has been met in many cities 
by two-year teacher-training colleges, and in some states 
teacher-training postgraduate departments are conducted 
in rural or semirural centres. More recently there have 
developed in cities the two-year junior college superim- 
posed on the high school, using its equipment and faculty, 
both of which are frequently more adequate for college 
grade work than are those of many small colleges. At pres- 
ent, one of the plans contemplated by the Massachusetts 
State Board of Education, as an alternative to the estab- 
lishment of a state university, is the institution of twelve 
junior colleges in the chief centres of population, bringing 
free college education to within fifteen miles of 90 per 
cent. of the population. 
Survey Recommendations.—The findings and recom- 
mendations of recent surveys are full of help to the second- 
ary school faculties who are eager to take advantage both 
of the methods of finding community and pupil needs, and 
of the recommendations of experts. Appended are ex- 
cerpts from the helpful criticism and recommendation of 
Inglis regarding small high schools in the Indiana Survey 
and of Nichols concerning commercial curricula in the 
Philadelphia Survey. 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  206 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
Inglis * Has Criticised the Existing Program of Studies. 
“To meet the needs of these small (three-teacher) high schools, 
the (Indiana) State Board of Education has for several years recom- 
mended the following course of study: 
First Year 
Required: English, algebra, general science. 
Elective: Foreign language, agriculture, manual training, home 
economics. 
Second Year 
Required: English, plane geometry, early European history. 
Elective: Botany, zoology, foreign language. 
Third Year 
Required: English, modern European history, applied mathematics or 
bookkeeping (1st half), and business arithmetic (2nd half). 
Elective: Agriculture, manual training, home economics. 
Fourth Year 
Required: English, physics, U. S. history and civics, physiology and 
hygiene (1st half), and elementary economics (2nd half). 
Elective :. None. 
Music and drawing must be systematically taught one or two 
periods a week throughout the four years. 
“This ‘general curriculum’ is seriously defective in several 
important respects. It contains so many different studies, and touches 
so many fields of instruction, that the limited teaching staff of the 
small school cannot effectively cover them. . . 
“The arrangement of studies is also objectionable. There can be 
no valid excuse for requiring all pupils to take algebra in the first 
year and geometry in the second. These subjects,-as ordinarily organ- 
ized and taught, are beyond the capacity of many high school pupils, 
and they are not essential elements in the high school education of all 
children. They should be among the electives offered. Likewise, 
adverse criticism must be made of the failure to provide any social 
study in the first year, and of the postponement of civics until the fourth 
year as an appendage to American history. The work in the second 
and fourth years is too academic; finally so long as applied arts and 
sciences come only in the first and third years, satisfactory articulation 
or codrdination cannot be effected.

tional Commission. General Education Board, 1923, pp. 103-107.

SMALL HIGH SCHOOLS 207 
“There is a growing conviction among those most concerned with 
the public high school—a conviction manifesting itself increasingly 
in practice—that relatively few high school studies are of such import- 
ance as to be required of all pupils. The best thought and the best 
practice are increasingly toward the limitation of high school require- 
ments to such subjects as (a) deal with the fundamental elements of the 
English language and its literature; (b) make definite and direct con- 
tribution toward citizenship and social efficiency; (c) deal with mate- 
rials of common need; and (d) contribute to physical well-being. 
“On this basis the required studies for all pupils in any four- 
year high school would be limited to some such groups as the follow- 
ing: First year—English, civics, general science, physical education ; 
Second year—English, general history, physical education; Third 
year—English, American history, physical education; Fourth year— 
English, economics, government, physical education.” 
Inglis“ Has Recommended a More Desirable Program of 
Studies, 
“6. The curriculum proposed below provides a program of 
twenty-four full units of instruction (for the full four-year course), 
so arranged that only fifteen full units of instruction are provided in any 
one school year, and so organized that no teacher’s load exceeds six 
full units (five in Plan 2) of instruction in any one school year. 
“7, In fine, the proposed curriculum makes it possible for three 
full-time teachers to provide a program of instruction which under the 
present and ordinary form of organization would require four full- 
time teachers. It means either (a) a curriculum adequate to meet the 
needs of rural children—far broader and richer than at present, or 
(b) a less expensive curriculum, according as the present organization 
has meant (a) an inadequate curriculum with three teachers (or their 
equivalent or (b) adequate offerings with four or more full-time 
teachers (or their equivalent). At present few small high schools in 
Indiana (or elsewhere, for that matter) successfully escape the 
dilemma of (a) inadequate curriculum with the legitimate number of 
teachers, and (b) adequate curriculum with an excessive number of 
teachers at excessive cost. 
“8. The principle employed in the proposed curriculum is that of 
alternating certain subjects. That is very far from being a new 
principle. It has been used by capable principals. The complete 
organization of the proposed curriculum on that principle is, however, 
presented for the first time. In the proposed curriculum, with one

  208 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
exception, the only subjects offered every year are required subjects in 
the first and second year. The exception is general mathematics. 
“9. The curriculum proposed has the following advantages: 
(a) It provides for twenty-four full units of instruction. Twenty- 
four units is the smallest program which provides for the standard of 
sixteen units for graduation, while permitting college preparatory 
pupils to take algebra, geometry, and two units of foreign language, 
or non-academic pupils to take four or five non-academic subjects in 
place of algebra, geometry, and foreign language. No curriculum 
which cannot do this is satisfactory. It cannot be done with the 
usual organization. It is now done in most small high schools of 
Indiana or elsewhere. 
(b) It provides a program permitting the pupil preparing for 
admission to college, to secure training in all subjects required for 
admission to most higher institutions (to all not requiring more than 
two units of mathematics or more than two units of foreign language). 
(c) At the same time it permits the non-academic pupil to take 
non-academic subjects in place of algebra, geometry, and foreign 
language. At present algebra is a required subject for all pupils in 96 
per cent. or more of all high schools enrolling less than 100 pupils in 
Indiana; geometry is a subject required of all pupils in more than two- 
thirds of such schools, and foreign language is a required subject for 
all pupils in more than three-fourths of such schools. 
(d) It provides for an adequate program with three teachers 
where four teachers are required under the usual form of organization.

A MORE RATIONAL GROUPING 209 
The Curriculum Should Have Immediate and Assured 
Values.—Nichols “ found that 65 per cent. of the girls and 27 per 
cent. of the boys in the Philadelphia public high schools are in the 
commercial departments; 57 per cent. of the continuation-school pupils 
of Philadelphia are commercial pupils ; over 30 per cent. of the evening 
high school pupils take commercial work. In the commercial curricu- 
lum of the schools there is great pupil mortality. Of 114 commercial 
ninth grade boys in one school, only 14 remained to graduate, two 
of whom were going to college as they had planned from the beginning. 
The commercial curriculum included much prescription of academic 
subjects, lest the commercial pupils later want to go to college. It 
is the surveyor’s opinion that more pupils are disappointed in the 
college-preparatory curriculum and wish to change to the commercial 
curriculum than vice versa. 
The high school commercial curricula are failing to meet local 
needs. There are many boys and girls of high school age enrolled in 
private commercial colleges, as in the commercial curricula of the 
public high schools of Philadelphia, but the private commercial cur- 
ricula are seldom well adapted to the younger pupils who attend. 
Stenography for young pupils is not advisable. Foreign language for 
stenographic vocational purposes is futile. The Federal Trade Bureau 
and the Commercial Museum informed the surveyor that business 
offices employ persons who are specifically trained for transla- 
tional work. 
In the girls’ high schools less than 20 per cent. of those who 
enrolled in commercial work remained to graduate, 40 per cent. left 
before the end of the first year, 25 per cent. during the second year, and 
15 per cent. more during the third and fourth years. The surveyor 
proposes a commercial curriculum for the junior and senior high 
schools, and one for the fourth year high school. He makes this 
significant statement: Each year of the commercial curriculum should 
be a unit-curriculum within itself. He suggests also that if foreign 
language is taught to commercial pupils, it should be modified to 
accomplish the purposes that are dependable and feasible, and that 
there should be a probationary period for those electing foreign 
languages so that they can be transferred if they are not successful. 
A More Rational Grouping of Curriculum-experiences 
is Feasible.“*—There follows a plan based on the report

FIFTH PRINCIPLE 211 
of the Curriculum Committee of the National Association 
of Secondary School Principals that should serve as a guide 
for curriculum-makers. It assumes a twenty-five-hour 
week, subjects meeting generally for four 60-minute peri- 
ods a week. This suggested arrangement does not pretend 
to be final ; it is presented to make the proposed regrouping 
of educational experiences more concrete. The curricu- 
lum organization of the Detroit Intermediate Schools fol- 
lows somewhat similar subject-groupings. 
FIFTH PRINCIPLE 
THE PUPIL’S FIRST YEARS IN SECONDARY SCHOOL 
SHOULD GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE UNDER 
GUIDANCE THE MAIN FIELDS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY AND TO 
ACQUAINT HIMSELF WITH THE WAYS IN WHICH SCIENCE, 
HISTORY, LITERATURE, MATHEMATICS, AND OTHER SUB- 
JECTS AFFECT HIS DAILY LIFE. THEREAFTER, THE PUPIL 
AND HIS PARENTS SHOULD DETERMINE WHAT SECONDARY 
SCHOOL WORK HE WILL DO. 
Educational Guidance is a Primary Function of the 
Junior High School.—Guidance in further education and 
progress is a fundamental aim of the early years of second- 
ary education. Pupil enthusiasm is fundamental to posi- 
tive guidance; such enthusiasm may develop through an 
interest in a subject, through the spontaneity and conta- 
gious zeal of the teacher, through extraschool agents, 
parents, neighbors, and through pupil clubs. During the 
junior high school period, the school’s guidance program 
will succeed largely to the degree that the school’s activities 
are of immediate interest to children, that they may have 
broadened experiences in many of the inviting fields of 
knowledge and skill into which they may enter for serious 
study, when they have made up their minds to specialize.
-P-A-G-E-222
    212 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
The secondary school cannot be a benevolent autocrat 
directing pupils what curricula they shall follow. In the 
first place, no man is wise enough to give such directions 
with any assurance that either the child or the community 
will benefit from them. In the second place, a democratic 
community cannot entrust so final a power to any single 
agent. It is better, on the whole, to run the chance of a 
somewhat less ideal segregation according to abilities and 
interests, keeping the organization flexible enough so that 
pupils may change from one curriculum to another with 
a minimum loss of time. As Snedden,1® perhaps some- 
what overstating the case, points out “it is easy to grant 
that pupils are unable to elect courses wisely, without yield- 
ing to the claim that the instructors are, in any single 
whit, in a superior position to make such a selection.” To 
examine present high school requirements must convince 
one that free elections are no less valuable than some 
requirements. 
It must be remembered, too, that parents who keep 
their children in school are making considerable invest- 
ment as measured not only by board, clothes, medical 
attention, and expenses incidental to high school member- 
ship, but by the amount that the children might have been 
expected to contribute if they hadi been at work instead of 
at school. Society and the state hold the parent finally 
responsible as trustee for the welfare of the child. 
We cannot prescribe definite goals for our young people 
and prepare them accordingly. Our present lack of knowl- 
edge forbids ; the indefiniteness of democratic development 
makes it impossible; the interplay of inherent abilities, the   
*Snedden, D.: Problems of Secondary Education, Houghton 
Mifflin Co., p. 134.

APPLICATION PRINCIPLE V 213 
encouragement and veto of environment, the social inherit- 
ance, fortuitous opportunities to exploit some less marked 
abilities—these are elements too complicated to make 
much interference with freedom of election safe. It is 
often better for a pupil to work zealously at studies that 
seem to him worth while, than to work grudgingly at 
tasks that may seem to his teachers potentially more val- 
uable for him. : 
This is not to say that pupils should be permitted to 
idle away time at courses of their own choosing, but that 
they should be allowed to work hard at courses of their 
own choosing. The democracy that is being evolved is 
chiefly genetic rather than telic; it is an urge, a yearning 
for partly-defined ideals; it can only be hastened by the 
encouragement of variations and specializations. There 
is necessary as great a freedom of choice of curriculum as 
is consistent with the suppression of antisocial tendencies, 
and the assurance of a common culture. 
APPLICATION OF FIFTH PRINCIPLE 
A. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
1. Prescribed Preparatory Courses Give No Adequate 
Opportunity for Exploration or Guidance—Too fre- 
quently curriculum-choices once made by pupils entering 
the ninth grade, even though made without adequate guid- 
ance, have been difficult to change. Partly for adminis- 
trative reasons, but more because of a puritanic attitude 
on the part of teachers, pupils have been kept at distasteful 
meaningless subjects, making shirking probable and fail- 
ure almost certain. To be sure, printed programs of study 
sometimes show a very kindly effort to help the pupil to 
elect wisely on entrance to the high school; often there is

  214 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
pointed out the necessity of consulting the principal or 
other official, if the pupil is planning to go to college. 
But too often there are presented to the entering pupils 
mere lists of courses under such headings as “ college 
preparatory,” “scientific,” “general,” and ‘‘commer- 
cial” curricula. 
In the Four-year High School Curriculum-changes 
Are Not Encouraged—Very seldom in the four-year 
school are the conventional first-year courses introductory. 
Latin I is most frequently planned for the purpose of mas- 
tering the formal knowledges and skills useful for second- 
year Latin. Algebra I is taught so that pupils can “do” 
intermediate year algebra. 
High schools have felt obliged to choose between the 
various desired ends to be obtained. With as few teachers 
as small schools have, it frequently seems necessary to 
spend an undue proportion of the time and energy of the 
teachers in teaching advanced subjects, omitting or unduly 
abbreviating the general introductory subjects. Even in 
larger high schools, the necessity or desirability of educat- 
ing boys and girls for some degree of familiarity with the 
manifold interests and activities of cultivated men and 
women has not impressed itself on those responsible for 
the program of study. What the academic college officers 
think that they want of candidates for admittance to their 
institutions has been more influential in determining what 
pupils got than any analysis of their needs or exploration 
of their interests and peculiar abilities. 
In small high schools the prescribed curriculum has 
persisted, and in many ninth grades of four-year high 
schools all subjects are prescribed, including sometimes 
such selective and academic subjects as ancient history, 
English grammar and rhetoric, and algebra.
-P-A-G-E-225
IN PROGRESSIVE SCHOOLS 215 
Pupils are not often forbidden by the school authori- 
ties to make obviously unwise choices, although they are 
frequently advised, not always wisely, concerning their 
elections. There is, too often, a propaganda for election 
of classics and mathematics that leads many pupils to 
elect Latin and algebra, who are almost certain to fail 
through lack of interest and effort, or less often through 
lack of ability. 
Parents are Not Yet Generally Accepted as Partners in 
the Education of their Children —Parents who wish their 
children to get special advantages not offered by the 
school are often balked, because the school’s prescribed 
schedule is too heavy to permit pupils to carry music-les- 
sons or art-lessons outside of school. Some progressive 
schools, however, do give credit toward graduation for 
such outside instruction, with proper safeguards to make 
sure that the quality of instruction is satisfactory, the 
work faithfully done, and reasonable progress made. 
2. Newly Developed General Introductory Courses in 
the Ninth Grade Have Exploratory Functions.—A rapidly 
increasing number of four-year high schools and the major- 
ity of junior high schools are including civics, science, and 
general mathematics in the program of the ninth grade or 
earlier. Without neglecting the primary immediate pur- 
pose for which these subjects are taught, the pupils are 
generally brought in contact with the interesting content 
of the more advanced courses in these same general fields. 
While English also may be stimulating in the same way, 
there is a tendency, which from the point of view of this 
principle is unfortunate, to make the ninth grade English 
course into a formal composition-grammar course, thus 
emphasizing the preparatory aspect at the expense of the 
potential educational guidance-aspect.

216 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
Exploration by the Pupils of Their Aptitudes and 
Interests is Generally More Open-eyed in Junior High 
Schools Than in Conventional Four-year Schools.— 
Where junior, high schools are organized, the arousal of 
educational enthusiasms and the guidance of elections are 
generally provided for, sometimes through the advisory 
system, sometimes through vocational counsellors, some- 
times through definite courses in educational formation. 
The junior high school schedule frequently provides for 
more subjects to be taken each year than the four-year high 
school or three-year senior high school. This gives oppor- 
tunity in the lower school to provide preliminary contacts 
with the materials of instruction of more senior high school 
subjects than the conventional four-subject schedule can 
give. Where the junior high school does its work ade- 
quately, the senior high school is relieved to a great extent 
of its guidance-problem, and can concentrate on its problem 
of intensified specialized training for the majority of its 
students. Socially alert senior high administrators do not 
assume, however, that choices even at the tenth grade level 
are final and irrevocable. 
The school that prescribes no subject that is not clearly 
justifiable in order tol accomplish the purpose of secondary 
education for the individual boy or girl, finds little diffi- 
culty in explaining to parents and pupils why the prescrip- 
tions are necessary. 
The Conception of the Public High School as the 
Peoples’ School is Growing.—The prescription of algebra 
and of foreign language in commercial curricula has some- 
times been discontinued, because administrators have found 
it difficult to explain to parents why a pupil could not take 
typewriting until he had completed geometry or French! 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
WHAT SCHOOLS CAN DO 217 
Many high schools comply with this principle, allowing 
pupils to elect subjects or curricula generally with the 
formal consent of parents. Less often is any machinery 
set up to make sure that parents have the necessary infor- 
mation to give careful consideration to the choices made. 
There is a tendency, however, to remedy the situation ; 
parents’ meetings are held to establish confidence, and to 
disseminate information and advice about elections. Par- 
ent-teacher associations and similar organizations are fre- 
quent, and may promote more cordial understanding and 
cooperation between parents and schools, so that parents 
can more intelligently help pupils to decide among the 
opportunities offered. With the resulting better under- 
standing of the parental points of view, there is a growing 
tendency to grant school credit toward graduation for 
music and art done outside of school. This is equivalent 
to an extension of the elective privilege to cover subjects 
that the school cannot offer. 
B. WHAT CAN BE DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
Better Use of Existing Opportunities for Guidance 
and Arousal of Enthusiasms are Necessary.—There is 
need of still further planning the printed programs of 
study so that they will give more exact and more helpful 
advice to the pupils, parents, and advisers or counsellors 
concerning the purpose, and the probable attainable objec- 
tives of each curriculum. 
It is to be hoped that all courses, the chief present 
purpose of which is to prepare for later studies, will be 
modified, and indeed, be radically reorganized in the 
junior high school, and in the ninth grade of the four- 
year high school. In place of these preparatory courses 
should be put such general courses as those referred to 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
218 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
above, which give experience and knowledge of present 
value, but intentionally using for this purpose content typ- 
ical of the more advanced courses. Thus, English litera- 
ture may include translations from modern and ancient 
languages. English composition, if taught to improve 
the form of expression regarding reading and actual 
experiences that interest pupils, may sometimes draw upon 
the romance of mathematics, or make use of historical, 
scientific, and economics materials, vocational informa- 
tion, home decoration. Similarly, civics actually leads 
into many fields that arouse interests in other civiliza- 
tions, problems of applied science, business organization, 
the use of graphs. General science, of course, treats of 
biology, geography, physics, and chemistry, but it is 
also an excellent introduction to applied mathematics, 
economics, mechanical and art drawing, home economics. 
The Immediate Needs of Pupils in the Early Years 
of Secondary Schools are Paramount.—This objective 
may still further be promoted by means of pupils’ clubs— 
science clubs, art clubs, glee clubs. Enthusiasms are best 
aroused and guided for purposes of curriculum-elections 
by means of periods set aside for more or less informal 
activities of advisers and pupils.2° Such a ninth grade pro- 
gram, might more frequently be introduced into four-year 
high schools. 
Minimal Essentials Only Should be Prescribed.— 
Even though prescriptive subjects may frequently be 
justifiable on general grounds, as English in the core- 
curriculum, or general mathematics in an academic cur- 
riculum, the course of study in the required subject 
frequently contains subject-matter or processes that are

Junior High School,” School Review, Feb., 1924.   
   
-P-A-G-E-229
ADEQUATE INFORMATION 219 
not justifiable as prescriptions. Thus, complicated fac- 
toring and puzzle-problems in ninth grade mathematics 
or technical grammar in English might well be supple- 
mentary to the prescribed minimal essentials. 
The School Should Recognize the Validity of Extra- 
school Educational Experiences.—Though parents’ and 
pupils’ opinions and wishes should be given much weight, 
obviously unwise choices should be discouraged and, if 
necessary, forbidden. Thus, a girl with inadequate motor 
coordination might be refused stenography, or a pupil of 
less than normal mental ability might be refused advanced 
courses in foreign languages and mathematics. Advisers’ 
approval, pupils’ and parents’ conferences, may need to 
be resorted to. 
All schools should encourage pupils with special inter- 
ests and abilities to continue lessons of educationally desir- 
able type outside of school at the expense of parents and 
others; and for such work properly certified to, school 
credit toward graduation should be granted. Pupils 
whose parents wish them to attend advanced institutions, 
which demand preparation in subjects for which the 
school does not prepare, should be free to get this special 
preparation at their own expense, but such work should be 
credited as school work leading to the school diploma. 
Parents Need More Adequate and Immediate Infor- 
mation Regarding the Pupil’s Efforts and Success.—More 
schools should prepare administrative devices to keep 
parents informed and should plan to obtain their reén- 
forcement of the school’s efforts. For this purpose some 
progressive administrators are endeavoring to keep par- 
ents accurately informed of the progress, attitudes, study- 
habits, physical conditions of their children by means of 
informational report-cards, which include a written state-
-P-A-G-E-230
  
220 WHAT ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES 
ment, or a check-mark against a printed list of these traits. 
Such a check-slip is used at the Lincoln School of Teach- 
ers College. At the University of Chicago High School 
a simple card is sent home telling of special success or 
failure. Through parents’ organizations, through par- 
ents’ evenings, through parental visits to the school and 
through all other contacts possible, parents should be 
made aware of the possible choices and should be encour- 
aged to express themselves concerning the choices it is 
possible for the pupils to make. A study-class of parents 
who desire to understand modern educational problems is 
both feasible and desirable. 
Small high schools should recognize the needs of the 
pupils of the first years to be of paramount importance; 
and if they cannot offer all the advanced courses the older 
pupils need, the latter can transfer to nearby larger high 
schools. But if the small high school does not offer ade- 
quate courses for the beginners, there may be many of 
them who will never desire to reach the later years. The 
school’s first duty is to the incoming pupils, whose stay 
in school will depend on the success with which they 
adjust themselves to the educational opportunities offered. 
Such first-year programs as those cited under the second 
and third principles, together with the increasing tendency 
to establish systems of vocational guidance and pupil 
advisement for first-year students, illustrate the growing 
consciousness of responsibility.

CHAPTER XI 
WHAT SHOULD BE THE BASIS OF COMMON 
EXPERIENCES? 
PRINCIPLES VI, VII, VIII, AND IX. 
Preliminary statement: 
The Core-curriculum and Curriculum-prescriptions. 
—The core-curriculum, or, more accurately, the core of 
the curricula, consists of those groups of activities or 
courses of study so essential to the purposes of each level 
of secondary education, that all pupils are required to 
complete them. Prescribed courses have as objectives not 
only the social adjustments that justify the prescription, 
but also further values for individuals, which would not 
justify prescribing the courses for all pupils. Their aims 
include not only command of the fundamentals, explora- 
tion, guidance, and the like, but also preparation for leis- 
ure, and for vocations. 
The following four principles should determine the 
organization and presentation of the core-curriculum sub- 
jects, and the curriculum-prescriptions. 
SIXTH PRINCIPLE 
SOME SUBJECTS ARE SO IMPORTANT TO THE MUTUAL 
ADJUSTMENT AND WELFARE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND 
SOCIETY THAT THEY MUST BE REQUIRED OF ALL PUPILS. 
The Construction of the Core-curriculum is a Com- 
plicated Problem.—If all children were alike in physical, 
mental, and emotional abilities and aptitudes, if they came 
to the school with the same educational attainments and 
with similar social inheritances of knowledge, interests, 
221 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
    222 BASIS OF COMMON EXPERIENCES 
attitudes, ideals, habits, and powers, and if they were all 
destined to; the same vocational, family, and leisure activi- 
ties, then a single curriculum for all pupils might be devel- 
oped. Even this task would not be an easy one. It would 
assume an assured knowledge of social institutions and 
human conduct, an understanding of the relative values of 
preparatory exercises in affecting adult life that we do not 
now have. It would require an understanding of the 
comparative values of practice exercises that are of little 
immediate value but are preparatory for future needs, and 
of intrinsic activities that make for better adjustments 
to present needs, in the belief that present living best pre- 
pares for future life. -Concerning such an understanding 
there is little agreement as yet among psychologists and 
methodologists. 
Since children are not alike in any one of the charac- 
teristics noted above, the secondary school curriculum can- 
not be the same for all; it must be broken up into as many 
curricula as there are homogeneous groups of pupils, so 
far as the resources of the community make this feasible. 
But there is a recognizable body of universal needs of 
youths and adults, preparation for which is of great 
importance. It is certain that the school! has the duty to 
attempt to give a considerable amount of common ele- 
ments of education to all pupils in anticipation of the 
social requirements that life will make of them. 
Needs of Individuals for General Training Are Not 
Uniform.—The tasks of the curriculum-maker are five: 
first, to discover what these nearly universal needs for 
health, for fundamental skills, for vocational efficiency, 
for home membership, for citizenship, and for leisure 
are; second, to determine what traits need to be developed 
in all individuals adequately to meet these needs; third,
-P-A-G-E-233
  
NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS 223 
to decide to what degree of excellence it is feasible to 
prepare boys and girls of secondary school age; fourth, 
to ascertain to what extent this preparation has already 
been accomplished by the elementary school, home, or 
other educative agency, for some or for all pupils; fifth, 
to prescribe those educational experiences for all pupils 
that all need for this common end, and to prescribe for 
special groups, with deficiencies in needed traits, those 
educational experiences which they require. 
Thus all need good’ health and hygienic habits of liv- 
ing, but some already have them; all need to be able to 
read rapidly and understandingly, but some already have 
the ability; all need vocational skill and appreciation, some 
have all that can be given at secondary school level; all 
need the knowledge, attitudes, and habits that make for ade- 
quate home life, some have already these traits; all need 
the adjustments necessary for civic participation, some 
already have them to much greater extent than others; all 
need the ability to enjoy their leisure harmlessly, many 
already have broad, general interests that need only 
encouragement and opportunity. But many lack these 
traits. And some have attitudes and interests that seem 
likely to prove harmful to them or to the community. 
The vast range of specific objectives that education 
must strive to attain for the individual members of the 
school, who differ from each other in so many ways, must 
make one very cautious about deciding what subject-mat- 
ter and methods are most likely to give the results sought. 
Even in those subjects to be prescribed, there must be a 
restricted core of minimal essentials of knowledge, habits, 
and powers, which may be expected of every pupil; and 
also large opportunities assured for developing in each
-P-A-G-E-234
  224 BASIS OF COMMON EXPERIENCES 
child the desires, habits, knowledge, attitudes, and ideals 
that he needs and can attain. 
Provisions for Individual Differences Within the 
Core-curriculum are Necessary—The core-curriculum 
aims to increase like-mindedness, but does not aim at like 
outcomes or identical traits in pupils of differing abilities, 
interests and aptitudes. It calls for the greatest care in 
adapting the activities and the demanded outcomes to the 
skills, abilities, and needs of all the pupils. Just because 
it is required of all, it must also give full play to all indi- 
vidualities, requiring each pupil to contribute what he is 
capable of, accepting a low minimum as satisfactory for 
the dull, and encouraging the more able ones to do vastly 
more. Thus, the curriculum not only teaches the minimal 
essentials as effectively as possible, but also serves as a 
field of exploration, wherein pupils may find new interests 
and test out old ones. 
The Core-curriculum Has a Remedial Function.— 
Prescriptions should be remedial; they should develop 
traits that are necessary, but that are not safely left to 
informal education or to other educational agencies. 
Pupils whose expectancy of stay in school is compara- 
tively short should find in the core-curriculum more inten- 
sive practice to assure reasonable skill in the fundamental 
knowledges and powers. Because the period of its influ- 
ence is shorter for them than for the others, the school 
should try most vigorously to develop habits and attitudes 
necessary for codperative action tempered by good sports- 
manship, and for codperative thinking emphasizing a 
tolerance of differing opinions, a desire for the truth, a 
search for the best practical solution of difficulties rather 
than for the triumph of a preconception. While these 
pupils should find subject-matter of immediate interest 
so far as possible, it would be selected largely with a view
-P-A-G-E-235
  CORE-CURRICULUM ANTICIPATES 225 
to acquainting them with problems that they will surely 
deal with throughout life—problems of industry, com- 
merce, housing, diet, community sanitation, recreation, 
international relations, social reforms and the like. 
Many of these desired knowledges, skills, and atti- 
tudes are difficult to develop in immature boys and girls, 
but the need is so pressing that the school must seek the 
best way of presenting these most important problems. 
If we could segregate the pupils who would surely remain 
in school to graduate, it is possible that for them some or 
many of these difficult problems could be postponed till 
the eleventh or twelfth grades. Since this is not now pos- 
sible, it is probably wisest to treat all as though they were 
not certain to get the more advanced courses in the elev- 
enth and twelfth grades. 
The Core-curriculum Anticipates Pupils’ Later Edu- 
cational Problems.—The core-curriculum should antici- 
pate the needs of pupils in the rest of their high school, 
and further education. The prescribed subjects should 
furnish an apperceptive basis for further study in related 
fields, arouse educational enthusiasms for advanced 
studies, thus aiding in educational guidance of pupils’ 
choices of curricula and elective subjects. In a word, 
every prescription has the primary function to encourage 
persistence of pupils in purposeful school work. 
SEVENTH PRINCIPLE 
CORE-CURRICULUM COURSES SHOULD BE SO ARRANGED 
THAT EACH ONE IS MOST WORTHWHILE AT THE TIME 
TAKEN, AND TO THE EXTENT IT IS PURSUED. 
Since in most high schools a majority of pupils do not 
complete the tenth grade, and since many leave during the 
* For the Seventh Principle, I am indebted to Prof..T. H. Briggs.  
-P-A-G-E-236
    
226 BASIS OF COMMON EXPERIENCES 
seventh, eighth and ninth grades, each course should be 
planned to be of greatest possible value to the extent taken. 
This calls for the selection of subject-matter and methods 
of instruction that contribute, so far as possible, to the 
seven objectives set up by the Commission on Reorganiza- 
tion of Secondary Education. These educational expe- 
riences must be adapted for pupils of junior high school 
ages and abilities. If the work of the school grows out of 
the life-needs and -activities of pupils, all courses will be 
worth while at the time taken and to the extent pursued. 
This principle should not be interpreted to deny that 
one primary object of every required subject of the ear- 
lier years of secondary education is the arousal of educa- 
tional enthusiasm through special assignments, correlations 
with advanced courses, and the like, so that each pupil 
may desire to go on to complete a high school curriculum. 
EIGHTH PRINCIPLE 
CORE-CURRICULUM COURSES SHOULD BE SO PLANNED 
THAT EVERY INDUSTRIOUS NORMAL PUPIL CAN PASS. 
This Principle is Revolutionary Only as Applied to 
Conventional Abstract Courses.—This, the most revolu- 
tionary proposal made in this presentation of the curricu- 
lum problem, would scarcely seem to require any support- 
ing argument. For, surely, to oblige a pupil to study a 
subject which he cannot pass, however earnestly he tries, 
is to foredoom him to failure. Thus to encourage the 
habit of failure, or to justify the attitude of complaisance 
in failure, is to undermine the spirit of determination on 
which much of the pupil’s future success depends. How- 
ever, subjects chosen and organized in accordance with 
the foregoing principles are likely to be so concrete, so 
full of actual experiences of life, that many more pupils
-P-A-G-E-237
  EIGHTH PRINCIPLE 227 
can do a high grade of work in them than in more abstract 
and remote courses often required in the first year. 
Not All Communities are Yet Convinced that Sec- 
ondary Education Should be Universal—The community 
may perhaps be ready to take the position that academic 
high school education shall not be offered to children of 
less than approximately 1.00 I. Q. In that case it would 
be justifiable to gauge the required courses so that only 
such pupils can complete them. But if the community 
desires to offer secondary education to pupils of less abil- 
ity, say from approximately .7o I. Q. up, then requirements 
must either be altered for them, or else it must be made 
possible for them to pass if they work earnestly. 
Terman and Proctor, studying the pupils of the high 
school and some eighth grade pupils of Palo Alto, Cali- 
fornia, found that the mental ages of 137 ninth grade 
pupils ranged from twelve years eight months to nineteen 
years six months, the chronologically retarded pupils 
being mentally the least mature. Pupils of less than 
thirteen years’ mentality could not succeed, and for those 
of fourteen years the chances of success were not good. 
Few were found in high school at all with less than .90 
I. Q., indicating that few “dull” pupils even reached the 
ninth grade.?_ There was practically no likelihood of high 
school graduation for pupils of less than .go I. Q.   
* The term “normal pupil” has two meanings. As commonly used 
it applies to all pupils who are not “subnormal” or at most “border- 
line” cases. It is so used in this principle. In its technical sense it is 
applied to all children whose mental ages as measured by the Binet- 
tests, are at least nine-tenths of their chronological ages; i.e., whose 
intelligence quotients are at least .90. To be more specific, children 
whose intelligence quotients are above, say .70, and below .90, would 
roughly be termed normal, meaning that they are not “borderline” 
or “subnormal” cases; but technically they would be referred to as 
“Jess than normal” or “dull;” Otis, indeed, refers to children of .70 
to 80 I. Q. as “borderline cases.”
-P-A-G-E-238
  228 BASIS OF COMMON EXPERIENCES 
Van Denburg, studying one thousand New York high 
school first-semester pupils, found that of those standing 
low in their teachers’ estimates, 50 per cent. dropped out 
within a half year; of those rated average, 50 per cent. 
dropped out within one and a half years; of those rated 
as high, 50 per cent. remained three years or more. That 
even these one thousand pupils were a highly selected 
group was shown by the fact that although one pupil in 
twenty-three in the elementary schools of New York 
gained special promotion, one in three of the pupils studied 
had done so.® 
“A nation falls short,” conclude Terman and Proc- 
tor, “ of the true ideals of democracy, which refuses (sic) 
to furnish suitable training to a third of its children* 
merely because of artificial requirements.’ Such a state- 
ment is not quite justified, and it misses the more impor- 
tant aspect of the matter. Society does not refuse, it 
merely slights or ignores those who fail to meet the 
standards. But the neglect harms not only the individ- 
uals to whom opportunities are refused; the community 
is the loser by the failure to prepare the naturally less effi- 
cient and less easily socialized members of the social 
group, for constructive participation in the inevitable 
activities that lie before them. 
Horizontal Mental Growth, Not Vertical Mental 
Growth, is the Object of the Core-curriculum.—Core- 
curriculum subjects prescribed in sequence, as English 
generally is, should not increase demands on abstract rea- 
soning; but rather should give broader experiences—other-

-P-A-G-E-239
APPLICATION PRINCIPLES VI-VIII 229 
wise less able pupils cannot do satisfactory work. Bagley, 
in attacking the uses he fears may be made of intelligence 
tests, asserts (as indeed Terman had already pointed out 
before him) that there are two kinds of mental growth, 
natural growth from birth to maturity, and experiential 
growth. The former he calls “ vertical,” the latter “ hori- 
zontal” growth. Since vertical mental growth is slow for 
all people after they are fourteen, and since it seems that 
the just normal and less than normal pupils never pass the 
fourteen-year-old mental level, it appears certain that any 
courses prescribed in sequence for dull and bright alike will 
be too difficult for the former, if the courses increase in 
their demands for verbal or abstract, intelligence year by 
year. Rather should they aim to foster horizontal, expe- 
riential growth, requiring adequate qualities of work to be 
done by pupils, but in quality emphasizing neatness, 
promptness, attention to detail, and emotional, moral quali- 
ties rather than intellectual qualities. 
Curriculum-prescriptions are Properly Selective.— 
Courses prescribed for a specific curriculum, not included 
in the core-curriculum, would probably demand a some- 
what higher standard for a passing grade, and so would 
eliminate pupils not fitted by nature to succeed with the 
curriculum. For example, in stenography, all pupils not 
qualified to attain considerable skill in this work should 
properly find it too difficult, and would then elect other 
curricula in which they could succeed. 
APPLICATION OF SIXTH, SEVENTH AND EIGHTH PRINCIPLES 
A. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
1. In Practice Some Subjects are Prescribed that are 
Not of Great Value for All Pupils—Up to the present, 
there are still many high schools that prescribe for,all pupils 
one or more of such subjects as algebra, geometry, ancient
-P-A-G-E-240
230 BASIS OF COMMON EXPERIENCES 
history, English grammar, English “ classics,” a foreign 
language, choral music, art, and home economics (for 
girls). Few of these subjects are of intrinsic value to a 
pupil; they are thought of chiefly in terms of their contri- 
bution to later courses. Moreover, in some of these sub- 
jects, such as history, mathematics, and foreign languages, 
the failure-rate is rather high. Prescriptions of subjects 
in which considerable numbers of pupils cannot or do not 
succeed are wasteful of financial and human resources. 
In algebra, which is often prescribed in the ninth grade, 
frequently as many as 35 per cent. of the pupils fail. 
A subject is sometimes prescribed for an objective 
that does not conflict with the principle in question; but 
teachers fail to subordinate other objectives that are in 
conflict with these principles. Thus, mathematics is some- 
times prescribed because of its guidance-values, but is 
frequently so taught that it fails to subordinate all other 
purposes to that of guidance. 
Activities or subjects are frequently prescribed, not 
only for pupils who need them, but also for pupils who are 
already quite well enough equipped. Thus English is 
prescribed generally through the eleventh grade, not only 
for those who neither speak nor write in accordance with 
good usage, but also for those whose home influences are 
such that they already have reasonable skill. Similarly, 
physical training is prescribed for those whose habits and 
health are satisfactory, and who are getting enough exer- 
cise anyway; as well as for those whose health is unsat- 
isfactory or who get too little exercise. 
Too frequently subjects are so organized and taught 
that little useful power or knowledge is gained until the 
subject has been pursued for a full year or more. Thus, 
a prescribed foreign language is sometimes taught so that
-P-A-G-E-241
  MORE PROGRESSIVE PRACTICES = 231 
no reading- or speaking-ability is developed until after 
much grammatical knowledge and skill have been attained. 
The social-civic aim of education is generally provided 
for in part by the prescription of some social study, but 
frequently the prescription is not well chosen, nor so 
taught as to contribute very directly to the objective. 
Of 475 high schools in the North Central States reply- 
ing to a questionnaire sent out by Monroe and Foster © 
204 schools were teaching ancient, medieval or general 
history in the first semester of the ninth grade, six schools 
offered modern or English history, and 116 only were 
teaching any form of civics or other social science. (Table 
V). About go per cent. of the history-courses were text- 
book courses. (Table VI). Current events, however, were 
taught in conjunction with history-courses in many (per- 
haps half) of the schools. (Table VII). During later years 
American history, civics, and economics were taught, and 
frequently required ; but many of the pupils in these schools 
who most need intelligent understanding of, and guidance 
in social, economic, and political affairs, leave school before 
the opportunity to get this help is open to them as high 
school pupils.

“There are high school students who are likely to be eliminated by 
the requirements of any considerable number of constants for gradua- 
tion. The boy whose course consists largely of intensive industrial 
work deserves the community commendation which a diploma bestows. 
It is true that such a boy cannot be admitted to college as college- 
entrance requirements are at the present time, but practically none 
of these pupils contemplate college entrance. At the other extreme, 
it is found that high school students who are preparing to enter Eastern 
colleges have difficulty in conforming to the narrowly delimited aca- 
demic requirements, and at the same time meet constants marked out 
on a more liberalized basis.” 
“The Department recommends that all curriculums of four-year 
high schools shall be so constructed as to require the following units 
of work, to be designated as ‘ List A,’ of every student as a prerequisite 
for graduation: 
2 units of English. 
2 units of social studies, one of which shall be advanced. 
American history (34) and civics (%). By social studies is meant 
history ; community, vocational, and economic civics; elementary eco- 
nomics and sociology; and the political and industrial aspects of 
geography. Problems of American democracy may be substituted 
for the half-unit of civics as a constant in cases where pupils have 
had a half-unit of community civics. 
I unit of natural science.” 
“ Electives. . . . Foreign languages and algebra are not placed in 
the category of studies that are to be required of all students. In their 
stead some of the newer types of secondary courses will be found more 
advantageous to many high school youths.” 
Des Moines, Iowa,’ High Schools prescribe only 
English, social science, and physical education. 
The subjects offered in the Des Moines (four year) high schools 
are arranged in the following groups of related subjects, each group 
comprising all those studies that are at present taught in these schools 
in one field of knowledge; the English group, social-science group, 
commercial group, home-economics group, industrial-education group, 
music-group, art-group, physical-education group.

CORE-CURRICULUM SUBJECTS 233 
Sixteen units are required for graduation and must include two 
majors and two minors. For the core-curriculum, one of these majors 
must be in the English group, at least two units must be from the 
social-science group. Two years of physical training, two periods per 
week, are also required, for which one-fifth unit per year is allowed. 
Aside from the requirements stated above, every pupil is allowed 
great freedom in the selection of electives from any of the various 
groups. In making this selection he is required to consult with his 
home-room teacher or with such other adviser as may be assigned 
to him by the principal, and the individual course of study selected must 
be approved by the adviser or by the principal. 
Approved Core-curriculum Subjects are Valuable to 
the Extent that They Emphasize Activities, Interesting 
to All Pupils—If prescribed English consisted of gram- 
mar, rhetoric, and, analysis of classics; if prescribed social 
studies were merely chronological history to be memo- 
rized; if prescribed science were a logical presentation of 
systematic botany, or “ pithball electricity;” if physical 
education were only setting-up exercises; there would be 
little more reason for prescribing them than for mathemat- 
ics and foreign languages. But these subjects lend them- 
selves to organization and teaching in terms of the 
activities of pupils, rather than the mastery of memoriza- 
tion of the results of a historian’s, scientist’s, or teacher’s 
activities. And in progressive secondary schools, advantage 
is taken of these possibilities. The subjects recommended 
for the core-curriculum, as taught in progressive schools, 
have the following prominent characteristics: 
(1) They emphasize activities rather than the acqui- 
sition of information. 
(2) They can be readily organized so that the activi- 
ties undertaken appeal to the interests, and are within the 
powers of the pupils taking them. 
(3) They emphasize present as opposed to deferred 
values.  
-P-A-G-E-244
  234 BASIS OF COMMON EXPERIENCES 
(4) Finally, they are usually so taught that any indus- 
trious, mentally normal pupil can pass. 
There is a Growing Tendency to Prescribe Social 
Sciences Other Than History—In a study of the “ Status 
of Certain Social Studies in High Schools” recently re- 
ported by Moore ® it is estimated that 19 per cent. of the 
(four-year) high school pupils in the 6,624 schools report- 
ing, were studying “ modern civics,” 24 per cent. conven- 
tional civics (presumably civil government), four per cent. 
“modern economics,” six per cent. conventional econom- 
ics, four per cent. other social science courses, and 34 per 
cent. current events. It appears that 90 or more per cent. 
- of the graduating pupils in the schools which answered the 
questionnaire have taken some social science other than his- 
tory during their high school careers. However, it must 
be remembered that Moore is dealing with selected high 
schools, and that the high percentage does not include 
those who leave without graduating. In the report of 
Monroe and Foster, referred to above, it is shown that 
from 56 to 79 per cent. of the schools now offering social 
sciences other than history, favor putting them in the 
core-curriculum. 
Homogeneous Grouping Makes Possible Flexible 
Standards in Prescribed Subjects.—In large high schools, 
provision for homogeneous grouping of pupils makes pos- 
sible a flexible grading of standards of work required, so 
that more able pupils can be required to do a higher qual- 
ity of work than less able ones can be expected to accom- 
plish.2 In high schools, too small for homogeneous

WHAT SCHOOLS CAN DO 235 
grouping, adaptation has to be made on the basis of indi- 
vidual abilities and aptitudes. 
At Burlington, Iowa, High School for several years 
prior to 1919, pupils were segregated according to their 
ability to do good school work based on teachers’ judg- 
ments of the first six weeks in high school, but subject to 
transfers from group to group if first judgments later 
proved incorrect. Since 1919, the divisions have been 
made at the beginning of the year on the basis of intelli- 
gence-tests. 
“Tn the fall of 1919 we indiscriminately assigned ninety Freshmen 
to four sections of English 1, all meeting the first period of the day. 
Had we followed our old plan, we should have reassigned them at the - 
end of the first six weeks, assigning the best twenty-eight students to 
Section A, the next forty-six students to two B Sections, and the 
remaining sixteen students to Section C. The natural laws of chance 
would have operated to cause the transfer of fifty-six students, or 62 
per cent. of the class. A comparison of the ranking of the tests, and 
the actual ranking which the teachers gave at the end of six weeks 
shows a positive correlation of 52 per cent. (sic) Had we placed the 
students at registration-day on the basis of the tests and reassigned 
them at the end of six weeks on the basis of teacher-judgment, there 
would have been a greatly reduced percentage of transfers.” ” 
To get groups as homogeneous as possible, semester-courses are 
alternated, permitting the doubling-up of classes; this results in a 
larger number of pupils to divide. 
Principal Ray H. Bracewell of Burlington says, “the policy of 
teaching in segregated groups practically does away with the need of 
failure.” This directly supports the writer’s experience with ability- 
grouping at Blewett Junior High School, St. Louis, Mo. 
B. WHAT CAN BE DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
All Schools Should Make Their Practices Accord 
With Those of the Progressive Schools Referred to 
Above.—As Robinson has said regarding social progress 
in general, “ It is fear that holds us back.” Administrators 
and teachers worry lest the school be criticised because a

boy who has neglected to take algebra in the ninth grade, 
and who later desires to enter a college of engineering, 
will have to take an extra subject to make up the deficiency. 
Better guidance and fuller information to parents is 
needed, rather than the prescription of algebra for many 
pupils who do not require it, in order to provide for the few 
who do need it. 
Carefully Planned Modifications of Subject-matter 
and Methods Are Much Needed.—What is now needed, 
beyond what progressive schools have already done, is to 
improve the courses of study and the methods of conduct- 
ing classes. Subject-matter needs to be reorganized in 
terms of the acquisition of information, habits, and atti- 
tudes through the pupils’ own activities, rather than 
through the repetition of activities imposed by the teacher. 
Thus, to report to the class on the animal life actually 
observed about a small pond, to organize and deliver a 
four-minute speech of the functions of a grade-congress, 
to practice evading a tackler in football, to explain by 
means of a diagram how the park-department, police- 
department, and water-department codperate to care for 
the public playgrounds, are types of pupil activity that are 
truly educative for all, that make assured contributions to 
the attainment of the objectives of secondary education, 
that are worth while to the extent taken, and that every 
industrious normal pupil can complete with a reasonable 
degree of success. 
Caution is needed in deciding what should be pre- 
scribed for all pupils; but the consensus of opinion can be 
stated that the following subjects at least should be 
included in the core-curriculum.*

SUBJECT-MATTER AND METHODS 237 
a. Social studies (civics, history, “human” geog-

and problems involved are of such fundamental impor- 
tance to intelligent participation in civic affairs ; 
b. English language and literature, sufficient for 
reasonable mastery of the means of expression, and for 
an acquaintance with a considerable range of general 
literature, and of books and magazines in the fields of 
pupil’s interests ; 
c. General science, because the knowledge and con- 
cepts involved are so fundamental to an understanding of 
our social and natural environments. 
d. Physical education, in order that the growing body 
may be developed sturdily, that physical defects may be 
overcome or diminished, and that community health may 
be safeguarded. 
e. School activities, clubs, room organizations, pupil 
participation in school control, and moral, social and voca-

-P-A-G-E-248
238 BASIS OF COMMON EXPERIENCES 
The present tendency is to prescribe general mathemat- 
ics for academic pupils throughout the junior high school, 
and in the ninth grade of the four-year high school; and 
special mathematics (commercial arithmetic) in the voca- 
tional curricula, though this prescription is perhaps less 
cogently reasoned than those given above. 
NINTH PRINCIPLE 
CURRICULUM-PRESCRIPTIONS, THE COURSES REQUIRED 
OF PUPILS TAKING EACH SPECIAL CURRICULUM, SHOULD 
CONTAIN ONLY SUCH PREPARATORY CONTENT AS IS ACTU- 
ALLY NECESSARY TO FULFIL THE PURPOSE OF THE CUR- 
RICULUM. 
A Curriculum-prescription is Properly Preparatory 
and Somewhat Selective in Character—A curriculum- 
prescription differs from a core-curriculum subject in that 
it may properly contain practice for the development of 
skills or the fixing of certain knowledge, which is of pre- 
paratory value; that is, which is taught because it is 
necessary to the pupil’s success in later courses. Thus, a 
pre-engineering curriculum would prescribe algebra as a 
preparation for advanced mathematics, but the preparatory 
and selective function should not be overemphasized. The 
prescription for many pupils of elements looking forward 
to activities which only a few will undertake, involves 
financial and human waste. 
It is peculiarly wasteful to master skills or information 
in the ninth grade that will not be used until the eleventh 
or twelfth grade. Worst of all is the prescription of sub- 
ject-matter, none of which is ever going to be used by 
any pupils, such as some elements of conventional ninth 
grade algebra.
-P-A-G-E-249
APPLICATION PRINCIPLE IX 239 
The major part of a content of a curriculum-prescrip- 
tion should, of course, be of immediate value whether the 
pupil completes the curriculum or not. 
APPLICATION OF NINTH PRINCIPLE 
A. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
1. Curriculum-prescriptions Frequently are Not Intel- 
ligently Planned or Taught.—Provision for curriculum- 
prescriptions is generally made for high schools. Within 
any given curriculum—a fine-arts curriculum, for example 
—certain subjects, as cover-design, would likely be re- 
quired during the eleventh and twelfth grades that could 
only be taken advantageously by pupils who had passed suc- 
cessfully a preparatory course in lettering or color-har- 
mony. Such preparatory courses sometimes require types 
or degrees of skill not necessary for success in the advanced 
course. Similarly algebra, prescribed in some academic 
curricula, generally contains such material not needed in 
later high school courses in mathematics. 
The required first-year courses must usually be passed 
in their entirety or repeated altogether. But if they are 
required as preparation for later courses, it is possible that 
the understanding of the English, or science, or mathemat- 
ics necessary for success in the later courses, may have 
been gained even by the failing pupils. 
2. In Most Curriculum-prescription Subjects There 
Have Been Great Improvements in Regard to This Prin- 
ciple in the Texts and Courses of Study Produced in the 
Last Ten Years.—The movement for general mathematics 
in the junior high school grades emphasizes the selection 
of subject-matter on the basis of its immediate social 
values, and on the preparation for advanced courses, by
-P-A-G-E-250
  240 BASIS OF COMMON EXPERIENCES 
stimulating the pupils’ interest and joy in the subject. In 
modern foreign languages, and more recently even in 
Latin, the postponement of much of the former gram- 
mar and composition until after more immediately appli- 
cable knowledge and skill has been attained, is becoming 
common. 
Junior high school and ninth grade commercial cur- 
riculum-prescriptions of comprehensive courses in book- 
keeping—logical and complete—are sometimes modified 
and rechristened “ office-practice,” or ‘“ business-practice,” 
or “accounting ” courses, or are replaced by typewriting 
and commercial practice. The new emphasis is on mechani- 
cal operations and fundamental skills, of great use both to 
the pupil who leaves to enter a store or office during the 
ninth grade, or to the pupil who continues in a commercial 
curriculum till graduation. Similarly, in the junior high 
school and in the ninth grade of the four-year high school, 
manual training is giving way to industrial arts, mechan- 
ical drawing to shop-drawing, domestic science to cooking. 
Nor are these changes in name merely; they signify far- 
reaching changes in conception and execution. 
B. WHAT CAN BE DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
Specific Knowledge or Skills Needed for Advanced 
Courses Should be Listed, and These Taught as Imme- 
diately Preceding Their Use as Possible—All subjects 
that are prescribed as preliminary to later studies should be 
carefully planned, so that content, the chief value of which 
is propedeutic, will not be separated from the time of its 
use longer than necessary. Such a study for the placement 
of Latin grammar has been made for Latin.1% 
*Cf. Byrne, Lee: Latin Syntax, University of Chicago Press, 
1909.  
-P-A-G-E-251
  
SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED 241 
If, in making analyses of eleventh and twelfth grade 
subjects, one enumerates specific activities required, instead 
of naming large topics, he would generally find a compara- 
tively small amount of preliminary skill and knowledge 
actually necessary. Thus, if instead of listing factoring as 
a prerequisite skill for intermediate algebra, one listed only 
the types of factoring used so frequently that it would be 
economical to have learned them in advance, if in archi- 
tectural drawing one listed only the specific mechanical 
skills and knowledge frequently needed, if in salesmanship 
one listed only the commercial terms and knowledge 
actually needed as an apperceptive basis, the curriculum- 
prescription of earlier years could be much simplified and 
enriched with intrinsic subject-matter. 
The study by Williams of college freshman chemistry 
to find what secondary school mathematics was involved in 
working the problems, is referred to in Chapter VI. Mrs. 
Theodosia T. Callaway made a similar study of a college 
freshman text used. in Stephens College. She found only 
elementary concepts of arithmetic, algebra and geometry 
were involved.'4 | 
In the training of artillery-officers at Fortress Monroe, 
Major Fred Engelhardt greatly reduced the length of the 
mathematics course, by excluding all non-essentials. He 
found that by rearranging the sequence of topics and pro- 
cesses, and by-applying their knowledges and skills as fast. 
as they learned them, the candidates for commissions mas- 
tered in four months the mathematics conventionally 
taught in two years.

  CHAPTER XII 
WHAT SHOULD BE THE BASIS OF ELECTIVE 
CHOICES? 
TENTH AND ELEVENTH PRINCIPLES 
Preliminary statement: 
Common Misunderstandings Regarding Electives. 
In regard to no other phase of the curriculum is there so 
much discussion between persons who are talking at cross 
purposes as in regard to election of subjects and curricula. 
The opponents of early introduction of optional courses in 
the junior high school seem to forget that even the pri- 
mary grades permit a considerable amount of choice of 
activities, that early elections are practically equivalent to 
try-out courses, that opportunities for rechoices are pro- 
vided without appreciable loss of time. Moreover, pupils 
drop out of school during the junior high school, frequently 
to seek in private business schools or in employment, the 
opportunities for serious work along the lines of their 
interests, that have been forbidden them at junior high 
schools in which elections are postponed. 
During the ninth grade of four-year high schools 
(somewhat earlier in the case of junior high schools), 
pupils are customarily permitted to make a tentative choice 
of the general field in which they wish to specialize, 
whether they wish to elect a commercial, home economics, 
college preparatory, or other curriculum. The freedom of 
election is interfered with often because of certain social 
considerations, or because of the advice given by teachers 
or friends in whom conventional or conservative ideas are 
242
-P-A-G-E-253
COMMON MISUNDERSTANDINGS — 243 
strong, or who are ignorant of the true basis of curricu- 
lum electives. 
This tentative curriculum is frequently preceded by a 
single-subject election which may become the point of 
departure for the curriculum-choice. For example, a 
junior high school pupil in the eighth grade who selects 
bookkeeping and likes it, and whose parents and adviser 
are satisfied with the choice, very likely will continue the 
subject, and select a commercial curriculum in the ninth 
grade and in the senior high school. On the other hand, 
if the choice of elective does not seem a wise one to follow 
up, he will re-elect at the end of a semester, or choose an 
academic or other curriculum in the ninth or tenth grade. 
In the ninth grade, the bookkeeping course will appear 
then for him as a curriculum prescription, and he will get 
an opportunity to elect another subject in this grade. He 
may choose another commercial subject, typewriting or 
commercial arithmetic, or an unrelated subject, as French 
or music. 
In the tenth grade there may be two curriculum-pre- 
scriptions, but the decreasing core-curriculum will make 
possible a free election permitting further specialization 
along the lines of his curriculum, or another opportunity to 
elect a more or less unrelated subject. In the eleventh and 
twelfth grades, two electives may be possible, and within 
the curriculum chosen there may be an opportunity for 
selection of a variable; e.g., a choice of foreign lan- 
guages in an academic curriculum, or a choice between 
stenography, accounting, and salesmanship in a commer- 
cial curriculum. 
A diagrammatic statement of a six-year secondary pro- 
gram of studies may make clear to the reader what plan

the writer would assign to the core-curriculum of con-

munity and in the state. What is the compulsory attend-

traditions of the community? what the industrial and 
commercial opportunities of the locality? what the finan- 
cial status of the families represented? These are some 
of the questions that the curriculum-makers must study 
before an answer can be given to the first part of the 
question. 
The content and cultural significance of the required 
courses of the curriculum influence the answer to the sec- 
ond part of the question. 
The following two principles may guide in the laying

TENTH PRINCIPLE 245 
out of the curricula and electives for any secondary 
school system. 
TENTH PRINCIPLE 
WHATEVER CURRICULUM A PUPIL MAY CHOOSE TO 
FOLLOW, SOME OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE GIVEN FOR THE 
FREE ELECTION OF COURSES THAT MAKE A SPECIAL 
APPEAL TO HIM. 
The opportunity to choose forms of educational activ- 
ity to pursue is necessary in order that the right of each 
individual to his unique interests and activities may be 
provided for, and in order that the pupil may have prac- 
tice in choosing between forms of activity, which is the 
best training for the self-direction needed in life. 
The studies of the ninth-grade program of the four- 
year high school may be so general that no elective subject 
is very necessary, especially since the pupil has the oppor- 
tunity to elect into a curriculum that appeals to him. If the 
general preliminary courses have been adequately given in 
junior high school, electives in each curriculum may well 
be offered in the ninth grade. After the first year or so of 
the junior high school or, perhaps, the ninth grade of the 
four-year high school, when the pupil is “ finding himself ” 
by taking general introductory courses, it is destrable 
that no curriculum should prescribe all the subjects that 
can be taken in any one year.” 
Within the more limited fields of the different cur- 
ricula and courses of study, constant opportunity of choice 
? Morrison, H. C.: “Readjustments of Fundamental Schools,” 
School Review, v. xxxi, No. 7, Sept., 1923, p. 508. 
Morrison takes a very different position from the one stated here. 
He believes that “the principle of electivism below the true university 
level will probably come to be applied chiefly at the point at which the 
student’s career leads him out of the course of general education into 
the field of specific training for his vocational life.”  
-P-A-G-E-256
  
246 BASIS OF ELECTIVE CHOICES 
should, of course, be given. No matter how homogeneous 
a group electing a subject, different topics or projects will 
make varying appeals to different pupils. 
Thus in salesmanship, in a commercial curriculum, 
some pupils will find much more pleasure in a project in- 
volving women’s jewelry, while others will attack more 
zealously the problems of “ selling” typewriters, or writ- 
ing advertisements of men’s shoes, or fitting up a display 
of furniture. Such preferences should be largely taken 
into account, though a reasonable amount of common 
experiences may be required of all pupils who elect 
a course. 
ELEVENTH PRINCIPLE 
A HIGHER QUALITY OF WORK MAY BE DEMANDED IN 
ELECTIVE COURSES THAN IN REQUIRED COURSES. 
Since pupils choose elective courses because of special 
interest in or adaptability for them, they should be required 
to maintain a somewhat higher grade of work than pupils 
who take the same courses because they are prescribed. 
Such a higher standard is more feasible, too, because it is 
not so serious from the point of view of graduation to 
fail an elective, as it is to fail a prescription. Another 
elective may be substituted for the one failed, and the 
pupil’s progress is scarcely interrupted unless several such 
courses are failed. But a prescription failed must usually 
be repeated, and progress is largely checked until it is 
made up. 
Too often, up to the present, electives have been less 
stringent than prescribed courses; perhaps because if they 
are not kept “easy,” they may not attract enough pupils 
to have the course continued. The very fact that a subject 
is elected implies purposeful work voluntarily and sponta-

  APPLICATION PRINCIPLES X-XI 247 
neously done. No pupil should be permitted to dawdle 
away time under these conditions. The pupil who is mis- 
taken in his choice of electives should make a new choice at 
the first opportunity. 
APPLICATION OF THE TENTH AND ELEVENTH PRINCIPLES 
A. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
1. The Elective System is in a Transition Stage— 
The free elective system after a partial trial has been 
generally replaced by a program made up of curricula 
within which some elections are allowed. All stages of this 
development may, of course, still be found, the prescribed 
academic or college-preparatory curriculum, the free elec- 
tive system with a minimum of prescription, the modifi- 
cation of this system known as the group-system, and the 
curriculum-system as set forth under Principles III and 
IV. Vestiges of the different stages persist even in pro- 
gressive schools. The college-preparatory curriculum is 
frequently as rigid as when it was the only curriculum 
offered, though colleges have generally ceased to make 
‘very unreasonable requirements for admission. The 
general curriculum (called the “elective” curriculum in 
Los Angeles) is frequently as purposeless as it was. when 
the free election enthusiasm was at its height. Des 
Moines, Iowa, still uses (1920-21) the group system, 
and finds it reasonably satisfactory. 
Different Curricula Vary in Rigidity.—It is quite rea- 
sonable that curricula should vary somewhat in the range 
of opportunities for election of subjects that appeal to 
individuals. But the general curriculum frequently con-

-P-A-G-E-258
  248 BASIS OF ELECTIVE CHOICES 
sists of a small core-curriculum plus enough elective units, 
often chosen almost aimlessly, to meet the quantitative 
graduation-requirement. On the other hand, college-pre- 
paratory and commercial curricula too frequently give 
chance for choices of curriculum-variables, but not of free 
electives. A happy medium between laxity and rigidity is 
often found in the fine-arts and home-economics curricula, 
which usually make more generous provision for free elec- 
tion of subjects not directly contributing to the major or 
obvious aims of the curriculum. 
Some Electives are Commonly Known to Pupils as 
“Snap” Courses.—Elective courses customarily give 
credit toward graduation according to the number of pre- 
pared periods a week required—unprepared periods gener- 
ally count for one-half as much as prepared periods. But 
the effort required in elective subjects varies widely. Some 
electives, as physical geography and art, are often noto- 
riously easy to pass, and are elected by “ snap-hunters ” 
who have no real interest in the subject. To offset this ten- 
dency, rules are sometimes made by authorities limiting the 
number of certain electives that can be taken, because they 
are known to be “snap” courses. But such rules are 
unsatisfactory correctives. 
School Authorities Often Fail to Appreciate the 
Opportunities for Capitalizing the Out-of-school Activi- 
ties of Pupils—Frequently pupils who are studying very 
seriously music or painting with private teachers outside of 
schools, and who are making noteworthy progress, are not 
given credit toward graduation, even though the work 
parallels courses given by the schools. Similarly, pupils 
engaged in machine-shops and drafting-rooms, dress- 
alteration departments, acting as salesmen, all gaining in-

valuable experience that supplements the work of the 
school, often can get no credit for their work toward 
graduation. In fact, these outside activities are sometimes 
said “to interfere seriously” with school work, and so 
parents are advised to discontinue them. 
2. More Freedom of Election Through Modifications 
and Safeguards Promotes a Greater Quantity and Higher 
Quality of Work.—In order that pupils may elect subjects 
that challenge their interest, and for which they feel them- 
selves best fitted, more freedom of election of subjects is 
made possible by special modifications and safeguards. 
Curricula are subdivided so that pupils specialize in a 
narrower field, and then are permitted to elect either re- 
lated subjects (which might have been prescribed in a more 
comprehensive curriculum), or an entirely unrelated sub- 
ject; e.g., music in a commercial curriculum. At Solvay, 
New York, the commercial curriculum permitted pupils in 
the eleventh and twelfth grades to specialize in stenography, 
bookkeeping or salesmanship. In case a pupil selected 
salesmanship for specialization, he could elect either ad- 
vanced bookkeeping or stenography, or a subject outside 
the curriculum, such as a foreign language, art, dress- 
making. 
Opportunity to take five subjects, or even six, reciting 
four periods a week with longer periods, requiring a longer 
school day permit much more freedom. At Trenton, New 
Jersey, Senior High School, the college preparatory cur- 
riculum requires 5714 “counts” for graduation; it pre- 
scribes 12 counts of English, 8 counts of social studies 
(ancient history and problems of democracy), 8 counts 
of mathematics, and 2 counts of physical training—3o in 
all. This permits 2714 or more “ counts” to be earned 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  250 BASIS OF ELECTIVE CHOICES 
in electives including foreign languages, mathematics, sci- 
ence, mechanical drawing, commercial geography, etc. 
The requirements for graduation in all curricula, of 
two major sequences of three units each, and of two minor 
sequences of two units each (see Principle XIV) assure a 
reasonable concentration in two-thirds of each pupil’s cur- 
riculum, and tend to discourage an undue amount of scat- 
tering of electives even in general curricula. 
The Quality and Quantity of Work That Interested 
Pupils Willingly Give to Electives in Schools Where a 
High Standard is Demanded, is Proof of the Feasibility 
of These Principles—For example, the Commercial High 
School of New York demands 20 units for graduation as 
compared to 16 for other high schools. The policy of 
changing the significance of the term “ graduation”’ may 
be questionable, and this citation does not mean that the 
writer considers it approvable. But it does indicate a 
willingness on the part of pupils who elect purposefully 
to do far more work than would be necessary just to earn 
a high school diploma. 
Another illustration is found at Solvay, New York, 
where girls of the home-economics curricula have for ten 
years willingly given up their noon-hours several days a 
week to prepare and serve luncheons to teachers and pupils, 
just for the experience that it gives them. 
More and More are Progressive Schools Giving For- 
mal Recognition to Educative Experiences Gained Out- 
side of School—Music lessons are credited toward 
graduation, if proper certification of the number of lessons 
and quality of work is presented, and if the high school 
music-teacher is satisfied that reasonable progress has been 
made. The Lincoln School of Teachers College does not 
offer Latin in its program of studies, but will give credit
-P-A-G-E-261
  
EDUCATIVE EXPERIENCES 251 
for graduation to pupils who complete two units or more 
under a teacher of recognized standing, and permits such 
pupils to carry light school schedules during the time they 
are studying the subject outside of school. 
Part-time codperative schools give credit toward grad- 
uation for the weeks the pupils spend in store or factory, 
as well as for the time that pupils are getting their general 
and technical instruction in school. 
At Solvay, New York, during the writer’s superintend- 
ency, 1913-16, it was the practice to grant to high school 
pupils in the home-economics curriculum a maximum of 
ten school credits, equivalent to two units, for dressmaking 
or repairing, home-management (if the girl were made 
fully responsible for the finances as well as the care of the 
home), or employment in millinery, garment-making or 
alteration-establishment, if approved by the head of the 
home-economics department. Similarly, pupils enrolled in 
the industrial-arts curriculum could earn a maximum of 
ten credits by working in machine-shops, drafting-rooms, 
or in building-projects. Commercial-curriculum pupils 
could earn equivalent credits for actual employment in 
offices or as salesgirls, if enrolled in appropriate courses at 
school at the same time. 
S. C. Mitchell of the Benton Harbor (Michigan) High 
School has explained a plan * (presumably in operation in 
that school), by which the high school codperates with 
private correspondence-schools, not only giving credit for 
graduation for subjects so studied, but by providing 
rooms, library, equipment in the school, and a director of 
the correspondence-study department to guide, encourage, 
and assist the pupils in their work.

  252 BASIS OF ELECTIVE CHOICES 
B. WHAT CAN BE DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
The Range of Electives Should be Determined by 
Local Conditions.—The plans explained above are worthy 
of emulation, to the extent that the problems they are 
planned to solve exist elsewhere. Each school has its own 
problems; it should seek out the courses taken too gen- 
erally because they are easy, and see to it that they are 
“stiffened up;”’ it should devise plans that conserve the 
valuable features of the free elective system, while mini- 
mizing its abuses.° 
By reference to the schematic arrangement given under 
the Application of Principles III and IV, the reader can 
get a general plan for arranging for adequate elective 
classes by the use of a six-period day. The earlier electives 
are primarily exploratory in function, and give way to 
curriculum-prescriptions or curriculum-variables for which 
they prepare. The latter electives offer opportunities for 
activities more or less unrelated to the curriculum purposes, 
or for more extensive and intensive work in the curriculum 
courses. This choice between finding one’s hobby outside 
or within one’s vocation is similar to the choices that adults 
make for themselves.

WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE OF 
MODIFICATION? 
TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH PRINCIPLES 
Preliminary statement: 
Principles I and II were statements of the general 
philosophy underlying the planning of the secondary pro- 
gram of studies; the next three dealt with the general 
administrative questions regarding its organization; the 
six that followed dealt with the core-curriculum, curricu- 
lum-prescriptions and electives. Principles XII and XIII 
deal with the manner of bringing about such a readjust- 
ment as is necessary to satisfy the requirements so far 
set forth. 
The Teachers’ Professional Status is Gaining Recog- 
nition.—The time has passed, if there ever really were such 
a time, when a teacher who has mastered certain conven- 
tional skills and knowledges (that had been practically 
unchanged for generation after generation) can be con- 
sidered a successful secondary teacher, because he succeeds 
in passing the same skill on to his pupils. Unless he con- 
ceives his task as recreating and modifying his subject- 
matter and methodology in accordance with his pupils’ 
interests and needs, and with the rapidly changing social 
conditions and problems, the teacher is a mere cog in a 
machine of which he has no direct control. 
253 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  254 PROCEDURE OF MODIFICATION 
TWELFTH PRINCIPLE 
THE CURRICULUM NEEDS TO BE CHANGED FROM TIME 
TO TIME 
The Curriculum, Like Life, is Constantly in Process 
of Adaptation Communities and community life change, 
industrial and commercial procedures change, the social 
and political world changes, educational science and phi- 
losophy change, and the program of studies consequently 
needs a, periodic overhauling to keep in harmony with these 
new developments. In a growing or otherwise changing 
community a critical study is peculiarly necessary, because 
the needs of the pupils differ from school to school, and 
from year to year. Ideally, the curriculum should be in a 
constant state of revaluation and, adaptation. 
This principle ought, perhaps, to be so self-evident that 
it should require neither defense nor application; indeed 
it may seem superfluous even to state it. But so well 
recognized is the attitude of those who have what Wells, 
in his essay on the Discovery of the Future, calls the “ legal 
mind,” those who accept a printed curriculum as authority, 
and who somewhat resent the suggestion that new times 
raise new problems, that the reason for stating this prin- 
ciple may be clear. The attitude that all who deal with cur- 
ricula should have is that today is the threshold between 
yesterday and tomorrow, that those standing on the thresh- 
old are all about to step into the morrow, and that none 
can go back to yesterday. While we may adjust ourselves 
to the tomorrow better because of the experiences of yes- 
terday and today, nevertheless, we must realize that the 
morrow brings its own problems, and that no curriculum
-P-A-G-E-265
  
THIRTEENTH PRINCIPLE 255 
made out to fit yesterday’s needs is likely to be entirely 
satisfactory tomorrow. 
The natural conservation of human nature as well as 
the tendency towards reorganization rather than recon- 
struction, even when the latter is sorely needed, should be 
guarded against. 
THIRTEENTH PRINCIPLE 
THESE CHANGES CAN BEST BE MADE BY THE INTEL- 
LIGENT COOPERATION OF TEACHERS, SCHOOL OFFICIALS, 
AND INTERESTED COMMUNITY GROUPS. 
Teaching is Inseparable from the Curriculum.—The 
actual operation of a curriculum-organization and particu- 
larly of teaching a course of study, depends on the whole- 
hearted and intelligent enthusiasm of the teachers. Unless 
they are in accord with what they are doing, directions as 
to topics or methods are futile. For, since education is 
interested in making changes in people by controlling 
their experiences and reactions, we must realize that teach- 
ers are a part of nearly every educational situation that the 
school provides. The teachers are in this sense insep- 
arable from the curriculum—it must be theirs or they 
cannot be active agents in carrying it out. 
The difficulty that progressive supervisors and admin- 
istrators have experienced in getting modifications into 
operation, because the teachers have not understood and 
sympathized with the changes, is proof that teachers can 
be powerful agents for reform if they do feel a propulsive 
interest in the change. Indeed, the continuity of progres- 
sive policy depends in most communities on the active 
advocacy of changes by the teachers, rather than on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  256 PROCEDURE OF MODIFICATION 
individual zeal of a principal or superintendent whose 
tenure is uncertain, or who is likely to find professional 
advancement in a new field. 
Much is being written about scientific curriculum-build- 
ing ; and in certain fields of study; e.g., the social sciences, 
mathematics, and spelling, there is now some real achieve- 
ment based on careful investigation and measurements. 
If, however, the results of such studies are to be most 
effective in modifying the curriculum, it is necessary 
for teachers to appreciate their significance. Such an 
appreciation is learned by adults by their own activities, 
exactly as children learn their lessons. To attempt to for- 
mulate a set of objectives for a course of study, or to find 
activities that will help children attain these objectives, puts 
one in a problem situation, it induces a mind-set which 
makes one seek help, it results in a hospitable attitude 
toward the findings of research-specialists that is often 
wanting when teachers are not made partners in curricu- 
lum-making. 
Education Implies Codperative Effort.—This codpera- 
tive effort does not mean that the teachers of each school 
or school system would make the careful scientific inves- 
tigations, nor that they would be expected to discover for 
themselves a philosophical basis for the curricula. For 
these, education depends on its research specialists and 
leaders in thought. It does mean, however, that they will 
become familiar with the results of the best thinking and 
investigations that are available, they will decide on those 
recommended changes that are best adapted to their own 
communities, and that they will ascertain just what these 
mean when applied to the curriculum-problems of the 
particular high schools with which they are connected.

APPLICATION PRINCIPLES XII-XIII 257 
APPLICATION OF TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH 
PRINCIPLES 
A. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
1. Curriculum-modifications Have Largely Been 
Forced by Community Sentiment or Parental Opposition 
to Traditional Subjects—The reorganization of second- 
ary programs of study has been so immensely stimu- 
lated in the past decade, that one scarcely realizes that 
there are sections where almost no change has taken 
place; and that such changes as there have been have 
appeared in the printed statements of the programs of 
study more frequently than in the actual practices.* In 
some communities, the traditional subjects have continued 
almost unchanged for generations; what changes have 
come about have frequently been forced upon teachers 
and administrators instead of being sponsored or wel- 
comed by them. Often they have lacked any forward- 
looking plan of development. 
The changes have come about frequently because the 
public has been unwilling to invest its children’s time in 
the study of Greek, logic, etymology, Anglo-Saxon, sur- 
veying, navigation, sacred geography, ethics, intellectual 
philosophy, and many other subjects that are listed by 
Inglis ? as having been at one time or another subjects 
of the secondary curriculum. 
However, some subjects have, doubtless, been post- 
poned till college level because of the judgment of educa- 
tors that they could best be taken later; e.g., analytical 
geometry, astronomy, medicine, and surgery. And some 
*Cf. Johnson, Newlon and Pickell: Junior-Senior High School 
Administration, p. 172 ff, Scribner Sons, 1922. 
*Inglis, A.: Principles of Secondary Education, p. 143, Houghton 
Mifflin Co., 1917.    
-P-A-G-E-268
258 PROCEDURE OF MODIFICATION 
subjects have surely been encouraged and protected; e.g., 
Latin, algebra, ancient history; for the school teacher’s 
influence has been most frequently and continuously 
exerted in favor of traditional subjects. 
Locally Influential Teachers Have Sometimes Op- 
posed Changes.— Where their conservative spirit has been 
most potent, there has generally been a group of Latin or 
mathematics teachers politically entrenched who have had 
a vested interest in the conventional method and organi- 
zation of the traditional subjects. As new teachers are 
added to the departments over which these powerful vet- 
erans preside, they find it most comfortable to conform 
to the practices approved by their elders. The St. Louis, 
Mo., High Schools, for example, were in 1920, still using 
Wentworth’s algebra, 1893 edition, and until 1917 had 
been using an early edition of Collar and Daniell’s First 
Latin Book, chiefly because of the influence of the older 
teachers who objected to any change, and who were 
strong enough to prevent it. 
Inert Teachers Slavishly Teach “ What is in the 
Textbook.”—Teachers who have themselves come from 
comfortable homes, studied a linguistic-mathematical cur- 
riculum of a conventional high school, then graduated 
from a reactionary liberal-arts college, and immediately 
returned to teach languages or mathematics in a conven- 
tional high school—such teachers, instead of seeking 
better solutions of problems, have slavishly followed text- 
books, and have preferred textbooks like those which they 
themselves studied as school pupils. 
Even good texts make probable a “ preparation for 
recitation’ method. Monroe’s study on “Types of 
Learning Required of Pupils in the Seventh and Eighth ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
  UNIFORM PROGRAMS OF STUDIES 259 
Grades and in the High School” *® casts an interesting 
side-light on this matter. Three hundred seventeen teach- 
ets gave 3042 replies to the question of types of learning 
required. Memorization of the text was most frequent 
(mentioned 467 times), getting’ information to solve 
problems or to answer questions was second. The social 
studies, mathematics, and Latin were the three subjects 
in which, it was stated by the teachers, these types of 
learning were frequent. Unless the curriculum is to con- 
sist of pupil-activities, the teachers can scarcely be active 
contributors to the making of it; for this conception of the 
curriculum assumes that the actual curriculum takes shape 
from day to day. 
Uniform Programs of Studies Adopted by Central 
Authorities are Frequently Not Adapted to the Needs of 
Special Groups of Pupils.—In large cities there are local 
communities in which the need of changed curricula is felt 
more consciously than in other districts. School boards fre- 
quently vote formal approval of a program of studies and 
State Departments approve of them so ceremoniously as 
to make it difficult for the faculty of a high school to 
experiment with the program of studies with a view to 
meeting local conditions. A curriculum-plan once adopted 
may continue to be not unsatisfactory in a community of 
wealth and leisure and “ cultural ” traditions; and this pro- 
gram may be forced on other communities of the city that 
are less influential. 
This condition is most common where one school 
serves an entire district, and where “ foreigners,” or non- 
home-owners are the classes not adequately served. Influ- 
ential people, whose children are all going to conventional 
colleges, find it difficult to see any reason why taxes should   
* University of Illinois, 1923.  
-P-A-G-E-270
  
  260 PROCEDURE OF MODIFICATION 
be levied on them for advanced education of the children 
of non-tax-paying, alien groups. A similar situation exists 
in cities that have a number of “cosmopolitan” high 
schools all following a program of studies laid down by a 
central authority. In Detroit, Michigan, in a junior high 
school observed by the writer in a residential district, 
where nearly all the children were. going to take academic 
or commercial curricula in senior high school, all the boys 
were being forced through a series of industrial prevoca- 
tional try-out courses, which would very likely have been 
meaningful and interesting in an industrial district, but 
which were obviously unsuited and uninteresting to the 
boys observed. 
In the northern section of St. Louis, Mo., not one of 
the three white high schools is situated much below Grand 
Avenue, thirty-six blocks from the Mississippi River. The 
heart of the manufacturing and trading district lies 
between Grand Avenue and the river. The high school 
program of studies, similar or identical for all white high 
schools, is not at all attractive to the great mass of boys 
and girls from the industrial districts, who simply ignore 
the public high school, and so are given slight consideration 
by the school. 
2. Rapid Social Changes and the Resulting Rapid 
Growth of the High Schools are Now Forcing Many, 
Perhaps Most, High Schools to Undertake Adjustments. 
—New subjects or new aspects of accepted subjects appear 
year by year in response to a demand that makes itself felt 
through the press, or through civic associations. In the 
one field of social science there have found their way into 
the program of studies in the past fifteen years, modern 
history, community civics, vocational civics, educational 
guidance, problems of democracy, sociology ; and there has
-P-A-G-E-271
  CURRICULUM-ADJUSTMENTS 261 
been in the last five years, renewed interest in economics 
and general history. In English, mathematics, and some 
other subjects, this activity has affected content and 
method, but has not caused so much change of names. 
SUCH CHANGES HAVE USUALLY COME ABOUT THROUGH 
THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS OF PROGRESS 
a, The School Survey.—These changes are the result 
of social forcts outside the school that are challenging edu- 
cators constantly. In no small degree, the widespread 
demand for school surveys by Chambers of Commerce 
and Boards of Education has been based on dissatisfaction 
with the high school program of studies, and a desire for 
expert advice as to how conditions might be improved. 
b. Teachers’ Consciousness of Pupil Welfare.—While 
the program of studies is feeling the pressure of modifica- 
tion from without, the administrator struggling against 
inertia has frequently found a source of help in the element- 
ary school teachers promoted to the junior high school or 
to the four-year high school. These teachers have been 
teachers of boys and girls rather than of algebra and biol- 
ogy, and are often less inclined to look on any organization 
of subject-matter as sacred. 
c. The Junior High School and Crowded High School. 
—The newness of the problems in the junior high school, 
and in less degree the unusual situations generally facing 
high schools due to increasing numbers, have made some 
modifications necessary. While such modifications have 
not always been improvements on the conventional school 
program, the very fact of their newness makes improve- 
ment more probable. 
d. State Legislation and the Leadership of State 
Education Departments are Sometimes Important.— 
Progressive state departments of education issue bulletins
-P-A-G-E-272
  262 PROCEDURE OF MODIFICATION 
from time to time containing suggestive programs of 
study, description of courses, and advice on school organi- 
zation, all tending to encourage administrators and teach- 
ers to modify their programs, Examples of this are the 
bulletins of the Maryland, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, 
New Jersey, Missouri, and Ohio State Departments of 
Education. In many states, the Legislature requires that 
all pupils study American history, or economics, or prob- 
lems of democracy. In some states there are special grants 
for schools that meet special requirements; such as that 
agriculture be taught. State legislation accepting the pro- 
visions of the Smith-Hughes Vocational Act, encourages 
school districts to develop vocational classes, and continua- 
tion and part-time classes which are generously subsidized 
by the state and nation. 
e. New Types of Textbooks.—A fourth cause for the 
improvement is the enterprise of school-book publishers, 
who are constantly publishing books representing new 
conceptions of purposes, and means for accomplishing 
these purposes. Through agents and through circulars and 
samples, these books are ‘‘ sold”’ to teachers, administra- 
tors, and school boards, and so the program of studies 
is enriched. 
f. Active Teacher-participation in Curriculum-modifi- 
cations.—When teachers select textbooks, as they do more 
and more in American school systems, they also make, for 
practical purposes, the courses of study in the subject for 
which the text is chosen. ‘Teacher-committees within a 
school frequently make outlines’ setting forth suggestive 
problems or topics that may well be taught in connection 
with the texts that are in use. Less frequently, the teach- 
ers of a department may work out the courses that should 
be given, independent of any specific text. 
There has been a rapid increase in the number of
-P-A-G-E-273
  TEACHER PARTICIPATION 263 
school systems and individual schools in which the pro- 
grams of studies, curricula, and courses of study have 
been carefully studied by teachers, supervisors, and admin- 
istrative officers. Among the early examples was St. Louis 
in 1913. There, subject-committees made preliminary 
reports on principles determining content and methods; 
and when, after discussion and revision, this report had 
been accepted by the General Committee, the subject-com- 
mittees made specific recommendations for the work to be 
covered in each grade. When this report was accepted by 
the General Committee and Superintendent of Instruction, 
it was published to be tried out in the schools; after which 
the subject-committees recommended changes to overcome 
difficulties found in the actual use of the courses of study. 
At Decatur, Illinois, 1915; Lincoln, Nebraska, 1916; To- 
peka, Kansas, 1915; Oakland, California, 1918; Berkeley, 
California, 1920; Cleveland, Ohio, 1922, and in many 
other progressive school systems a similar organization for 
curriculum-modification has been used. 
At Denver, Col., a committee on constants (core-cur- 
riculum) for junior and senior high schools first reported. 
Now subject-committees are working on the courses of 
study on the basis of the core-curriculum tentatively 
adopted ; these committees are assisted by experts from the 
nearby schools of education, and by other experts brought 
to Denver for conferences. 
At Los Angeles Teacher-participation Has Been 
Organized Under the Direction of an Expert—At Los 
Angeles, the committees of teachers are actually making 
the curriculum, from the determination of objectives to 
the formulation of the pupil activities by which the objec- 
tives can be attained. The manner in which this is being 
carried out is so instructive that a summary of the instruc- 
I 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
eee ae eee | 
264 PROCEDURE OF MODIFICATION | 
tions left by Dr. Bobbitt after his second period at Los 
Angeles, for guidance in the continuance of the work, is 
given here. Forty committees had been at work for 
a year or more. 
(1) Each committee is asked to check over with Mr. Griffin of the 
Research Department, its platforms in the form of basic assumptions, 
“matter-of-fact statements of policies approved by the department.” 
(2) The committee next is to check up with Mr. Griffin its list 
of objectives aimed at—‘‘ something that is needed in human life,”— 
“whatever is not taken into account in sizing up the proficiency of a 
pupil is not to be set down as an objective.” 
(3) Third, each committee is to check over with Mr. Griffin the 
series of pupil activities that may best attain the objectives; for tech- 
nical skills each objective will have its own list of activities, though 
some activities lead to more than one objective, for history, literature, 
science, etc., “where objectives are largely but aspects of a single 
organic result,” one series of pupil activities are to be formulated. 
(4) Employing these three steps just mentioned for guidance, each 
“committee will have drawn up that series of exercises of every kind 
which make up the day-by-day and week-by-week course of training ” 
so that what every individual pupil should be doing every week can be 
known. (It is interesting to find that the most difficult courses to 
handle in this way have been the social sciences.) When reports are. 
ready they are submitted to the superintendent and assistant superin- 
tendents in charge of junior and senior high schools, and when approved 
by them, referred to the Board of Education for approval, and then 
printed in separate bulletins, for trial in the schools. 
Active Codperation of Business Men, Manufacturers, 
Machinists, and Other Practical Groups.—In some places 
the business men of the community, or other practical 
groups are invited to codperate. 
At Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Superintendent Darling has recently 
recast his commercial curriculum in accordance with recommendations 
of the business men of his community. “The commercial curriculum 
was established in competition with a business college and there 
seemed therefore to have been the necessity for making it a business- 
college course. I discussed the matter with many business men and 
found that they preferred to have the students rather more broadly

v. ii, No. 13, April 9, 1923.  
-P-A-G-E-275
  COMMUNITY COOPERATION 265 
educated in a general way than to have them have advertising, sales- 
manship, commercial law, history of commerce, and the like. We 
people reshaped our course to omit a number of the highly technical 
subjects believing that those subjects will be more readily acquired in 
connection with office work than would the rather more broadening 
subjects, economics, American history, social problems.” * 
At Easton, Massachusetts, in 1910, the writer sub- 
mitted the commercial curriculum of the Oliver Ames 
High School to business men who employed graduates, 
with a questionnaire calling for criticism and advice. As 
a result, not only was the curriculum modified to include 
actual office experience prior to graduation, but places 
were immediately available for graduates even when jobs 
were scarce. 
At Trenton, N. J., Director of Commercial Education 
Lomax has instituted evening high school courses in real 
estate, salesmanship, and accounting, at the suggestion of 
the Chamber of Commerce; he has also been guided by the 
results of a questionnaire to the business men of the com- 
munity, regarding the office appliances to be installed in 
the high schools. 
At Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the vocational-guidance 
program has been developed with the codperation of a 
committee of employers. 
One of the earliest pieces of codperation with business 
men was that at Rochester, N. Y., directed by Professor 
Nichols of Harvard, who was then director of commercial 
education at Rochester. 
In vocational work, it is customary to have advisory 
committees representing practical men, employers and 
employees, to codperate with the Board of Education and 
its officers in improving the work of the schools. Such

committees have functioned in the writer’s experience at 
Easton, Massachusetts, and at Solvay, New York® 
WHAT CAN BE DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
Flexibility of Procedure and Teacher-initiative Should 
be Encouraged.—The very nature of an ideal curriculum 
—one organized as pupil-activities—would assure its flexi- 
bility. Each teaching-situation, each pupil-response— 
success, failure, sullenness, eagerness, rudeness—modifies 
a detail in a curriculum. 
Whether teachers respond to these needs and opportu- 
nities wisely depends on such factors as training, intelli- 
gence, enthusiasm. A readiness to readjust the programs 
of study of small schools will be promoted by decreasing 
the number of different subjects that any teacher has to 
teach. When the teaching-burden is unreasonably heavy, 
teachers naturally prefer the conventional “ organized” 
subjects that require little independent organization and 
outside preparation. 
Where flexibility is quite lacking, times for changing 
the program might well be fixed by resolution or by-laws 
of the board of education. It would be best, of course, if 
the board of education would approve a general plan, and 
leave the high school officers free to adapt the plan to their 
peculiar, needs. 
Teachers should be expected to familiarize themselves 
with the scientific studies being made in their fields. One 
of the most effective pieces of professional leadership of 
a principal or superintendent is to bring to the attention of 
chairmen of departments or alert teachers, scientific studies 
such as appear from time to time in the Year-books of the

A Bold Philosophy and Patient Effort Are Necessary 
to Guide Social Changes.—Every school system can in 
some measure duplicate the procedure for curriculum- 
modification in the examples referred to above. It should 
be noted, however, that only peculiar circumstances gener- 
ally make possible sweeping revisions. While it is desirable 
that the plan of reorganization be worked out boldly in the 
light of a forward-looking, steering philosophy of educa- 
tion, the actual change will generally have to be carried out 
gradually, adding subjects or forming new curricula that 
seem desirable and justifiable, and dropping subjects not 
justified by the numbers that elect them, or that seem of 
less value than other subjects that can be added. 
If the progressive administrator will invite the thinking 
public to register its opinion, he will find it easy le antici- 
pate public demands that will be made anyway. Public 
progress is going on, and the school can be made most 
effective if it can hold itself ready to consider dispassion- 
ately community demands, and act on the conclusions 
reached. The school of tomorrow will obviously have 
larger and larger numbers of classes in commercial sub- 
jects, and in other special fields, and a corresponding

A Recommended Procedure—(1) Standing commit- 
tees of teachers from all the high school faculties, repre- 
senting teachers of the various subjects, should work with 
the supervisory officers, including the superintendent of 
schools, to determine what curricula should be offered, and 
what subjects each should include in each year, both as 
prescribed studies and as elective studies. 
(2) Similarly, committees of teachers of each subject 
should function as clearing houses for progressive ideas 
and experiments, and make recommendations, in conjunc- 
tion with members of the supervisory staff, including the 
superintendent of schools, for the content and method of 
the various subjects. 
(3) The reports of committees, as approved by the 
superintendent of schools, would then be presented to the 
Board of Education by him with his recommendation 
for adoption. 
Instead of one active spokesman for progress, the 
community will be reached by every active teacher; for 
there are many parents who feel a personal friendship and 
confidence in the teachers of their children.

  CHAPTER XIV 
WHAT DOES GRADUATION MEAN? 
PRINCIPLES XIV, XV AND XVI 
Preliminary statement: 
Hicu school graduation has a conventional significance 
not much more elastic than the bachelor’s degree. Just as 
the degrees from some colleges carry the implication of 
higher grades of work accomplished than the degrees 
granted by other institutions, so the difference in the 
attainments of pupils graduating from different schools is 
very great. 
Confusion Regarding Significance of High School 
Graduation.—There is a great deal of confusion in current 
thinking in regard to the high school diploma. It has 
been recently urged that state laws should deny work-cer- 
tificates to any students below the age of eighteen, and 
to all who have not a high school diploma.t_ The impli- 
cation is that all pupils, if they remained in school, would 
or could ultimately gain a high school diploma. In the 
minds of those who assume this, the diploma signifies that 
so many subjects have been studied for definite lengths of 
time without “ failures ”’ (another conventional, arbitrary 
term), and, therefore, that the award has been made. 
But to many others, the diploma signifies a degree of 
mental power, an ability to do work of “college grade.” 
Here we deal not so much with experiences achieved, as 
with the internal mental growth, native intelligence, bright-

ness. To grant diplomas as a reward of high ability that 
has been given a certain extensiveness and intensiveness of 
experience, has a significance more nearly comparable to 
the leaving-examination certificate of the European sec- 
ondary schools. 
Significance of the “ Quality ” Diploma.—This quality 
diploma is safeguarded by the administration of rather 
rigid curriculum-requirements, refusing “ pass-marks” 
to those who are not successful with subjects studied. A 
bonus of a fraction of a unit credit is sometimes given to 
pupils who succeed in passing their subjects with better 
“ grades ” than mere “ passing marks; ” this is commonly 
called “credit for quality.” More frequently, pupils who 
do exceptionally good work may be permitted to elect 
more than the normal number of courses a year. In either 
case an especially able and industrious pupil may earn the 
high school diploma in fewer semesters than normal pupils. 
It is customary, however, in schools of “ high stand- 
ards,” so to adjust the pass-mark of the courses that indus- 
trious pupils of fair intelligence can pass, but that pupils 
with less than normal ability, no matter how industrious, 
cannot pass. As noted elsewhere, Terman and Proctor 
found for certain California high schools that .go I. Q. 
was the lowest limit of intelligence that could succeed. If 
the diploma is to stand for quality of ability, such a safe- 
guard seems necessary and justifiable. Such a diploma 
may well signify that pupils that earn it are able to do 
“college grade” of work. 
_ Significance of the “ Quantity ” Diploma.—The quan- 
tity diploma, which it is assumed all industrious pupils 
could earn if they should remain in school, is a different 
matter. The graduate of the school that would give the 
quantitative diploma is hard to define in terms of ability, 
   
-P-A-G-E-281
  A COMPROMISE PLAN 271 
Often such a graduate would be unable to do college work, 
could not compete with other high school graduates in 
office work, could not succeed in a training school for 
nurses. All that could be said of him would be that he had 
spent at least six years in school since he entered the 
seventh grade, had been reasonably industrious during 
that time, had taken the number of subjects ordinarily 
required in each grade, and had done as well as his native 
ability warranted. In other words, the secondary course 
would be defined as six years of diversified educational 
experiences (beginning with the seventh grade) through 
which each pupil would develop according to his ability. 
Such a definition would have full justification if the 
school is considered an educational institution, the function 
of which is to give to all the children of high school age 
in the community, educational opportunities suited to their 
abilities, interests, and aptitudes. Under these conditions, 
two groups of pupils would not graduate, (1) those who 
have failed to take advantage of their opportunities in 
that they have insisted on taking courses for which they 
were not suited, and (2) those who have not put forth 
the effort that might reasonably be expected. All others 
would receive diplomas at eighteen or earlier, except as 
illness or other accidental causes might delay the comple- 
tion of the curricula. 
All of this conception would be further complicated 
if the junior college should be accepted as secondary educa- 
tion to be given to all pupils regardless of native ability. 
A Compromise Plan—However, in the following 
pages, a less radical recommendation is made. A compro- 
mise plan is set forth, because it represents the most 
advanced ground that can safely be taken at present, with 
the double meaning attached to the conception, high school
-P-A-G-E-282
  272 WHAT DOES GRADUATION MEAN? 
graduation. In brief, it is urged that the diploma con- 
tinue to keep its significance as a certificate of ability and 
accomplishment, and that a special certificate be given to 
all others who have done faithful work through the high 
school grades, but whose native abilities are not such that 
the high schools can sponsor them to continue their educa- 
tion in formal institutions of learning. 
FOURTEENTH PRINCIPLE 
FOR GRADUATION FROM SECONDARY SCHOOL, THERE 
SHOULD BE REQUIRED: 
(1) THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF A PURPOSE- 
FULLY PLANNED CURRICULUM; 
(2) A REASONABLE DEGREE OF CONCENTRATION AND 
CONTINUITY OF THE SUBJECT-MATTER; 
(3) TOTAL CREDITS EQUIVALENT TO NOT LESS THAN 
I5 UNITS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION, EXCLUSIVE OF 
CREDITS FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION, CHORAL MUSIC, AND 
THE LIKE. 
Graduation is a Public Recognition of Worth and a 
Pledge to Service——The diploma is the school’s formal 
seal of approval, and as such it should be awarded with 
becoming discrimination. Graduation should be conceived 
to be a ceremonial that is at once an award to those 
who have accomplished a purpose, and a formal pledge 
to use their knowledge and skills with regard for the 
social welfare. 
It Assumes a Balanced Education With Reasonable 
Mastery in Some Fields of Endeavor.—The aims or objec- 
tives of secondary education are to be met as effectively as 
possible by the total educational experience of the pupils. 
The curriculum is the most definitely controlled or pur- 
posefully directed organization of such experiences. The
-P-A-G-E-283
  “UNIT” IS CONVENIENT COUNTER 273 
curriculum followed by each child is presumably carefully 
balanced so as to contribute as a whole to the attainment 
of all the objectives set up. Smatterings from several 
curricula would be less likely to result in well-rounded 
education. If the secondary school diploma should be 
granted only to pupils who have completed the core- 
curriculum of the school and the prescriptions of one 
curriculum, this would assure a reasonable amount of con- 
centration and continuity of education. 
The “ Unit” is a Convenient Counter.—The advan- 
tage of reckoning credits for graduation in terms of 
“Carnegie Units” lies in the wide acceptance given the 
term by colleges and secondary schools. Its purpose, as 
set forth by the Carnegie Foundation Report,’ is to serve 
as a convenient counter for the relation between the high 
school and college, to make possible a process of calculat- 
ing college-entrance requirements in easy and natural 
terms. All colleges and secondary schools that are mem- 
bers of the North Central Association of Colleges and 
Secondary Schools, of the Association of Colleges and 
Secondary Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, of 
the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools, and of similar associations of the South and of 
the Pacific States, and all colleges associated with the 
College Entrance Board, have defined high school grad- 
uation, so far as it affects admission to college, in terms 
of this quantitative counter, the ‘‘ Carnegie Unit.” 
Its shortcoming lies in the fact that it is defined in 
merely quantitative terms.* It needs to be given a quali-

tative definition. It is not sebtigh that a pupil has studied 
Latin or history four or five prepared periods a week for 
a year; we need some specific knowledge of what expe- 
riences and what increased abilities were gained in each 
course. This, the “ unit ” does not express. 
The Definition of the Unit.—The following definition 
of the word “ unit” is a condensation of that made by the 
National Conference Committee on Standards of Colleges 
and Secondary Schools. 
A unit represents a year’s study in any subject in a 
secondary school, so planned as to constitute approxi- 
mately one-fourth of a full year of work for a pupil of 
normal ability. To count as a unit, the recitation-periods 
shall aggregate approximately 120 sixty-minute hours. 
Time occupied by shop- or laboratory-work counts one-half 
as much as time in recitation.* 
FIFTEENTH PRINCIPLE 
A CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO 
THOSE PUPILS WHO HAVE CARRIED THROUGH TO COM- 
PLETION THE WORK OF ANY CURRICULUM OR ITS EQUIVA- 
LENT WITH REASONABLE EFFORT, BUT WHO FOR ANY 
REASON HAVE NOT FULFILLED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR 
A DIPLOMA. 
The Certificate is a Recognition of Growth, and a 
Record of Work Completed—Such a certificate states 
clearly what work has been completed and the units with 
which the holder has been credited toward a diploma. This 
serves as a matter of record, to protect the school, and to 
aid in transfer of credits if the holder continues his educa- 
tion later. Furthermore, it serves as a reasonable and 
proper recognition of effort and growth. It can be granted

Standards for Secondary Schools, 1921.

-P-A-G-E-285
SIXTEENTH PRINCIPLE 275 
to pupils who have failed to win a diploma due to lack of 
mental ability, illness, change of schools, and the like. 
It Would Lend Itself to Many Uses.—Since it would 
have no conventional significance such as attains to the 
regular high school diploma, it can be granted to all pupils 
who complete curricula requiring less than the completion 
of fifteen units above the eighth grade; for example, a 
Smith-Hughes two-year curriculum. It can be granted 
at other times than on graduation day; and it can give 
recognition of “ extracurriculum ” and extraschool activ- 
ities that are known to have educational value, but which 
it is difficult to credit toward conventional graduation. The 
certificate will be of especial value in making it possible for 
pupils who have tried but failed in elementary courses, 
to be given the opportunity to take advantage of the 
advanced instruction, without the assumption that this 
leads to graduation. 
Such a certificate of completion would not in any way 
interfere with the conventional esteem in which the 
diploma is held. It would, indeed, make possible the more 
accurate definition of the conventional “ graduation.” 
SIXTEENTH PRINCIPLE 
INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION SHOULD BE 
URGED TO ACCEPT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION TO SATISFY 
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS, WITHOUT IMPOSING SPECIAL 
SUBJECT-MATTER EXAMINATIONS.

shown that school records of pupils furnish far more accu- 
rate prognoses of probable success in college than do the 
examinations in the subjects conducted by the College 
Entrance Examination Board. And yet these examina- 
tions are very carefully planned, and are administered with 
the greatest regard for justice to the individuals tak- 
ing them. 
Beatley has studied the relative prognostic value of 
secondary school records and examination-marks for judg- 
ing the probable success of students in the first and second 
years at college. For this study, he used the records of 
students who entered by the new plan taking four com- 
prehensive examinations. He gives also the results of a 
similar earlier study by Lincoln, who used the records of 
students who entered by the old plan, which required 
examinations on fifteen or more units of secondary 
school work. |   COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION (R) BASED ON GENERAL AVERAGES *

APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES XIV-XVI 277 
APPLICATION OF FOURTEENTH, FIFTEENTH AND 
SIXTEENTH PRINCIPLES 
A. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
1. Usage Has Been Varied and Confusing in Reckon- 
ing Credits for Graduation—As bases for credits for 
graduation, prepared recitations per week, or per semester, 
Regents’ “ counts” and other arbitrary credit-awards are 
still common. Frequently pupils have been graduated who 
have picked up the requisite number of credits, but in 
most diverse fields, with few subjects pursued beyond ele- 
mentary courses—a planless and purposeless collection of 
smatterings. 
The granting by many four-year high schools of a 
school diploma for short curricula, particularly two-year 
commercial curricula, is often resented by those who are 
obliged to work twice as long for a school diploma from 
the four-year curricula. With the introduction of Smith- 
Hughes short curricula, continuation-classes, and corre- 
spondence-school classes, a well-considered policy is 
necessary, if the proper significance is to be retained for 
the terms “ graduation”’ and “ diploma.” 
On the other hand, pupils are frequently given no 
credit whatever for work failed, whether because of lack 
of effort, lack of ability, illness, or other cause; indeed, 
often no office record is made. Pupils who leave school 
before completing secondary school are generally given no 
record of what they have accomplished. 
College Preparation Tends to Become the Prime 
Function of Many Schools—The  college-preparatory 
function of the secondary school is of such great impor- 
tance to the more influential elements in the community, 
particularly to those parents whose children are aiming to  
-P-A-G-E-288
  278 WHAT DOES GRADUATION MEAN? 
go to college, and to young men and women who are now 
in college or who have recently graduated, that adminis- 
trators and teachers naturally are frequently overanxious 
that graduates make a good showing on entrance-examina- 
tions. Sometimes it happens that the preparation for 
examination-taking is the poorest possible preparation for 
pupils who, after entering college, take courses in which the 
power of independent thought is needed. Preparatory 
courses have as objectives the memorization of facts and 
development of skills that are most likely to appear on the 
college-entrance examinations. These objectives do not 
conform to such purposes as those stated in the first and 
second principles. 
The effect on the secondary school that emphasizes 
preparation to take college-entrance examinations is to give 
this not only priority over the school’s function as an 
educational institution, but even almost exclusive control 
over its choice of pupils to be retained, and the methods 
used throughout all the years of the school. In such 
schools, community civics, problems of democracy, general 
science, and general mathematics may very likely not be 
offered, because Smith and Wellesley do not recognize 
them! Such courses do not lend themselves toan entrance- 
examination outcome, their purpose being to give educa- 
tional experiences, rather than mere organized, systema- 
tized, and easily summarized facts. 
College Entrance Examinations Select the Candidates 
Who are Prepared to Pass Examinations.—College- 
entrance examinations in subjects gréatly favor two classes 
of candidates ; (1) those whose parents are wealthy enough 
and sufficiently eager for their sons and daughters to enter 
restricted colleges, to hire tutors or to send them to special 
preparatory schools; and (2) those who have so great a |

UNIFORM GRADUATION BRO 
social drive that they are willing to master the mechanical 
processes and facts necessary to pass examinations, but too 
frequently of little value for any other purpose. In many 
secondary schools the closing months of courses on which 
examinations are to be held, are given over to practicing 
examination-taking with papers of previous years. Indeed, 
there have appeared on the market copies of the questions 
in each subject-examination set by the College Entrance 
Examination Board for the past few years with correct 
answers to be memorized by candidates, with the hope of 
meeting such questions again. In the Rural School Survey 
of New York State it was discovered that some high 
school teachers were teaching. high school subjects by 
means of Regent’s Examination review-books. 
2. Influential Educational Bodies Have Popularized 
and Standardized a Uniform Graduation Requirement.— 
The National Education Association Committee on Ar- 
ticulation of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the North 
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the 
College Entrance Examination Board, and other influen- 
tial bodies have popularized the use of the term “ unit,” 
and have standardized the graduation requirement for 
the four-year high school as fifteen units, including 
two majors of three units each, and two minors of two 
units each. 
Well-planned Curricula Usually Comply With This 
Principle.—If the core-curriculum prescribes a major of 
English and at least a minor of social studies, then cur- 
riculum-presctiptions of a major in one subject and a 
minor in another, there would still remain opportunity for 
as many as five units to be earned in scattering courses, 
which surely allows sufficiently for distribution. For exam- 
19
-P-A-G-E-290
    280 WHAT DOES GRADUATION MEAN? 
ple, a commercial curriculum would contain English, social 
study, physical education, and perhaps other subjects from 
the core-curriculum ; it would prescribe for all commercial 
curriculum pupils, perhaps, office practice, arithmetic, and 
exploratory courses in bookkeeping, typewriting, stenog- 
raphy, salesmanship; i.e., ‘ curriculum-prescriptions ;” 
it would offer alternatives in the senior high school for 
specialization, bookkeeping and accounting, or stenography 
and typewriting, or salesmanship; i.e., “ curriculum-varia- 
bles,” and it would permit free elections of foreign lan- 
guage, or art, or mathematics, or practical arts. 
Junior-Senior High School Adjustments are Made.— 
The most common “best practice” for graduation from 
the three-year senior high school, is the acceptance of 
three or four units of junior high school work, and the 
requirement of eleven or twelve additional units to be 
earned in the senior high school. If more than four units 
of junior high school work are credited, it is equivalent to 
making the senior high school less than a three-year 
school. The University of Chicago High School meets 
this situation by making the junior high school a two- 
year school, and retaining the senior high school as a 
three-year school. 
For pupils who complete curricula of less than fifteen 
units, certificates are frequently given by high schools, 
and occasionally a statement is given to any pupil who has 
completed at least a half year’s work, similar in form to 
the one that it is customary to transmit to the director of 
continuation-education in cities conducting such schools. 
Office records in most efficiently conducted secondary 
schools contain full information concerning the school 
activities of every pupil who has attended the school, and 
sometimes this record is amended for several years after
-P-A-G-E-291
  
WHAT SCHOOLS CAN DO Bh gSt 
the pupil has left, showing where he is employed or what 
other educational institution he is attending. 
All Colleges are Becoming Reasonable as Fast as 
Their Progressives Can Overcome Inertia—Practically 
all colleges accept candidates for admittance who have 
satisfactorily completed the necessary subjects in high 
school, with high marks, and who are certified as being 
morally and socially desirable young men and women. 
This practice is almost universal except in the north- 
eastern sections of the country. Some twenty-six or 
more colleges have followed the lead of Columbia Uni- 
versity in admitting students who have completed their 
high school work very successfully, on the basis of intelli- 
gence-tests.° Harvard has taken the bold step of accept- 
ing boys of satisfactory moral and social characteristics, 
who have graduated from school in the upper 15 per cent. 
of the class. Dartmouth and some other colleges put great 
importance on the character and school activity of the 
candidates, as well as the record of scholarship. The 
women’s colleges also ask for somewhat the same infor- 
mation, but have not used it in deciding admissions so 
openly as has been done in some men’s colleges. President 
Comstock, in her inaugural address at Radcliffe, urged 
that more attention be paid to the personalities of appli- 
cants ; she suggested personal interviews, such as are used 
in selecting applicants for Swarthmore College and 
Antioch College. 
B. WHAT CAN BE DONE BY SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
Purposefully Planned Curricula Would Satisfy These 
Principles—Each curriculum should be organized so pur- 
posefully that pupils who complete it successfully will   
°From notes on statement of Dr. Ben Wood at Meeting of 
Secondary Group of Teachers College, November, 1922. 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  282 WHAT DOES GRADUATION MEAN? 
have attained the major objectives. Graduation would 
then symbolize a definite attainment whereas now too fre- 
quently the young men and women who complete high 
school have accomplished nothing more definite than fif- 
teen units. 
Records Should Show Progress of Pupils in All 
Activities—Scholastic, Social, Vocational, and Athletic. 
—For both the diploma and the certificate of completion, 
records of absolute achievement may well be shown, if 
satisfactory standard tests are available.1° Thus a pupil 
who is granted the certificate because of faithful work 
through four years, who entered with the ability to write 
a composition as good as quality 4 on the Huddleston 
English Composition Scale, would be shown to be now 
able to write composition equal to quality 5. Similarly, 
in spelling, punctuation, reading, grammar, beginning and 
ending test-results can be shown. In subjects other than 
English and foreign languages, test results at the end of 
the courses are more just and useful. 
Office records should also note the citizenship quali- 
ties, athletic and “extracurriculum ” activities, vacation 
employment or travel, out-of-school study of music or 
other employments. All experiences of educational value 
are worthy of consideration in the school record. 
The influence of the school in the lives of the boys and 
girls who have attended the school can be continued in 
many cases by “return postal card follow-up,” sent out 
several times a year asking for information as to present 
address, employment, further schooling, and explaining 
at the same time the advantages the evening high school 
has to offer, urging attendance at alumni meetings, and 
the like.

QUALITATIVE DEFINITION 283 
Graduation Credits Should All be Earned in the Unit 
by Which the Diploma is Granted.—Secondary schools 
should define graduation in terms of units earned in the 
secondary school unit directly concerned. Senior high 
school graduation might well depend on 12 units, of work 
done in the senior high school. The North Central Asso- 
ciation of Colleges and Secondary Schools has formally 
approved such a definition, as has the National Associa- 
tion of Secondary School Principals. The North Central 
Association recommends: +? 
“(1) That colleges provide an alternative plan to the present 
system of entrance-requirements, said plan to call for twelve entrance- 
units, all of which are to be done in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth 
grades. 
“(2) That the colleges in restating their entrance-requirements 
consider the following definite suggestions as to distribution of units. 
“A major of 3 units 
Two minors of 2 units each (4 units) 
Electives 5 units 
12 units 
“a, English shall be offered either as a major or minor. 
“b. Nine of the twelve units shall be in academic subjects. 
“c, The two minors may be specified by any university for entrance 
to any college.” 
Within Limits a Qualitative Definition is Feasible.— 
Frequently pupils because of special abilities, social inher- 
itance, or out-of-school experience and effort, are able to 
perform the grade of work of an advanced unit without 
having spent 120 sixty-minute hours completing a prelimi- 
nary unit. The common-sense solution of such a difficulty 
is to let the pupil work with the advanced section, receiv- 
ing credits for both preliminary and advanced units. Such

Entrance Requirements.”   
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  284 WHAT DOES GRADUATION MEAN? | 
a solution would be possible in most intelligently con- 
ducted schools, and should be allowed in all schools. 
Extra credit for work of high character may be 
granted absolutely; e.g., as 1.2 units’ credit for a unit 
course completed with honor; or it may be granted in 
effect by the acceleration of capable pupils in homogeneous 
groups; e.g., the group may complete three units of 
French in two years. Each of these plans is in successful 
operation and the schools using them are generally enthu- 
siastically in favor of them. 
A Clear Definition of the Preparatory Function of 
High School is Needed.—The secondary school should 
endeavor to define its preparatory function in such a way 
as to protect the rights of those not going to college, and 
to assure to those who are aiming to take entrance exam- 
inations, more permanently valuable skills, knowledge, 
interests, and attitudes, than those necessary to pass 
examinations. This position when defined will have to be 
popularized constantly by explaining it to parents and 
pupils, to women’s clubs, and to other influential groups 
and individuals in the community. Such groups are best 
convinced, if they can be helped to convince-themselves ; 
sometimes they can be interested in the progress of home 
economics or commercial curriculum-groups, or again in 
analyzing the college, social and intellectual activities for 
which pupils should be given practice in preparatory school. 
An earnest effort should be made, while formulating 
or modifying curricula and courses to study, to obtain 
preliminary criticism of the proper officers of the colleges 
to which graduates commonly go to assure their sympa- 
thetic understanding of the changes, and to secure, if 
possible, their formal approval of the modifications. 
Schools Should Take Advantage of Liberal College’s 
Requirements.—College admission requirements doubtless

SCHOOLS SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE 285 
have an undue influence on graduation definitions. But 
there are few colleges that make unreasonable demands. 
The difficulty seems rather to be that principals of high 
schools have not accurate information, or lack the courage 
to advise pupils to take advantage of more liberal require- 
ments. With only insignificant exceptions, no men’s col- 
leges require any ancient language for candidates for the 
B. S. degree, and many high-grade women’s colleges have 
ceased to specify it. No subject should be prescribed in a 
college-preparatory curriculum for the purpose of meeting 
college requirements, that is not demanded by the most 
liberal high-grade institutions to which any of its grad- 
uates are likely to go. Subjects needed for admission to 
the less liberal colleges should be elective if reasonable 
numbers desire them; if not, pupils should prepare them- 
selves at privata expense, for which the public secondary 
school would credit them toward graduation. 
More and more emphasis is now being placed by many 
colleges on both the scholastic record of candidates and 
the record of their participation in student and community 
activities. -But it remains true that educational progress 
throughout the East and even in residential suburbs of the 
Middle West, is hampered because of the social position 
and political strength of the parents of girls who are 
planning to enter Smith, Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, and 
Holyoke, and who therefore need to be trained for exam- 
ination-taking. 
If the high school is to be freed of the college-prepara- 
tory incubus, there must be frank codperative consideration 
by college and high school officers of the problems involved 
in the fulfilment of the broader aims of secondary educa- 
tion. Thus would be removed one outstanding obstacle to 
curriculum-adjustment in the secondary school,

PART I 
CHAPTER I—WHAT IS THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
TRYING TO DO? 
Bluntschli, J. K.: The Theory of the State. Translated from Sixth 
German Edition. Clarendon Press, Oxford, Eng., 1885. 
According to the translators, the author has attempted 
“to do for the European state what Aristotle accomplished 
for the Hellenic.” Book I traces the evolution of the 
conception of the state. Book V explains that the state 
is a means rather than an end. Book VI discusses the 
sovereignty of the state, and its differentiated functions. 
Bryce, James: The Hindrances to Good Citizenship. Yale University 
Press, 1909. 
Three main hindrances dealt with are: indolence, pri- 
vate self-interest, and party-spirit. In lecture IV, Bryce 
has stated that the hope for overcoming these hindrances 
lies in the new generation which “can make the traditions 
that it finds better or worse.” Statesmen, teachers, writers, 
and journalists are forming the minds of modern nations 
to an extent previously unknown. 
Bryce, James: Modern Democracies. The Macmillan Co., 1921. 
Part I of Volume I describes the evolution and theory 
of democracy, and its relations to certain institutions. 
Chapter VIII deals with education: Part III contains 
examinations and criticisms of democratic institutions, and 
reflections on the present and future of democracy. 
Bode, Boyd H.: Fundamentals of Education. The Macmillan Co., 1921. 
From the standpoint of pragmatic philosophy, the 
author seeks an answer for questions of education involv- 
ing values and ideals. The conventional notion of culture, 
he says, has led to a disregard for legitimate human 
interests, and so has hindered the development of common 
interests and a sense of common life. 
Dewey, John: Democracy and Education. The Macmillan Co., 1916. 
“ ....the philosophy stated in this book connects the 
growth of democracy with the development of the experi- 
mental method in the sciences, evolutionary ideas in the 
biological sciences, and the industrial reorganization, and 
is concerned to point out the changes in subject-matter 
and method of education indicated by these developments.”

Dewey, John: Human Nature and Conduct. Henry Holt Co., 1922. 
Human psychology is social, customs are fixed social 
habits; they are altered often almost unconsciously by 
“impulses ”—original instinctive tendencies to respond 
“naturally,” rather than in accordance with custom. 
Human progress depends on liberations from customs by 
means of the readjustments of habits and institutions; in 
this process impulses are pivotal. 
Lippman, Walter: Drift and Mastery. Henry Holt and Co., 1917. 
The issues that must be faced by the American people 
now and in the immediate future, are very different from 
those of the last century and a half. Theirs is a new 
freedom. They must learn to use it in an environment that 
is without precedent in the history of the world. 
Lippman, Walter: Public Opinion. Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1922. 
Public opinion is the force that governs politics and 
social relations. What it is, what controls it, to what 
uses it may be put are questions of fundamental impor- 
tance to secondary education. The pupil must learn how 
his mind works on unfamiliar facts, so that he may deal 
with the world about him with a great deal more sophisti- 
cation about his own mind. 
Wallas, Graham: Our Social Heritage. Yale University Press, 1921. 
These lectures deal with “that part of our ‘nature’ 
which we acquire by the social process of teaching and 
learning.” Emphasis is put on the importance of trans- 
mitted habits, powers, concepts, ideals, and institutions, 
rather than on knowledge as such. 
Robinson J. H.: The Mind in the Making. Harper and Bros., 1921. 
This essay, in the words of the author, “suggests but 
the beginning of the beginning now being made to raise 
men’s thinking onto a plane which may perhaps enable 
them to fend off or reduce some of the dangers, which 
lurk on every hand.” The mind of man has as yet realized 
but few of the infinite possibilities before it.

Mifflin Co., 1917.

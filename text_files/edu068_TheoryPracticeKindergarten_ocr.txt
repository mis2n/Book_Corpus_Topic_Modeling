EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tue kindergarten is about to come into its own. 
For years it has been an institution little appre- 
ciated among the general run_of Sober-minded_ 
school-folk:~‘Traditionally it has worn an air of 
happy~playfulness that concealed its educative 
worth from minds that are wont to see pedagog- 
ical value only in the difficult and the irksome. 
The most it received from pedagogues was a 
kindly tolerance which expressed the conven- 
tional belief that young tots are privileged to be 
pleasantly entertained while they are waiting for 
the responsible age of six to arrive. 
But recent years of thought have greatly 
changed the professional status given to the kin- 
dergarten. Kindergartners..themselves_have be- 
come critical of their own doctrines. They now 
speak less of a mystical language and more of a 
scientific one.-They have reinterpreted Froebel- 
ian principles in terms of modern psychological 
wisdom, and made both their words and their 
deeds more intelligible to the ordinary student 
of education. yii

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
If the kindergartner is more comprehensible, 
the school-teacher is more comprehending. She, 
too, thinks more in general laws of psychology 
and less in the grooves of ancient pedagogical 
habit. She is receptive, in fact eager, to know 
any institutional experiences and resources which 
will offer proved ways and means of realizing 
modern pedagogical principles. More particu- 
larly is this true of primary teachers who work 
with children of near-kindergarten age. Already 
the more progressive among them know, appre- 
ciate, and utilize the principles and practices of 
the kindergarten. Soon all teachers in the ele- 
mentary school will wish to understand and apply 
those truths regarding human growth which 
Froebel exposited. 
The current professional interest in the kin- 
dergarten attaches to more than the teachers of 
the youngest children. The school executive and 
the educational theorist have been roused to an 
open-minded interest in the kindergarten. A 
constantly accumulating experience with play- 
grounds has led the schoolmaster to attach a 
new respectability to naturalistic modes of learn- 
ing. A popular interest in the doctrines and 
methods of Madame Montessori has exerted a 
pressure on the minds of school managers, forc- 
viii

ing them to think critically of prevailing proce- 
dures in the education of young children. The 
resulting appraisal has been favorable to the 
kindergarten, especially where its practice has 
been revised so as to conform to twentieth-cen- 
tury information about childhood. Now super- 
intendents and boards of education discuss most 
earnestly the issue, Shall the kindergarten years 
become part of the universal provisions of a reg- 
ular system of public schools? The answer given 
will depend on many factors in the argument, 
but one — the clear comprehension of the kin- 
dergarten itself — will be primary and funda- 
mental. 
To offer a small treatise which will satisfy the 
new interest of the public, the school adminis- 
trator, and the class-teacher is a considerable 
service. The volume that follows offers more. It 
is a simple and helpful guide to the young kin- 
dergartner who hesitates between conservative 
dogma and radical theory, and knows not which 
way to turn. This monograph offers an excellent, 
working reconciliation of the worthy elements in 
both the old and the new kindergarten. More- 
over, the readable form of the presentation will 
insure it a hearty welcome.

  THEORY AND PRACTICE OF 
THE KINDERGARTEN 
I 
THE CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
*In the kindergarten, as in the home, certain 
fundamental principles underlie the work of 
child-training. The kindergartner comes from 
the training-school with a more or less distinct, 
or perhaps with a more or less hazy, idea of the 
principles of psychology and pedagogy as applied 
to the immediate needs of teaching. Her mind, 
as well as her notebook, is primed with theory. 
She has had a modicum of practice. Of the actual 
conduct of a kindergarten as a whole, and of the 
problems involved, she is largely ignorant. When 
for the first time she is confronted with from 
thirty to forty-five little children for whose train- 
ing she is to be held responsible, she is suddenly 
and very vividly made conscious of the fact that 
her psychology and her pedagogy must now be 
translated into terms of practical experience if 
she is to meet successfully the problems that 
beset her.

THE KINDERGARTEN 
The nature of the kindergarten 
° The kindergarten should partake of the nature 
of the home) while foreshadowing the more formal 
life of the school that is to follow. *There should 
be no distinct break between the home and the 
kindergarten, for the kindergarten is in reality 
only an enlarged home. It is the easy process for 
the kindergarten to degenerate into a sort of sub- 
primary school, and to lose entirely the sugges- 
tion of the home. The problem of keeping a 
happy balance between control and spontaneity, 
of holding steadily to the principle of freedom 
under law, presents so many difficulties and per- 
plexities, that the young kindergartner is apt 
to give up the ideal as unattainable and to fall 
into that class of mechanical kindergartners who 
in time forget that they ever held ideals of better 
things. 
Two types of kindergartens 
“That subtle, invisible, yet palpable something 
which one feels the moment she enters a kinder- 
garten is the keynote, to the discerning, of the 
character of the work that prevails in that kin- 
dergarten. °It is what we are pleased to call 
“atmosphere.” ¢A kindergarten in which the 
2 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
  CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
children are kept constantly restrained until they 
assume the character of well-mannered puppets, 
responding perfectly to the will of the kinder- 
gartner, does not present an ideal condition} 
Stillness, formalism, routine, suppression of the 
children’s spontaneous activity and of all ini- 
tiative are the marks of such a kindergarten. 
Its atmosphere is deadening. The kindergartner 
herself has lost all power of inspiration. She is 
living on a dead level of mechanism. *This is the 
easy way, we are told, to conduct a kindergarten. 
It saves the teacher; it requires less thought, less 
study, less expenditure of energy, and less waste \ 
of nerve-power. °On the other hand, the kinder- 
garten in which there is the hum of busy activity, 
in which the children, alive and eager, in an at- | 
mosphere of ideal freedom, are carrying on their © 
work and play, gives us a situation where there 
is opportunity for the spontaneity of the children 
to find a natural outlet; where their activity is 
guided into channels of usefulness without de- 
stroying initiative) The atmosphere of this kin- / 
dergarten is charged with spiritual ozone; there 
are light and life here; there are energy and power 
being utilized for good. The kindergartner who 
guides this kindergarten is capable of giving and 
receiving inspiration. For her, ‘‘kindergartning is 
3
-P-A-G-E-10
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
not a craft, it is a religion: it is not an avocation, 
it is a vocation from on high.” Her work is not 
easy. It calls for mental alertness and spiritual 
power; it makes a drain upon her nervous energy; 
it calls for study of her children; it asks of her 
that she bring to bear upon her work all her 
knowledge, all her skill, all her patience, all her 
faith. In short, it demands of her an unswerv- 
ing ideal and in return it gives her a joy that is 
deep and abiding, and a development of mind 
and spirit which steadily enlarges. 
Can there be any question which of these two 
phases of kindergartning, the young kindergart- 
ner fresh from school and full of enthusiasm will 
select? 
A formal and restrained regimen 
To illustrate still further these two types of 
kindergartning, let us visit two kindergartens. 
It is the gift period when we enter the first. 
Fifteen or eighteen children, with hands folded, 
are sitting at their tables, while one of the chil- 
dren is placing the small fourth gifts at the back 
of the tables. After they are all placed, the 
teacher raises her arms, with pointer-fingers 
erect, and says: “Let us find the two front 
corners, the two back corners, the front right 
4
-P-A-G-E-11
  
  CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
corner, the back left corner, the front left corner, 
the back right corner.” The children, as the 
teacher gives the commands, raise their arms and 
with pointer-fingers, in unison, touch the corners 
as called for. There is no animation, no interest, 
neither is there any objection apparent to the 
observer, but entire obedience to the commands 
of the teacher. Supposedly these children know 
that their boxes contain some fascinating blocks, 
but there is no perceptible desire to get at the 
blocks manifested by any of the children. After 
several minutes of the foregoing exercise, the 
children are told to move their boxes to the 
center of the tables, and then, to the accompani- 
ment of song, they open them slowly in unison. 
The teacher now proceeds to give seven uncon- 
nected forms, some by dictation, some by imita- 
tion, which the children follow obediently. There 
is no talk in connection with any of the forms, 
there is evidently no time for it, and there is no 
joy or sense of pleasure evinced by any of the 
children, neither is there seemingly any dislike 
of the process. It is evidently an everyday pro- 
cedure, which is simply accepted as a matter of 
course. Five minutes or less before the close of 
the period, the teacher remarks: “You may 
now make anything you choose.” The spectator 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
breathes a sigh of relief; she is at last to see what 
the children can do. But it takes a moment or 
two for the children to adjust themselves, or 
possibly they are too fatigued for a fresh endea- 
vor, and, alas! before a single form is completed, 
the command comes for the blocks to be put 
away. 
A free and enriched life 
It is also the gift period when we enter the 
second kindergarten. Four children are assisting 
in placing the large fifth gifts before the expectant 
children, some of whom are seated on the floor, 
where a special space has been allotted to them; 
others at the tables. The children watch eagerly 
the four distributors until the last child re- 
ceives his box, when in a quiet tone the teacher 
asks, “What have we been talking about to- 
day?” ‘The farmer,” comes from the children. 
“What,” continues the teacher, —“‘for I am 
not going to let you make just what you choose 
to-day, — what do you think I am going to ask 
you to do with your blocks?” ‘Make the far- 
mer’s house,”’ says one; ‘‘the farmer’s barn,” says 
another. “Yes,” replies the teacher, “I want 
you to make farm-barns, just the sort of barns 
you think a good farmer would build.” ‘You 
6 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  - CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
may take out your blocks,” she continues. The 
boxes are removed more or less rapidly accord- 
ing to the skill of the various children, and the 
children start at once to work. As you watch 
their play, you note that initiative is not wanting 
here: the children handle the blocks with ease 
and assurance, and while there are very distinct 
differences in the forms which you see growing 
under their deft fingers, due in a measure to the 
conceptions of farm-barns which the children 
have, and in a measure to the various tempera- 
ments of the children, every child works with 
eagerness and interest, and in the end the sense 
of achievement, of power, shown by each little 
child, attests the value of this procedure. During 
this gift play, the room is not absolutely still, yet 
there is no disorder, but the best sort of activity. 
A child occasionally calls to a neighbor to see 
something that he has achieved, or to the teacher 
for her advice or commendation. Some of the 
children at the tables sit, some stand, the rule 
evidently being that each may do whatever is 
most convenient for the work in hand. When a 
form is completed, the children are free to go 
and look at it, and comment on it, and so each 
gains through the work of the various members 
of the group. The teacher herself does not fail 
7
-P-A-G-E-14
THE KINDERGARTEN 
to observe each form, to commend its good 
points, to suggest an improvement here or there, 
to criticize in kindly fashion any bit of work that 
is done carelessly, so that the children may add 
to their experience the advantage of her wider 
knowledge. When the hour is ended, each child 
replaces his blocks and carries his box to the 
cupboard. Throughout this period there has 
been for the observer the sense of joyous activ- 
ity. The home spirit is here; the children are 
natural, spontaneous, unaffected. 
The achievement of the preferred type 
The children in the first kindergarten which 
we visited, make up that class of children who 
pass into the primary school, obedient, ready to 
follow commands, but so lacking in initiative that 
they are lost when left to themselves, and in the 
end bring down the condemnation of the primary 
teacher upon kindergartens and kindergarten 
methods. On the other hand, the children of the 
second kindergarten observed, form that class of 
children who bring joy to the primary teacher. 
They enter the primary school alert, intelligent, 
abounding in initiative, self-reliant and self-con- 
trolled. 
Again, is there any question which of these 
8
-P-A-G-E-15
CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
two kindergartens shall stand as a model of kin- 
dergarten procedure, for the beginning kinder- 
gartner? 
The basic importance of a true conception of 
freedom 
Granted that we prefer the atmosphere of 
freedom and self-activity to that of restraint and 
imposed activity, how is the inexperienced kin- 
dergartner to achieve this desirable end? In the 
first place, she must have a true conception of 
ideal freedom. Freedom does not mean license, 
nor unbridled liberty. It means liberty under 
law. She knows that she herself is only free as 
she obeys given laws. If she disobeys the laws of 
her physical being, she becomes a slave to disease 
and weakness; if she disobeys the laws of the 
moral world, she becomes a slave to unfortunate 
habits, and her mental and spiritual powers are 
lessened; if she disobeys the laws made by man, 
her external liberty is curtailed. She is only 
free, then, as she obeys law. *True freedom is 
sometimes defined as “the opportunity for the 
fullest development of the total self.” This op- 
portunity is enlarged or curtailed as we obey 
given laws. 8This, then, is the type of freedom 
which we desire for our kindergartens — oppor- 
9

tunity for the fullest development of the total 
child.t 
This does not mean that we shall supply an 
ideal environment, furnish all the agencies neces- 
sary for the child’s fullest development, and then 
leave him to grow like a weed by the wayside. 
It means, rather, that having provided as perfect 
an environment as possible, having secured the 
agencies deemed best for stimulating the child’s 
development, the kindergartner shall wisely guide 
the child’s activities into useful channels. Dr. 
Dewey has truly said, “Guidance is not ex- 
ternal imposition. It is freeing the life-process 
for its own most adequate fulfillment.” 2 We 
must not fall into the error of those kindergart- 
ners who, in their reaction from formalism, have 
come to regard the interests of children as the 
center of kindergarten procedure — as the one 
1 It is to be noted that Dr. Maria Montessori, the present- 
day apostle of liberty, does not, as her book attests, stand for 
unbridled liberty. She says: “The liberty of the child should 
have as its limit the collective interest; as its form, what we 
universally consider good-breeding. We must, therefore, check 
in the child whatever offends or annoys others, or whatever 
tends toward rough or ill-bred acts. But all the rest, — every 
manifestation having a useful scope, — whatever it be, and 
under whatever form it expresses itself, must not only be per- 
mitted, but must be observed by the teacher.”

CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
° A Western kindergartner, who has been very 
successful in settlement work, tells us that, at 
the beginning of her work with this class of 
children, she had great difficulty in getting into 
touch with the children. Her usual kindergarten 
procedure fell flat. The children were dull and 
stolid. She could get no response, although she 
tried various methods.* One morning, as she ap- 
proached the school-building, she saw her group 
of stolid little people transformed into lively, ani- 
mated children.*They were playing a game called, 
“The Bluebird,” and the zest and enthusiasm 
with which they were entering into the rather 
meaningless game set the kindergartner to 
thinking. ‘When the children came in, she said 
to them, “Children, will you teach me how to 
play the Bluebird?” The response was instan- 
taneous; and the Bluebird, followed by other 
games of the children’s selection, took the place 
of the carefully prepared morning program. 
«Gradually, she tells us, she was able to lead from 
these interests of the children to games and songs 
of better content, and to plays with gifts and 
other material, until at last she had as happy 
and busy a band of little people as could be 
desired. She found her point of contact, and she 
was not afraid to use it. 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
THE KINDERGARTEN 
*The before-school time — that twenty min- 
utes or more when the children are assembling 
in the morning — is the most precious period of 
the kindergartner’s day. This is the time when 
she comes most closely in touch with her children, 
when they are, as it were, off their guard, and can 
be studied most effectively. Woe be unto that 
kindergartner who neglects this period, or puts 
it to some other use! This is not the time for the 
kindergartner to be preparing her exercises, it 
is not the time for her to be making out her regis- 
ter, nor is it the time for her to visit with her 
assistant. It is the children’s hour: it should be 
sacred to their needs. “It is the time for the per- 
sonal greeting to each little child, for the warm 
clasp of the little hand in the teacher’s own, and 
the word of welcome that makes the child feel 
that his presence adds to the teacher’s joy of the 
day. This sends the child about his work or 
play with an added light in his eye and a warmth 
in his heart that cheers him through the entire 
day. 
One cannot emphasize too strongly the value 
of this personal greeting. The formal good-morn- 
ing which some kindergartners send across the 
morning circle to their children is a meaningless 
courtesy as compared with the personal greeting. 
14 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  
  CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
The children at this period should be happily 
employed in service to the kindergarten. They 
may water the plants, dust the chairs and tables, 
or with miniature hoe and rake prepare the sand- 
bed for the day. That a child may love you, let 
him do something for you: that a child may love 
his kindergarten, let him do deeds of service 
therein. This makes him feel a sense of proprie- 
torship, and a sense of responsibility in the kin- 
dergarten. It knits him to you by the bond of 
service. °It is a pathetic sight to see little chil- 
dren enter a kindergarten room, and walk with 
staid steps to their seats in the circle, and there 
sit like pegs on a board until the regular proce- 
dure of the kindergarten begins. It is refreshing, 
on the other hand, to enter a kindergarten where 
in this before-school time there is an air of life 
and activity; children serving, children playing, 
children in intimate converse with their teacher. 
2 The atmosphere of the kindergarten at this period 
strikes the keynote of the character of the work 
in the kindergarten. It tells its own story. 
A few years ago a kindergarten-trained mother 
entered her little boy in one of the public kinder- 
gartens of a well-known city. At first the boy 
went happily to school: he was full of enthusiasm. 
But there came a day when his step lagged, his 
#5. 
   
-P-A-G-E-22
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
interest seemed gone, he had to be persuaded to 
go at all. The mother, not being able to discover 
any good reason for this change of heart in her 
boy, thought best to keep him at home for a day 
or two. The teacher called at the home on the 
second day of the child’s absence and frankly 
told the mother that the little boy had annoyed 
her by talking, — he was, in short, too sponta- 
neous, —and so she had banished him from the 
kindergarten for a period, and the boy, through 
this punishment, which she acknowledged was 
too severe, had become estranged from her. The 
mother accepted the teacher’s frank statement 
and returned the boy to the kindergarten. The 
child, however, went unwillingly. The mother, 
seeing that he was still in an unhappy state of 
mind, bethought herself of a device whereby the 
teacher and the child might again be brought 
into friendly relations. She took the little boy to 
a florist’s shop, where she purchased a bunch of 
violets which he was to take to his teacher on the 
following morning. The boy, like all children, 
was overjoyed at the idea of taking a gift to his 
teacher. The mother accompanied her child to 
the kindergarten on the following day, and stood 
outside the door where she might watch, unob- 
served, the reconciliation of the child and the 
16
-P-A-G-E-23
    CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
teacher. The teacher sat at her desk, her back 
toward the children, evidently at work on her 
register. The little boy went happily toward her 
and stood for a second at her side; she was un- 
conscious of his presence; he tiptoed around to 
the other side, and, somewhat timidly, pushed 
his violets toward her; she glanced up and with 
the remark, “Oh, yes, put them right on the 
desk,” turned again to her work. The little fel- 
low’s face fell, his chin quivered in his attempt to 
keep back his tears; and the mother, watching 
eagerly at the door, felt her heart sink within her. 
The next day she removed her child from that 
kindergarten. The teacher had missed her oppor- 
tunity because she was not attending to the busi- 
ness of kindergartning. 
Illustrations, both positive and negative, could 
be multiplied attesting to the value of the inti- 
mate relation of kindergartner and child in the 
before-school time. 
The attitude of fairness as essential 
It would seem hardly necessary to say that an 
attitude of fairness in the treatment of the chil- 
dren is another essential in the conduct of the 
kindergarten. Yet it is true that many young 
kindergartners, and some not so young, uncon- 
7
-P-A-G-E-24
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
sciously fall into the habit of favoritism. Freder- 
ick is bright, quick to respond to the appeals of 
his teacher, and in consequence, Frederick is con- 
tinually called upon for various activities in the 
morning circle, in the games, as well as for special 
acts of service for the kindergartner. She for- 
gets that there are other children in the kinder- 
garten with a yearning desire for these oppor- 
tunities which young Frederick monopolizes. 
They may not be so quick to respond, but for 
that very reason they must be sought out and 
brought out and then utilized. AU of the children 
must be given the opportunity for service and for 
leadership in the various activities of the kinder- 
garten. The kindergarten is not a place where 
that precocity of a Frederick or a Mary is to 
be displayed. The slow child, and the diffident 
child, and the dull child are all to have their 
opportunity for activity and service; for it must 
never be forgotten that the kindergarten is insti- 
tuted for the development of the children, — and 
of all the children. 
The use of subtle and varied means of discipline 
§ The subject of fairness in dealing with children 
leads us directly to the subject of discipline in 
the kindergarten. A professor of psychology was 
18
-P-A-G-E-25
  CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
heard to remark: “There is no discipline in the 
kindergarten.”” He would have been more accu- 
rate had he said: “‘The discipline of the kinder- 
garten is a subtle process. It is a part of the total 
procedure: it, therefore, does not stand out dis- 
tinctly as a thing by itself.” 
Variations in the problem 
Dr. Maria Montessori’s statement, that ‘‘dis- 
cipline must come through liberty,” is as true 
in the kindergarten as in the Italian Houses of 
Childhood. *The atmosphere of freedom provides 
opportunity for self-teaching, self-control, and 
self-reliance. These are the fruits which show 
themselves in due time, but at the beginning of 
the year to the young kindergartner, undertak- 
ing for the first time the general conduct of a 
kindergarten, the discipline presents a somewhat 
serious proposition. Here are from thirty to 
forty-five little children of every type, sometimes 
of every nationality; children who have been sub- 
jected to good, bad, and indifferent home train- 
ing, and sometimes to none at all. There is the 
stubborn child, who exhausts all your persuasive 
tactics, and week after week steadily refuses to 
join in the singing of the little folks. “TI will sing 
when I get in the High School,” is his daily re- 
ao)
-P-A-G-E-26
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
joinder to your invitation for him to join with 
the others. There is the diffident child, who, 
to hide her embarrassment, takes on an air of 
bravado and is perpetually making herself the 
center of unlovely attraction. There is the spoiled 
child whose method of bringing his parents, and 
supposedly his teacher, to terms, is to throw him- 
self on the floor and kick vigorously. There is 
the child of adventurous spirit, who already, at 
the age of five, has run away to camp out in a 
neighboring cemetery. There is the child who 
has no sense of property rights and takes what 
does not belong to him, as well as the child who 
has not yet gained a sense of the value of truth- 
fulness. To these may be added the child of the 
over-exercised imagination and the child lacking 
in imagination. There are also a good measure 
of happy, responsive, normal children. Now, to 
bring into a harmonious group these varying ele- 
ments is no small problem. It is right here that 
the kindergartner’s psychology and pedagogy 
ought to stand her in good stead. Her knowledge 
of the universal tendencies of children and their 
significance is a basis on which to interpret the 
individual variances. ‘She must look behind the 
deed to the motive that prompted it. 
A young woman was in charge of a group of

children who were playing a tournament game. 
The children stood in a horizontal line, mounted 
on imaginary chargers. In turn each child, hold- 
ing the wooden sword aloft, galloped around the 
room attempting to take on his sword two hoops, 
which were held high by the teachers. A little 
boy stood at the end of the line patiently and 
expectantly awaiting his turn. When the third 
from the last child started on his round, the 
little boy at the end of the line began to prance 
and throw his head, a veritable imitation of a 
splendid charger. To the onlookers, this child 
was a delightful expression of a being absorbed 
in the game to the exclusion of all else, but to 
the young teacher he was a disorderly child, and 
she at once proceeded to check and condemn this 
exhibition of spontaneous activity.’ To be able to 
distinguish between willful naughtiness and spon- 
taneous activity or superabundant activity is a 
prime necessity in dealing with little children. 
The teacher must train herself in the habit of 
looking for the significance of the acts of her 
children, and must therefore cultivate that dis- 
cernment that will lead her to discriminate be- 
tween essentials and non-essentials. With little 
children there are many acts to be overlooked and 
passed by as of no consequence. She must also 
21
-P-A-G-E-28
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
realize that the child’s acts are not final but trans- 
itional. As Dr. Dewey has said: “The child’s 
present experience is in no way self-explanatory. 
It is not final, but transitional. It isnothing com- 
plete in itself, but just a sign or index of certain 
growth tendencies. As long as we confine our 
gaze to what the child here and now puts forth, 
we are confused and misled. We cannot read its 
meaning. Extreme depreciations of the child 
morally and intellectually, and sentimental ideal- 
izations of him, have their root in a common 
fallacy. Both spring from taking stages of a 
growth or movement as something cut off and 
fixed. The first fails to see the promise contained 
in feelings and deeds which, taken by themselves, 
are unpromising and repellent; the second fails 
to see that even the most pleasing and beautiful 
exhibitions are but signs, and that they begin to 
spoil and rot the moment they are treated as 
achievements.” 
Evenness in discipline 
The kindergartner’s aim, as has already been 
stated, must be to develop the relation of confi- 
dence between herself and the children and to 
maintain an attitude of fairness in all her dealings 
with them. To these essentials must be added 
22 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
eee ee ee eee 
CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
evenness in discipline. There is probably nothing 
in the home that contributes so unfortunately to 
proper child-training as the capriciousness of the 
average mother in dealing with her children. 
There may be some excuse for this in the home, 
but there is none in the kindergarten. Kinder- 
gartning is the supreme business of the kinder- 
gartner, and it is her duty to master all its de- 
tails. "The kindergartner cannot be irritated by 
the idiosyncrasies of the children; neither can she | 
be governed in her control of the kindergarten , 
by her moods and feelings. She must be guided | 
by the abstract Right, the ideal Best Sound | 
pedagogical principles must rule her conduct day | 
in and day out. To do otherwise means failure. ? 
Some one has said that we should look upon | 
each fault of a child as the defect of a virtue, and 
endeavor to instill in the child the virtue lacking, 
rather than to dwell on the fault. This is a safe 
rule, based on good pedagogical procedure, and 
its use in the majority of cases works beneficially. 
So, for instance, the diffident child must be trained 
in self-confidence and courage; the child with the 
overdeveloped predatory instinct, in property 
rights; the overimaginative child must be brought

face to face with facts; while the unimaginative 
child needs the nourishment contained in fairy 
tales and imaginative games. 
Positive and negative methods 
“Forbidding only charms. Don’t teach a child 
to be wicked in order to show him what goodness 
is,” is a familiar maxim, so the substitution of 
the positive Do, for the too familiar Don’t, works 
most happily. The positive method turns the 
child’s attention to new and better forms of ac- 
tivity, which in time become habitual with him. 
There are times when the use of the negative 
method is necessary, and the fact that it is not 
of common occurrence makes it the more effec- 
tive. 
° The habituating of the little child to expres- 
sions and deeds of courtesy is a most important 
phase of child-training. Good-breeding is never 
to be disregarded. The community-life of the 
kindergarten lends itself particularly to this 
phase of child-training, and it should never be 
lost sight of by the faithful kindergartner. “The 
kindergartner herself must embody in her daily 
practice the essence of good-breeding. *For her 
children she is the model, and it is both interest- 
ing and pathetic to see their small attempts to

re-live in their own little lives the qualities in her 
that make a vivid impression upon their plastic 
minds. 
The office of punishment in the kindergarten 
should be remedial. It should be the retributive 
method whenever possible; that method whereby 
the punishment is the natural outcome of the 
misdeed. For the true function of punishment is 
to help the individual to see the nature of his 
error and to point the way whereby he may 
avoid its repetition.* 
1 A little boy who, through heedlessness,neglected to use the 
doormat, to remove the mud from his shoes before entering 
the kindergarten, was given the dustpan and brush and obliged 
to sweep up the dirt which he had brought into the room. 
Two or three applications cured him of this habit. Another 
boy who indulged in the vicious habit of spitting on the floor 
was made to clean up the floor, with a liberal amount of soap 
and water, the process being made somewhat lengthy and 
laborious. The offense was not repeated. A child who per- 
sistently indulged in the habit of striking his fellow playmates, 
and upon whom various forms of isolation had no lasting effect, 
was guilty one morning of a flagrant offense. The kinder- 
gartner, feeling that the time had come for strenuous action, 
took the child from the room and told him in simple language 
that he was not a trustworthy caretaker of his hands, and 
therefore it was no longer safe to allow his hands to be free. 
She then bound his two hands together with broad cotton 
bands, and he was taken back to the kindergarten and given 
his usual seat. Through the morning-circle this little boy was 
permitted to discover what it meant to be deprived of the use 
of his hands. The kindergartner and the children stood ready 
to wait upon him — move his chair, and so forth. The teacher

“Actions speak louder than words” may be 
applied very pointedly to kindergarten disci- 
pline. The young kindergartner who falls into 
the habit of delivering a somewhat prolonged 
dissertation to a child who has committed some 
fault, not only fails to impress the child for whom 
the speech is delivered, but has a most disquiet- 
ing effect on the whole group, as was witnessed 
in a kindergarten not long ago. It was the gam 
period, when one of the children began to pull’ 
and throw the line into confusion and disorder. 
The kindergartner corrected him, but he per- 
sisted in the error of his way. She then stopped 
the game and began to talk to the child, in the 
presence of the group. She continued until the 
whole group was restless and disorderly, and the 
boy had not mended his way. For her children 
her remarks were evidently meaningless. If, on 
the second offense of the child, the teacher had 
promptly removed him from the circle, her act 
would have had meaning, not only for the child 
watched carefully the effect of this punishment, not wishing to 
carry it beyond what the little child could well endure. The 
child accepted it gravely. He took part in so far as he was able 
in all the songs and plays. No resentment was shown, for he 
was very evidently conscious of the justness of it. If it was 
not a complete cure, it certainly proved salutary for a long 
period of time.

CONDUCT OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
at fault, but for the whole group. One positive 
action on the part of the teacher is more salutary 
than reams of talk. The truth of this fact could 
be illustrated again and again in kindergarten 
practice. The children learn that back of all the 
sweetness and light of their teacher, there is a 
stiff moral backbone, and their respect for her is 
enhanced thereby. 
Mr. Denton Snider, in one of his commentaries 
on The Mother Play, calls our attention to the 
fact that the father embodies in his character, 
in a large measure, the principles of justice, while 
in the mother the element of love predomi- 
nates, and the kindergartner, if she is to be a 
wise guardian of little children, must combine in 
happy balance both these qualities — love and 
justice. And so, in guiding her children she must 
often do the hard thing, the thing that makes a 
pull at her heartstrings, if she sees that this is 
the thing necessary for the child’s good. 
Special resources 
The kindergartner has many allies in the con- 
duct of her kindergarten. The self-activity of 
the children, given proper means of expression, 
is a power for good.° Children whose whole selves, 
body, mind, and spirit, are wholesomely em-

ployed, do, as the tradition has it, — “forget to 
be naughty.” The story properly employed is a 
most happy means of inciting to right conduct 
and better endeavor, while the community-spirit 
which the kindergarten itself furnishes supplies 
the elements which are the foundation of good 
citizenship, and therefore affords a condition in 
which the virtues of self-control, thoughtfulness, 
kindness, courtesy, and service thrive. In ex- 
tremity, the kindergartner has the public opinion 
of this little community to turn to. There are 
few children so set in willful ways as not to be 
moved by the voice of public sentiment. It is 
an effective means of discipline when used with 
discretion, but must not be used unduly. In 
short, that subtle, invisible, yet palpable some- 
thing, which I have referred to as the atmosphere 
of the kindergarten, depends, in its last analysis, 
upon the character and ideals of the woman in 
charge of the kindergarten. "She makes her kin- 
dergarten — whether it shall be a place where 
the children express their spontaneous activity 
in an atmosphere of ideal freedom, or whether 
it shall be a place where the imposition of her 
will has changed the active children into obedient, 
well-mannered little grown-ups in an atmosphere 
of restraint, is determined entirely upon the

ideals that govern her work, plus her ability to 
put them into practice. She must be conscious 
of her ideal, and she must consciously employ 
the methods whereby she hopes to achieve the 
desired end. If she so pursues her course, theory 
and practice will be brought into unity, which 
will express itself in the best of kindergarten 
procedure, and the reaction upon herself will 
give us, in due time, the “artist-teacher.”

KINDERGARTEN ACCESSORIES 
The importance of favorable environment 
In recent years much emphasis has been placed 
upon the value of environment. Some writers 
will even have us believe that if a proper environ- 
ment be secured, other things will take care of 
themselves, so great is their faith in its influence. 
While the kindergartner is a firm believer in the 
influence and benefits of favorable environment 
she does not believe or maintain that an ideal 
environment will secure an ideal kindergarten. 
She has seen the ideal environment housing the 
mechanical kindergarten. She does maintain, 
however, that the environment may be a great 
adjunct or a serious handicap in the development 
of the true kindergarten. 
Hygienic conditions 
For this reason every kindergartner desires to 
secure good rooms, well lighted, and well ven- 
tilated, with proper sanitary conditions. She 
frequently, however, does not succeed in this 
30
-P-A-G-E-37
  KINDERGARTEN ACCESSORIES 
endeavor, as boards of education are not always 
wise and far-seeing, so it happens that she often 
has to make the best use of an unfortunate situa- 
tion. 
Simple decoration and ornament 
It is, happily, becoming more and more the 
custom to simplify in the matter of the decora- 
tion and adornment of the kindergarten room. 
®The day of paper chains and cheap ornaments is 
passing, and the principles of good art are being 
applied in the kindergarten as in the home) A 
poor room is not improved by over-adornment. 
Tlie idea of covering baseboard as well as walls 
with a heterogeneous collection of cheap pictures 
does not better matters. It simply adds to the 
sense of confusion and disorder. 
®A good color-scheme and a sense of space are 
two essentials that should be sought for in the 
kindergarten room.) In a room flooded with sun- 
shine, the walls should be tinted in a soft, cool 
color, while, on the other hand, rooms into which 
little sunshine enters call for a color in which 
there is 4 suggestion of warmth. In small rooms 
the kindergartner should eliminate every unnec- 
essary object. She needs to keep such a room 
from the appearance of being cluttered, Pictures, 
3F

  THE KINDERGARTEN 
few and good, and such as have some artistic 
value, should be placed on the walls. “It is true 
that the children as a rule do not take any 
marked and continuous interest in these pictures; 
but the influence of a beautiful and artistic en- 
vironment does affect the child, although the 
fruit of it may not be apparent during his kinder- 
garten days) 
Pictures 
Kindergartners would do well to consult the 
interests of children in the matter of decorative 
pictures, instead of being guided, as they so often 
are, by their own preferences. Good art may 
still be followed and the interests of the children 
subserved. Raphael’s “Madonna of the Chair,” 
in the experience of many kindergartners makes 
a greater appeal to little children than any other 
of the better-known Madonnas.’ Pictures which 
tell a story, or pictures into which the children 
can themselves read a story, attract and hold 
their attention. For instance, Strutt’s picture, 
“A Little Child Shall Lead Them,” makes a 
wonderful appeal to little children. The true 
symbolism of the picture is beyond their compre- 
hension; nevertheless, the picture awes and fasci- 
nates them, and their interpretations of the pic- 
32
-P-A-G-E-39
    KINDERGARTEN ACCESSORIES 
ture, as shown by their comments, give evidence 
of the fact that the spirit of the picture has 
touched their little souls. 
A few years ago some city kindergartners com- 
bined and bought two or three really fine pic- 
tures. These pictures traveled from kindergarten 
to kindergarten, a place of honor being given to 
them during the weeks in which they lingered 
with the children. This experiment proved un- 
usually successful, the children showing keen and 
continuous interest in each picture and looking 
forward expectantly to the appearance of its 
successor. 
A space — generally a frame mounted with 
burlap in a color harmonizing with the walls — 
should be provided for the placing of unframed 
pictures illustrating talks and stories. These 
pictures are, of course, changed from time to 
time. : 
& One cannot lay too strong an emphasis against 
the habit of hanging pictures, like clothes upon a 
line, on a string strung across the blackboard. 
Thirteen Mother Play pictures were hung in such 
fashion in a kindergarten which the writer visited, 
while on another blackboard, in the same room, 
hung a dozen pictures dealing with the subject 
of the Nativity. The effect was not only inar- 
33
-P-A-G-E-40
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
tistic, it had nothing to commend it.*Fancy the 
confusion in the brain of a little child, resulting 
from trying to assimilate a dozen different pic- 
tures dealing with the same subject! °Simplify! 
simplify! Remember the stage of development of 
a little child’s mind! Remember his limited ex- 
perience and have mercy upon him!—one cannot 
but exclaim when she witnesses such practices. 
The pictures used in illustration should be few 
and carefully chosen. To show a child of kinder- 
garten age LeRolle’s Nativity and Correggio’s, 
and two or three others, is not good practice. 
Select one good picture and let that suffice. When 
the child is older and can understand that these 
many pictures are the different interpretations 
of various artists, it will be soon enough to in- 
troduce him to these varying types; but now 
remember his years, and save him from blind 
confusion. 
*Little children love to look at small pictures 
which they can handle and pass to one another. 
A kindergartner secured a number of pictures 
illustrating various themes, purchasing several 
copies of each, from which her children gained 
great enjoyment and profit, used in this way.! 
1 The pictures secured were the Brown and the Perry pic- 
tures, and a few of the Mother Play pictures.

Animal pets 
‘The introduction of animal pets into our kin- 
dergartens has met with success only in a com- 
paratively few instances; Those kindergartens 
which are situated in places where the climate 
will permit of much outdoor life can easily pro- 
vide the space and means for the care of such 
pets. In some few instances, where the rooms are 
spacious, a very large cage has been provided, 
which admits the opportunity of having and 
caring for pets, such as squirrels. ‘In some cities 
a round of such pets has been kept in several 
kindergartens, — visiting pets, as they are called. 
This has proved fairly satisfactory, but in most 
of our city kindergartens, with their present cir- 
cumscribed space and lack of conveniences for 
the proper care of pets, it is more or less a farce 
to attempt, in any large way, this branch of work, 
which was plainly advocated by Froebel, and has 
distinct educational value. \It is, however, very 
necessary that the child have something upon 
which to expend the spirit of nurture, and for 
this reason goldfish are often a substitute in the 
kindergarten for animal pets, and, as they are 
easily cared for by the children, form a very 
beautiful as well as interesting feature of the

kindergarten life. "Some kindergartners are also 
very successful with aquariums) In the spring 
the little garden, planted and tended by the chil- 
dren, partially fills this need, and through the 
long winter months the plants which the children 
care for in a small measure compensate for our 
lack of animal pets.! 
Plants 
®The kindergartner who has plants in her 
rooms simply as a means of adornment, which 
either the janitor or she herself cares for, fails in 
a very vital part of her educational procedure. 
As has been indicated, the plants in our kinder- 
gartens, the living, growing things, are about the 
only means we have of giving to the children the 
opportunity to nurture life.“The development of 
the nurturing spirit brings in its train a series of 
incipient virtues — care, time-order, thoughtful- 
1 If the boy cannot have the care of a little garden of his 
own, he should have at least a few plants in boxes or pots, 
filled, not with rare and delicate or double plants, but with 
common plants that have an abundance of leaves and blos- 
soms, and thrive easily. The child, or boy, who has guarded 
and cared for another living thing, although it be of a lower 
order, will be led more easily to guard and foster his own life. 
At the same time the care of plants will gratify his desire to 
observe other living things, such as beetles, butterflies, and 
birds, for these seek the vicinity of plants. (The Education of 
Man, p. 112.) 
36
-P-A-G-E-43
  KINDERGARTEN ACCESSORIES 
ness, kindness, love, are all generated in the care 
of a living, growing thing. But the development 
of these habits is entirely defeated when the kin- 
dergartner fails to make the children’s care of 
the plants a daily feature of her program.) We 
hear her say that the children cannot care for 
the plants without spilling the water, and that it 
is much easier to do it herself, and anyhow she 
thinks the value of it is overestimated. If the 
children in Dr. Montessori’s Children’s Houses 
can successfully carry tureens of hot soup across 
the room, and serve the soup to their little mates 
from these dishes, is it too much to ask that the 
kindergarten child shall carry a small watering- 
pot across the room and water the plants? “Sup- 
posing he does spill some of the water, a cloth 
may be supplied with which he may repair the 
damage done, and in time he will learn his lesson 
of care. In the kindergarten, as in the home, it is 
the doing of these little deeds of service regularly, 
day after day, that establishes the beginnings of 
habits which are to be so valuable in the later 
life of the child. * The kindergartner who neglects 
these phases of child-training, no matter what 
her excuse, not only fails in her Froebelian disci- 
pleship, she ignores certain claims of modern 
pedagogy. 
37
-P-A-G-E-44
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
Mr. Hughes tells us: “He — Froebel — urged 
very strongly that all children should be trained 
to cultivate plants, partly in order to gratify their 
natural tendency to work in the earth, and to 
use their interest in productive activity and the 
nurture of living things, especially plants or pets. 
But he had higher reasons for making every child 
a little gardener, both at home and at school. 
Careful culture in the preparation of the soil and 
its proper enrichment, coupled with due atten- 
tion to watering, weeding, hoeing, and, if neces- 
sary, to pruning, produces plants of grander pro- 
portions, greater beauty, and richer fruitfulness. 
By these results the child not only learns to 
recognize evolution, but it also sees that it may 
become an active agent in promoting evolution. 
It gains a conception — at first symbolic, after- 
ward conscious — of the greatest of all truths — 
that it has power to help other life to grow to grander 
life. ‘By sowing the apparently dead seed, which 
afterward bursts into life and beauty, it learns 
that it has power to start life to grow that without 
its aid might have remained forever undeveloped. 
The teacher or parent does not require to point 
the lesson. The symbolism of the unconscious 
stage of childhood will naturally become trans- 
formed into conscious character in due time. It 
38
-P-A-G-E-45
  KINDERGARTEN ACCESSORIES 
is impossible to overestimate the advantages of 
a training that, through the self-activity of a 
child, reveals to it two vital truths — that it 
may aid all life — human life as well as plant 
life— to reach a higher condition of life, and 
that it may bring into existence new elements of 
living power, material power, intellectual power, 
or spiritual power, to aid in unifying and uplift- 
ing the race. The formation of these appercep- 
tive centers in a child’s mind qualifies it for the 
highest education it can ever receive. The life 
must remain comparatively barren in which these 
ideals have not been implanted. The time to 
implant them is in the symbolic period of child- 
hood, and the process is the nurture of life in 
Nature.” + 
(The raising of bulbous plants, such as hya- 
cinths, daffodils, and tulips, is perhaps the most 
satisfactory form of plant culture for the kinder- 
garten) The presentation of the bulbs to the 
children, with a suggestion of the life that is 
sleeping in the bulb, the preparation of the earth 
in boxes or pots, and the planting of the bulbs, 
comprise a lesson into which the children enter 
with zeal and interest, and which they do not 
soon forget. In the weeks that follow there are

the visits of the children, in small groups, to the 
dark room to water the bulbs and look for signs 
of dawning life; and then comes the joy of the 
discovery of the little white fingers pushing 
through the earth. The bringing of the plants 
back to the kindergarten is a red-letter day, and 
now each morning the children watch eagerly the 
growth of these little plants, waiting patiently 
for the appearance of the promised bud, and 
faithfully attending to each plant’s needs; and 
when at last a little plant bursts into full bloom 
it occupies an honored place in the kindergarten 
circle. It is truly the children’s plant. Where 
there is a succession of these plants the spring 
becomes a prolonged joy.* 
Sand-beds 
A sand-bed of some description has come to 
be regarded, and justly, as a necessary part of 
kindergarten equipment. ‘As our Afnerican kin- 
dergartens are at present housed, the sand-table 
seems to meet the need most satisfactorily. With 
those who have worked with both the square and 
oblong tables, the preference is very decidedly in 
favor of the latter. Both for the free play of the

children, and for the directed play, it lends itself 
more successfully to the short arms of the little 
people. 
Musical instruments 
The piano in the kindergarten should be a 
good one, but in too many instances it is a pa- 
thetic degenerate, a sad relic of better days. To 
train the ear.of the children in distinguishing 
songs and rhythms, and to accustom them to 
good but not too elaborate music, is a legitimate 
use of the piano in the kindergarten, in addition 
to its regular office in connection with songs and 
games and other physical exercises: If used as a 
means of summoning the children, or calling 
them to order, it should be used pianissimo, 
rather than in the double forte, as some over- 
forceful kindergartners seem to think necessary. 
The triangle with its silver tone is a specially 
happy means of giving signals in the kindergar- 
ten. It is much to be desired that kindergartners 
substitute this for the spatting of the hands, 
which savors too often of inner irritation. 
Toys 
A few carefully selected toys to supplement the 
gifts)may properly be included in a kindergarten 
equipment. They should, however, be chosen

with an eye to stability and usefulness) Cheap 
toys should find no place in a kindergarten. A 
toy with which the children can do something is 
the ideal toy. A box, containing very perfect 
copies of domestic animals, was purchased for 
one kindergarten and the animals used very suc- 
cessfully with the gifts and the sand-table. 
(Small dolls for the doll-house make the doll- 
house mean much more to the children than the 
untenanted house. Paper dolls are often specially 
good in this connection. Balls of various sizes 
and sorts are always desirable. The doll, her bed, 
and her carriage, are a never-ending source of 
comfort to the little girls, and to some of the 
boys, as well as a directly educative agent.) Ex- 
perience leads one to speak very emphatically of 
the value of a doll or dolls in the kindergarten. 
Properly used, the doll is a direct civilizer. 
In one kindergarten, a little doll, not more 
than ten or eleven inches in height, dressed in a 
simple gingham gown, modeled after those worn 
by many of the little girls in the kindergarten, 
was introduced one morning as a newcomer. She 
was received with acclamations of delight, and a 
little time was spent in selecting a name, Mary 
being ultimately chosen by unanimous consent.

ant. She was a conspicuous figure in the morn- 
ing circle, where she was tenderly held in the arms 
of either a little girl or a little boy, for the boys, 
irrespective of their ages, vied with the girls in 
their claims on Mary. Some mornings she wan- 
dered from child to child, and every morning the 
children sang the greeting to her. A little red 
chair was at Mary’s disposal during the game and 
work periods, and at the end of the day she was 
carefully put to bed. The making of the doll’s 
bed and the dressing of Mary were two of the 
duties in the before-school period. It was de- 
lightful to see the incipient virtues that followed 
in the wake of Mary, — selfish impulses stifled 
and generous ones taking their place, tenderness 
and care supplanting rudeness and thoughtless- 
ness, and fair-play becoming the accepted rule 
of this group of young Americans. 
Play apparatus 
(If the kindergarten meets the demands of 
modern psychologists, it must be equipped with 
apparatus suited to the physical needs of children 
from four to six years of age. Apparatus for 
climbing, swinging, and walking plays is advised 
by experts as necessary for the muscular develop- 
ment of the growing child. The need of some such 
43
-P-A-G-E-50
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
apparatus is specially urgent for the children of 
our large cities, who are deprived of the natural 
incentives to muscular exercise which the country 
children find in the world of nature) If our kin- 
dergartens could be equipped with such appara- 
tus, which the children would be permitted to use 
at will during the morning, much of the adverse 
criticism of scientists would be done away with. 
Certainly child-psychologists and kindergartners 
should work together. Their interests should be 
the same. 
It is very true that comparatively few of our 
kindergartens are at present housed in rooms 
large enough for the admission of much, if any, 
apparatus. It is also true that kindergartners 
will have to overcome many obstacles before the 
introduction of such apparatus will become gen- 
eral, But the ideal should be held and worked 
for; and it is certain that if the general body of 
kindergartners would work as a unit for this 
necessary addition to kindergarten furnishings, 
the time would not be far distant when our school 
boards would feel the insistence of the claim and 
meet the demand. 
The idea that our kindergarten games meet all 
the needs for the muscular development of the 
children no longer holds good. That they are a

help when properly played, no one will deny, but 
that they often, in the hands of an unwise 
teacher, defeat their very purpose of recreation 
and muscular exercise, every fair-minded kinder- 
gartner must admit. The games also come at a 
stated period, whereas the apparatus stands as 
an invitation to the child at any time that the 
muscular hunger may be upon him. It may be 
objected that chaos would be the result of such a 
procedure as the use of the apparatus indicated 
above; but we affirm confidently that any effi- 
cient kindergartner will be able to adjust both 
herself and her children to the new order, and 
still maintain freedom under law. 
The accessories of a kindergarten, if properly 
selected, are, therefore, helps in the conduct of a 
kindergarten. With the necessary accessories, 
the kindergartner has less to contend with and 
so more easily and successfully works out her 
ideals of kindergarten procedure. They, in a 
measure, form the background for that ideal at- 
mosphere for which she is working, and so are 
not to be lightly set aside as matters of small 
moment. 
In the kindergarten, as in the home, the en- 
vironment, which expresses refined taste, acts, 
even if imperceptibly for the present, surely and

continuously upon the esthetic sense of the in- 
dividual, and in this busy world, in which there 
is so much striving for the betterment of all 
classes, this phase of education must not be lost 
sight of. On the other hand, all that helps to 
build up a vigorous physical development is even 
more important; for sound physical health makes 
for sound moral and mental development.

THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
A. THE GENESIS 
The bases of program-making 
Durinc the past few years attention has been 
repeatedly directed to the subject of the kinder- 
garten program. Programs of various kinds have 
been made and remade. We have had programs 
based on the Mother Play; programs whose form 
followed the immediate interests of the children; 
programs which found their motive in the various 
phases of institutional life; and programs which 
gained their inspiration from the world of nature. 
There have been, on the one hand, advocates of 
a uniform program, developed by kindergartners 
of large experience and true insight; while, on 
the other hand, there have been equally zealous 
advocates of original programs, prepared by the 
individual teachers. 
47
-P-A-G-E-54
THE KINDERGARTEN 
The early dominance of logical and formal 
programs 
“In the early days of program-making, and to 
some extent to-day, it is undoubtedly true that 
the programs were more or less logical and formal. 
They were developed from the intellectual point 
of view and presented to the children subjects 
with which the kindergartner believed the chil- 
dren should be familiar. These subjects were 
developed in an orderly and more or less related 
fashion. It was unquestionably subject-matter 
imposed from without. The tendency then was 
to crowd the program.) "The kindergartner, par- 
ticularly the young kindergartner, labored under 
the delusion that she must bring to the children 
facts in relation to a wide range of subjects, with- 
out considering whether or not they functioned 
in the children’s experience.?She had not learned 
that the need of wide knowledge on her part was 
not that she might impart it to the children, but 
that it might be an illuminating means by which 
she could meet the needs of the children wisely 
and sanely. 
48
-P-A-G-E-55
  
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
Factors influencing the evolution of the program 
The evolution of the kindergarten program has 
come about not so much through a radical change 
of subject-matter as through the recognition of 
principles which govern educational procedure. 
We have come to see that the educational prob- 
lem presents two aspects, the psychological and 
the sociological, which are mutually related. The 
educative process is defined as one of interaction 
between the immature, undeveloped individual 
(the psychological factor) and “certain social 
aims, meanings, and values incarnate in the ma- 
tured experience of the adult” (the sociological 
factor).1 
This has led, naturally, to a study of both 
factors of our problem — the undeveloped child 
and the matured life of the social whole, and the 
relation which they sustain to one another. We 
have learned through this study something of the 
nature of the little child, of the character of his 
experiences, and of his attitude toward life. We 
have found that he is an emotional creature, 
guided largely in his actions by feelings of affec- 
tion and sympathy, the reasoning powers as yet 
being in abeyance; that the little world in which 
1 Dewey’s The Child and the Curriculum, p. 8. 
49 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
he moves is a narrow and personal world, limited 
by his experiences; that his experiences, which to 
us seem disjointed and separated, constitute for 
him a unity. We know, then, that the little child 
guided by his feelings, not yet possessing judg- 
ment, but filled with a keen zest for investigating 
the life about him, is confronted by a world of 
overwhelming magnitude, which acts upon him 
and upon which he reacts. The interactionary 
process has its small beginnings in the early 
months of the child’s life, and continues in in- 
creasing measure so long as he lives. 
Education is an interactionary process 
Fine problem that challenges the teacher when 
the little child comes into her keeping is, What 
agencies shall she select from these innumerable 
phases of life that surround the child, to facilitate 
the interactionary process? It is self-evident that 
the matured life of the social whole, to which the 
child must in some way or other become adjusted 
and which he must assimilate in himself, has been 
largely shaped and modified by what is some- 
times called “the spiritual inheritance of the 
race.” The problem of the teacher may therefore 
be restated as, What agencies will best help the 
child to become adjusted to the world in which 
50
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
he lives, so that he may gain from this race in- 
heritance what is best for himself, so that in 
the end he may contribute his share toward its 
furtherance and enlargement? It is, we trust, 
needless to say that the kindergarten can make 
only the small beginning in this necessary ad- 
justment. 
The pathways of adjustment 
What do we mean by the “spiritual inheri- 
tance”’ of the race, or the “spiritual possessions” 
of the race, as it is sometimes termed? We mean, 
without doubt, those agencies which have con- 
tributed to the development and advancement of 
civilization, and which, generation after genera- 
tion, have proved themselves of permanent 
worth. There comes to mind, at once, the great 
moral and religious forces which have contributed 
to the making of noble men and women, actuated 
by lofty and religious ideals, and thus to the de- 
velopment of states and nations founded upon 
principles of righteousness and truth. We think 
of the great literatures of the world, which have 
expressed for us the profound truths of individual 
and universal experience, and the sciences which 
have made us to know the facts and processes of 
our being and of the universe in which we live.

THE KINDERGARTEN 
We recall to mind the creations of master minds 
in the fields of painting, sculpture, music, and 
architecture, which have contributed to the edu- 
cation and ennobling of generations of individu- 
als; and lastly, we remember the vast contribu- 
tions of the industrial world, which, if we should 
attempt to catalogue them, would appall us by 
their gigantic proportions. 
It is from these agencies that we deduce what 
we are pleased to call ‘educational values,” — 
Ethics, Religion, Literature, the Sciences, the 
Fine Arts, and Industries; and from these in 
turn derive the curricula of our schools and col- 
leges. The question naturally arises, What and 
how much from these educational values may we 
select to use in the training of little children from, 
four to six years of age? In order that we may 
not fall into the error of developing a formal and 
logical program, the product of the intellectual 
point of view, we must turn again to the first 
factor in our educational problem, — the little 
child, — and see what connection we can estab- 
lish between his small experiences and the great 
educational values. Dr. Dewey tells us: ‘‘ Psycho- 
logical considerations may be slurred or shoved 
one side; they cannot be crowded out. Put out 
of the door, they come back through the window. 
52 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
Somehow and somewhere motive must be ap- 
pealed to, connection must be established be- 
tween the mind and its material. There is no 
question of getting along without this bond of 
connection; the only question is whether it be 
such as grows out of the material itself in rela- 
tion to the mind, or be imported and hitched on 
from some outside source. If the subject-matter 
of the lessons be such as to have an appropriate 
place within the expanding consciousness of the 
child, if it grows out of his own past doings, 
thinkings, and sufferings, and grows into appli- 
cation in further achievements and receptivities, 
then no device or trick of method has to be re- 
sorted to in order to enlist ‘interest.’ The psy- 
chologized is of interest — that is, it is placed in 
the whole of conscious life so that it shares the 
worth of thatilife. But the externally presented 
material, that, conceived and generated in stand- 
points and attitudes remote from the child, and 
developed in motives alien to him, has no such 
place of its own.” } 
Ethical values 
®T¢ is not difficult to find, in the life of children, 
an approach to the educational value of Ethics. 
1 Dewey’s The Child and the Curriculum, pp. 34-35- 
53
-P-A-G-E-60
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
Ethics deals with human conduct and character, 
and the little child in his daily life, both at home 
and in the kindergarten, is a concrete example of 
phases of conduct and incipient habits. The kin- 
dergarten is preéminently an ethical institution. 
¢The community life of the kindergarten lends 
itself specially to the development of right con- 
duct, and to the establishing of helpful and cour- 
teous habits. The kindergartner who neglects to 
recognize this phase of her work, fails signally. 
In the community life of the kindergarten, there 
is a comradery, a give-and-take between the 
children, which develops good traits of character, 
and tends of itself to stamp out unfortunate 
habits and tendencies. *The wise kindergartner 
supplements this self-training, which the child 
gets through contact with the group, by inciting 
the children to deeds of service and self-denial 
apportioned to their ability, to habits of daily 
courtesy, order, punctuality, cleanliness, so that 
the kindergarten becomes a veritable training- 
ground for beautiful expressions of child-life, and 
this in a way so natural and unaffected that it 
seems a spontaneous development. 
54
-P-A-G-E-61
  
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
Religious values 
° The little child in his unspoiled condition has 
a natural instinct for reverence. He repeats in 
this, as he repeats in other phases of his life, 
certain fundamental tendencies of early man- 
kind, the impulse out of which has developed the 
religious life of the race. Through this native 
instinct for reverence we are to lead the child to 
the educational value, Religion. Specific religious 
training will have no place in the kindergarten 
program, but we may plant the seed for later 
religious training through the nurturing of those 
impulses which will later grow into religious ex- 
perience. All religion has its beginnings in the 
feelings, and even after the intellect takes con- 
trol of the religious experience, faith, which is the 
dominant note of the truly religious, is, in a 
measure, influenced by feeling. “The little child, 
led as he is so much by his emotions, is particu- 
larly susceptible to the influences that stir the 
heart. He has a capacity for reverence which if 
properly nurtured prepares for the later religious 
experience. 
As we are dealing with the practical problems 
of the kindergarten, we must face not the ideal 
conditions, which we devoutly desire, but the 
wD
-P-A-G-E-62
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
situation as it actually exists. In America to-day 
there is a marked lack, in many homes, of the at- 
titude of reverence toward things high and holy, 
as well as a lack in the observance of religious 
rites. Sunday, the day set apart by universal 
consent, for religious observance, is, in the minds 
of many children, a day for excursions, for golfing 
and automobiling; a day when the big newspaper 
with the delectable colored supplement appears. 
The result of this is, that a percentage, often a 
large one, of the children who come into our kin- 
dergartens have never been moved and awed by 
the coming together, in a place of worship, of 
their parents and other parents for common acts 
of devotion; their little hearts have not been 
stirred by the sight of the mother kneeling at 
their bedside in petition to the Heavenly Father; 
they have had no occasion to wonder at the mean- 
ing of the family, gathered together for family 
worship. They have possibly been sent to a 
Sunday-School, but often even this substitute for 
religious nurture in the home is wanting. It fol- 
lows, therefore, that frequently we have to deal 
with children in whom the instinct of reverence 
is wholly dormant. It is now that our knowledge 
of the universal tendencies and instincts of chil- 
dren comes to our aid. History and experience 
56
-P-A-G-E-63
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
have taught us that the instinct of reverence is 
within every human heart. It is a universal gift 
placed there by an all-wise Providence, and so 
we take on faith that which we cannot see. We 
believe that we must treat the heart of the little 
child as we treat the tiny seed or the bulb, — give 
it right conditions and nurture it day by day, 
and in due time we shall see the beginnings of 
the spirit of reverence sending forth its tiny 
shoots. We need to make our own the profound 
truth taught by Froebel, that “Every seed of 
truth sown in the heart of a child must germi- 
nate and bear fruit; the process of germination 
may be slow, but if there is life in the seed it 
will bear fruit in due season.” 
Our approach, therefore, to the educational 
value of Religion is through such nurture as will 
develop in the heart of the child a sense of rev- 
erence. This nurturing process is effected through 
general influences rather than specific means. 
Nature, which speaks through visible symbols to 
the little child, offers us a concrete means of 
leading the child to a dim feeling for the Great 
Unseen, — to a sense of awe and wonder, in 
which reverence has its beginnings. The rural 
teacher and the teacher in the kindergarten of 
the small city have the privilege of taking the 
57

children out into nature, where they may observe 
the miracles of growth in their natural setting; 
where they may see the various phases of bird- 
life, — the building of the nest, the care of the 
young, and the migration in the fall; where they 
may observe at first hand the creeping cater- 
pillar, and later the gorgeous butterfly. The kin- 
dergartner in our crowded cities, who, at best, is 
able to take the children to the parks for only an 
occasional outing, must, perforce, bring many 
phases of nature into the kindergarten, that the 
children may not be deprived of this valuable 
means of child-training. The planting and nur- 
turing of bulbs, the garden where the children 
sow the seeds and watch, day by day, the growth 
of each little plant, supply in goodly measure 
their lack of direct contact with the larger world 
of nature. Caterpillars brought to the kinder- 
garten, and kept in a ventilated glass case, where 
the children may watch them feeding and finally 
spinning their cocoons, make up another valuable 
experience for these little people. The children’s 
interest in the various phases which the ele- 
ments exhibit — rain, snow, wind, sun — is still 
another opening for the nurturing of the spirit of 
wonder and reverence. As these several experi- 
ences arouse in the child the sense of wonder, 
58
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
the wise kindergartner finds her opportunity to 
direct the children’s thought to the one Great 
Spirit that ‘broods over the universe.” 1 
There is also opportunity for the children to 
give expression to their awakened feelings of 
reverence through song and simple prayer. Ex- 
perience has proved that little children, even 
those who have been most unfortunately en- 
vironed, respond most happily to this method of 
nurture. We recall an interesting experience with 
one group of children. It was the Easter season. 
The children had had the pleasure of the Easter 
thought brought to them through the bulbous 
plants which they had cared for, and through the 
spring flowers. Their attention had been called 
to a cocoon which had been placed on the teach- 
er’s desk, and the thought of the life that was 
sleeping in the cocoon suggested. Patiently the 
children had watched for some sign of life in the 
apparently lifeless case. The next to the last 
day of the week came, and the last moments, 
and as the teacher was dismissing the group a 
child cried in a rapturous tone, — “It’s coming 
out, the butterfly’s coming out!” On tiptoes the 
children gathered about the desk, and observed 
in reverent silence that new life come forth and

  THE KINDERGARTEN 
spread its beautiful wings. When it was at last 
fully out of its cocoon, and stood balancing itself 
on its discarded house while drying its wings, the 
children broke into exclamations of wonder and 
delight, as the full beauty of the Cecropian moth 
was revealed. After a time it tried its wings in 
somewhat timid flight, and a little later flew 
toward the windows where the plants of the 
kindergarten stood. The next morning the chil- 
dren found the moth still among the plants, and 
had the pleasure, for some little time, of observ- 
ing the beautiful creature. Its tendency to fly 
repeatedly to the window brought from one of 
the children the suggestion that it probably 
wanted to go out in the air, and finally, by com- 
mon consent of the children, the window was 
opened and the moth flew away into the beauti- 
ful outside world. 
It is not for a moment to be supposed that any 
of the experiences suggested are to be forced 
upon the children. The children lead and point 
the way, the kindergartner standing ready to 
seize each opportunity as it occurs, to make each 
experience more meaningful for the children.
-P-A-G-E-67
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
Literary values 
® The little child brings with him to the kinder- 
garten, through the spoken word, the point of 
departure for his introduction to the educational 
value, Language. He comes to us with a limited 
vocabulary; sometimes with no English vocabu- 
lary; with incomplete and defective expressions 
of speech; and the kindergartner, by suitable 
methods, begins to help him to build for himself a 
better vocabulary, to express himself in simple, 
direct, and correct sentences. “Stories, selected 
with reference to their adaptation to the age of 
the children, and for their literary value, are told; 
thythmical poems are read to them, and they are 
led to express themselves through the reproduc- 
tion of the stories which have been told them, as 
well as through simple verse} such as Stevenson’s 
“The friendly cow all red and white, 
I love with all my heart: 
She gives me cream with all her might, 
To eat on apple-tart.” 
Scientific values 
In the life of the child of kindergarten age, we 
find comparatively little to connect with the wide 
field of Science. Many phases of science may 
61 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
     THE KINDERGARTEN 
have touched his little life, but as yet he is not 
aware of them. The simpler phases of biology, 
and, in a small measure, mathematics as applied 
to his daily life, — the counting of his toys and 
pennies, — are about all that challenge his atten- 
tion. From these points of contact the kinder- 
gartner leads him to observation and care of 
various phases of plant life, and of some of the 
simple and accessible forms of animal life; and 
the simple elements of number and form are in- 
cidentally developed through his plays) The 
method in the kindergarten, so far as natural 
science is concerned, is to avoid specific and tech- 
nical training. It is simply, as it were, to prepare 
the soil for the sowing of the seed that is to come 
later on. In other words, it develops the attitude 
of observation of the thing in its natural setting: 
it instills in the child a sympathetic interest in 
the living thing, some knowledge of its habitat 
and habits, where the surroundings offer this 
opportunity, and then it is satisfied to wait until 
the child is older before more specific training or 
instruction is given. 
62
-P-A-G-E-69
       THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
Artistic values 
*To the educational value, the Fine Arts, there 
are various avenues of approach. The child’s 
interest in pictures enables the kindergartner to 
turn his attention from the delights of the Sun- 
day Supplement to pictures both embodying 
good art and subjects that command the interest 
of the child. /By means of large crayon and some- 
times of brush and water-color, the child may 
make his own small beginnings in the art of 
pictorial representation, crude, to be sure, but 
an effective means of self-expression: Clay offers 
a medium for plastic representation, and while 
the efforts of the children may be far from satis- 
factory from the art side, it meets a world-old 
desire on the part of children to produce through 
plastic material) 
The universal appeal which music makes to 
little children is a fact too well recognized to 
need discussion. It is only in rare instances 
that a little child is indifferent to the appeal of 
rhythm and music, while occasionally we find a 
child who is so sensitive to the effects of music 
that he is dissolved in tears whenever he comes 
in contact with musical expression. Experience 
has taught us that as soon as the child can be 
63 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
led to express himself through song, both the 
indifference and the over-sensitiveness pass. The 
kindergartner meets the instinctive love of 
thythm and music in the children through vocal 
and instrumental music. A percentage of the 
children, and sometimes a large one, is not able 
to express tune or melody: the voices are unor- 
ganized and drift about in a vague endeavor to 
grasp the melody. The kindergartner must, 
therefore, not only begin by selecting the very 
simplest and at the same time good melodies, 
but she must help the children to find themselves 
musically. Humming, the singing of one syllable 
to the entire melody, as well as leading the chil- 
dren to listen to the piano as the melody is 
played, are all valuable helps in organizing the 
children’s voices. The ear must be trained as 
well as the voice, and as time goes on the children 
find great delight in discovering for themselves, 
as the melody is played, what the song is. 
With so many good song-books and such a 
variety of songs from which to select as we have 
to-day, the kindergartner runs the danger of 
giving her children musical indigestion. She must 
remember that a few carefully chosen songs, 
well sung, are far better than a score of songs 
which the children only half master. 
64
-P-A-G-E-71
  
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
After their voices are once organized, it is sur- 
prising how easily and readily the children grasp 
the words and melody of a new song, particu- 
larly when the song is used, as it generally should 
be, to express some experience of the children; 
as the coming of the first snowfall, the visit to 
the carpenter or to the blacksmith, the appear- 
ance of the first dandelion, or the advent of the 
doll. 
The rhythmic game, when properly developed 
from simple rhythmic movements to the com- 
plete but simple dance, is a legitimate addition 
to the kindergarten plays: but here, as in other 
lines of her work, the kindergartner must be 
guided by wisdom and keep within the range of 
activities adapted to the age of the children. 
Industrial values 
The little child, if not influenced by artificial 
restraints and customs, evinces a marked interest 
in the laborer, no matter how lowly his calling. 
If a carpenter comes to repair the house, the 
small boy cannot get near enough to him and his 
work; and his happiness is complete if the car- 
penter allows him to try what he can do with 
some of the tools, or possibly to help in some 
small way.) A small boy of five years left his toys

and the pleasures of his own pleasant yard and 
rode a long summer afternoon with a man who 
was hauling loam. The satisfaction that glowed 
in his young face, when at the end of the day he 
came in to his mother and told how he had 
“helped” the man, will not soon be forgotten. 
The child’s dependence on the industrial world 
begins with his earliest days and increases as 
time goes on. When he reaches the period of 
childhood he has a dim consciousness of this de- 
pendence. The industrial plays and games of the 
kindergarten tend, in a measure, to clarify and 
deepen this consciousness. 
*From the vast field of industrial activity only a 
few of the simpler and fundamental phases may 
be brought to the child of kindergarten age. He 
is not yet old enough to appreciate or to grasp 
the complicated machinery of our complex mod- 
ern industries. To take him to one of our big 
shoe factories, or to a flour mill conducted in the 
expert fashion of to-day, is to thrust upon him 
an experience for which he is not yet prepared, 
and tends, therefore, only to confusion. The 
kindergartner sometimes needs to be reminded 
that there will be opportunity for the children to 
learn many things after they pass from the kin- 
dergarten, and must, therefore, be content to 
66

give them only that which they can properly 
digest and assimilate at the present period. 
The fundamental industries which served the 
race in its early days, and upon which the child 
is vitally dependent, arouse his interest and at- 
tention and are adapted to his present powers of 
comprehension. “It is, therefore, customary in the 
kindergarten to deal with the work of the farmer, 
the carpenter, the blacksmith, and where en- 
vironment makes it feasible, the miner. It is also 
possible and practicable, in some instances, to 
have the older children not only come in contact 
with phases of industry, but also to engage, in 
simple fashion, in some of the industrial processes. 
The trial of the carpenter’s tools may be carried 
on after the visit to see the carpenter at work. 
The raking, hoeing, planting, and weeding of the 
small garden brings the child very vitally in 
touch with the work of the farmer. The grinding 
of wheat-seed into flour by means of an ordinary 
strong coffee-mill is within the ability of the 
older children in some of our kindergartens. 
Later, the students of the school who are taking 
domestic science, are more than glad to make this 
flour into some form of bread for the children. 
The churning of cream into butter is another very 
simple and easily accomplished process for the 
67
-P-A-G-E-74
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
children to undertake. An ordinary cream-whip 
and glass jar supply the necessary machinery. 
The bread made from the flour which the chil- 
dren have ground, spread with the butter that 
the children have actually churned, makes a 
feast the children long recall with happiness. 
We cannot but deplore the practice that is cur- 
rent in some kindergartens, of forcing upon the 
children processes which should properly come at 
a much later age. A woman interested in educa- 
tional work visited a kindergarten where she was 
shown by the proud teacher six or eight jars of 
canned fruit, said to be the work of the chil- 
dren. This woman had had considerable experi- 
ence in the line of preserving, and as she looked 
upon these attractive glass jars, she was seized 
with an attack of skepticism; and she inquired, 
“Did the children do this?” “Oh, yes,” replied 
the ardent kindergartner. As she looked at the 
peaches and the pears, the woman continued her 
inquiry; ‘““Were they able to pare the fruit?” 
“Oh, of course not,” was the reply. “They 
could n’t do that without soiling their clothes.” 
A few more judicious questions brought out the 
fact that the children had virtually done nothing 
but watch the fruit boil; and yet this guileless 
kindergartner was herself saying and allowing 
68
-P-A-G-E-75
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
the children to say that it was the work of the 
children. It was without question a dishonest 
(though unconsciously so) procedure, quite in 
line with a certain sort of Christmas work that 
was once done in a class of so-called kindergar- 
tens, now happily extinct. The moral effect can- 
not but be bad. From the educational point of 
view, this procedure has no value, for the laws 
controlling the process — measuring, weighing, 
boiling, and so on — are all beyond the compre- 
hension of the little kindergarten child. This 
work belongs properly to the children in the 
grammar-school period. It is maintained that 
the child in the home loves to take part in these 
processes, but it should be remembered, in this 
connection, that the little child in the home plays 
out these experiences almost entirely through 
imitation with his toys. He does not engage in 
the process. He would soon weary of that. 
We find thus that the child’s experience and 
interests function naturally, if in a small way, in 
the great educational values upon which the 
school curricula are based.’ Our kindergarten 
program, then, may find its genesis in the rela- 
tionship which the child’s experiences sustain to 
these values, and while its development must be 
simple and based on the universal activities of 
69 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
children, it may form the first link in a connected 
educational chain, thus, in a measure, realizing 
Froebel’s dream that a thread of continuity 
should run through all educational procedure, 
from the kindergarten to the university. 
B. THE ORGANIZATION 
The flexible use of a formulated program 
“For the young kindergartner, the organiza- 
tion of her program is an important consider- 
ation. She is too limited in experience, too 
slenderly equipped with the means and the 
knowledge necessary for meeting the problems 
and emergencies that await her, to trust to any 
sudden intuition to guide her aright. “Because of 
these limitations she runs the danger of falling 
into a logical procedure; of forgetting, at times, 
the children and their needs. But even with this 
danger confronting her, it is essential that she 
have a formulated program which she may de- 
velop as the year progresses. This program, how- 
ever, must be elastic.*There are valuable experi- 
ences that come to the children at times which 
the kindergartner has not foreseen, and hence 
has not prepared for. ®When she perceives that 
an experience, which has in it elements of value, 
7o
-P-A-G-E-77
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
is possessing the children, her carefully prepared 
program should be set aside and the present 
experience utilized. It is a time to strike when 
the iron is hot. 
Negative and positive illustrations 
Two illustrations, one negative and the other 
positive, may serve to point our moral. In a 
city where a uniform program held sway, an 
assistant fresh from her training-school observed, 
on the way to kindergarten one morning, her 
group of little people eagerly watching a flock of 
pigeons which had lighted in an open space, not 
far from the school, where some grain had acci- 
dentally been scattered. She stopped for a few 
moments and observed with the children this 
interesting episode and then hastened on, eager 
to develop an idea that this incident had sug- 
gested to her. Full of enthusiasm she went to 
her director and said: ‘May I use the Mother 
Play picture, ‘Beckoning the Pigeons,’ this morn- 
ing with my children? I found the children so 
interested in a flock of pigeons I thought it would 
be a good time to show this picture and perhaps 
tell them a little story about the pigeons.” The 
director eyed her in cold disapproval, and re- 
plied: “We are taking up ‘The Fish in the 
qt
-P-A-G-E-78
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
” Brook’ this week.” The moral to this story is 
emphasized when we add that the director did 
not have so much as a goldfish as a point of 
departure for the work she was developing with 
the children at this time. 
In the same city a visitor chanced upon a kin- 
dergarten one morning when the children came 
in, one by one, each bringing an offering of horse- 
chestnuts, and eager to relate to the teacher the 
circumstances attending the finding of the chest- 
nuts. The kindergartner laughingly observed, in 
an aside to her visitor: “It is no use trying to 
follow the program this morning.” Thereupon 
she began to talk with the children, leading them 
to tell where they had found the chestnuts, as 
well as where they had originally been; then she 
recalled to them the blossoming tree in the 
spring-time, and ultimately led to the thought 
of the nuts as seeds, and of the life sleeping in 
each one. Later, she took the children out of 
doors, where they planted a few of the seeds in 
the school-yard, and then went for a walk to 
gather more nuts which they used later in the 
day in representative work on the floor of the 
kindergarten, in place of the gift play that was 
to have been. It was, for the visitor, an exceed- 
ingly happy illustration of meeting a common 
72
-P-A-G-E-79
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
experience of the children so as to turn it to 
profitable account. 
Y Four factors in the formulation of a program 
‘In formulating the program there are four 
things which must be taken into consideration: — 
1. The children, — their needs and experi- 
ences. 
2. The aim of the work. 
3. The agencies by which this aim will be 
attained, — often designated as “subject- 
matter.” 
4. The method of procedure. 
Children’s needs and experiences 
It is to be supposed that the young teacher is 
already familiar with the universal characteris- 
tics of children. She knows that they are spon- 
taneously active, guided by feelings, living in a 
narrow world bounded by their personal inter- 
ests; that their experiences are as yet uncon- 
trolled, the result of environment and chance; 
that they are lacking in power of concentration, 
and that their attention is largely passive, rather 
than active or voluntary. The individual vari- 
ances which she will find in her children will have 
to be interpreted in the light of the knowledge 
73 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
of these universal characteristics: but in the 
making of her program she must be led by the 
common experiences and interests of her group 
of children. This will necessitate on her part a 
study of the environment and the formative in- 
fluences under which the children have lived 
prior to entering the kindergarten. To these she 
will be able to add the interests which are de- 
veloped through seasonal changes, which will of 
course vary decidedly in their content, in rela- 
tion to the location of the kindergarten, — city 
or country, — and also the interests and experi- 
ences which are aroused through the celebration 
of our several national and religious festivals. 
These interests and experiences furnish the 
points of departure for program-making. The 
object of the program is to furnish the kinder- 
gartner with a guide whereby she may interpret, 
correct, enrich, and enlarge the experiences of 
her children. 
Educational aims 
¢The kindergartner must of necessity have some 
definite aim as the goal of her procedure. Before 
fixing upon an aim commensurate with the age 
and abilities of the children, she must first de- 
termine what the aim of education, considered 
74
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
in its large significance, is. From the time of 
Plato down we have had the aim of education 
defined for us. It has run the gamut of all pos- 
sible conceptions, ethical, practical, esthetic, cul- 
tural, and sociological; each one representing, 
possibly, the special trend of the age in which it 
was conceived or the ideals of its originator. For 
an ultimate aim of education we must have one 
that is sufficiently comprehensive to include all 
aims; and so we take as our aim that which is 
defined as self-realization. The individual who 
realizes his true self does so not merely by the 
cultivation of his own powers, but through par- 
ticipation in the universal life, both present and 
past. He is responsible not only for himself, but 
for his contribution to the life of the race; and 
he, through giving and sharing, receives unto 
himself of the life and power universal. 
With the little child in the kindergarten we 
can only make a small beginning toward so com- 
prehensive an aim. “Our immediate purpose, 
therefore, will be to establish the beginnings of 
right moral and social habits and right mental 
attitudes, while providing as perfect means as 
possible for the development of physical health 
and growth. In this connection it is necessary 
that kindergartners recall Froebel’s mandate, 
75
-P-A-G-E-82
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
that the child shall be at each stage of his devel- 
opment precisely what that stage calls for; and 
toadd to this the teachings of child-psychologists, 
— that the child’s physical growth and develop- 
ment are of prime importance during the kinder- 
garten period. 
Subject-matter employed 
In the selection of subject-matter we are influ- 
enced by the fact that the institution of the home 
has been the center in which the children’s expe- 
riences have been largely generated. For many 
favored children the influence of the home has 
been coupled with that of the world of nature. 
The content of a child’s experience is thus a 
variable quantity, and the measure of the world’s 
activities which we can, even in our small way, 
bring to the children will differ materially in our 
various kindergartens. This, therefore, answers 
the question which may have arisen in the mind 
of the reader, in relation to a set or uniform pro- 
gram devised for all classes and conditions of chil- 
dren. It would seem superfluous to discuss the 
question if it were not true that such a program 
has already had zealous adherents and somewhat 
wide application. The working-out of such a 
program was observed by the writer in two cities 
76 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
for an extended length of time. Her observation 
showed that in the hands of a poor or mediocre 
kindergartner, the procedure was lifeless and 
mechanical, — the kindergartner was a follower 
of the letter, — while in the hands of an able 
kindergartner, the program was subordinated to 
the needs of the children. 
®It is impossible to conceive of one program 
suited to the requirements of all classes of chil- 
dren. It may, however, be possible that many 
programs may be similar in relation to their 
broad general features, but in detail and in the 
working-out of the program there should be a 
wide divergence. Take, for example, a group of 
city children who come from homes of comfort 
and refinement, children who have known coun- 
try or shore life, and set them over against the 
children of the tenement district, who live in 
squalid quarters, whose homes lack not only 
comfort, but all the amenities of social life and 
culture. Prepare a program suited to the needs 
of the first group and thrust it upon the children 
of the second, — what response would you get? 
We had almost said, What response would you 
deserve to get? Reverse the proposition and 
prepare a program suited to the needs and ex- 
perience of the tenement children, and then at- 
77
-P-A-G-E-84
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
tempt to apply this to arouse the self-activity 
and creative life of the more favored children, — 
what result would you then get? A very good 
case of understimulation and arrested develop- 
ment. The children’s powers would soon atrophy 
under such a procedure. Or, again, suppose that 
we attempt a sort of compromise program, in 
reality adapted to neither group, — what would 
be the result of the use of such a program in either 
case? We do not hesitate to say that it would 
be a predestined failure. It would be not only 
unsuitable in content, it would be lacking in 
inspirational quality, without which any teaching 
is flat and unprofitable. @It follows, therefore, 
that the content of the subject-matter of our 
programs will vary to meet the requirements of 
the children whose development we are seeking. 
§The caution which must be observed in rela- 
tion to the subject-matter of any kindergarten 
program is the danger of too elaborate a plan of 
action, — of an attempt to cover too wide a 
field of interests; to thrust upon children expe- 
riences for which they are neither physically nor 
mentally prepared. This is probably a sin of 
which every kindergartner of any long experience 
has been guilty. We have been too zealous for 
the child’s mental development and we have 
78
-P-A-G-E-85
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
overreached the bounds set by nature. Simpli- 
fication in the subject-matter of the program is 
what older kindergartners have had to learn 
through experimentation. The young kinder- 
gartner profits by her older sisters’ experience, 
and begins her work with ideals more nearly 
commensurate with the ability of the children. 
In selecting certain phases of life for subject- 
matter, as illustrated in what we have come to 
term educational values, the kindergartner must, 
we repeat, be guided by the interests and ex- 
periences of her particular group. There is no 
rule that can be laid down. “The children lead, 
the teacher must study to follow their lead and 
to turn these interests of the children into profit- 
able channels. ' For instance, one kindergartner 
spent the entire month of May, with her older 
children, in the study of four birds, — the robin, 
oriole, woodpecker, and bluebird. It was not as 
exhaustive a study as the time spent might indi- 
cate, as only a portion of each day was given to 
this study. The birds, with the exception of the 
bluebird, had their nests on the school premises, 
and the teacher was able to combine outdoor 
life and this interesting study in a most happy 
way. The children, through crayons and clay- 
modeling, gave childlike expression to the ideas 
79
-P-A-G-E-86
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
they had received through this study, and ample 
opportunity was given them to talk over the 
happenings of each day. It was a very profitable 
and interesting month for these children and 
their teacher, but it would have been an absurd 
procedure had the environment and interests of 
the children not offered concrete knowledge as 
the point of departure. The thing which the 
kindergartner must constantly bear in mind is 
that the kindergarten child is not old enough for 
abstractions. 
Methods of procedure 
\The method which will be followed in pursuit 
of our aim will not be divorced from the child, 
but in harmony with his needs and normal ex- 
pressions of activity. Some one has well said: 
“Method should represent the teacher’s plan of 
action in response to the child’s initiative.” *The 
little child of kindergarten age expresses him- 
self through varying forms of activity, — play, 
speech, investigation, and small efforts at con- 
struction and representation. These phases of 
activity form the nucleus from which we must 
derive our method of procedure.) We take this 
activity through which the child has developed 
up to the present time, and utilize it as a means of 
80
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
further growth and development, our departure 
from the method to which the child has been 
accustomed prior to his kindergarten days simply 
being that we consciously direct this activity into 
what we believe to be safe and healthy channels, 
with a view to both the present and future needs 
of the child. 
The play of the child when he enters the kin- 
dergarten expresses itself generally in three ways 
— plays in which the child exerts force, plays in 
which he measures his strength against others, 
and imitative plays.' Imaginative plays, in which 
the child builds a little play-world for himself, are 
not, as a rule, characteristic of this period,? nor 
are the purely dramatic plays as yet developed. 
These come later. When the children are more 
advanced, or so environed as to have had a rather 
rich experience, these forms of play constitute a 
legitimate part in the developing process of the 
kindergarten method. 
From these native plays of the children spring 
our running, skipping, and like games, and our 
traditional games in which imitation strikes so 
1 See Blow’s Symbolic Education, chap. v. 
2 It is true that many children of this age have experiences 
of a purely imaginative type. They are, however, distinctly 
individualistic, and lack in the constructive element to which 
we refer. 
81
-P-A-G-E-88
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
dominant a note. From these we lead out to 
some industrial plays, the note of imitation or 
dramatization being emphasized according to the 
stage of development of the group of children 
with whom we are working. 
The children’s ability to use the spoken lan- 
guage varies according to the influences to which 
they have been subjected prior to the time of 
their entering the kindergarten. The manner of 
speech of the English-speaking child is an almost 
sure index to the character of his home training. 
“The kindergartner starts with what the children 
offer and consciously sets about to build up a 
vocabulary, to correct and improve modes of 
expression, and then to enlarge and enrich the 
children’s knowledge of language, through an 
introduction to phases of literature commen- 
surate with their growing intelligence. Thus we 
find our method calling for the use of stories, 
carefully selected, and of poems, rich in rhythmic 
quality. 
The activity of the child which takes the form 
of investigation or curiosity, as it is termed, has 
often been the despair of his parents, and on more 
than one occasion has brought down the condem- 
nation of the household upon his small person. 
To the kindergartner, this activity forms one of 
82
-P-A-G-E-89
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
the chief assets of childhood. Her method is to 
supply means and opportunities to utilize this 
power along constructive lines. ®She will provide, 
whenever possible, excursions into the world of 
nature, where the children may explore and dis- 
cover to their hearts’ content. Later, on their 
return to the kindergarten, the new knowledge 
gained, the new objects, animate and inanimate, 
found, will form the interesting topic of conver- 
sation for the little group gathered about the 
teacher. She will also provide materials, such as 
the kindergarten blocks, which can be taken 
apart and put together again, as well as com- 
bined in innumerable new and alluring ways, 
with no sense or act of destruction following. 
She will, in short, find many legitimate outlets 
for this really splendid activity, so that its reac- 
tion upon the child shall be for physical, mental, 
and moral well-being. In meeting this instinct 
for investigation, she provides also for that activ- 
ity which expresses itself in attempts at con- 
struction. The kindergarten blocks and plays 
in the sand-bed meet this need, as do also a 
few of the so-called occupations. The attempts 
which the children make at representation vary 
materially. Here again the home influence has 
acted as a stimulus or as a deterrent. Children 
83 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
who have had crayons and blackboards with 
which to experiment in their homes have con- 
siderable facility when they first enter the kinder- 
garten in the use of its representative materials; 
while, on the other hand, to the children who 
have lacked these incentives in the home, repre- 
sentative work is, more or less, a new field of 
activity. “The kindergarten method is to lead the 
child, through the material supplied and through 
an amount of guidance suflicient to make the 
activity valuable, from very simple to more dif- 
ficult phases of representative work, always 
keeping in mind the ability of the children. The 
tablets and sticks lend themselves specially to 
this form of activity, while the freer occupations 
— drawing with crayons, painting, free-cutting, 
and modeling in clay—supply the essential media. 
The aim of the kindergartner in selecting these 
activities as the point of departure of her method 
is to lead from the somewhat aimless activity of 
the children to purposeful and useful activity, 
and in this way, directly or indirectly, to help the 
children to find and to adjust themselves to 
their environment. It is the first step toward 
helping the child to gain control of his experience. 
Having fixed on aim, subject-matter, and 
method, and the way in which these features of 
84
-P-A-G-E-91
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
our program function naturally in the life of the 
children, it now remains to bind these various 
phases into a harmonious whole, so that our 
program will not announce itself as a program, 
but rather seem the natural and inevitable proc- 
ess, following the coming together of a group of 
little children and a guardian spirit. 
C. Tae DEVELOPMENT 
Two paths of procedure 
(In developing her plan of work, the kinder- 
gartner finds two paths of procedure open to 
her. The one leads to the program based on 
relationships, —relationships to the home, to 
nature, to the industrial world, to religion, with 
the implications which these relationships con- 
tain. It is expected that the child through con- 
tact with this line of work will be brought to a 
consciousness of these various relationships, at 
least in a small way, and that the reaction will 
be beneficial to his moral and mental life. ‘The 
other focuses attention upon the immediate ac- 
tivities of the children of a given group, and 
directs the procedure, by a selective process, 
along the line of these activities, day by day. 
In this procedure emphasis is laid upon the 
85 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
physical development of the children, the mental 
attitudes and moral habits being established in- 
cidentally) The one calls for a carefully devel- 
oped program; the other develops a program of 
action as the emergency dictates. 
Criticisms of both procedures 
The contention which has arisen in relation to 
these two procedures has led to various criti- 
cisms. It is said of the one that its plan of action 
demands of children apperceptive powers which 
they do not possess; that the results of the pro- 
cedure are magnified by the overzealous teach- 
ers; that they, in short, read into their resultant 
work values it cannot possess. It is a case of 
false interpretation. Of the other, it is said that 
the work is not developmental; that it partakes 
too much of the nature of hit and miss; that 
save in the hands of an expert teacher, the artist 
teacher, it follows too often the line of caprice, 
with the result that the children never arrive, 
and therefore are not properly trained and de- 
veloped. 
The unprejudiced observer must admit that 
the criticisms on both sides are well taken. There 
are dangers in both procedures, and there is 
good, unquestionably, in both methods of work. 
86
-P-A-G-E-93
    
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
The strong tendency toward a modified 
kindergarten 
The demand of the present day for a modi- 
fied kindergarten is too insistent to be ignored. 
Indeed it has not been ignored; for in even 
the most conservative kindergartens we note 
a change of procedure, — modifications in con- 
nection both with the development of the pro- 
gram and with the use of gift and occupation 
materials. In some cases a radical change has 
been made. All that was of the old régime has 
been cast aside as worthless, and new ideas and 
new methods adopted with avidity. This latter 
course does not commend itself to the discerning. 
There is too much that is good, too much that 
has proved itself of permanent worth, in the old 
plan of action, for us to cast it lightly aside and 
follow after new gods. There is something too 
spectacular in this iconoclastic method: we are 
led to doubt the sincerity and depth of its pro- 
genitors. Yet we must meet the demand for a 
modified kindergarten, — a kindergarten that is 
in line with the best in modern pedagogy. This, 
we believe, can be achieved through a process of 
elimination and addition with our present kin- 
dergarten system, not by its destruction. 
87 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
Progress does not lie, as some overzealous 
people apparently believe, in the disorganization 
and disruption of the present system. The mania 
for change is upon us, and any change in the eyes 
of some of the teaching body spells progress. So 
we have the spectacle to-day of some kinder- 
gartners casting common sense to the four winds, 
and running madly after a new scheme, — any 
new scheme so long as it surely is new. The result 
is not an ideal situation nor a kindergarten based 
upon a happy balance of control and spontaneity, 
but too often a kindergarten where disorder and 
disorganization seem the order of the day. They 
have cast everything of the old order out, and 
they have nothing of worth to take its place. 
Whither are they tending? Why this change? 
you ask, and they are unable to give an intelli- 
gent or convincing answer. 
The writer believes in the need of modifications 
in the kindergarten methods of to-day. There 
are phases of our present work that we must 
heroically cut away, and there are phases of the 
newer thought, particularly in line with the 
physical needs of children between four and 
seven years of age, which we must incorporate 
in our present system. We must make these 
changes intelligently, wisely. We must know 
88
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
whither we are tending. We must be able to 
answer honestly the why of this procedure. 
Otherwise we cannot be classed with educators, 
but rather with faddists. 
A kindergartner remarked, “We are not using 
the gifts any more; nobody seems to be.” To 
the query, “Why not?” came the reply, “Oh, I 
don’t know, nobody seems to know ‘where they 
are at’ nowadays.” So this unwise virgin throws 
out an excellent medium of expression for the 
children. She does not even put her wits to work, 
to find a suitable substitute, but trusts to chance, 
for it is obvious that a substitute must be found. 
Little children grow through doing. They must 
have material upon which to exert their awaken- 
ing powers. ¢One of the chief values of the kin- 
dergarten is that it supplies legitimate outlets 
for the activity of children. Take from them the 
legitimate means of activity and leave them to 
find their own incentives within the four walls 
of a kindergarten room and you will be forcibly 
reminded of the old adage: — 
“Satan finds some mischief still 
For idle hands to do.” 
It is now a particularly auspicious time for the 
inauguration of needed reforms in our kinder- 
gartens. The publicity which has been given the 
89 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
Montessori method has, in a measure, popular- 
ized the idea of greater liberty in the education 
of little children. The mind of the public is better 
attuned to the educational needs of small chil- 
dren than ever before. It is, therefore, expedient, 
while popular interest is alive to these needs, that 
the kindergarten world make imperative its de- 
mand for more commodious rooms, for appropri- 
ate apparatus for the physical training of the 
children, for space for gardens and pets, so that 
we may have the environment that will make 
possible a saner and more normal life for the 
kindergarten child. We are not blind to the 
difficulties and obstacles that beset the path of 
those who attempt to bring about an improved 
or modified kindergarten. We are fully aware of 
the indifference and the obdurateness of boards 
of education. We realize the expense that is 
involved. We appreciate, at its full value, the 
opposition and hostility of all those who believe 
in a prescribed and categorical training for the 
young. Despite these hindrances, we believe the 
time is ripe for a concerted action for a modified 
kindergarten, and we believe that the objections 
that will be raised and the difficulties to be over- 
come will be insignificant as compared with those 
which the pioneers in the kindergarten movement 
go
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
met and overcame. There are already many kin- 
dergartners working for an improved kindergar- 
ten practice. What we need is concerted action. 
In taking a stand for a more liberal kinder- 
garten we shall find ourselves ‘directly in line 
with the teachings of Froebel. ‘Education in 
instruction and training, originally and in its 
first principles should necessarily be passive, fol- 
lowing (only guarding and protecting), not pre- 
scriptive, categorical, interfering,” are the mem- 
orable words written by Froebel over eighty 
years ago: they have a peculiar significance to- 
day. If we may judge from practice, it seems 
possible that the meaning of this statement has 
not been grasped by all kindergartners, or, at 
any rate, it seems to have passed out of con- 
sciousness after the student left the training-class. 
It is possible that she did not see its practical 
application. To-day, outside the kindergarten, 
she is forced to see the practical exemplification 
of this statement of Froebel’s. Dr. Montessori 
in her Children’s Houses has struck a high note 
of “freedom for development,’”’ and while her 
practice does not appeal to us-as entirely con- 
sistent with her ideal, she has exemplified more 
truly certain ideals of Froebel than many of the 
direct disciples of Froebel. Many kindergartners, 
or
-P-A-G-E-98
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
in their ardor to follow certain systems of work 
or to achieve certain results, have forgotten the 
fundamental principles and ideals of Froebelian 
philosophy, which give vitality and perpetuity 
to the kindergarten system. 
Happily there has been in the past few years 
a distinct tendency on the part of many thought- 
ful kindergartners to bring into their kindergar- 
tens an atmosphere of greater freedom; to grant 
to the children more liberty for the expression 
of individuality along all lines of kindergarten 
work. It has to be acknowledged that superin- 
tendents of schools and principals often have to 
be reckoned with, and many a kindergartner has 
a very sharp check put upon the carrying-out of 
her ideals of practice. It is undoubtedly bad 
policy openly to oppose the will of your superior 
officer, but it is also a mistake for a kindergart- 
ner to discard her ideals which she knows are 
grounded in sound pedagogy, and settle into a 
mechanical procedure, because she sees this to 
be the pleasure of her superintendent or prin- 
cipal. This is an age of progress, and superin- 
tendents and principals will grow. We know of 
a supervisor, who a few years ago looked upon 
the introduction of hand-work in the grades, and 
the interchange of courtesies between the chil- 
92
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
dren which the work necessitated, as “‘desecra- 
tion of the schoolroom,” who to-day is warmly 
advocating the Montessori method. Even with 
an adverse superior the kindergartner may work 
into the program her ideas of freedom and self- 
activity, and, if wise and tactful, she will in time 
be able to bring her superior to consent to her 
practice, if not into agreement with her prin- 
ciples. This was well illustrated in the kinder- 
garten of a certain city. The superintendent 
made it understood that stillness was his criterion 
of a well-conducted kindergarten, so the kinder- 
gartners worked for stillness, with the inevitable 
result, — more or less mechanical kindergartens. 
There was, however, one courageous soul, too 
well grounded in the principles of child-training 
to submit to the dictum of the superintendent. 
She worked out her problem on liberal lines. 
While the superintendent did not heartily ap- 
prove, he did not forbid the procedure, and the 
kindergartner had the happiness of winning to 
her views the complete support of her immediate 
superior, the principal of the school in which the 
kindergarten was located.

  THE KINDERGARTEN 
Free play in the first week 
*Tn the opening days of the kindergarten, when 
the children come for the first time into new and 
strange surroundings, where they are thrown into 
close contact with many unknown little people, 
it is very important that this new and sometimes 
difficult experience be met so that the children 
will not feel too keenly the break from the fa- 
miliar home life. It has become the custom of 
some kindergartners, and we believe that the 
custom will grow until it is universal, to make 
this first week of kindergarten a time of free play, 
from which, naturally and gradually, is evolved 
the regular kindergarten procedure. “Instead of 
precipitating upon the little strangers the for- 
malities of the kindergarten circle, gift periods, 
and so on, the kindergartner spends the first few 
days in making the acquaintance of the children, 
in helping them to become wonted to their new 
environment and to one another. In accessible 
places the kindergarten balls, the simplest kin- 
dergarten blocks, beads for stringing, a few 
simple toys, and an abundance of pictures are 
placed at the disposal of the children. In these 
first free days the kindergartner initiates some 
of the children into the various duties of the 
94
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
kindergarten, — the watering of the plants, feed- 
ing of the goldfish, care of the sand-bed, and so 
on. When the opportunity presents itself she 
goes to the piano and plays a melody, and as the 
children gather about her, she sings some simple 
song. If the children are American-born, the 
Mother Goose songs make an excellent point of 
departure, for the children are already familiar 
with the words, and the melodies which aptly fit 
the words the children naturally and easily grasp, 
and are joining in the singing almost before they 
themselves are aware of it. From this the kin- 
dergartner may lead to some greeting song, or 
any of the simpler songs which time and occasion 
call for. The gathering of the children into a 
circle for some of the ball games will lead natu- 
rally to the introduction of the movement plays, 
— running, skipping, and so on. The day will 
come when the time is ripe for the telling of a 
story, and as the children gather about to listen, 
the teacher is not only evolving another period 
for her kindergarten procedure, she is knitting 
more strongly the bond which unites her with 
the children. There has been no compulsion in 
this method; the children who manifest an inter- 
est in a given thing forming the nucleus for the 
kindergartner’s initiative, to which the other 
95
-P-A-G-E-102
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
children naturally and inevitably gravitate. The 
day finally comes when the kindergartner finds 
it possible to form her morning circle with no 
sense of strangeness and no anxiety for the hap- 
piness and contentment of her group of little 
people; and the kindergarten morning of play 
and work develops naturally and happily both 
for the children and the kindergartner. 
Variation in the morning periods 
It has been the custom in the past to divide 
the kindergarten morning into short periods, 
varying the plays calling for concentration with 
periods of relaxing and recreative play. This has 
been wise in view of our procedure, but it is an 
admission that our work has savored somewhat 
of formality, too little of liberty: that it has been 
too much the plan of the teacher, too little the 
following of the children’s initiative. 
It must be acknowledged that in many of our 
kindergartens, housed as they are in rooms not 
adequate to the purpose, any more liberal form 
of procedure would result in chaos. The writer 
visited a kindergarten located in a finely ap- 
pointed school-building, where the kindergarten 
occupied one fair-sized, attractive room, in which 
the children were so crowded that they elbowed 
96
-P-A-G-E-103
| 
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
one another on the circle, and in several of the 
games a number of children had to leave the 
circle and become observers, in order to give 
room for even a very sedate activity. Liberty of 
action was an unknown quantity in that kin- 
dergarten. There are undoubtedly many equally 
unfortunate situations, and while they are un- 
questionably a check upon reforms, they will in 
time be affected by the pressure of public opinion 
and educational ideals. 
Therefore, despite the obstacles with which we 
must surely contend, we believe that every kin- 
dergartner whose environment will permit should 
begin with a modification of the periods of the 
usual kindergarten morning. “More liberty must 
be given the children for individual expression 
and for physical relaxation. Instead of the kin- 
dergartner always determining when the child 
needs a change of occupation, let the children, as 
they do in their home plays, take the initiative. 
This is a matter which, in time, will take care of 
itself if some apparatus for physical exercise be 
supplied. In the matter of apparatus two ob- 
stacles will be met with — expense and needed 
space. The former will be more easily overcome, 
as, with the introduction of the enlarged gifts, 
gradually such an equipment may be acquired. 
97  
-P-A-G-E-104
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
The matter of housing our kindergartens in rooms 
large enough to admit of proper paraphernalia and 
opportunity for freedom of movement is a much 
more serious problem. It can only be brought 
about by constant agitation of the subject and 
a changed public opinion. For this the kinder- 
gartner must steadily work. Through her moth- 
ers’ meeting she must preach this necessity, and 
through the mothers reach the fathers. 
It is not possible, or at least not advisable, to 
give a fixed schedule for a morning’s work. Any 
schedule must be elastic. The hours of kinder- 
gartens in different cities vary greatly. Therefore 
each kindergartner must arrange her schedule to 
meet the time at her disposal. 
Extending the gift period 
The change in schedule particularly called for 
just now seems to be the lengthening of the 
period allotted to plays with the gift material, a 
period which at times is used for work in the 
garden as well. Kindergartners who have worked 
with the enlarged kindergarten blocks have often 
felt that the prescribed half-hour period did not 
give to the older children the time which they 
would have enjoyed spending upon the material 
and which they could spend profitably. By ex- 
98
-P-A-G-E-105
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
tending the gift period and also the liberty of 
the children, so that they may, if they become 
wearied, leave their work for rest, play in the 
sand-bed, or upon the apparatus provided for 
physical development, we give to the children an 
opportunity, not only for more profitable use of 
the kindergarten materials, but also the chance to 
take the initiative in matters of rest and change, 
which will accord more with the natural play ac- 
tivity of children. We realize that in the hands 
of the inefficient teacher disorder and even chaos 
may result from such an arrangement, but we 
cannot plan for the inefficient. The intelligent 
teacher, whose aim is to keep the balance be- 
tween control and spontaneity, will soon adjust 
herself to the new arrangement, and will find a new 
happiness in this freer method. In many kinder- 
gartens to-day, where two rooms are provided, a 
method similar to this is already in operation with 
the younger children. It must be remembered 
that with the younger children even more liberty 
must be permitted than with the older group. 
Increasing initiative in rest and change oo 
* For many years in the majority of our kinder- 
gartens free-play periods have been a prominent 
feature. We advocate not so much the extension 
99 
   
-P-A-G-E-106
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
of the free-play periods as the introduction of a 
greater element of freedom and initiative on the 
part of the children in all the periods — gifts, 
games, and occupations alike. 
Wider use of small groups 
The advantage of working with small groups 
in the kindergarten is well recognized. It is the 
ideal arrangement, yet it has not been largely 
realized nor will it be until we have a changed 
attitude on the part of school-board authorities. 
The wise kindergartner, however, may work out 
this problem even with but one assistant so as 
to minimize the unfortunate features of the large 
group. With the freer methods of work and play, 
the children may be divided into three or four 
groups. This will of itself give greater oppor- 
tunity for the initiative of the children, and will 
develop responsibility and self-control in the 
children. 
The coming together of the children for the 
morning songs and the games is the only period 
in which the children should be assembled in one 
group, and in the case of very large kindergartens 
it is often more satisfactory to have the games in 
the smaller groups.* The herding of large num- 
bers of children for the various phases of kin- 
100
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
dergarten work defeats every aim of right child- 
training. 
Rearranging schedule for excursions 
The schedule of work for a morning must be 
a movable quantity. We have in the past been 
bound too rigidly by our schedule. We have 
been worshipers of time order. While time order 
is something well for us all to learn, we must not 
sacrifice the well-being of the children to stereo- 
typed method. For instance, excursions into the 
world of nature should be a prominent part of a 
kindergarten program: where kindergartens are 
favorably environed these excursions should come 
at least once a week while the season permits, 
and at a time most favorable to the significance 
of the excursion, without regard to the time 
schedule of the morning. There are also excur- 
sions to definite points of interest — the black- 
smith’s shop, or the fire-company’s house: such 
excursions as these may often be taken most 
profitably at the beginning of the morning or 
at the close of the morning, and the time order 
of the morning schedule should not interfere 
with the carrying-out of this phase of the work 
at the time which is most propitious. In other 
words, the work to be accomplished is more 
IOI
-P-A-G-E-108
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
important than the time schedule and the time 
order must often give way before it. 
The worth of a tentative program 
It is without question true that an expert 
teacher, possessed of wide knowledge, of large 
experience, of sure intuitions, and a fund of story- 
lore, could successfully evolve her program from 
day to day, meeting and utilizing the vital ex- 
periences of each day so that the work of the 
kindergarten would show a progressive develop- 
ment and in the end manifest a unified whole. 
Such teachers are, unfortunately, the exception, 
and for the beginning kindergartner to start out 
without the guide of a program, carefully de- 
veloped from week to week, would be unwise and 
often disastrous. This program is not a hard- 
and-fast proposition to which the kindergartner 
clings and proposes to put through, whether or 
no. It should be simply a tentative program, 
which the kindergartner draws up week by week, 
or month by month, the study and observation 
of the children suggesting its development. It 
will be subject to modifications, eliminations, and 
substitutions as the work of the kindergarten 
progresses and the experience and interests of 
the children dictate. It is instructive for the 
102
-P-A-G-E-109
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
  kindergartner to compare at the end of each 
month what she proposed to do in the light of 
what she actually accomplished. This forms a 
new basis for her procedure another year, and 
is the stepping-stone toward a more perfect 
practice. 
A suggestive general plan 
In the development of this program a general 
plan to be followed facilitates the work in hand; 
as, for example: — 
1. General theme for the month. 
2. Special experiences to be emphasized under 
this theme. 
3. Stories, poems, memory-verses, songs, 
games, and rhythms that may be developed 
in connection with the several experiences. 
4. Pictures and illustrative materials. 
5. Excursions. Out-of-door life. 
It must be acknowledged that a danger lurks 
in the following of an outline, — the danger that 
has already been indicated in another connection, 
—that the program may become too much an 
intellectual product, too little a plan of work 
fitted to the actual needs of the children. Not- 
withstanding this danger the outline seems a

interests and activities. 
Sample applications    rather necessary guide to hold the young teacher 
to a definite development. It remains for her to 
be alert to the danger, continually to call herself 
to a rigid account, to watch carefully the develop- 
ment of the program in the light of the children’s 
After a week of familiar intercourse with the 
children the kindergartner will not find it difficult 
to discover her point of departure in some com- 
mon interest of the children. It has become the 
somewhat general custom of late years, for kin- 
dergartners to use as their point of contact the 
home life and relationships of the children. This 
under some circumstances may be a propitious 
theme if not carried into the abstract realm; for 
it must be remembered that it is activities in 
which children of kindergarten age find their 
mental food, and not from generalizations. 
One kindergartner found her point of contact 
in the children’s home interests, in their toys and 
pets. Toys were brought to kindergarten, with 
which the children experimented. One day a 
pet dog was the center of attraction. The teacher 
here found her opportunity for a story of a brave 
dog. Another day, two pet bunnies became the 
104
-P-A-G-E-111
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
objects of interest, and the story of “Raggylug” 
was developed with the older children. From 
this story, exemplifying mother-love, the teacher 
was led to touch very briefly on family relation- 
ships, through pictures of the human family, 
families of squirrels, birds, rabbits, and kittens. 
The children being specially familiar with the 
gray squirrel, a story of a squirrel family was 
told to leave with the children the thought of 
parental care and filial obedience. No attempt 
was made to enlarge upon this subject of family 
relationship, the teacher believing that the chil- 
dren would imbibe from the pictures and the 
story all that they were able to assimilate at this 
stage of their development. 
In the month following, the children’s interest 
in the phenomena of nature that were then prom- 
inent formed the theme for the month’s work, 
the environment of the kindergarten being spe- 
cially favorable for outdoor life. A visit to the 
garden was the point of departure. Here some of 
the children gathered seeds from their plants; 
others hunted for caterpillars, and for the leaves 
upon which the caterpillars fed, so that in the 
days following they might be able to provide 
food for their guests; for the caterpillars were 
taken to the kindergarten, housed in the large 
105
-P-A-G-E-112
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
glass encased boxes, where the children were able 
to observe the spinning of the cocoons. As the 
month advanced, flocks of birds in their southern 
flight attracted the attention of the children, and 
the deserted nests began to be in evidence. This 
led not only to an interest in the birds that were 
leaving, but also afforded the kindergartner the 
opportunity to take the children where they 
might see the birds that were to remain through 
the winter; two distinct varieties, aside from the 
omnipresent sparrow, being observed — the blue 
jay and the pigeon. The brilliant leaves were a 
continual source of interest, and when at last the 
trees were bared of their foliage, the kindergart- 
ner took the older children out that they might 
see what had sent the leaves flying to the ground, 
and might observe how nature protects the new 
leaf buds through the winter. 
There was no prescribed date for these various 
outdoor adventures, the children’s interests as 
the changes in the world of nature stimulated 
that interest acting as the determinant. About 
the middle of the month the children harvested 
the few vegetables from their garden. A visit 
was then made to a city market, where the chil- 
dren viewed the larger product of the farmer’s 
harvest. A small boy’s account of how he helped 
106 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
  father to rake the lawn, supplemented by other 
small boys’ accounts of helpfulness about the 
home, led directly to the thought of the meaning 
of all that was being observed at this season — 
preparation for winter. 
These illustrations serve to show how the pro- 
gram may grow from the children’s experiences, 
how the children may be brought into touch 
with various essential relationships, and how the 
kindergartner may trust the activities thereby 
developed to give to the children the reactions 
suited to their age and understanding, without 
enlarging too much upon the experience and thus 
running the danger of thrusting upon the children 
abstractions for which they are not ready. 
It is a comparatively simple problem to select 
as our points of contact events of value in the 
lives of children who are, from all points of view, 
favorably environed. It is quite a different prop- 
osition when we come to deal with a class of 
children whose environment meets none of the 
requirements of civilized life. To thrust upon 
these children, whose homes are often two or 
three squalid rooms in a tenement, where the 
family relationships are distorted, the home life 
erratic, the ideals of home life, as is unfortunately 
or unwittingly, sometimes attempted, is to give 
107 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
to these children experiences for which they have 
had no preparation. It is like sowing seed before 
preparing the soil. 
* Sometimes the interests of these children are 
perverted, and the kindergartner finds it neces- 
sary to devise something which will arouse new 
and better interests. Sometimes these children 
are so underfed, so poorly nourished, that they 
are dull and stolid, and it is difficult for the 
teacher to discover a natural point of departure. 
Yetshe knows that they are children possessing 
the qualities and general characteristics of the 
better-conditioned children.*It is for her to pro- 
vide the opportunity for these little children to 
expand; for her to bring to them the warm sun- 
shine of love and sympathy, in which expression 
will come forth like the healthy blossom on the 
nurtured plant. How many kindergartners have 
had this blessed privilege! 
The way in which one kindergartner met the 
needs of children of this class may be suggestive. 
We shall merely suggest the experiences which 
she utilized and those which she brought to the 
children. The first week she gave to getting 
acquainted with her group of children and help- 
ing them to find themselves and each other in the 
new environment. She found that the first lesson 
108
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
which these little children must learn, in order 
to make life with them a desirable or even endur- 
able thing, was cleanliness. She realized that she 
could not preach cleanliness; that she must pro- 
vide some concrete means of awakening in their 
minds an ideal of cleanliness. An indestructible 
doll of fresh countenance, with delicately modeled 
hands, dressed in spotless but simple garments, 
and a doll’s bed equipped with immaculate linen, 
served her purpose. The doll made an instan- 
taneous appeal. She was exquisite. All her good 
points were noted by the children. Her immacu- 
late hands and nails put to shame the soiled hands 
of the children, as well as their nails, without 
exception clad in solemn black. Her clean dress 
led to the straightening out of crumpled gowns, 
and her tidy hair to the smoothing-out of tousled 
locks. The making of the doll’s bed formed an 
interesting lesson in neatness and order. The 
fruits of this experiment were not immediate, 
but gradual and permanent. 
The doll was followed by a bowl of goldfish, 
in order that the boys of the kindergarten should 
have something more specifically in their line to 
care for, and to suggest the needed lesson. The 
game, “This is the way we wash our clothes,” 
for a time was made to run, “This is the way we 
109 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
wash our faces,” “This is the way we brush our 
hair,” and so on, and to good effect. 
Nature had taught these children few lessons. 
The sidewalk and the gutter were their play- 
ground. The park was too far distant to admit 
of more than one visit a season. If the children 
were to come in contact with any phases of 
nature, the kindergartner must bring them to 
the children. The wild flowers of the season 
which had been brought to the kindergarten 
were already teaching their lesson of beauty. 
Space would not permit the introduction of any 
animal pets, and funds were limited. A few cater- 
pillars were first brought to the kindergarten and 
proved objects of keen interest. A dozen plants 
followed, which, with the aid of the children, were 
transplanted to a window-box. Then came the 
excursion to the park, an effort of no small pro- 
portions, but one that paid in full. Nuts and 
leaves in quantities were gathered and carried 
back to the kindergarten. The graceful swans 
swimming about in the lake, and the squirrels 
frisking about on the lawns, made the greatest 
claim on the children’s attention and memory, 
and served as points of departure for the work 
of the days that followed. Some toy swans and 
ducks, — Japanese toys, if we remember rightly,

—with a pan of water, afforded unalloyed de- 
light for many weeks thereafter. 
The last of the month daffodil and hyacinth 
bulbs were planted by the children, and so ended 
a month in which the children’s lives had been 
somewhat enlarged and enriched. 
The kindergartner, in wandering about the 
neighborhood to discover what materials of in- 
terest were available for use in the kindergarten, 
chanced upon two precious objects of interest — 
a cow tethered in a vacant lot and some pigeons. 
These objects being within a reasonable walking 
distance furnished points of departure for play 
activities, stories, and songs; and thus formed a 
not undesirable approach to the Thanksgiving 
festival. The life of these children was so circum- 
scribed that it was difficult for the kindergartner 
to see how Thanksgiving Day could be made 
meaningful for them, but she was happily sur- 
prised to find how the children entered into the 
spirit of the “Thank you” day: how many things 
they found in their barren little lives that were 
to them in the nature of blessings. The festival, 
both for the children and for the mothers, proved 
a morning of keen enjoyment. The children’s 
interest in the fruit, contributed through the 
kindness of friends, was made significant through 
ctr

the recent visit to the park. That apples grew 
on trees, as did the nuts; that potatoes came 
from the ground; that the rain and the sun helped 
in the good work of growth, were ideas developed 
naturally from the children’s joy in these fruits 
of the autumn harvest. 
The month of December brought a new prob- 
lem. The children were almost exclusively Jewish, 
and of the Orthodox type, which, of course, made 
impossible any celebration of the Christmas fes- 
tival. That these children should be deprived of 
the joys of the Christmas season seemed to the 
kindergartner an unmitigated ill. She pondered 
her problem and finally decided that, even though 
her children must forego the delights of the 
Christmas-tide, they should not be bereaved of 
the spirit of the season. A New Year’s party was 
the outcome, and the month of December found 
these little children, like their Christian neigh- 
bors, busy at work on gifts for father and mother, 
and the beautiful spirit of service pervading the 
kindergarten. 
The paper dolls, which were the product of 
lessons in cutting, had been a constant source 
of enjoyment for the children, and now paved 
the way to the development of the doll-house, 
and incidentally to an ideal of home-keeping,

THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM 
which these children so sadly lacked. The fur- 
nishings of the rooms were first developed with 
the blocks, the dolls figuring largely in these 
plays, and determining in large measure the 
needs of each room. These plays were followed 
by the actual making of the simplest cardboard 
furniture, the work falling to the older children 
of the group. In this way kitchen, dining-room, 
bedroom, and living-room developed under the 
industrious fingers of these little children. 
Through plays with the paper dolls the use of 
each room was evidenced, and the house when 
completed was at the disposal of the children 
in their play periods. Thus home-keeping formed 
the theme for the month of January and was 
developed through the activities of the children. 
We will not weary the reader with further 
illustration, as we believe the development of the 
program shown serves to emphasize our point 
that the program must grow naturally from 
the needs of the group we are working with. 
We may force upon the children a program which 
is the product of the study, but it cannot have 
the same vital connection with the daily experi- 
ences and needs of the children, and therefore 
cannot be as productive of good. Each kinder- 
gartner must work out her own program; by so

doing she not only comes more closely in touch 
with the needs and life of the children, she, 
herself, grows through the process. Her work 
becomes thus life-giving in a twofold sense. Her 
joy and interest in her work are enhanced there- 
by. The satisfaction of achievement is hers. 
Deadly and monotonous is the work of the 
teacher who follows a cut-and-dried system, who 
is not alive to the quivering life about her, who 
does not realize nor accept the joy of responsi- 
bility in guiding and indirectly forming the lives 
of the little children entrusted to her care. 
yf Only the woman who enters the kindergarten 
work with a sense of obligation to serve, with 
an ideal that reaches beyond the mere art of 
teaching, achieves success which is satisfying 
and abiding.

THE USE OF THE KINDERGARTEN GIFTS 
Conservative practice and modern criticism 
FIFTEEN or more years ago, kindergarten prac- 
tice, so far as the use of the gifts and occupation 
materials was concerned, followed very closely 
the prescribed Froebelian method, or at least 
the interpretation of that method as expressed 
by the leading spirits in the kindergarten world. 
About this time the claims of modern psychology 
began to be brought to the notice of kinder- 
gartners, and well-known psychologists openly 
attacked the then existing kindergarten proce- 
dure. Gradually, as a result of this, kindergart- 
ners were stimulated to make a more careful 
study of psychology and modern pedagogy, and 
to watch their own procedure in the light of the 
new revelations. In time, kindergartners who 
possessed initiative and courage, and who saw 
that their own practice was defeating the basic 
principle of Froebelian philosophy, — self-activ- 
ity, — began gradually to alter their procedure, 
and to develop a new system in the use of the 
kindergarten gifts and occupations. 
II5
-P-A-G-E-122
THE KINDERGARTEN 
Changing the size of the gifts 
9 At first their attention was called to the need 
that children of kindergarten age should have op- 
portunity to work with larger materials so that 
there would be less strain on the undeveloped 
accessory muscles of the hands, and so that the 
children would be relieved of eye-strain. The 
gifts, and particularly the Froebelian occupa- 
tions, were scored severely in this connection by 
many educators. 
The kindergartner, therefore, who made no 
fetish of the gifts, but looked upon them simply 
as a means to an end, began first to study her 
children at their play with these materials, and 
then by degrees to experiment with larger mate- 
rials, and to watch the effect upon the children 
of the new departure. She found no need for 
change in the one and one-half-inch balls of the 
first gift, or the two-inch forms of the second, 
but with the building gifts she saw at once the 
value of the larger and more stable material. 
She had to admit, as she observed her children 
handling the small fifth gift, that the gift was 
without question a direct strain on the nervous 
energy, as well as on the undeveloped muscles of 
the hands. She noted, as never before, the 
116
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
flushed faces of her children, and in some in- 
stances the extreme nervous tension present 
when the children tried to build up these blocks. 
The tablets, sticks, and lintels had always been 
to the children a vexation of spirit because of 
the ease with which the forms made from these 
materials were displaced. The kindergartner 
soon saw how larger materials would obviate 
these difficulties, and thus meet the demands 
of the psychologists. So she began her experi- 
ment with the enlarged gift material. She had 
been warned by the doubters that it would be 
noisy and clumsy, and that the children could 
not handle it; but she braved the objections and 
started on her experiment. In less than six 
months she was a complete convert to the en- 
larged material. She observed, as had been pre- 
dicted, that the children made more noise in 
removing these blocks from the boxes, but she 
also found that the blocks were so stable that 
the forms made by the children rarely came 
tumbling down, as with the smaller material. 
She also soon learned that the children handled 
them with ease, and with a sense of conquest. 
These big boxes of blocks were something worth 
while, something worthy of their increasing 
years! The strain which had been present in the 
117
-P-A-G-E-124
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
use of the smaller material was now eliminated, 
and the children, through the use of this new 
and larger material, were stimulated to greater 
and more satisfactory creative work; work that 
was more satisfactory not only to the kinder- 
gartner, but particularly to the children. 
Changing the use of the gifts 
The change in the size of the gifts did not lead 
directly to a change of method in their use, al- 
though it may have contributed in a measure to 
the somewhat general departure from the pre- 
scribed use of the Froebelian materials. Influ- 
ences had been at work for some years to lead 
kindergartners to a procedure more in line with 
modern pedagogical ideas. The mathematical 
phase of the gifts had been unduly emphasized, 
and many an earnest kindergartner had asked 
herself, To what end is this waste of precious 
time? Number, fractional parts, and geometric 
form could be taught with the gifts, and were 
taught to these little tots of from four to six 
years of age. It was said that we did it through 
play; but into what a forced and artificial play 
it often degenerated! To what end were we 
cramming these poor little heads with mathe- 
matical facts and ideas, much better adapted to 
118
-P-A-G-E-125
THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
a later period of child development, and surely 
more easily and securely grasped at a later stage? 
Those kindergartners, deeply imbued with the 
philosophic insight, saw in it an ulterior value, 
and read into this practice a present good it 
surely did not possess. The earnest kinder- 
gartner, seeking the well-being of her children, 
came to feel the futility of such a procedure. 
Here she was, filling the brains of these little 
children with mathematical ideas which they 
would speedily forget when they entered the 
primary school, if, perchance, they still retained 
them. She was learning that in the most pro- 
gressive primary schools mathematics played 
only an incidental part in the first grade; that 
educators were showing that it would be more 
profitable to introduce mathematics at a later 
age, when the child’s reasoning powers were 
more fully developed. Why, then, should she in 
the kindergarten be emphasizing the mathemat- 
ical side of the gifts? 
Some overzealous kindergartners tell us that 
the kindergarten does not prepare for the first 
grade, it prepares for life; therefore, why con- 
sider what is done in the first grade of the pri- 
mary school? But if the kindergarten is an 
integral part of the public-school system, the 
119 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
kindergartner must consider the claims of the 
first grade. The relation between the two should 
be intimate and vital, and the kindergartner in 
her procedure should consciously work with the 
needs of the primary grade in mind. Otherwise 
the kindergarten has no obvious part or place in 
the public-school system. 
The observant kindergartner also came to 
see, as time went on, that her practice had been 
defeating the cardinal doctrine of Froebelian 
philosophy. So much time given to the mathe- 
matics of the gifts, so much time to carefully 
planned sequences and to directed work, de- 
voured too large a measure of the periods allotted 
to the gift work. The result was that the chil- 
dren were active in carrying out the ends which 
the kindergartner had determined upon, but had 
small opportunity for expression of self-activity 
—of making the inner outer, if you please. 
Hence, the really productive work of the chil- 
dren in the kindergarten, whether related to the 
gifts or the occupations, was distinctly meager, 
entirely out of proportion to the time put upon 
these means of expression week after week. 
The children could, perhaps, discover acute 
angles in neighboring buildings, but their devel- 
opment along the line of independent doing was 
120
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
decidedly curtailed. The kindergartner, there- 
fore, naturally felt that she was hardly living up 
to the Froebelian maxim, “The child learns by 
doing,” although she was following the so-called 
Froebelian method. She was, therefore, led to 
ask herself, Which is better, to follow the Froe- 
belian system of kindergarten gifts and occupa- 
tions, or the principles underlying the philosophy 
of Froebel? 
Again, she found that the following of this 
method of work cut the children off from any 
large measure of work or play with the advanced 
gifts, the gifts richest in content and most stim- 
ulating to the imagination of the child. So much 
time spent upon details with the earlier gifts 
left but a small amount of time at the end of the 
year for these gifts which offer such splendid 
opportunities for the productive activity of the 
children. She, therefore, came to feel, with many 
outside the kindergarten ranks, that her proce- 
dure was wrong and called for a radical change 
of method if she were to give to the children 
entrusted to her care “the opportunity for the 
fullest development of the total self.” 
121 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
Principles dominating modern procedure 
She had no quarrel with the materials. She 
saw in them splendid possibilities for the crea- 
tive activity of the children. She could hardly 
conceive of any series of blocks better adapted 
to meet the advancing stages of the child’s de- 
velopment than the kindergarten building gifts. 
She recognized that in changing her method of 
procedure she must not lose sight of the fact that 
all development is effected through a process of 
growth; that no hit-or-miss method would bring 
about the results at which she aimed.® In other 
words, each day’s work must be built upon the 
work of the days that preceded it, if any steady 
and lasting development was to be secured. She 
did not go about her change of procedure with 
the recklessness of one who has thrown off the 
shackles that bound her, and is at last free to 
follow her own will. Rather, she made her 
changes thoughtfully, basing them as she be- 
lieved on well-grounded principles of pedagogy, 
and as time and experience added to her insight, 
she revised and corrected her original departure 
until at last she had a working basis somewhat 
after the following plan: — 
122
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
a. The governing basis of all work with the 
gifts shall be that of self-activity. 
In other words, the work carried on with the 
gifts, directed or otherwise, should be judged 
by this standard: Is this calculated to develop 
self-activity in the children; or are the children 
truly self-active? 
6. The aim of the method shall be to lead the 
children to productive or creative work. 
c. The dominant note of all work with the 
gifts shall be that of play. 
In the kindergarten, play often leads into 
work in a normal fashion, the children them- 
selves taking on the term “work” with a sense 
of added dignity and power. This is a legitimate 
process, but where the use of the kindergarten 
materials tends to long-drawn-out formal and 
tedious Jessons, the spirit of play is killed, and 
the kindergarten becomes a veritable sub-pri- 
mary of an antiquated type. 
d. The plays with the gifts may take one of 
three forms: 
Experimental. 
Creative. 
Play free, thought directed. 
Play and thought directed. 
Under the term “absolute free play” we have 
123 Absolute free play. 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
THE KINDERGARTEN 
the two forms of play, experimental and cre- 
ative. When the constructive gifts are first 
presented to the children, they are allowed to 
experiment with them, while the kindergartner 
remains “passive and observant.” Later, as 
they gain control and mastery of the material, 
their work leads from the early experimenting 
into well-defined creative performance. We 
have, in short, products of the creative power 
of the children: simple, they may be, and crude 
oftentimes, but none the less valuable as an ex- 
pression of their budding inner life. 
The plays, in which the thought is directed 
and the play free, are to hold the children to a 
given line of work, which they may carry out 
according to their own ideas. This trains the 
children to persistence in a given line of en- 
deavor, and leads them gradually away from 
their earlier desultory type of work. The bene- 
fits of this method are plainly to be seen later 
in the children’s absolute free play. 
The directed play, in which both thought and 
play are controlled by the teacher, is given with 
the main object of suggesting to the children the 
1T use the term “absolute free play,” because in my ex- 
perience so many kindergartners give the term “free play” to 
play which is in no true sense free. 
124
-P-A-G-E-131
THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
possible uses of the material; number may enter 
incidentally into these plays, and the simpler 
phases of form may be brought to the children’s 
attention, but the chief aim is to further the 
self-activity of the children with the material 
in hand. For this reason directed plays, as a 
tule, occupy not more than fifteen minutes, the 
remainder of the period being used by the chil- 
dren in application of the new ideas thus pre- 
sented. 
e. The enlarged gift material shall be used 
throughout the course. 
jf. The children shall be divided for their gift 
work into two or more groups, according 
to the size of the kindergarten, and accord- 
ing to their relative abilities, and shall be 
permitted to carry on their play, either at 
the tables or on the floor as they may 
elect. 
g. With the older children the major part of 
1 “The problem of direction is thus the problem of selecting 
appropriate stimuli for instincts and impulses which it is de- 
sired to employ in the gaining of new experience. What new 
experiences are desirable, and thus what stimuli are needed, it 
is impossible to tell except as there is some comprehension of 
the development which is aimed at; except, in a word, as the 
adult knowledge is drawn upon as revealing the possible career 
open to the child.” (Dewey’s The Child and the Curriculum, 
P. 25.) 
125
-P-A-G-E-132
THE KINDERGARTEN 
the time shall be devoted to plays with the 
advanced gifts. 
As has already been noted, in many kinder- 
gartens, where the Froebelian use of the gifts 
holds sway, little time is afforded the children 
for work with the gifts richest in content, and 
hence more stimulating to the imagination and 
most effective for constructive uses. So much 
time spent upon the analysis of the earlier gifts 
and in the formal lessons precludes the possi- 
bility of any adequate measure of time for ac- 
quaintance with the advanced gifts. 
In one program which had a very general ac- 
ceptance among the more conservative of kin- 
dergartners and a somewhat wide application, 
we found the first of the constructive gifts, the 
third gift, introduced the ninth week, the sticks 
introduced the sixteenth week, and the square 
tablets, the nineteenth week; while the fourth 
gift did not appear until the twenty-eighth week, 
and the fifth and sixth almost not at all. For ten 
weeks the children were kept almost exclusively 
on the first and second gifts, the gifts which least 
of all stimulate the self-activity of the children.? 
1 We specially designate as the advanced gifts, the fifth and 
sixth, the series of triangular tablets, and the series of rings. 
? It is probable that this program has undergone some modi- 
126
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
Miss Blow tells us that in the plan of Froebel 
the true use of the kindergarten gifts called for 
at least four years for its realization.! In Amer- 
ica the kindergarten course covers two years. 
Many children are in the kindergarten only one 
year, some a fraction of that time. This, in it- 
self, would seem to be an argument in favor of 
a change from the regular Froebelian procedure 
to something that will be so adapted to the 
American needs as to utilize all the kindergarten 
gifts, rich in content. 
The majority of the American children, prior 
to entering the kindergarten, have played with 
blocks of some form or other. There is rarely a 
child, excepting possibly the foreign child, who 
is not already familiar with the cubical blocks, 
though not in the exact size or number as the 
kindergarten blocks of the third gift. They, 
therefore, know the cubical block, and the older 
children certainly understand, in a measure, its 
possibilities. Why, then, should the child be 
kept from the use of these blocks for weeks after 
his entrance into the kindergarten, and then 
have them week after week as food for his crea- 
tive instinct? The nutritive element of the third 
fications since the writer was familiar with it, but it represents 
very accurately a procedure that was in vogue a few years ago.

THE KINDERGARTEN 
gift is very slight, and the child whose creative 
powers are fed on this for a series of weeks is a 
starved little creature: he is the beginning of the 
docile (but docile only in the kindergarten), 
obedient, little grown-up, who figures too largely 
in some of our kindergartens to-day. This proc- 
ess annuls the principle of self-activity. The 
children from four to six years of age who enter 
our kindergartens are alive, eager, capable; why 
not give them, from the first, material that 
stimulates them to self-activity, that gives them 
opportunity for overcoming difficulties, for mas- 
tery of objects, instead of keeping them at work 
or play on objects not stimulating, not worthy 
of their sense of power? 
The children of the kindergarten are very like 
the boy of whom Froebel wrote, who, when his 
father would roll the wood out of his boy’s path- 
way that he might easily pass it, cried out, “Let 
it lie, let it lie, I can get over it.” As Froebel 
goes on to say: “With difficulty, indeed, the boy 
gets over it the first time; but he has accom- 
plished the feat by his own strength. Strength 
and courage have grown in him. He returns, 
gets over the obstacle a second time, and soon 
he learns to clear it easily.” ! This suggestion of

Froebel we need to take to heart in the use of 
the kindergarten gifts. 
Suggestions for the use of the various gifts 
It is, of course, impossible in the compass of 
this chapter to give in detail the work carried 
on under the new departure (now no longer new), 
but an outline suggesting something of the char- 
acter and scope of the work may be helpful. 
First Gift — Activity plays: motion and color 
plays: plays to develop and relate simple direc- 
tions (round and round, up and down, etc.), and 
the primary colors; families of color. 
With the younger children, simple activity 
plays are first given which lead naturally to the 
motion plays. The color plays, if given, are pre- 
sented at the discretion of the teacher. With 
the older children the motion and color plays 
first given are to determine what knowledge they 
have of direction and color, and the later plays 
are given according to the needs thus indi-' 
cated. The plays with this gift take the form 
of games. 
Second Gift — Experimental plays with the 
three forms to discover the characteristics of 
129
-P-A-G-E-136
    THE KINDERGARTEN 
each; names of forms given and relating of these 
forms to other objects (families of form); whirl- 
ing plays; simple mechanical inventions; group 
plays. 
With the younger children the sphere and 
cube are first given for activity plays, and the 
children are led to note the characteristics of 
these playthings — the sphere rolls, the cube 
stands still. This is followed by a game in which 
these characteristics are more specially empha- 
sized; as, for instance, the game of ninepins. 
Some time later the cylinder is introduced in 
similar fashion. Games or possibly group plays 
follow, in which the children utilize the forms 
for some simple constructive work or for some 
play in the sand-bed. No analysis of form is 
given — that is, no development of faces, cor- 
ners, and edges of the blocks. The gift is used 
only occasionally. 
With the older children, the whirling plays are 
given, and later in the year they have oppor- 
tunity to try their skill in the line of mechanical 
inventions, the individual boxes supplied with 
the staples being used.

  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
The building gifts 
Third Gift — Experimentation by the chil- 
dren: directed plays, chiefly forms by imitation 
illustrating objects made by man; creative work 
by the children. 
This gift is presented to the younger children 
the first week of kindergarten for their experi- 
mentation; from this they are led to see the possi- 
bilities of the material through the suggestive 
work given by the teacher in the directed plays. 
These directed plays are very brief, as has been 
previously indicated. As the children gain in 
skill a full free period is given them each week, 
and thus they are started on the road to creative 
work. 
Toward the latter part of the term, the chil- 
dren, if they have not already discovered it for 
themselves, are led to see how the gift may be 
used in the making of symmetrical arrangements 
about a given center. 
Tf in the older group there are a number of chil- 
dren new to the kindergarten, this gift is given 
once or twice, or more if necessary, for free play, 
while the kindergartner observes the work and 
ability of the children. If, on the other hand, 
the group is composed of children who have al- 
131
-P-A-G-E-138
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
ready had a term in kindergarten, the presenta- 
tion of this gift is omitted. 
Fourth Gift — Experimentation: directed plays 
to bring out the special features of this material 
— namely, enclosing areas in three ways, illus- 
trations of the laws of balance and equilibrium, 
if these have not previously been discovered by 
the children; simple constructive forms, such 
as doll’s furniture, leading to the furnishing of a 
house; group plays. 
The younger children are presented with this 
gift as soon as they handle and use skillfully the 
blocks of the preceding gift. After their experi- 
mentation — this may cover more than the 
period of one day — the kindergartner leads the 
children to note the contrast in the blocks of 
this gift and those of the third, a third gift being 
placed before the children. The children are then 
led to suggest and to show what things can be 
done with the new blocks not possible with the 
old blocks. Again, in the directed plays, which, 
I repeat, occupy only a small portion of the pe- 
riod, the teacher gives simple suggestive plays. In 
these she is guided by the children, for her aim 
is to let them, as far as is practicable, discover 
for themselves what possibilities the new mate- 
132
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
rial offers. She then adds to their knowledge, 
little by little, until in time they use the mate- 
rial with skill and ease. Simple plays are also 
employed in which the children work together 
for a common end, either by individual contri- 
butions, as in the furnishing of a room, or by 
common effort, as the enclosing of a large area, 
building of a fort, and the like. 
This gift is generally given to the older chil- 
dren the first week of kindergarten; if they 
demonstrate in their free play that they have 
already mastered this building material, the 
kindergartner passes on to the more difficult 
material of the fifth gift, recurring to the fourth 
as occasion may suggest. Where a large number 
of the children are new to the kindergarten, 
more time is given for the development of this 
gift, but the ground is covered much more rap- 
idly than with the younger children. 
It should be noted that the kindergartner 
gauges the ability of the child in the use of any 
given material, not by what he is able to do under 
direction, but by what he does independently. 
The constructive forms which he makes, the 
skill which he shows in adapting his material 
to given ends, and the ability to see, in a measure, 
both the possibilities and the limitations of his 
133
-P-A-G-E-140
THE KINDERGARTEN 
material govern the kindergartner in her pro- 
cedure. With both the younger and older groups 
the third and fourth gifts are used in conjunc- 
tion when the children have gained familiarity 
with the materials. 
Fifth Gift — Experimental plays: name of the 
new form given; plays for the discovery of new 
forms; an occasional directed form by imita- 
tion; many plays in which the thought is directed, 
the play free; once a week, at least, absolute 
free play; group plays. 
As has been indicated, the fifth gift is given 
as early in the year to the older children as is 
consistent with their ability to handle and use 
it profitably. At first one gift is given to every 
three children. After the gift is opened, it is 
divided into three equal parts, each child thus 
receiving one third of the gift. The children 
experiment with this new material and learn to 
build it up properly when their play is over. 
They play with this material in the same manner 
as with the other gifts, and little games for the 
discovery of the new forms contained in this 
gift are now given. The children begin these 
games with the two large triangular prisms, and 
find the various combinations possible. Another 
134
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
day they pass from this to finding what they 
can make with two of the small triangular prisms, 
then with three, then with four. The new block 
is termed by its technical name, but no attempt 
is made to teach the geometric names of the vari- 
ous forms made. If an inquisitive child asks its 
name, it is given, but there is no drill, no at- 
tempt to force upon the children the geometric 
nomenclature. The children in these plays profit 
by the experiences of one another; thus, when a 
difficult form is discovered by one child, which 
the others are not able to get, the successful 
child contributes his form to the group and 
it is made by imitation. These plays, which 
call for considerable concentration, do not last 
over fifteen minutes, and are followed by free- 
play. 
When the children are able to use the new 
material with ease and assurance, they are ready 
for the fifth gift as a whole. This is a day of 
achievement for the children; they receive this 
large amount of fascinating material with the 
air of conquerors. They have at last attained 
to something commensurate with their growing 
sense of power. There is seemingly no limita- 
tion to the possibilities of these most alluring 
blocks. The added amount of material, and 
135

  THE KINDERGARTEN 
the new form, emphasized by its appearance 
in both large and small-sized blocks, opens up 
a big field of work for these capable little people. 
The plays with the third of the gift have bridged 
the gulf between the fourth and fifth gifts, and 
the children do not hesitate to attack the new 
material with assurance. The plays in the dis- 
covery of form are continued for a time, and 
are a great aid to the children in successfully 
combining the blocks for their various construc- 
tions. The directed work continues along the 
line of suggestion. No symmetrical forms — 
“Forms of Beauty,” as termed in the Froebelian 
school of work — are given with this gift, though 
the children are free to work out these problems 
if they choose. The kindergartner purposely 
omits this work, because she believes this mate- 
tial is for building purposes and so naturally 
adapted to constructive forms of work. She 
feels, therefore, in the limited time at her dis- 
posal it is much wiser to lay stress on symmetri- 
cal forms in connection with the gifts which are 
specially adapted to this line of work, namely, 
the tablets and rings. Plays in which the whole 
group combine, as in the building of a town, be- 
gin now to be a prominent feature of the work, 
and later in the year the children, in groups of 
136

THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
twos and threes, occasionally combine their 
blocks in some construction. 
Sixth Gift — Experimentation: contrasts of 
fifth and sixth gifts as to forms and as to pos- 
sibilities; names of new blocks given; directed 
plays to suggest the architectural uses of the 
material; many plays in which the thought is 
directed, the play free; absolute free play; group 
plays. 
It may be truly said that the possibilities of 
the fifth gift are so many and interesting that the 
children never exhaust it. Throughout the year 
it forms one of the most profitable of our educa- 
tional agencies. It does not, however, tend to 
develop the zsthetic side of constructive work, 
but rather the practical. The blocks of the sixth 
gift, on the other hand, contribute directly to 
the child’s love of the beautiful. The introduc- 
tion of the column makes possible phases of archi- 
tectural work which take the child farther into 
the world of form, and widen his experience, at 
the same time cultivating his sense and love of 
that which is artistic and beautiful. Therefore, 
when the children have gained control of the 
fifth gift, so that they express themselves freely 
and satisfactorily with its material, the kinder- 
137
-P-A-G-E-144
  
THE KINDERGARTEN 
gartner introduces the sixth. The children are 
already accustomed to a large amount of mate- 
rial in the fifth gift, and so are quite ready for 
the sixth, so far as the mere manipulation of the 
material is concerned. The blocks, however, 
are not as suggestive in themselves as those of 
the fifth gift, because of the fact that they de- 
velop forms of architecture with which the 
children are not familiar. For this reason, and 
because the children are now older and more 
experienced, more directed plays are given with 
this material than with the fifth gift, but these 
plays still keep to the idea of suggesting what 
the possibilities of the gift are. This gift is not 
generally presented until the beginning of the 
second term, although there is no rigid rule in 
the matter, the needs of the children determin- 
ing its introduction. After the children have 
experimented with the blocks of the sixth gift, 
the fifth and sixth are contrasted, the children 
being led to discover the likenesses and dissimi- 
larities of the two. The technical names of the 
new blocks are given and the column is devel- 
oped as the special feature of the gift. Directed 
plays follow to suggest the use of this new fea- 
ture, and abundant opportunity is given the 
children in their free play for the application of 
138  
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
the ideas thus given. Group plays are also a 
prominent feature with this gift as the chil- 
dren advance in understanding and skill in its 
use. 
It should be said that in the use of all the build- 
ing gifts the children are taught to take the 
blocks from the boxes methodically, and at the 
end of their play to build them up and to return 
them to the boxes and to the cupboards. These 
little lessons in order and care of playthings the 
kindergartner believes essential to our Ameri- 
can children, who are too often allowed to be 
lax in these matters in their homes. They are 
not, however, obliged to open their boxes in 
unison. They are permitted to remove the blocks 
as quickly and deftly as they individually are 
able. There is no set time for the introduction 
of any one of the gifts, the kindergartner being 
guided in this matter solely by what her obser- 
vation leads her to believe advisable. It should 
also be remarked that in the case of one or two 
children who are not as proficient as the others, 
the group advances, and these individual chil- 
dren are given material adapted to their ability. 
Seventh Gift— The circular, square, and all 
the triangular tablets of the enlarged material 
139
-P-A-G-E-146
    THE KINDERGARTEN 
are used. Experimental plays with a limited 
amount of material; directed plays to suggest 
uses of material, symmetrical arrangements tak- 
ing precedence, as the work with the gift pro- 
gresses; term “triangular tablet” given to all 
the triangular forms; occasional group plays. 
The tablets are used supplementary to the 
preceding gifts from the beginning of the year. 
The mathematical phases of the gift are not em- 
phasized, save in relation to the elementary 
forms with which the children have already 
become familiar in the use of other materials. 
There is no analysis of the planes, no develop- 
ment of angles. The circle, square, and right 
isosceles triangle are used with the younger chil- 
dren, the circle being given first. A limited 
amount of material is first given and this in- 
creased as the children progress in its use. This 
gift is used less frequently with the younger 
children than with the older. 
With the older children more emphasis is laid 
upon work with the triangular tablets. The 
right isosceles is given first, and the others in 
turn as the children master the work with com- 
binations of the given tablets. The emphasis 
is laid upon the symmetrical forms, or, in other 
words, work in design, as the children naturally

-P-A-G-E-147
  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
lead that way. The amount of material given 
to the children is limited at first, increased as the 
children gain in their ability to develop arrange- 
ments, some children being able to combine 
larger numbers than others. At first, tablets of 
one kind are used in any given combination, 
and later the various tablets are united, some- 
times at the will of the teacher, often as the chil- 
dren may elect. The method which proved most 
helpful in leading the children to successful free 
work was the following: The teacher had the 
children make by imitation a center, or funda- 
mental, as we sometimes designate it; then four, 
eight, or more tablets were placed at the dis- 
posal of the children to arrange about the given 
center as they might see fit; the only rule to 
which they were held being that of correct bal- 
ance. In this work the children were led to see 
the value of working by opposites in order to 
insure the correct balance of parts. In time they 
advanced to absolute free play. Experience 
proved that the children did not readily see the 
application of the material to picturing objects 
made by man; so the kindergartner through 
directed plays gave a few of these forms, gen- 
erally by imitation, thus suggesting to the chil- 
dren a further use of the gift. The tablets are 
141
-P-A-G-E-148
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
given frequently throughout the year, but not 
as often as the building gifts. 
Eighth Gift — Sticks from one to ten inches in 
length used. Experimentation with a limited 
amount of material, sticks of medium length and 
all of the same length being first used; a few 
directed plays; the material used largely to illus- 
trate things of interest in the children’s daily 
experience; number enters incidentally, — count- 
ing plays, and the like. 
With the younger children the sticks are used 
chiefly for linear picture plays of things in which 
the children are at the time specially interested, 
and are also used in conjunction with the tablets 
for illustrative purposes, but they are not usually 
given early in the year. 
With the older children the gift is used occa- 
sionally throughout the year, particularly as an 
illustrative means. For example, a group of 
children, after a visit to a farm, will work out 
the whole story of a farm, each child having a 
definite part to carry out — picturing buildings, 
fields, orchard, and so on. This play will be 
carried out on the floor so that the longer sticks 
may be used. At other times the material may 
be employed to represent some object. 
142
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
Ninth Gift — Experimental plays: develop- 
ment of symmetrical arrangements, both through 
free and directed plays. 
With the younger children the whole rings 
only are used, a limited number being first given, 
beginning with the largest rings. The gift is 
used occasionally. 
With the older children all the forms of this 
gift, save the smallest quarter rings, are used 
in the course of the year, and the children as 
they progress are allowed as much material as 
they can handle profitably. The plays are 
largely free, directed plays being occasionally 
given to turn the attention of the children to 
wider uses of the material. 
Tenth Gift — Lima beans, medium-sized peb- 
bles, horse-chestnuts, and the like are used in 
place of lentils. The work is largely free; the 
gift is seldom used. 
After the experimental play the teacher gives 
some directed play in the following manner: 
Large sheets of heavy paper on each of which 
has been drawn, in bold outline, the form of an 
object, — animal, fruit, or an object made by 
man, — are given to the children, and they fol- 
low the outline with the material of the gift. 
143 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
THE KINDERGARTEN 
In localities where large material, such as horse- 
chestnuts, can be secured, very excellent results 
may be achieved, the children working their 
ideas out boldly on the floor of the kindergarten, 
an exercise which is very much enjoyed by them. 
It is impossible to tabulate all the benefits 
derived from the method above indicated in the 
use of the kindergarten gifts; all the knowledge 
incidentally gained; all the stimulus to new en- 
deavor; all the incentive achieved through the 
overcoming of obstacles. We may, however, 
point out, what experience has shown, that the 
gift work thus pursued develops in the children 
initiative, self-reliance, self-control, power in 
the control of material, and ability to express 
one’s self through material means, far in excess 
of the development of these qualities through 
the method pursued in former days. The kin- 
dergartner has often been astonished by the 
creative ability of little children when thus 
given ample opportunity to express itself. In 
many cases, particularly with the fifth gift 
blocks and the tablets of the seventh, she has 
realized that some of the children surpass her 
in their original use of the material. The joyous- 
ness with which the children pass on from 
144 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE USE OF THE GIFTS 
achievement to greater achievement attests its 
value. 
A kindergartner of wide experience visited a 
kindergarten in which the above plan of work 
was carried out. She chose to observe the work 
of the older children. The teacher in charge 
said to her: ‘‘I was planning to have the chil- 
dren use the tablets this morning, but if you 
would prefer to see the children work with some 
other gift, I will be glad to change my program.” 
The kindergartner replied that she would like 
to see the children work with the fifth gift. 
The teacher thereupon gave to each child a large 
fifth gift and the kindergartner moved about 
among the children, free to observe their work. 
Each child worked out happily some idea which 
for the moment absorbed him, until at last there 
were fifteen separate structures, varying, of 
course, in intrinsic merit, but each one an ex- 
pression of a child’s thought and ability. The 
visitor turned to the teacher and said: “It is 
wonderful! I don’t understand it. How have 
you achieved it?” The teacher was able to re- 
ply: “There is really nothing wonderful about 
it. It is simply the result of a steady growth in 
independent doing. We begin the first of the 
year to train our little people in the habit of 
145
-P-A-G-E-152
THE KINDERGARTEN 
working freely and independently with the 
various materials, and what you have just wit- 
nessed is the natural outgrowth of such a pro- 
cedure.” 
We, therefore, present this scheme of gift 
work to the young kindergartner with no hesi- 
tation. We believe in it. We realize in what 
measure it is a departure from the Froebelian 
system of work, but we believe that, while it 
departs from the carefully developed Froebelian 
schools of work, it most truly embodies the vital 
principles of Froebel’s educational theory, which 
are the fundamentals in any right system of 
child-training.
-P-A-G-E-153

THE USE OF THE STORY IN THE 
KINDERGARTEN 
Ir was an accepted principle of Froebel’s that 
whatever contributed to the pleasure of children 
in general, in all times and all climes, had in it 
elements of value; that it, in some way or other, 
conduced to the development of the individual. 
He believed, therefore, that certain toys, such 
as the ball and the doll, which have given uni- 
versal pleasure to children in all generations, 
possess distinct educational value. Likewise tra- 
ditional games, which have been passed on from 
generation to generation through some occult 
medium, have lived because of innate worth. 
The story belongs in this category of things 
which hold within themselves elements of good, 
and which thus contribute to the education of 
little children. We are not surprised, therefore, 
to find the story playing an important part in 
the procedure of a kindergarten. We should, 
rather, be surprised if it were not so. 
147
-P-A-G-E-154
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
The function of the story 
In the development of the race, the story in 
one form or another played no insignificant part. 
The bards of ancient times were honored story- 
tellers; and the epics of the ancients are to-day 
our classics. The love of the story is not confined 
to little children, for the story in an enlarged 
and elaborated form to-day holds under its spell 
the youth and the adult in countless numbers. 
Froebel believed that the child’s love of the story 
centers in the fact that the story in its various 
phases expresses for him the experiences of his 
own little life, which, in a measure, he only 
faintly comprehended, but which fill him with 
yearnings for expression that are beyond his 
limited vocabulary, as well as beyond his as yet 
uncontrolled life. Affection, sympathy, mis- 
understandings, struggles with temptations and 
unfortunate habits, heroic adventures, and 
heroic conquests of self, which are found in the 
story, particularly in the fairy-tale, hint of his 
own immature attempts at adjustment to his 
world. Just as the great novel pictures for the 
adult the universal history of the human spirit, 
so the well-conceived child’s story pictures for 
1 Education of Man, pp. 116-17.

  THE USE OF THE STORY 
him the beginnings of this history. Small and 
insignificant as they may seem to the dulled 
imagination of the grown-up, to the little child 
they are teeming with life and vitality and 
truth. Because these stories suggest his experi- 
ences, and sometimes show the way out of diffi- 
culties, they supply for his expanding soul a 
nutriment nowhere else to be found. This con- 
stitutes the prime reason for the use of the story 
in the kindergarten. 
Its practical worth 
For those who demand a more practical eluci- 
dation of the value of the story for the little 
child, we may add that the story is for him the 
beginning of literature; for the stories, when 
properly selected, are giving to the child his 
first taste, and are creating thereby an appetite 
for good literature, which in time leads to the 
love of books, without which a soul leads but a 
barren existence, but with which the human 
spirit is never companionless nor solitary. 
“Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know, 
Are a substantial world, both pure and good: 
Round these with tendrils strong as flesh and blood, 
Our pastime and our happiness will grow.” ! 
1 Wordsworth’s Personal Talk. 
149
-P-A-G-E-156
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
Incidentally, through the story the child en- 
larges his vocabulary and increases his fund of 
expression. It also is not unusual for the story 
to be a direct means of inciting to better con- 
duct and worthier ideals. The fairy-tale par- 
ticularly contributes to the fostering of better 
conduct, because it so plainly and so simply 
shows in their true perspective the effect of such 
habits as greed, dishonesty, cruelty, and rude- 
ness, while showing, with illuminating clearness, 
the beauty of their opposites — generosity, hon- 
esty, kindness, and courtesy. 
Two mistakes in choice of material 
In the selection of stories the kindergartner 
finds a wealth of material at her disposal. 
Among the classics, myths, folk-tales, and fairy- 
tales allure her, while a host of modern stories, 
good, bad, and indifferent, await her selection. — 
In this wealth of material there lurk two dan- 
gers, of which many kindergartners are not un- 
mindful. There are so many good stories the 
kindergartner overloads her program. She pre- 
sents too many stories, with the result that the 
children contract mental indigestion. Again, she 
is often inclined to present stories that are far be- 
yond the comprehension of children of kinder- 
150
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE USE OF THE STORY 
garten age. She attributes to them an assimila- 
tive power possessed by children of ten or twelve 
years of age. The story is beautiful, it takes her 
fancy, she must tell it to the children, and if it 
is dramatically presented, it often holds their 
attention, and she flatters herself that they have 
grasped the meaning of the tale, whereas in truth 
they have but got the shell of the story: its beauty 
and the truth which it embodies are beyond their 
grasp. She thus defeats two purposes — both 
her immediate effort and the effort of some 
teacher who, later on in the grades, will attempt 
to present the same story to children who are 
now able to comprehend and appreciate it at its 
full value, but for whom its luster has been 
dimmed by the premature telling in the kinder- 
garten. ‘We heard that in the kindergarten!” 
is an aggravating salute for a fourth-grade 
teacher to receive from her group of children 
when she presents a story which her judg- 
ment leads her to believe is adapted to the 
needs and comprehension of a much more ma~- 
ture development than that found in our kin- 
dergartens. 
The kindergartner must use a wise discrimina- 
tion in the selection of stories. She will find that 
a majority of the stories written for children, 
151
-P-A-G-E-158
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
both the classical and the modern, are not 
adapted to children of the immature age with 
which we have to deal in the kindergarten. For 
example, few of the popular sop fables are 
within the comprehension of children from four 
to six years of age; the same is true in general 
of myths, and many folk-tales. There are, 
of course, individual exceptions, but the above 
statement holds true in relation to the mass of 
children who are found in our kindergartens. 
The store of classic fairy-tales, however, is a 
more fruitful field of investigation for the kin- 
dergarten teacher. Andersen’s beautiful fairy- 
tales, on the other hand, are, almost without 
exception, written for older children. Stories, 
such as Little Beta and the Lame Giant, and 
Prince Harweda,' charming stories which em- 
body an elaborate symbolism, are far too highly 
refined and developed for kindergarten children. 
The fact that they are told in some of our kin- 
dergartens does not disqualify our statement. 
The same is true, with one or two possible excep- 
tions, of the beautiful parables of Mrs. Richards,? 
which are much better adapted to the adult 
mind than to that of little children. In some

THE USE OF THE STORY 
cases it is true that stories in their original form 
may be cut and adapted to the intelligence of 
the kindergarten child, but it is an open ques- 
tion whether this is a wise procedure. A short 
story which in itself is a perfect specimen, or at 
least an excellent specimen, of story-making, 
ought not to be mutilated. Why not pass such 
stories on to your sister teachers, who will have 
the children later when they can appreciate the 
story in its entirety? It is probable that almost 
every kindergartner of long experience, in the 
early years of her practice, presented many of 
these stories to her children. She knew that they 
were fine stories; she loved them; she could tell 
them with such skill that the children listened 
spellbound, and she believed that they grasped 
both their beauty and truth. One day she awoke 
to the fact that it was a mental impossibility 
for the children to gain from these stories what 
she had imagined they did. She realized that 
she was expecting of them a process of appercep- 
tion far beyond their ability. She began to 
wonder why they had listened so attentively. 
Had they really got any mental content from 
the story, and if so, was it distorted to meet their 
immature intelligence? Or, had they like little 
David, in The Awakening of Helena Ritchie, been 
153
-P-A-G-E-160
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
fascinated in studying how many times she 
moved her jaw? 
Despite the fact that the majority of children’s 
stories are written for children older than those 
found in our kindergartens, we need not despair, 
as we still have a sufficiently large selection open 
to us. We need to remember that we must not 
overload the child’s mind. A good story will 
bear repetition: the children’s love for it grows 
as it becomes more familiar. We do not want 
to instill in our children that insatiable desire 
for change that proclaims the vacillating mind. 
We may easily do this if we present too many 
stories to them. 
The chief characteristics of a good tale 
It will be profitable for us to consider for a 
few moments what the chief characteristics of a 
story adapted to the needs of children of kinder- 
garten age are. By so doing we may have a 
guide in our study of stories which will facilitate 
our work in selection. 
We may safely say that the kindergarten child 
calls for stories dealing with primitive needs, 
primitive emotions, and primitive experiences, 
for these are in line with his own life. He is not 
able to grasp a complicated plot, nor is he equal 
154
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE USE OF THE STORY 
to the subtle analysis demanded by some of the 
modern fairy-tales. The story adapted to his 
needs must make a direct appeal to his imagi- 
nation: the reaction must be instantaneous. 
He has no interest in the circuitous method of 
reaching a desired end. It should also abound 
in action and be expressed in simple, vivid lan- 
guage. The elements, repetition and direct dis- 
course, if not a necessity, are certainly charac- 
teristics of an ideal story for little children. The 
favorite classics, The Story of the Three Bears, 
The Three Little Pigs, and The Little Red Hen, 
combine in a most successful manner all the ele- 
ments needful to a perfect story for children of 
kindergarten age — action, simplicity of plot, 
simple, vivid language, repetition, and direct 
discourse. These tales are nursery classics: they 
have endured because of the instantaneous ap- 
peal which they make to the mind of a little 
child. The writers of these stories understood 
little children. 
A few of the fairy-tales collected by the Grimm 
brothers and some of the English fairy-stories 
meet almost ideally the requirements of a story 
for very young children. Simple hero-stories 
narrating the deeds of children, and particu- 
larly the heroic deeds of animals, are accept- 
155
-P-A-G-E-162
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
able to children. Humorous tales in which the 
humor is decidedly apparent, in other words, 
put on with broad strokes, make their appeal 
to these children; but tales in which the humor 
is of a subtle nature fall absolutely flat. 
All who recognize the important part which 
a sense of humor plays in life will appreciate the 
value of occasionally introducing a purely humor- 
ous tale. A sense of humor is a safety-valve for 
us adults: a hearty laugh is good for all. 
Historical tales, on the other hand, are hardly 
fitted to children of kindergarten age. The aver- 
age kindergarten child does not comprehend 
long periods of time, and the attempt to intro- 
duce him to phases of history through the me- 
dium of the story is very largely a waste both 
of time and good material. Nature-tales, the 
object of which is to impart certain facts in rela- 
tion to the world of nature, should be given in 
homeeopathic doses. It is better for the child of 
tender years to get his knowledge of Nature 
through contact with her. There are, however, 
a few stories which illustrate for him some facts 
within his knowledge which may be safely used; 
and there are also numbers of good stories deal- 
ing in happy vein with phases of animal life 
from which the children derive much enjoyment 
156 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE USE OF THE STORY 
and profit. We find little place in the kinder- 
garten for the moral story, the sole aim of which 
is to deliver in pointed fashion some needed 
lesson. All the stories which we use may be said 
to have a moral value: the truths which many 
of them implant in the heart of the little child 
are much more effective than the old-fashioned 
moral tale, which more often antagonized than 
allured. 
Telling the story 
It is the custom in the kindergarten to ¢ell the 
story to the children rather than to read it. In 
dealing with children as young as we have in 
the kindergarten, this is by all means, with oc- 
casional exceptions, the better method. The 
story is an intimate thing, and in telling it, the 
teacher comes closer to her children than through 
the medium of reading. She is able also to adapt 
it more readily to meet the immediate needs of 
her group, and to make it more dramatic and 
realistic, and thus better to hold the interest 
and the attention of the children. Because the 
story is an intimate thing, it should be told to 
small groups of children who are gathered about 
the teacher. It is, we believe, a great mistake 
for a kindergartner to attempt to tell the story 
157
-P-A-G-E-164
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
to the entire body of children, seated in the 
kindergarten circle. It is, indeed, a pathetic 
sight to see a kindergartner attempting this 
method. It is only in rare instances that she is 
able to hold the attention of all the children. 
Her attempts to throw the story across her 
large circle to the children most remote from her, 
to hold the attention of those nearest to her, and 
to enlist the interest of those who are not yet old 
enough, possibly, to grasp the beauty of the 
story, is positively painful to the onlooker. In 
every kindergarten there are children of various 
ages and stages of development, and it is not 
reasonable to expect that one given thing, be it 
story, gift play, or occupation work, will meet 
the needs of all of them. The work must be 
adapted to them, and for this reason stories 
should be selected with a view to meeting the 
needs and interests of the various children. This 
can only be done by separating the children into 
two, three, or more groups, according to their 
abilities, and then providing stories to meet the 
requirements of each group. This method adds 
not only to the children’s joy and profit in the 
story, but it adds to the teacher’s pleasure as 
well as comfort in presenting it. Story-telling 
should be a joy to the teacher; it ceases to be a 
158
-P-A-G-E-165
THE USE OF THE STORY 
joy when it passes from the matter of an inti- 
mate relationship to a more or less formal pro- 
ceeding — to a duty that must be performed 
because it is a part of a kindergarten schedule. 
It follows, therefore, that different stories 
should usually be given to the different groups 
on the same day. The habit of selecting one 
story and forcing it upon each group, whether 
or no, is pernicious, as is also the habit of select- 
ing a given story for a set day for the children 
of all the kindergartens of a given city. We have 
witnessed this latter procedure, and have not 
known which of the two sufferers was more to 
be commiserated — the group of little children, 
or the teacher obligated to perform this bad 
pedagogical act. A story which may meet most 
happily the needs of the children in a kinder- 
garten like the Horace Mann, of Teachers Col- 
lege, when presented to a group of East Side 
foreign children, whose lives are confined and 
narrow, will have a deadening effect upon the 
spirits of these children, and will be a direct 
means of developing inattention and impairing 
their power of concentration. It is not that the 
less favored children are to be deprived of stories 
that nurture the spirit and stir the imagination; 
but rather that they should be given stories 
159
-P-A-G-E-166
    THE KINDERGARTEN 
better adapted to their needs —stories which 
they may be able to interpret through their own, 
lives, rather than stories the content of which 
leads them into an unknown realm for which 
they have neither chart nor compass, where 
they are left stunned and bewildered, instead 
of stimulated and revived, by the telling. 
Story-telling is an art. Some are born to this 
art, and some achieve it through persistent en- 
deavor. Every kindergartner ought to be an 
artist in story-telling. If this is not possible, it 
certainly is not demanding too much to ask that 
every kindergartner strive to be an artist in 
story-telling. There are no fixed and fast rules 
by which the art may be attained, for it is too 
largely a matter of personality; but a few simple 
suggestions may help the inexperienced kinder- 
gartner toward more artistic work. 
Suggestions for preparation 
After selecting a story, it should be read first 
with a view to getting its general style and 
features; then it should be re-read slowly as 
many times as is necessary for the individual 
thoroughly to imbibe its salient points, its spe- 
cial atmosphere. It must never be committed 
word for word. There is nothing more fatal to 
160
-P-A-G-E-167
  THE USE OF THE STORY 
good story-telling, for story-telling is not a reci- 
tation. The teacher who memorizes her story 
puts herself in jeopardy: she lays herself open 
to the danger of forgetting it, than which there is 
nothing more disastrous, as well as to the dan- 
ger of being easily discomfited by the remarks 
which the children are sure to interject, or by 
the entrance of unexpected visitors. Rhymes 
which appear in the story may be memorized, 
and certain phrases which are to be repeated 
again and again must also be learned verbatim. 
But the story as a whole must be made the 
teacher’s own, must become a part of herself, 
so to speak, so that it seems to issue spontane- 
ously from some inexhaustible source. There is 
no other way, no shorter cut to artistic story- 
telling. The memorized story can never be any- 
thing but a mechanical, formal thing, which is 
sure to fall short of its mission. 
In order to make the story her own, the 
teacher, after mastering its chief features, must 
put the book aside and tell the story, preferably 
audibly, to no less an interested listener than 
herself, and later, if she be fortunate, to some 
child friend. She must not be afraid to make 
use of gesture where gesture is called for, and 
she must know the meaning of “dramatic fire,” 
161
-P-A-G-E-168
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
while guarding against a theatrical display of 
dramatic pyrotechnics. In short, she must pre- 
pare for the telling of the story as carefully as 
she would prepare for any other phase of her 
work. When she finally gathers her children 
about her to listen to the story, she must put self- 
consciousness out of the way. She must remem- 
ber Froebel’s motto, “Come, let us live with our 
children,” and she will find that neither the en- 
trance of the principal nor of the board of edu- 
cation nor the irrelevant remark of a child will 
have any power to disconcert her. The story 
and she are one, there is nothing to fear. This 
happy condition will not be achieved after one 
effort, but it will come in time, if the kinder- 
gartner perseveres in her ideal. 
In connection with story-telling, she must 
remember the necessity of the use of good Eng- 
lish. She should be constantly on her guard 
against the habit of dropping into careless expres- 
sion and poor enunciation. The children are 
copyists. They catch with incredible avidity 
her expressions, her inflections, and even her 
enunciation. The reading of good literature is 
our chief help in the use of correct English; it is 
also our best means of acquiring an apprecia- 
tion of literary values. But both in the use of 
162
-P-A-G-E-169
THE USE OF THE STORY 
good English and in clear enunciation, habit is a 
great factor. She must, therefore, habituate 
herself to these virtues. 
Miss Nora Smith gives us so good a recipe for 
story-telling that we feel inclined to pass it on: 
“One measure of pure literary taste; two of 
gesture and illustration; three of dramatic fire; 
four of ready speech and clear expression. To 
these add a pinch of tact and sympathy.” 
Tact, or the ability to adapt one’s self to her 
group of children, to find its peculiar needs and 
to fit the story to them, is a prime essential in 
successful story-telling, and the born story- 
teller is sure to have this gift. Sympathy with 
the life and moods of the children, as well as 
with the spirit and content of the story, is 
equally essential, and is possessed by all good 
story-tellers. It is a mistake, we believe, to 
attempt to tell a story which you neither enjoy 
nor appreciate. You cannot give life to a story 
into which you yourself do not enter. This is 
illustrated again and again in those kindergar- 
tens where some outside influence prescribes the 
stories to be given. This is fatal to the develop- 
ment of the art of story-telling. 
In the selection of fairy-tales it is sometimes 
necessary to make some slight changes which 
163 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  THE KINDERGARTEN 
do not affect the thought and beauty of the story, 
better to adapt it to the interests and under- 
standing of the children. For instance, in the 
story of The Frog Prince, it is better to close with 
the happiness of the little boy in the return to 
his home and parents, rather than to give the 
usual ending of the consummation of a happy 
marriage. The subject of marriage is not one of 
any interest to a child of kindergarten years; 
whereas separation and return are vital experi- 
ences in the life of children. For this reason, 
such stories as Cinderella should be left for a 
later period. We sympathize with those who 
object to the traditional idea of the stepmother 
or the stepfather, portrayed as beings of vicious 
and hateful tendencies. This relationship is not 
essential to the truth the story embodies; any 
old woman or man will answer as well. It is in 
the adaptation of these stories that the judg- 
ment, tact, and sympathy of the teacher are 
called into play. 
The reading of rhythmic poems 
In connection with the use of the story in the 
kindergarten, it is not amiss to speak of the 
value of occasionally reading to the children 
poems rich in rhythm. Only a few such poems 
164
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE USE OF THE STORY 
need be given, but repeated frequently. These 
poems meet the child’s love of rhythmic sound, 
and the reading of them brings to the chil- 
dren the suggestion that these delightful things 
are found in books. Such poems as Eugene 
Field’s The Rock-a-by Lady fascinate the chil- 
dren. 
Take again such a simple poem as Lucy Lar- 
com’s well-known The Brown Thrush, and you 
can appreciate the appeal which both the rhythm 
and the content of the poem make to the emotions 
of the child-heart. Mr. Clement C. Moore’s 
A Visit from St. Nicholas is another example of 
poems which give delight to children. 
Books containing stories 
There are to-day a multiplicity of good books 
presenting stories for children. In the past few 
years there has been a revival of interest, seem- 
ingly, in folk- and fairy-tales, myths, and the 
like, and many publishers are now offering edi- 
tions of these desirable tales, well edited, so that 
if the kindergartner does not herself possess a 
supply of such books, one or more of these excel- 
lent collections will be found in the public libra- 
ries of any town, be it large or small. Books 
containing various types of stories are usually 
165
-P-A-G-E-172
| | 
THE KINDERGARTEN 
found in public libraries, and these are not be- 
yond the purchasing ability of the teacher. 
The story-hour should be, and often is, one 
of the happiest periods of a kindergarten day. 
It is a time when the teacher touches the spirit 
and kindles the imagination of her children: it 
is her opportunity for helpful suggestion; for 
inciting to better conduct; for suggesting ideals 
of life through the alluring details of the true 
fairy-tale. “Once upon a time” are in many 
kindergartens, as they should be in all, the magic 
words that bring a new light to the eyes of the 
children. The ideal story is, in truth, a mental 
and moral tonic for the children. Would that we 
all knew how to use it with power and judgment! 
We append herewith a brief list of books for 
supplementary reading; also a short list of stories

VI 
THE KINDERGARTNER AND THE PRIMARY 
TEACHER 
/ Tue little child enters the kindergarten at the 
age of four or five, and passes on into the first 
grade of the primary school at the age of six; or, 
possibly, as in some of our more congested cities, 
he enters the kindergarten at the age of five and 
is pushed on into the primary at five and a half, 
to make room for some other child who is clam+ 
oring for admission to the kindergarten. 
i Vv What the kindergarten achieves 
In the first instance, the little child has gained 
from his kindergarten training, provided this 
training has been of the accepted type, certain 
attitudes toward life which make him more com- 
formable to the amenities of social existence. 
The beginnings of desirable habits have been 
established, — courtesy, kindness, thoughtful- 
ness, cleanliness, order, obedience, and the like, 
—and ideals of life commensurate with his im- 
mature intelligence have been made clear to 
168
-P-A-G-E-175
i4SINDERGARTNER AND TEACHER 
him. He is, in a measure, more self-controlled 
than the child who entered the kindergarten a 
year or more earlier, and he is distinctly more 
self-reliant. His vocabulary is very much larger 
than when he first came under the influence of 
the kindergarten; his expression richer; he has 
gained innumerable ideas of the world in which 
he lives, of the relationships of things — all of 
which are his mental stock-in-trade, which he 
takes on with him into the primary school. He 
is eager for the work that awaits him in the pri- 
mary, the allurements of which the kindergart- 
ner may have already set before him. He has 
put away the childish things of the kindergarten; 
he is now to read and write! But in relation 
to the general characteristics of children, he is 
but little changed. He is still the delightfully 
spontaneous being he was when he entered the 
kindergarten; brimming full of activity; guided 
largely by his feelings; gauging life by his sym- 
pathies; his power of concentration, though 
somewhat developed, still weak, and his atten- 
tion almost wholly involuntary. 
In the second instance, the little child has 
been very slightly affected by his life in the kin- 
dergarten. Five months or less is too short a 
time in which to establish correct habits or to 
169
-P-A-G-E-176
I _ 
THE KINDERGARTEN 
develop the elements of self-control and self- 
reliance. The kindergartner has but made her 
beginnings in this good work when he is taken 
from her guidance and rushed on into the pri- 
mary. If a foreign child, an improved vocabu- 
lary is, perhaps, his most noticeable acquisition 
from his kindergarten stay; but in general, while 
the kindergartner may be conscious of improve- 
ment and growth along all lines, to the succeed- 
ing teacher this is not marked, for its roots have 
little depth. Unfortunately, it is generally the 
case that the children who are subjected to this 
sort of kindergarten training, which is beyond 
the power of the kindergartner to alter, though 
protest she always may, are those whose home 
environment is lacking in the things needful to 
proper child-training, and are, therefore, the 
children who particularly need the full course of 
kindergarten training. 
The common ground of kindergartner and 
primary teacher 
It would seem, therefore, that the problem of 
the primary teacher, so far as the training of 
little children is concerned, is not different from 
that of the kindergartner. The child with whom 
she has to deal is the same child who came into 
170
-P-A-G-E-177
  KINDERGARTNER AND TEACHER 
the kindergarten, changed only in degree. If 
the primary teacher looks upon her work as 
something more than the teaching of the three 
R’s, if the training of the whole child is her 
business, the same as that of her sister kinder- 
gartner, it matters greatly to her to what pre- 
vious influences the children who come under her 
care haye been accustomed. 
Our increasing recognition of the fact 
Not many years ago it was not an uncommon 
thing to hear superintendents of schools dis- 
cussing the advisability of establishing transi- 
tional classes, to bridge the gap between the kin- 
dergarten and the primary school. Why has the 
interest in and need of the transitional class 
died out? It is, we believe, due to two facts. 
First, the kindergarten is no longer looked upon 
as a pedagogical abnormality: it is recognized 
as the corner-stone of a unified structure. Sec- 
ond, the ideals of what constitutes proper train- 
ing in the primary grades have undergone a 
radical change, so that to-day the child passing 
on into the first grade of the primary does not 
find himself in a place the atmosphere of which is 
foreign to all his previous experience. We still 
have too many primary schools of the antiquated 
171 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
ha | os 
THE KINDERGARTEN 
type; but in our progressive schools of to-day 
we find in the primary, as in the kindergarten, 
an air of greater freedom; so-called busy-work 
or hand-work, allied to the kindergarten occu- 
pations, engaging the children’s attention; and 
stories, games, and dramatization playing an 
important part. In some cases the stationary 
seats and desks have been removed, and the 
primary, like the kindergarten, suggests a busy 
hive of industrious, free, little people. { 
In some of our best State Normal Schools the 
Kindergarten Training-Course has been changed 
to the Kindergarten Primary Training-Course, 
and all the students in these courses are pre- 
pared to teach either in the kindergarten or the 
primary. This, more than anything else, we 
believe, is making for an appreciation of the 
unity of the work, and the unity of the purpose, 
of the kindergarten and the primary school. 
In view of the fact that the individual to be 
educated in the primary is not a different crea- 
ture from the one to be educated in the kinder- 
garten, that the means to be applied are not 
divorced from the kindergarten agencies, but an 
enlargement of them and a development from 
them, that the ideals and purposes are the same, 
—the well-being and development of little 
172
-P-A-G-E-179
  KINDERGARTNER AND TEACHER 
children, — it seems the natural thing that there 
should exist between the teacher of the kinder- 
garten and the teacher of the primary an inti- 
mate and fraternal relation. That this has been 
the exception rather than the rule in the past, 
we must frankly admit: that it is happily becom- 
ing more general to-day we count as one of the 
favorable signs of better times to come. 
Reasons for its retardation 
But why has this much-to-be-desired coépera- 
tion of kindergartner and primary teacher been 
so retarded? Wherein lies the difficulty? The 
difficulty has its root, unquestionably, in the 
attitude of the teaching body, both of the kin- 
dergarten and the primary. There has been 
a class of primary teachers who have clung 
tenaciously to mechanical routine, and whose 
hostility to the kindergarten is proverbial. Stiff- 
necked they have been, unapproachable, un- 
yielding. Happily their kind is gradually vanish- 
ing from the pedagogical stage. On the other 
hand, there is among the primary teachers a 
class of women, alert, intelligent, actuated by 
high ideals, filled with no less enthusiasm for 
the betterment of the children under their care 
than their sister kindergartners. Many of them 
173
-P-A-G-E-180
eer meats 
THE KINDERGARTEN 
are as well educated and equipped for their 
chosen work as the kindergartners, some of them, 
possibly, better educated and equipped. They 
are ready to codperate with the kindergartner, 
ready for any plan of action that will make their 
work for little children more efficient. They 
have gone halfway, and they have, alas! in too 
many cases, come up against the indifference 
of their sister kindergartners — indifference to 
the claims and the work of the primary teacher. 
There have been many happy instances of 
splendid codperation, but there have been many 
more cases of lack of coéperation or even of 
interest in the two teaching bodies. 
We bear witness to the fact that we have 
never known a body of teachers so filled with 
zeal and enthusiasm for their work, so ready to 
sacrifice self and time to its interests, so eager 
for growth of self, that they may better fulfill 
the duties that devolve upon them, than is 
found in the kindergarten teaching force. Kin- 
dergarten associations in so many of our cities 
attest to the professional spirit that animates 
this group of women. They spend their money 
freely for lecture courses, and they go willingly 
to their meetings to exchange ideas and discuss 
problems. To come in contact with a body of 
174
-P-A-G-E-181
KINDERGARTNER AND TEACHER 
women thus animated brings with it a sense of 
uplift and kindles the spirit. Splendid as all this 
is, it has, we fear, had a tendency to breed a 
species of isolation in the kindergarten teacher 
and to beget an absorption in one’s own special 
interest to the exclusion of the interests of the 
neighbor who is at her very door. It has bred 
indifference to the needs of the primary teacher 
and in some cases — we dislike to admit it — 
has begotten a supercilious sense of superiority, 
as though the kindergartner in case were made of 
finer clay than her sister teacher. Any fair- 
minded person must acknowledge that there are 
efficient, finely educated women in both kinder- 
garten and primary work, and that the reverse 
is also unhappily true — that the inefficient, the 
weak, the shallow woman is found in the ranks of 
both the kindergarten and the primary. It is 
certainly not wise nor becoming for us to arro- 
gate to ourselves superiority. Our deeds and our 
work will speak for themselves. 
The advantages of codperation 
The kindergartner has much to gain and no- 
thing to lose from fraternal codperation with 
her sister primary teacher. Many kindergartners 
spend from one to two years with little children, 
175
-P-A-G-E-182
THE KINDERGARTEN 
striving to overcome defects, to root out unfor- 
tunate habits, and to implant right ones in their 
stead; in short, to sow the seeds that will some 
day develop into desirable character. It is with 
a sinking at the heart that these kindergartners 
are at last obliged to send their little ones on 
to a teacher, with whom they have but a casual 
acquaintance, of whose ideals of child-training 
they know nothing, or possibly to a teacher who 
they know has no interest in the all-around de- 
velopment of a little child. That their time and 
effort may in the end count for nothing is appall- 
ing. Their hearts yearn toward these little chil- 
dren whose joys and sorrows have become so 
familiar a thing to them; whose aspirations, so 
small and pathetic, have often stirred their 
hearts; and to whom every bit of the way they 
have trod toward better conduct and a happy 
life is so well known. The primary teacher and 
her work are to them largely unknown quantities, 
the primary school an undiscovered country, 
although it lies at their door. 
On the other hand, the kindergartner who 
lives in fraternal relations with the primary 
teacher need have no anxiety, or at least much 
less concern, as to the outcome of the work she 
has so patiently and persistently striven to ac- 
176  
-P-A-G-E-183
  KINDERGARTNER AND TEACHER 
complish. Conferences between the two have 
brought about mutual understanding, mutual 
helpfulness. The kindergartner learns not only 
wherein the primary teacher finds the kinder- 
garten child superior to the child who has 
missed the kindergarten training, but she also 
learns what defects in the training are apparent 
to the primary teacher, and so is able to correct 
her practice along certain lines. She comes to 
know also something of the work and ideals of 
this sister teacher, and something of the prob- 
lems that confront her. She finds time, conse- 
quently, to visit the primary and acquaint her- 
self with the work there in progress; and through 
this she gains an enlargement of mind and 
spirit. 
The primary teacher, in turn, comes to a bet- 
ter knowledge of the ideals and purposes of kin- 
dergarten training. She learns something of the 
children who are soon to enter her room; of all 
that the kindergartner has tried to do for them; 
of all that she hopes for them, and of her fears 
for them. Thus she is better prepared to build 
upon the foundation laid by the kindergartner, 
and, as time goes on, they may counsel together. 
The kindergartner is given the freedom of the 
primary, and so the little children upon whom 
177 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
     
   THE KINDERGARTEN 
she has put so much effort, to whom her heart 
has gone out in deepest sympathy, are not lost 
to her. She may still watch their unfolding, 
developing life, in conjunction with her sister 
teacher. It is this that makes kindergartening 
worth while; that makes any teaching of little 
children worth while. 
We urge, therefore, the young kindergartner 
just starting out in her work, and the kinder- 
gartner who is already established, to aim to 
create a cordial relation between herself and the 
primary teacher. Make yourself familiar with 
the work of the grades, particularly of the first 
grade and of its needs. Let your ideals and 
principles of work be understood by the pri- 
mary teacher. Invite her to your mothers’ 
meetings; help her, if she desires it, to establish 
her own mothers’ meeting, and at the close of 
the year together combine in a grand parents’ 
meeting. 
On stormy days, when the number in the 
kindergarten is reduced, do, as so many kin- 
dergartners do to-day, invite the first-grade 
teacher with her children, either to the morning 
exercises or to participate in the games later in 
the morning. By so doing you not only enlist 
the interest and sympathy of the teacher in 
178
-P-A-G-E-185
  KINDERGARTNER AND TEACHER 
your work, but give joy to the children. It 
helps to strengthen the link that connects the 
two departments. In brief, be on the lookout 
for opportunities for developing a helpful and 
vital intercourse between the primary teacher 
and yourself. 
This may not always be an easy thing to do. 
You may be unfortunate enough to be thrown 
with the mechanical type of teacher, or the in- 
different, or the hostile. It is true that there are 
some primary teachers who cannot be won over 
to any interest in kindergartens or kindergarten 
ideals, but they are few. More often you will 
only have to go halfway: the primary teacher 
will be glad of your codperation. Make it your 
aim to gain the friendship of the teacher. Possess 
yourself with patience and arm yourself with 
tact and sympathy. Be sure that this latter 
springs from within, that it is not a veneer, 
which the penetrating can so easily discover and 
will so quickly resent. 
How mutually helpful and beneficial such a 
relationship may be only those who have ex- 
perienced it in its full measure can understand. 
Be assured that it enlarges your work, acts both 
as a stimulus and a corrective in your practice, 
and reacts upon the children in such a way as 
179

to work most surely for their development and 
well-being. With so many primary-trained kin-

far distant. May the kind fates speed that pro-

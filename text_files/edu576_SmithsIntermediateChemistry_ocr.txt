WHY STUDY CHEMISTRY? 
CHEMISTRY began as a secret science. The early chemists con- 
cealed their knowledge — and more often their ignorance — under 
a cloak of symbols and ciphers of the most mysterious and awe- 
inspiring sort. But now the Black Art has been opened to day- 
light. ‘The modern chemist is more anxious to tell people what 
he knows than people are to listen to him. He still uses symbols 
and has a fondness for long words, but these are designed to reveal, 
not to conceal. 
Still there lingers about chemistry something of the witchery 
of its antiquity. It has the air of being much harder to under- 
stand than it really is. The curious structural formule of organic 
compounds are no more difficult to work out than a Chinese puzzle 
and quite as much fun. 
Chemistry is especially fitted to give training in the scientific 
method, for it is experimental from the start. Properly taught. 
—or rather properly learned — it inculcates self-reliance and 
independence of thought. If the pupil will take the teacher’s 
word for the names of things and follow the advice of the book 
as to what experiments to try, he can find out and think out the 
most important part of the science for himself. He can work 
out a system of analysis by testing known substances in a sys- 
tematic way and then when he enters upon unknown mixtures 
he can attack them with the courage of self-confidence. The 
student of astronomy never gets a chance to handle a star, or 
even an asteroid. But the substances that the young chemist 
studies are always weighable, usually tangible, generally visible 
and frequently smellable. The student of geology never has the 
opportunity to make a mastodon and all he knows of a volcano or 
a geyser is the picture of it. But the Freshman chemist makes 
/3007

oxygen the first week and if he gets through the term without 
making a voleano or geyser he is lucky. 
This is not said to the disparagement of other studies. They 
all have their peculiar merits which their professors are at liberty 
to demonstrate. But chemistry has the advantage of most of 
them in that it points toward the future and instigates to action. 
The study of the history of man as written in books and of the 
history of the earth as recorded in rocks gives one a sad sense of 
irreparableness. What they deal with is dead and gone and all 
that is left is their lesson which may or may not be applicable to 
present problems. Meteorology is a _ discouraging science. 
“People are always complaining about the weather but nobody 
ever does anything about it.’”’ Astronomy reduces one to a state 
of impotent awe. It is interesting of course to find out the struc- 
ture of the solar system, but if you do not like it you cannot change 
it. You cannot put Saturn in the place of Venus so as to get a 
brighter evening star with two rings and eight satellites running 
around it. You cannot even alter the inclination of the axis of 
the earth so as to give the polar regions a chance to grow bananas. 
But when you find out the structure of a chemical molecule you 
can alter it to suit yourself. You can substitute a bromine for a 
chlorine atom and hook up a carbon chain into a ring. 
In this field man is master of his material and the only limita- 
tions to his power are his own ignorance and the innate intracta- 
bility of the elements. Berthelot calls chemistry the most crea- 
tive of the sciences, because it penetrates most profoundly into 
the nature of things and deals with the infinitesimal parts of 
which all substances are composed. The chemist begins by taking 
things apart (analysis); then he proceeds to put them together 
again (synthesis). Sometimes he puts them together in a differ- 
ent way and then he gets something quite different, perhaps some- 
thing that never existed on the earth before. Some 300,000 dis- 
tinct substances are described in chemical dictionaries and only 
a small fraction of these are to be found in nature.
-P-A-G-E-7
  WHY STUDY CHEMISTRY? v 
Chemistry is the science of power. All the energy of man and 
beast and all the energy of machinery, except that furnished by 
windmills and water wheels, is chemical energy and nearly all 
of this is derived from two simple and similar chemical reactions, 
the oxidation of hydrogen to form water and of carbon to form 
carbon dioxide. Food and fuel plus the oxygen of the air pro- 
vide the motive force of the modern world. The automobile 
and the elephant, the airplane and the eagle, the whale and the 
steamboat, man and his machines would alike be lifeless unless 
empowered by the oxidation of hydrogen-carbon compounds. 
Potential chemical energy is peculiarly effective in that it is so 
compact, portable and permanent. A few bags can contain 
enough of it to blow up a building or propel a projectile seventy- 
five miles. : 
Chemistry has control of life and death. An animal or plant 
deprived for a time of the proper chemical compounds will starve 
or if it imbibes a minute amount of the wrong chemical com- 
pounds it dies at once. The vital processes of the body are con- 
trolled by chemicals, some of which are already known, and a 
little more or less of them in the blood determines whether we 
shall be tall or short, bright or dull, handsome or ugly, cheerful 
or melancholy. 
Chemistry is the science of terror and pity. Warfare has been 
an intermittent branch of applied chemistry ever since the inven- 
tion of gunpowder, but it was not until 1914—18 that its terrible 
power of destruction and devastation was realized. But chem- 
istry may heal the wounds it causes, even with medicaments 
drawn from the same unpromising protean stuff, coal tar, that 
yields the high explosives and poison gas. Chemistry is the chief 
weapon of man in his lifelong fight against the bacteria and pro- 
tozoa that invade his body and ultimately destroy it. It is with 
chemicals that he combats the insects that eat his crops and infect 
him with disease. It is chemistry that brings relief to the sleep- 
sess and suffering and deprives surgery of its pain. Chemistry
-P-A-G-E-8
vl SMITH’S INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
may, it is true, demolish a building, but it is chemistry that erects 
it, even the steel-ribbed skyscrapers and mammoth monoliths 
of concrete. 
Chemistry is the democratic science. It bestows upon the 
poorest what once were the gifts of kings; jewels and bright- 
dyed garments, sugar and scents, vessels of porcelain and metal, 
foreign fruits and out-of-season foods, books and pictures. Chem- 
istry carries music into farmhouse and tenement on disks of resin 
and reveals to multitudes from the celluloid film scenes from a 
distance and past events; thus short-circuiting space and time. 
Chemistry has brought light into dark dwellings by means of 
windows and lamps. It supplies food to the hungry, for with 
nitrogen extracted from the air and phosphorus from the rocks 
it makes two blades of corn grow where one grew before. 
Chemistry is the joyous science. It contributes most to the 
pleasures of life. Every scent and every savor is due to chem- 
istry. The tints that delight the eye in flower or fruit, in gem 
or painting, the greens and browns of the forest leaves, the reds 
and yellows of the brick-built town, the black of print, the dyes of - 
cloth, the blush on the maiden’s cheek — whether it be natural or - 
artificial — all colors are chemical. We may not gratify our ears = 
with music more than once a week, but we satisfy our chemical © 
senses three times a day and chemical colors delight our eyes all 
the hours they are open. The students should realize that chem- 
istry is not exclusively concerned with the stuff in the bottles be- 
hind the prescription counter, but has just as much to say about 
the soda-water side to which they are quite naturally more at- 
tracted. They should understand that chemistry includes not 
merely the process of cooking but the process of digestion. This 
explains why we have introduced some unconventional topics and 
experiments in the following pages. 
Chemistry is a practical science. None touches everyday life 
at more points except its sister science, physics, between which 
and chemistry no clear boundary can be drawn. None has more

avenues for profitable employment. Some studies can be made 
a profession only by teaching them. But the qualified chemist 
has two strings to his bow. If he does not like teaching, he may 
leave the campus for the industrial field. He may find employ- 
ment in the big establishments devoted to the reduction of ores, 
to steel or other manufactures or to the production of foods, fer- 
tilizers, dyes, drugs, soaps, gas, rubber, oil, cements or explosives. 
Here he may be engaged in routine analysis of the raw material 
and finished products. Or he may be put in control of the fac- 
tory processes. Or he may be engaged in research to prevent 
waste, to utilize by-products, to invent new compounds or to 
contrive new uses. In any case he will be near to the heart of 
the industry and if he has inventive genius or managerial ability 
he may rise high. In some fields of chemistry women have almost 
as much of a chance as men. 
On account of its varied opportunities and its expanding field 
chemistry is drawing an increasing number of college graduates. 
Many more take the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in chemistry 
than in any other branch. The American Chemical Society 
with 15,500 members is the largest special scientific body in the 
world. When the Government took a census of chemists to see 
‘how many were available for war service, 25,000 names were 
registered, and this did not include them all. No other science 
is growing so fast through original research. In the files of the 
National Research Council more than 2100 living Americans are 
recorded as having made contributions to chemistry. Compared 
with this, the research men in botany number 1400, in zodlogy 
1255, in geology 750, and in mathematics 600, in psychology 450 
and in astronomy 250. 
But it is not sufficient that the ranks of research chemists and 
technologists be kept filled. Chemistry has an interest and a 
usefulness for everyone. What would be the value of an art 
gallery if nobody entered it but artists? And what would become 
of the book business if nobody read but authors? Chemistry

is of value to those who never intend to become professional chem- 
ists because it gives one an understanding of household arts and 
modern manufactures, of the principles of agriculture and bodily 
processes, but more because it opens the eyes of the mind to the 
molecular meaning of the marvelous metamorphoses of the visible 
world.

Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) was a nonconformist minister of 
Birmingham, England, but devoted his leisure and his means to 
chemical research, the results of which were published in his six 
volumes on “Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of 
Air.”’ He was the first to prepare pure oxygen, which he called 
“‘dephlogisticated air.” He also made nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, | 
ammonia, hydrochloric acid, sulphur dioxide, and silicon fluoride. 
He found that water could be made to absorb carbon dioxide 
under pressure, thus laying the foundation of the “soda-water”’ | 
industry. On account of his sympathy with the French Revolu- 
tion and his heterodox theological views a mob burned his home « em 
and laboratory, July 14, 1791. Priestley narrowly escaped with 
his life and went to America, where he settled at Northumberland, 
Pennsylvania. Here a group of chemists gathered on August 1, 
1874, to celebrate the centenary of the discovery of oxygen, and 
founded the American Chemical Society, now the largest scientific 
association in the world.

Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794) is called ‘‘the father of | 
modern chemistry’? because he placed the science on the solid 
basis of quantitative experiments and devised the system of naming 
compounds by their composition. He proved that the air con- 
tained two gases; one which was inert and another which supported 
combustion and united with metals. He called the former gas 
“azote”? because it would not support life and the latter “oxygen” 
because it formed acids. He was guillotined during the Reign of 
Terror. The Commission on Weights and Measures petitioned 
that he might be allowed to complete his work on the metric system, 
but Coffinhal, vice-president of the revolutionary tribunal, refused, 
saying: ‘The republic has no need for savants.”’ a

Arrhenius put forward his theory of ionization while still a student 
at Upsala. His own description of its reception is worth repeating: 
‘“‘T came to my professor, Cleve, whom I admire very much, and I 
said: ‘I have a new theory of electrical conductivity as a cause of 
chemical reactions.’ He said: ‘That is very interesting,’ and 
then said ‘Good-bye.’ He explained to me later, when he had to 
pronounce the reason for my receiving the Nobel Prize for that work, 
that he knew very well that there are so many different theories 
formed, and that they are almost all certain to be wrong, for after 
a short time they disappear; and therefore, by using the statistical 
manner of forming his ideas, he concluded that my theory also would 
not exist very long.”’ 
It scarcely needs to be added here that the theory is still very much 
alive!

Sir William Ramsay (1852-1916) will always be famous for his 
work on the inert. gases of the atmosphere and for his discoveries in 
the field of radioactivity. He first became interested in chemistry 
in a rather unusual way. While a boy at school, he broke his leg 
in a football game, and was kept on a couch for several weeks. To 
kill time, he read Graham’s Chemistry, hoping to find out how to 
make fireworks. For the next few years his bedroom was full 
of bottles and test-tubes, and often full of strange smells and star- 
tling noises.

The recovery of valuable hydrocarbons of the aromatic series 
(benzene, toluene, naphthalene, etc.) from coal gas is a feature of 
every modern coke and gas plant. The bulk of the peace-time 
demand for ‘“‘benzols’’ — as the light oils extracted by washing 
the gas are called in industry — is for employment as motor fuels. 
From one ton of coal approximately 3 gallons of “ benzol’”’ is 
recovered, giving from 20 to 30 per cent more power and mileage 
than high-grade gasoline, and causing less carbon trouble.

Marie Sklodovska, a Polish refugee stranded in Paris, was first 
engaged in the physical science department of the Sorbonne to 
wash bottles and prepare the furnace. Professor Lippmann, the 
pioneer in color photography, promoted her to setting up apparatus, 
and put her to do work with Pierre Curie, one of his assistants. In 
1895 she became Madame Curie. 
In 1903 the results of Madame Curie’s work on radium were pre- 
sented to the faculty as a thesis for the doctor’s degree. The thesis, 
unlike that of Arrhenius, was favorably received, and shortly after- 
wards the Nobel Prize in Physics was divided between the Curies 
and Becquerel, whose previous work on uranium had suggested the 
research. 
In 1911 Madame Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

moisture may condense. Hence, when a particle of a radium

SMITH’S 
INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
CHAPTER I 
SUBSTANCES AND PROPERTIES 
WHEN exact information in regard to any sort of material is 
required, we hand the material to a chemist. To learn something 
about the nature of chemistry, let us watch the chemist at work 
on a typical problem. 
Properties.— Suppose that the material is a piece of cloth, 
and we desire to know whether it is all wool, or partly cotton. 
The chemist places a piece of the cloth in a test-tube (Fig. 1), 
and pours in an amount of lye sufficient to cover 
it. Lye is a solution in water of a white solid, 
named by chemists, commonly, “ caustic soda ”’ 
and, more formally, sodium hydroxide. The con- 
tents of the test-tube are then heated over a flame 
and are kept at the boiling point for ten minutes. 
If the cloth dissolves entirely, leaving a liquid, 
clear like water, then it was composed of nothing 
but wool. The chemist draws this conclusion 
because wool, although not affected by the boiling arr 
water, has the property of turning into a soluble 
substance when caustic soda is heated withit. If, on the other 
hand, the piece of cloth becomes thinner, obviously losing a part 
of its material, but leaving a part undissolved, then it contained 
cotton. This conclusion depends on the fact that cotton has 
the property of not being dissolved by caustic soda solution. 
1
-P-A-G-E-20
    2 SMITH’S INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
The same conclusion could have been reached in other ways. 
For example, some threads could have been taken from the 
edges of the sample and placed under a microscope. In this 
case, they would have been seen to be made up of long, hollow 
fibers or tubes (Fig. 2). But the cotton fibers (A) are smooth on 
the surface, while the woolen fibers (B) are covered with scales. 
By this difference in properties, the presence of both kinds, or of 
B 
  only one of the kinds, could quickly be found out. Still again, the 
chemist knows that wool will “ take” almost any dye, while 
cotton remains uncolored by 
A the greater number of dyes. 
| | He could, therefore, boil a piece 
@) of the cloth with a solution of a 
Lf soluble dye — such as red ink 
(eosin)— for a few minutes, and 
| then wash the sample _ thor- 
oughly in clean water. On 
Fic. 2 examining the cloth with’ a 
microscope he could then ob- 
serve whether any fibers were still white. Here wool has the 
property of uniting with the dye, while cotton has not. The last 
plan could be used only with white goods, or goods not already 
strongly dyed. 
The first method is the one which the chemist would probably 
employ in practice, because by its means he can ascertain and 
report, not only the presence of cotton, but the proportion of 
cotton present. To do this, he weighs the dry piece of cloth 
before placing it in the test-tube. Then, after the boiling with 
caustic soda solution, he washes what is left of the sample very 
thoroughly in running water, dries it, and weighs it again. The 
weight of this “‘ residue ” is that of the cotto.. The difference 
between this and the original weight is the weight of the wool. 
The chemist is then able to state the percentages by weight of 
cotton and of wool in the original material.
-P-A-G-E-21
SUBSTANCES AND PROPERTIES 3 
Substances.— Upon considering these operations, we can 
discover a general plan which the chemist has devised and employs 
in his work. Different samples of cloth are of different colors 
and appearance, even when they contain the same proportions of 
cotton and wool. A casual inspection is, therefore, of little 
value. But in certain respects all samples of wool are alike, 
such as in dissolving in caustic soda, in “ taking ”’ certain dyes 
and in possessing a scaly surface. Those respects in which all 
samples of wool are alike are called the specific properties of wool. 
Similarly all samples of cotton are alike in certain respects, which 
are called the specific properties of cotton. And these properties 
of cotton and of wool are different, many of them very different 
indeed. For the purpose of stating what he means, the chemist 
calls a kind of material, all specimens of which possess a certain 
set of specific properties, a substance. Wool is one substance,* 
and cotton another substance. Every part of a specimen of a 
substance has the same specific properties as any other part. If 
any portions can be found which have different specific properties, ° 
these are portions of another substance, accidentally or inten- 
tionally mixed with the first. The chemist calls the foreign mat- 
ter an impurity, and the specimen an impure sample of the sub- 
3tance of which it is mainly composed. 
A substance, then, is a species or kind of matter, and all speci- 
mens of it show the same set of specific properties. Any par- 
ticular substance is recognized by the specific properties which 
it exhibits when exposed to various tests. Specific properties, 
conversely, are those qualities which are characteristic of any 
particular substance. 
The plan which the chemist uses in his experimental tests, 
therefore, is that of ascertaining whether a given material exhibits 
* In point of fact, wool contains several substances, but they are all alike 
in respect to the three properties mentioned above. ‘They differ slightly in 
respect to other properties, and so can be distinguished from one an- 
other.  
-P-A-G-E-22
  4. SMITH’S INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
the properties of one, or of more than one substance. He then 
describes it by naming the substances he finds in it. 
Another Illustration.— This view-point is peculiar to the 
chemist. Each art or science has its own view-point — its own 
way of thinking about a given object. By the geologist, a piece 
of granite is at once thought of as belonging to the older rocks of 
the earth, and the geologist considers when it was formed and how 
it was formed (namely, by solidification of a molten mass). 
To the builder, it is a very hard stone, expensive to cut and pol- 
ish, but very ornamental, and very durable. How and when 
it was formed does not make any difference to the builder. 
To the chemist, as a chemist, on the other hand, the expense 
of cutting granite, and its ornamental character, are of no interest. 
Instead, the chemist notices at once that it is spotted, and, upon 
examining it closely, he observes that it appears to be a mizture. 
He breaks up a portion, and studies the properties of the fragments. 
‘ Some are transparent like glass, are very hard, and in fact are in 
all respects like quartz or rock crystal (Fig. 3). All specimens 
of rock crystal, from whatever source, are alike in properties, 
and quartz is, therefore, a distinct 
substance or species of matter. Again, 
certain of the particles in granite are 
oP dark, and with a penknife can be 
easily split into transparent leaves, 
eo ae. thinner than paper. These fragments 
are in all respects like mica (sheets of 
which, under the name of “ isinglass,’’ are used to close the win- 
dows of stoves), which is another substance (Fig. 4) well-known to 
the chemist. Still others of the fragments are less transparent 
than the quartz and less hard. They can be split, but with 
much greater difficulty than the mica. They are crystals,* 
* Crystals are natural forms of a geometrical nature, assumed by solid sub- 
stances (p. 94).
-P-A-G-E-23

oblong in shape. ‘These are pieces of a third substance, felspar 
(Fig. 5). All the particles in the granite belong to one or other 
of these three kinds. The chemist, then, studies the specific 
properties, such as the hardnesses and the crystalline forms of 
various parts of the specimen and seeks to state or describe the 
nature of the specimen in terms of the substances he finds 
in it. 
A Third Illustration.— When flour is examined by the chem- 
ist, it appears to the eye to be all alike. Under the microscope, 
even, all he can learn is that it consists largely of grains, which 
have the characteristic appearance of grains of starch (see Fig. 
99, p. 399). He places some flour on a square piece of cheese- | 
cloth and encloses it by tying with a thread (Fig. 6). On knead- 
ing the little bag in a vessel of water, the water becomes milky. 
When the milky water stands, 
the white material settles to the 
bottom, the water can be poured 
off, and the deposit can be dried. 
This white substance, when boiled 
with water, gives an almost clear 
liquid which jellies on cooling. 
This is another property of starch. 
A little tincture of iodine (solu- 
tion of iodine in alcohol), dropped on a part of the starch, 
causes the latter to turn blue. This is a very characteristic 
property of (and therefore test for) starch. When the bag of 
flour is kneaded persistently in water which is frequently changed, 
the material finally ceases to render the water milky. The starch 
has all been washed out. When the bag is now opened, a sticky 
material is found in it. This is called gluten. 
The chemist therefore finds that flour contains starch and 
gluten. He learns this by separating these two different sub- 
stances.

  6 SMITH’S INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
The Law of Component Substances.— Every material 
consists of certain substances, each of which has a definite set 
of specific properties. In terms of these properties the material 
can be described. This is the first and simplest law of chemistry, 
and at the same time the most fundamental. 
Mixtures and Impurities.— A material containing more 
than one substance is called a mixture. The characteristic of a 
mixture is that each of the substances present, although mixed 
with the others, possesses exactly the same properties as if it were 
present alone. No one of the ingredients affects any other 
ingredient, or alters any of its properties. Granite and flour 
are typical mixtures. 
When a specimen is composed mainly of one substance, and 
contains only minute amounts of one or more other substances, 
it is frequently spoken of as a specimen of the main substance 
containing certain specified substances as impurities. To be 
called an impurity, the foreign matter need not be dirty or offen- 
sive. Thus, common salt usually contains a little magnesium 
chloride, a white crystalline solid, as an impurity, and it is this 
impurity which becomes damp in wet weather. Again, com- 
pounds of lime and magnesium are common impurities in drink- 
ing water. 
Component.— The ingredients of a mixture are called the 
components (Latin, put with), because they are simply placed 
together, without change, and can be separated without change. 
Other Specific Properties.— Beside the specific properties 
which happen to have occurred in these illustrations, there are 
others which are constantly found useful by the chemist. Thus, 
in the case of solids, besides the hardness and crystalline form, he 
gives special attention to the temperature at which the substance 
melts (the melting-point), the specific gravity or density (weight
-P-A-G-E-25
  
SUBSTANCES AND PROPERTIES 7 
of 1 ¢.c., see Appendix I), the color and the solubility or non-solu- 
bility in water. In the case of liquids, the temperature at which 
the liquid boils under atmospheric pressure (the boiling-point), 
the specific gravity, the mobility, the odor and the color (if any) 
are never exactly the same for any two different liquids. We shall 
learn more about these properties as occasions for using them 
arise. 
Attributes and Conditions.— It should be noted that 
mass is not a specific property. Different specimens of a given 
substance may have different masses, but they all have the same 
specific properties. The mass of each, although fixed, is a quality 
of that particular specimen only. So is it with the volume and 
the dimensions of aspecimen. These are attributes of a specimen. 
Again the temperature is not a specific property. There is no 
particular temperature peculiar to quartz. Even the very same 
specimen may be at different temperatures at different times. 
Temperature and pressure are variable and are called conditions. 
The temperature or the pressure of a specimen may be changed 
at will. But the specific properties of a substance under any 
given conditions cannot be changed, so long as we have to do 
with the same substance. 
Law of Chemical Change.— When the wool was boiled 
with caustic soda solution, it was in some way acted upon by 
the caustic soda. It became soluble, and disappeared into the 
liquid. Wool will not dissolve in boiling water. But in the 
former operation its material acquired at least one new property, 
namely that of being soluble. Since we have defined a substance 
as a species of matter, with a definite set of specific properties, 
we are compelled to decide that when a piece of material changes 
its properties, it has, in doing so, become a new substance. This 
experiment, then, calls our attention to the second of the funda- 
mental laws of chemistry, namely that material forming one or 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
8 SMITH’S INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
more substances, without ceasing to exist, may be changed 
into one or more new and entirely different substances. When 
such an alteration occurs, it is called a chemical change or reac- 
tion. To learn more about this most remarkable fact, we shall 
take up in the next chapter some examples of a simple and long 
familiar nature. 
Definition of Law.— In science, a law, or generalization or 
rule, is a statement describing some general fact or constant 
mode of behavior. Its uses are to condense a great many similar 
facts into one statement, and thus to make the whole set of facts 
more easy to remember. 
Constituents.— As we have seen, we speak of the substances 
in a mixture as the components. When we wish to refer to the 
forms of matter which are chemically united in a compound, we 
call them the constituents (Lat., standing together) of the com- 
pound substance. Thus, iron and oxygen are the constituents of 
rust. 
The chemist separates (p. 13) the components of a mixture, 
for that is all that is necessary. He liberates the constituents of a 
compound, however, because they are bound together in chemical 
combination. 
The names given to compounds are usually devised so as to 
indicate the nature of the constituents. Thus, iron-rust is oxide 
of iron (or ferric oxide, from Lat., ferrum, iron). The yellowish 
powder obtained when lead is heated in air is lead oxide or oxide 
of lead, and the white powder similarly derived from tin is oxide 
of tin. 
A Condensed Form of Statement.— We may represent a 
chemical combination, or indeed any kind of chemical change, in a 
condensed form, thus: 
Iron + Oxygen — Oxide of iron (ferric oxide)
-P-A-G-E-27
  
SUBSTANCES AND PROPERTIES 9 
Each name stands for a substance. Two substances in contact 
with one another (mixed), but not united chemically, are con- 
nected by the + sign. The arrow shows where the chemical 
change comes in, and the direction of the change. We read the 
statement thus: Iron and oxygen brought together under suit- 
able conditions undergo chemical change into oxide of iron, called 
also ferric oxide. Similarly we may write: 
Lead + Oxygen — Oxide of lead. 
Tin + Oxygen — Oxide of tin. 
Explanation of Rusting.— Experiment shows that the 
process of rusting is accompanied by a slow increase in the 
weight of the solid, due to the gradual addition of oxygen to the 
metal. Now, this increase in weight ceases of its own accord, 
when a certain maximum has been reached. This occurs when 
the last particles exhibiting the properties of the metal have dis- 
appeared. Thus, lead gains in weight until every 100 parts of the 
metal have gained 7.72 parts of oxygen, and tin until every 100 
parts have gained 26.9 parts of oxygen. When these increases 
have occurred, the metal is found to have been all used up, and 
prolonged heating and stirring cause no further union with oxy- 
gen and no further change in weight. This fact, that each sub- 
stance limits itself of its own accord to combining with a fixed 
proportion of the other substance, in forming a given compound, 
is one of the most striking facts about chemical combination. In 
mixtures, any proportions chosen by the experimenter may be 
used. In chemical union, the experimenter has no choice; the 
proportions are determined by the substances themselves. Thus, 
100 parts of iron when turning into ordinary red rust take up 43 
parts of oxygen, no more and no less. 
This fact enables us to make our condensed statements more 
specific and complete by including in them the proportions by 
weight used in the chemical change:
-P-A-G-E-28
  10 SMITH’S INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
Tron (100) ++ Oxygen (48) — Ferric oxide (143). 
Lead (100) + Oxygen (7.72) — Oxide of lead (107.72). 
The following numbers, which represent the same proportions 
by weight, are the ones commonly used by chemists: 
Tron (111.68) + Oxygen (48) — Ferric oxide (159.68). 
Summary.— Thus far, we have learned that chemistry deals 
with substances and their specific properties, and with the changes 
which substances undergo. We have discussed and defined a 
number of important words expressing fundamental chemical 
ideas. Finally, we have touched upon the weights of the ma- 
terials used in chemical change, a subject of great importance 
which will be more fully developed in a later chapter. 
Exercises.— 1. Describe the following, by mentioning some of 
their specific properties: (a) water, (b) wool, (c) cotton (pp. 1-3). 
2. If any of the following are mixtures, mention the facts which 
show them to contain more than one substance (p. 3): (a) muddy 
water, (b) an egg, (c) milk. 
3. State and illustrate the first two laws of chemistry (pp. 6, 7). 
4. Make definitions of “‘ pure’ and “ impure ”’ as applied to a

5. Give a list of the specific properties mentioned in this chap- 
ter.

  CHAPTER II 
CHEMICAL CHANGE AND THE METHODS OF STUDYING IT 
We must now take up two new examples of chemical change. 
They will aid us in introducing one or two additional conceptions 
andlaws. Theseare continually used by the chemist, and without 
them we cannot begin the systematic study of the science. 
Another Case of Combination: Iron and Sulphur.— 
Since oxygen is an invisible gas, there is a slight difficulty in real- 
izing that rusting consists in the union of two substances — this 
gas and a metal. The present example is less interesting historic- 
ally, but it is simpler because both substances are visible and are 
easily handled. The case of iron and sulphur will enable us to 
illustrate the same point of view and to 
practice the application of the same tech- 
nical words. It will also introduce us to 
two manipulations — filtration and evap- 
oration — which are frequently used by 
the chemist. 
We begin by observing and contrasting 
Fia. 7 the specific properties of the two sub- 
stances. Sulphur is a pale-yellow sub- 
stance of low specific gravity (sp. gr. 2). Itis easily melted (m.-p. 
114.5° C.). It does not dissolve in water — that is, it does not 
- mix completely with and disappear in water, as sugar does on 
stirring. It does dissolve readily in certain other liquids, such as 
carbon disulphide, however. It crystallizes in rhombic forms 
(Fig. 7). It is not attracted by a magnet. Iron is a lustrous 
greyish substance of much higher specific gravity (sp. gr. 7.8). 
12
-P-A-G-E-31
CHEMICAL CHANGE AND THE METHODS OF STUDYING IT 13 
It is very difficult to melt it (m.-p. over 1500° C.). It does 
not dissolve in any common liquids at ordinary temperatures. 
It crystal izes in cubes, and is attracted strongly by a magnet. 
Study of the Mixture, before Combination.— Now, if 
some iron filings and pulverized sulphur are stirred together in a 
mortar, the result is a mixture. True, the color is not that of 
either substance, but with a lens particles of both substances can 
be seen. Passing a magnet over the mixture will 
easily remove a part of the iron, and with the 
help of a lens and a needle the mixture could be 
picked apart particle by particle, completely. 
We can separate the components of the mixture 
more expeditiously, however, by using manipula- 
tions based upon other more suitable properties. 
Thus, sulphur dissolves in carbon disulphide while 
iron does not. If, therefore, a part of the mix- 
ture is placed in a dry test-tube along with some 
carbon disulphide (Fig. 8), and is shaken, the liquid dissolves 
the sulphur and leaves the iron. To complete the separation, the 
iron must be removed from the liquid by 
filtration, and the sulphur recovered by 
evaporation of the carbon disulphide. 
  Filtration.— Iron, or any solid, when 
it is mixed with a liquid or with a solu- 
tion (like the solution of sulphur in car- 
bon disulphide) is said to be suspended 
in the liquid. If the solid is one that 
settles rapidly, the liquid may be sep- 
' arated from the solid, in a rough way, by 
pouring off as much of the clear, super- 
natant liquid as possible. This is called decantation. 
-A complete separation is effected by pouring the mixture on toa  
-P-A-G-E-32
  14 SMITH’S INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
cone of filter paper supported in a glass funnel (Fig. 9). The liquid, 
together with anything that may be dissolved in it, runs through 
the pores of the paper and down the hollow stem of the funnel. 
The liquid is then called the filtrate. The particles of the sus- 
pended solid are too large to pass through the pores, and so col- 
lect. on the surface of the filter paper. This operation, like every- 
thing the chemist does, takes advantage of differences in the 
specific properties of the various materials. 
The material remaining on the paper (the residue), when dry, 
is wholly attracted by a magnet and shows all the other properties 
of iron. 
Evaporation.— To recover the sulphur, the solution in carbon 
disulphide — the filtrate — is poured into a porcelain evaporat- 
ing dish. (Carbon disulphide is very in- 
flammable! Keep flames away). When 
the vessel is set aside, the liquid grad- 
ually passes off in vapor (e-vapor-ates). 
Sulphur, however, does not evaporate 
at room temperature and remains as a 
residue, in the form of crystals of rhombic outline in the bottom 
of the dish (Fig. 10). Here, again, differences in specific properties 
have been utilized. 
Since the physical properties of two substances are not changed 
by mixing, we have thus used the properties of the iron and sul- 
phur so as to separate them once more. The iron is on the paper; 
the sulphur is in the dish. 
  Combination of Iron and Sulphur.~ But iron and sulphur 
are capable of combining to form a new substance, if we alter 
the conditions by raising the temperature. When we place some 
of the original mixture of iron and sulphur into a clean test-tube 
and warm it, we soon notice a rather violent development of heat 
taking place, the contents begin to glow, and what appears to
-P-A-G-E-33
CHEMICAL CHANGE AND THE METHODS OF STUDYING IT 15 
be a form of combustion spreads through the mass. The heating 
employed at the start falls far short of accounting for the much 
greater heat produced. When these phenomena have ceased, and 
the test-tube has been allowed to cool, we find that it now con- 
tains a somewhat porous-looking, black solid. ‘This material is 
brittle; it is not magnetic; it does not dissolve in carbon disul- 
phide; and close examination, even under a microscope, does not 
reveal the presence of different kinds of matter. This substance 
is known to chemists as ferrous sulphide and, as we see, its prop- 
erties are entirely different from those of its constituents. 
In this connection we must not omit to notice that, as in rust- 
ing, a certain fixed proportion will be used in forming the com- 
pound. 
Iron (55.84) + Sulphur (32.06) — Ferrous sulphide (87.90). 
If more iron is put into the original mixture, then some 
unused iron will be found in the mass after the action. If too 
much sulphur is employed, some may be driven off as vapor 
by the heat and any that remains, beyond the correct propor- 
tion, can be dissolved out of the ferrous sulphide with car- 
bon disulphide. The sulphur which has combined with the iron, 
however, is no longer present as sulphur — it has no longer the 
properties of sulphur, and therefore cannot be dissolved out. 
Another Illustration: Mercuric Oxide.— It has long been 
known that air contains an active and an inactive gas. The 
Chinese called them yin and yang, respectively. Mayow (1643-— 
1679) showed that the active gas caused rusting, that it was ab- 
sorbed by paint (really by the linseed oil) in “‘ drying,” that it 
supported combustion of wood and sulphur, and that it is 
necessary to life, being absorbed by the blood from the air en- 
tering the lungs. It was not until 1774, however, that a pure 
specimen of this gas was obtained, by Bayen, and was recog- 
nized to be a special kind of gas different from ordinary air.
-P-A-G-E-34
16 SMITH’S INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
The gas (later to be named oxygen) was made by Bayen from 
mercuric oxide, “a bright red, rather heavy powder. When 
the oxide is heated, (Fig. 11), we find that 
a gas is given off. This gas is easily shown 
‘to be different from air, since a glowing splin- 
ter of wood is instantly relighted on being im- 
mersed in it. The gas is pureoxygen. During 
the heating, we notice also that a metallic 
coating appears on the sides of the tube, in the 
form of a sort of mirror. Apparently the vapor 
of some metal is coming off with the oxygen and 
condensing on the cool parts of the tube. As this shining 
substance accumulates it takes the form of globules, which may be 
scraped together. It is, in fact, the metal mercury, or quicksilver. 
If the heating continues long enough, thé whole of the red powder 
eventually disappears, and is converted into these two products. 
  Fria. 11 
Second Variety of Chemical Change: Decomposition.— 
Bayen’s experiment introduces to us a second, and very common 
kind of chemical action. The first variety was combination or 
union (p. 14). The second is called decomposition. It consists 
in starting with a single substance (here mercuric oxide) and 
splitting it into two (or more) substances, which differ in proper- 
ties from the substance taken and from one another. Here, the 
red powder gave mercury, a liquid metal, and oxygen, a colorless 
gas. 
Simple and Compound Substances.— We have seen that 
two (or more) substances, like lead and oxygen, can combine to 
form a compound substance. Are all substances, then, com- 
pounds? We find that some are not. We have never succeeded 
in obtaining lead, or oxygen, or iron, or tin, or sulphur by com- 
bining any two substances. We can decompose mercuric oxide 
by heat, and we have other ways of decomposing compounds like 
oxide of tin and ferrous sulphide, but we have never succeeded in
-P-A-G-E-35
CHEMICAL CHANGE AND THE METHODS OF STUDYING IT 17 
decomposing the mercury or the oxygen, the iron or the sulphur 
themselves. Substances which we are not able, by chemical 
means, to decompose into, or to make by chemical union from, 
other substances are called simple or elementary substances. 
The distinction between simple and compound substances was 
first drawn by Boyle in 1678. Later, and independently, it was 
stated very clearly by Lavoisier (1789). 
Several substances, regarded in Lavoisier’s time as elementary, 
have since been shown to be compounds. Thus, quicklime was a 
simple substance until Davy, in 1808, prepared the metal calcium 
and showed that quicklime was the oxide of this metal. Hence, 
we do not say that the substances regarded as simple cannot be 
decomposed, but only that they are substances which we “ are not 
able ” (at present) to decompose. 
The phrase ‘‘ by chemical means”’ is also important. Although 
by chemical methods we are ‘not able to effect any decomposition 
of the elements, yet we cannot regard them as absolutely unalter- 
able and permanent. The element radium cannot be decomposed 
by chemical means, but it undergoes continuous and spontaneous 
** disintegration ”’ into the elements helium and lead (see p. 546). 
It has recently been discovered by Rutherford that other elements, 
such as nitrogen and aluminum, may also be disrupted to give 
hydrogen, under the action of the tremendous forces of the 
swiftly-moving particles ejected from radium in the course of 
this disintegration. Such phenomena, however, do not affect 
our conception of elements as applied to ordinary chemical reac- 
tions. 
Elements.— The word element is used in two senses. It is 
applied to the simple substance. Thus we speak of “ the element 
iron,’ meaning the metal iron. It is applied also to the iron- 
matter contained in ferrous sulphide or in ferric oxide. The 
reader should note that it is correct usage to speak of the element 
iron and the element sulphur in ferrous sulphide, but a chemist
-P-A-G-E-36
18 SMITH’S INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
would never say that this compound contained the simple sub- 
stances iron and sulphur. If he did, we should understand him to 
mean that it was a mixture, and we should expect parts of the 
material to be magnetic like iron, and other parts to be yellow and 
soluble in carbon disulphide, which is not the case. In the same 
way the name of an element (such as iron) is applied both to 
the material in combination and to the free substance. Thus 
‘iron ”’ may mean free, uncombined, metallic iron, or iron-matter 
in some compound. The sense in which the word is employed 
must be inferred from the context or circumstances. When a 
chemist speaks, as he sometimes does, colloquially, of “iron ”’ in a 
drinking water, for example, we know at once that he refers to 
iron in the form of some compound, for metallic iron does not 
dissolve in water. 
The word element, then, means one of the simple forms of 
matter, either free or in combination. 
In formally describing a body or specimen, the chemist always 
avoids the ambiguity just referred to by naming the components, 
2.e., the substance or substances it contains. He assumes that 
the nature and constituents of these substances will be known to 
anyone hearing or reading the description. If he says the body 
contains zinc and sulphur, it is understood that the body is a 
mixture of these simple substances. If it contained these ele- — 
ments in combination, the chemist would report that it was sul- 
phide of zine. 
The Common Elements.— Thousands of different com- 
pound substances are known but, when they are decomposed, it is 
found that the number of different elements contained in them is 
not great. Dozens of substances contain iron, hundreds contain 
sulphur, thousands contain oxygen. In fact, by combining a 
limited number, two, three, or four, of simple substances together, 
in varying proportions by weight, an almost unlimited number of 
different compound substances could be produced.
-P-A-G-E-37
  
CHEMICAL CHANGE AND THE METHODS OF STUDYING IT 19 
A list of the elements appears on the inside of the cover, at the 
end of this book, and contains about eighty names. Of these, a large 
number are rare, and seldom encountered. More than 99 per cent 
of terrestrial material is made up of eighteen or twenty elements and 
their compounds. Only about twenty elements occur in nature 
in their simple, uncombined condition. Three-fourths of the 
whole number are found in combination exclusively, and must 
be liberated by some chemical action. 
Taking the atmosphere, all terrestrial waters, and the earth’s 
crust, so far as it has been examined, F. W. Clarke has estimated 
the plentifulness of the various elements. The first twelve, with 
the quantity of each contained in one hundred parts of terrestrial 
matter, and constituting together 99 per cent, are as follows: 
J eae 49.85 Calcium........ 3.18 Hydrogen..... 0.97 
PCO ss See 4G 20; 08° Bedtim <2. 2.33 Titanium...... 0.41 |

MODs 33's 3 erin’ 4.12 Magnesium...... 2. Sb.j: CEROOD o5 555'3\65 0.19 
The significance of these figures is more clearly shown in Fig. 
12. It will be seen that oxygen accounts for nearly one-half of the 
whole mass. Silicon, the oxide of which when pure is quartz 
and in less pure form constitutes ordinary sand, makes up half of 
the remainder. Valuable and useful elements, like gold, silver, 
sulphur, and mercury, are among the less plentiful which, all 
taken together, furnish the remaining one per cent. 
Law of Definite Proportions.— In the decomposition of 
mercuric oxide (p. 16)* we find that, for every 100 parts of

mercury liberated, almost exactly 8 parts of oxygen by weight 
are set free. Using the numbers commonly employed in chemis- 
try, which represent the same proportion by weight: 
Mercuric oxide (216.6) — Mercury (200.6) + 
Oxygen (16). 
We find also that mercury and oxygen can be 
made to combine to form mercuric oxide, and 
the proportions by weight required are the same. 
Moreover, every sample of mercuric oxide, whether 
made by combination, or in any of the other pos- 
sible ways, always contains this proportion of the 
two elements. We have already seen that the 
oxides of lead and tin contain fixed proportions 
(p. 9) of the metal and oxygen and that ferrous 
sulphide has a constant composition by weight. 
The same principle is found te apply to all 
chemical compounds, and is stated in the law of 
definite or constant proportions: In every sample

posed, the proportion by weight of the constituent

of this point must be deferred to a later chapter (pp. 550-552).

  Conservation of Mass.— The most painstaking chemical 
work seems to show that, if all the substances concerned in a 
chemical change are weighed before and after the change, there is 
no evidence of any alteration in the quantity of matter. The two 
weights, representing the sums of the constituents and of the 
products, respectively, are, indeed, never absolutely identical, but
-P-A-G-E-39

the more careful the work and the more delicate the instrument 
used in weighing, the more nearly do the values approach identity. 
We are able to state, therefore, that the mass of a system is not 
affected by any chemical change within the system.

  This statement simply means that the great law of the conserva- 
tion of mass holds true in chemistry as it does in physics. Chemi- 
cal changes, thoroughgoing as they are in respect to all other 
qualities, do not affect the mass; an element carries with it its 
weight, entirely unchanged, through the most complicated chemi- 
cal transformations. 
Superficial observation, as of a growing tree, might seem to give 
evidence of the very opposite of conservation of matter. But 
here the carbon dioxide gas in the air, the most important source 
of nourishment for plants, is overlooked. Similarly, the gradual 
disappearance of a candle by combustion seems to illustrate the 
destruction of matter. But if we catch the gases which rise 
through the flame (Fig. 13), we find that the gases weigh even 
more than the part of the candle which has been sacrificed in 
making them. When we take account of the weight of the oxy- 
gen obtained from the air which sustains the combustion, we find 
that there is really neither loss nor gain in weight. If we carry
-P-A-G-E-40
22 SMITH’S INTERMEDIATE CHEMISTRY 
out chemical changes in closed vessels (Fig. 14), which permit 
neither escape nor access of material, we find that the weight does 
not alter. 
Physics in Chemistry.— It will be seen that one cannot 
accomplish anything in chemistry without acquiring and using 
some knowledge of physics. We measure quantities by means of 
the physical attributes, weight and volume. We produce chemi- 
cal change by arranging the physical conditions, for example, by 
mixing, heating, or using an electric current. Physical means are 
the only means we possess for producing, stopping, or modifying 
chemical changes. Again, we ascertain whether a chemical 
change has taken place or not by observing the physical properties 
of the materials before and after the experiment. Thus, we noted 
that the red, powdery oxide of mercury, when heated, gave a 
liquid metal and a gas. All the phenomena of chemistry are 
physical. A phenomenon is literally something that is seen or, 
more generally, something that affects any of the senses. Ob- 
serving physical phenomena is, therefore, our sole means of study- 
ing chemical changes. Chemical work is, in fact, entirely de- 
pendent upon the skilful use of physical agencies, and upon the 
close observation of physical phenomena for its success. 
It is only the inference, following the experiment and the obser- 
vation, that is strictly chemical. If one substance gives two 
different substances, or if two substances give one different sub- 
stance, for example, we infer that a chemical change has occurred. 
We then try to recognize the substances by their properties and 
name them. 
Changes like that of ice into water, or of water into steam, and 
vice versa, are not regarded as chemical changes. These are 
called changes of state (see p. 64). 
Law: Explanation: Scientific Method.— There is a widely 
spread impression that a science, like chemistry is a part of
-P-A-G-E-41
CHEMICAL CHANGE AND THE METHODS OF STUDYING IT 23 
the natural order of the universe. It is thought that we are try- 
ing to find the boundaries of chemistry, as they have been pre- 
determined by nature, and to discover the facts, relations of 
facts, and laws which nature has provided as a means of classify- 
ing the content of the science. Now, the situation is precisely 
the reverse of this. Nature provides only the materials and the 
phenomena, and man is attempting to classify them. He divides 
the whole into groups, such as physics, chemistry, botany, etc. 
Then he classifies the facts within each group, in order that he 
may more easily remember them and perceive their relations. 
He often finds that, when new facts are discovered, parts of the 
classification have to be changed. 
In the preceding pages, we have discussed some of the ways 
that have been invented for classifying the materials and facts 
assigned to chemistry. Thus, we pick out a number of facts of a 
like nature and try to make a single statement which will cover all 
these facts. For example, we find about one hundred thousand 
different substances and, in the case of each substance, every speci- 
men that we have examined contains the same proportions of 
the constituent elements. So we formulate the law of constant 
proportions. 
A law or generalization in chemistry is a brief statement 
describing some general fact or constant mode of behavior. We 
must remember, however, that laws are only true so long as no 
facts in conflict with them are known. There are no laws in 
nature. Nature presents materials and phenomena as she pleases. 
The laws are parts of science, which is made by man, and is a de- 
scription of natural facts as man knows them. 
One section (p. 9) was entitled: ‘‘ Explanation of rusting.” 
If that paragraph be now re-read, it will be found that, in the 
ordinary (as distinct from the scientific) sense of the word, no 
explanation was given! When we ask a man to “explain” some 
feature in his conduct, we recognize that he might have chosen to 
act otherwise, and we wish to know why he acted precisely as he
-P-A-G-E-42

did. Nature, however, has no free will, and cannot tell why she 
presents certain phenomena, and not others. 
On examining the explanation, we find that it simply shows 
that when iron rusts it combines with oxygen from the air. This 
is an additional fact. It shows how iron rusts, namely, by taking 
up oxygen, but not why it is able to unite with oxygen. We 
simply do not know why iron can combine with oxygen gas and 
platinum cannot. | 
Explanations in chemistry are of three kinds. (1) We usually 
try to show that the phenomenon is not an isolated one. Thus, 
we show that other metals rust. This reconciles us to some ex- 
tent to the fact that iron rusts, and we feel some mental satisfac- 
tion. This is the method of showing that the fact to be explained 
is a member of a large class of similar facts. (2) Next, we try 
to get more information about the fact to be explained. Thus, 
when, to the acquaintance with the outward manifestations of 
rusting, we add the further information that there is an increase 
in weight, and that this is due to union of oxygen from the air 
with the iron, we feel increased satisfaction, and say that the 
fact has been ‘ explained.” (3) If we are still dissatisfied, and 
can discover no further useful facts, we imagine a state of affairs 
which, if true, would classify the fact or add to what we know 
about it. This step we call explaining by means of an hypothesis. 
We then devote our attention to trying to verify the hypothesis. 
The formulation of laws and the making of attempts to explain 
facts are part of what is called the scientific method. The purpose 
of this method is to convert the subject matter into a science, that 
is, into an organized body of knowledge. 
Summary.— In this chapter we have learned: (1) that, 
while there are many substances, there is a limited number of 
entirely different kinds of matter (elements); (2) that, in addition 
to definite specific properties, each substance has a constant 
composition by weight. We have also learned that physical
-P-A-G-E-43

properties are utilized in manipulations, like filtration and evapo- 
ration, as well as for identifying substances, and that physical 
attributes are used for measuring quantities in chemistry and 
physical conditions for guiding chemical change. Finally, we 
have seen that a science is not a natural, but a manufactured 
product, and that the science of chemistry is still in the making. 
Exercises.*— 1. What physical properties are used (a) in 
filtration, (b) in evaporation, (c) in the separation and identifica- 
tion of the products from heating mercuric oxide (p. 15)? 
2. Describe: (a) a red-hot rod of iron, 10 em. long by 1 cm. 
diameter, weighing 58.5 g.; (b) a solution of 5 g. of sulphur in 
20 c.c. (26 g.) of carbon disulphide at 18° C. In doing so, divide 
the description into attributes, conditions, and properties. 
3. Consider the following materials and state whether, so far 
as you can now judge, each is a single substance or a mixture: (a) 
a candle, (b) a cake of soap, (c) an egg. 
4, What are the two most direct ways of showing a substance 
to be a compound? Illustrate each. 
5. If we say that quicklime contains calcium, do we mean the 
element or the simple substance calcium? 
6. What explanation was given, (a) of the disappearance of 
mercuric oxide when heated, (b) of the absence of iron and sulphur, 
as substances, from ferrous sulphide? Which of the three kinds 
of explanation was used in each case? 
7. What weight of oxygen will be required to combine with 15 
grams of lead (p. 10)? 
8. If 5 grams of lead and 4 grams of oxygen were heated 
together, which of the two would remain in part unused? How 
much of this one would remain (p. 10)? 
* The exercises should in all cases be studied with minute care. They not 
only serve as tests to show that the chapter has been understood, but very 
frequently (as in No. 4) also call attention to ideas which might not be ac- 
quired from the text alone, or (as in Nos. 1, 2, 5) assist in elucidating ideas 
given in the text which, without the exercises, might not be fully grasped.

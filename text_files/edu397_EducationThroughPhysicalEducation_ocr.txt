PREFACE. 
Many valuable books have been published dealing with the 
technique of the various activities related to physical education, 
but there are comparatively few dealing with the organization and 
administration of physical education and with the subject as a whole. 
There are no books dealing with physical education for girls and 
women as such. 
This book represents entirely a woman’s point of view in physical 
education; it makes its appeal to girls and women. It represents a 
reaction against the man-made athletic world. It makes no specific 
effort to solve the problems in men’s athletics, but, by advocating 
a different educational philosophy where girls’ and women’s athletics 
are concerned, it hopes to avoid for them most of the evils commonly 
associated with physical education in the past. 
It concerns itself less with the detail of technique and more with the 
general administration of all physical activities; less with the rules 
and more with the general physical education program and problems 
connected with it; more with standards, ideals, principles, methods 
and systems. 
The author has frankly and freely criticized the unsocial and 
non-socializing tendencies in present-day physical education with 
a feeling of confidence that her motives will be understood and that 
educators, men and women alike, will endorse her views and her 
standards. 
The interest and participation of girls and women in athletics 
is increasing by such leaps and bounds that proper leadership is 
not always available and as a result many dangerous tendencies 
are manifesting themselves. It is to be hoped that the leaders in 
recreation and sports will agree with the philosophy of this book. 
Experience has proved that young instructors are not always 
conversant with the many details concerned with the running off 
of a field day or a swimming meet; that their attitude is not always 
the educational one and that their ideals and objections are not 
always of the highest. To them this book hopes to make its appeal.

vi PREFACE 
If the masses are to be educated and the army of unskilled 
instructed, types of activities must be offered which are suited to 
their needs and degree of development. Great ingenuity must be 
used in our efforts to appeal to and interest them. This will require 
greater emphasis on, and an ever increasing number of the less 
highly organized games and events, of activities which can safely be 
indulged in with little or no training, and of types of recreation which 
can be enjoyed by those with physical defects and handicaps. 
The author hopes through this book to assist and to encourage this 
movement. 
Hundreds of girls are going out of college every year to act as 
camp councillors, girl-scout leaders, camp-fire guardians, club 
leaders and workers in various kinds of social organizations. For 
them, also, this book was written. 
While it is true that many of the illustrations used in these pages 
have been drawn from college life and experience, nevertheless, 
just as many of the principles which apply to physical education 
in the public schools can be applied to colleges, so, also, can much 
of the material presented in this book, many of the theories and 
principles advocated, be applied by public and private schools, 
playgrounds, camps, girl scouts, club leaders, ete. 
Finally, it is the hope of the author that she may inspire her 
readers with a desire to experiment, to do original work and to under- 
take research work of some kind. There are so many interesting 
problems awaiting solution, so many lines of research and thought 
waiting to be investigated, while so little has been done. Physical 
education has been so busy with drills and exhibitions and practical 
every-day things that it has been slow to recognize and seize its 
wonderful opportunities. It has been lacking in courage and vision. 
It is impossible for the many remote corners of the country, 
for institutions and organizations and individuals out of touch with 
the big movements in physical education to know and appreciate 
the really fine spirit which animates the leaders of physical eduea- 
tion for women—the desire for real social service which dominates 
their actions. Possibly this book which reflects in many instances 
their principles and ideals, may help to reinforce some of their 
teachings and make the world in general realize a little more fully 
the inherent educational possibilities in physical education. 
The author is greatly indebted to all of those (too numerous to 
mention) who, by contributing outlines, charts, quotations, sugges- 
tions and ideas have helped to make more forcible and graphic her

ideas. To the members of her department—especially Miss Lelia 
Finan and Miss Meryle Hauser; to Miss Christine Dobbins, Inspec- 
tor of Dancing and Athletics, New York City Public Schools; and 
to Miss Nell Haile and Miss Lillian Schoedler she is especially 
indebted for unfailing support, interest and many valuable sugges- 
tions; to all the members of the Athletic Board at Barnard College 
who, by loyal advocacy of many of the principles and policies out- 
lined, by their high ideals and constant striving for higher standards 
have served as an inspiration and help, sincere thanks are due. 
Much valuable work upon the manuscript was done by Miss Harriet 
Chamberlain. To all who contributed in any way whatsoever, 
grateful acknowledgement is made.

EDUCATION THROUGH PHYSICAL 
EDUCATION. 
CHAPTER I. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Durine the sixteenth century in Europe, twenty-five years was 
the average age of the population; in the eighteenth century it », 
was extended to thirty-five years. Fifty years ago, the average age 
in New York was forty-two years, but now it is fifty-three years. 
In three hundred years it has more than doubled. As life becomes 
more complex, more urban, what will it be in fifty years more? 
The responsibility of answering this question lies with physical 
education to a great-degree. Ninety per cent of American babies 
are born with normal physical abilities, yet the draft showed almost 
40 per cent of our men incapacitated for strenuous service. What 
happened between birth and manhood? What would a like survey 
disclose regarding our girls and women? Of the students entering 
Barnard College last fall, only 70 per cent received a health grade 
of “A,” 79 per cent showed postural defects of various kinds, 62 
per cent feet defects, 46 per cent were either over or under weight, 
19 per cent had defective hearts, 47 per cent suffered from menstrual 
difficulties of some kind, 13 per cent constipation and 64 per cent of 
the class had a hemoglobin count of less than 90. This is probably 
typical of a like group of students anywhere, as Barnard draws its 
students from all over the United States. Where is the fault? 
In the home, or in our educational systems? 
Dr. Clark Hetherington recently made the following statement 
in an address: “The problem of physical education is in the public 
schools, not in the colleges. There are masses of children in public 
schools—25, 000,000 of which relatively few, approximately less 
than 3 per cent enter college. The college problem is relatively 
insignificant. If we had a perfect program of physical education 
in college, and poor programs in elementary schools and high schools, 
college work would be relatively uninfluential. If we had a perfect 
2 (17) 
\- 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
18 INTRODUCTION 
program in high school and not in college, it would have stupendous 
influence. Physical education in high schools is poor; and it is 
extremely poor in elementary schools; so the problem is in the public 
school. College and university directors are in a position to have 
profound influence in public schools because: 
“1. College directors are trained in academic work as well as 
physical work. 
“9. Physical directors are training leaders of public opinion. 
“3. Physical directors are training leaders who are to teach in 
schools.” 
Will the time come when colleges will refuse to admit students 
who cannot pass a fairly high physical efficiency test? It is to be 
hoped. A more rigid entrance standard followed by exclusion, 
might have a wholesome effect upon our public and private school 
systems, and upon the Boards and Governments back of them. 
At any rate, educationally minded and intelligent physical edu- 
cators are looking the facts in the face and realizing that, if physical 
education is to meet the demand and take its proper place in the 
general scheme of education, it must wake up; it must stop thinking 
in terms of gate receipts and records and championships; it must 
think more in terms of mass participation, mass improvement, mass 
health, character training and citizenship, social service and civic 
standards. 
Physical education in its reactions is but following in the wake of 
general education. Education stands upon the threshold of a new 
era and physical education must not fail to keep pace with general 
education. From extreme formalism in physical education, the 
pendulum has swung to recreation and play. The beginning of 
the twentieth century saw the establishment of playgrounds, play 
centers, recreation centers and a wave of recreation and athleticism 
swept the country. 
~~ Effect on Athletics for Boys and Men.—Instead of this accession 
resulting in a program of universal participation where men and 
boys were concerned, it resulted in high specialization for the few; 
an undue emphasis upon championships and records, upon “var- 
sity” teams and intercollegiate competition; a foolish worship of 
athletic prestige and records. It became responsible for the pro- 
fessional coach, paid out of all proportion to his real value as an 
educator; for the erection of huge stadiums and for a general com- 
mercialism of sport. Enormous gate receipts were necessary in 
order to support the various sports. The games and meets degener-

ated into huge spectacles, not to display before an interested and 
sympathetic group the Brows of the chosen few, but to entertain 
the public. =— Soper. 
Results of the War.—At the height of this period came the World 
War, and physical examinations showed that one-third of our 
men were unfit for active service. The country was stunned—a 
country which prided itself on its athletic prestige, its athletic 
manhood, its athletic prowess and physical development: Hadn’t 
it won “Olympics?” Hadn’t it led the world in making and break- 
ing records? Weren’t its coaches paid the highest salaries of any 
in the world? 
Dean Keppel of Columbia University in a book on “ Under- 
graduate Life” quotes President Garfield of Williams College to 
the effect that “In New England colleges, the average expenditure 
per student for athletic purposes was $170.00 with only 16 per cent 
of the students participating. The figures of the country at large 
were $59.00 with only 17 per cent competing.” This is eloquent 
enough, and speaks volumes regarding the emphasis in men’s 
athletics. Too many men had sat in the grand stand, and the fine 
physical specimens, the men who needed it least, had received all 
the training. The.sad part of this was that most of the defects 
discovered were remediable and could have been prevented by the 
right system_of physical education and 1 recreation. Quite wisely, 
the Government drew its own conclusions. What had been good 
for the few was good for the many: So, it set to work. Huge 
athletic and recreation fields were made and equipped for the army, 
elaborate programs of gymnastics, recreation and sport were 
worked out and carried into effect even at the front. Individual 
defects were followed up and treated. Much valuable personal 
information was given to every man and boy. All that science and 
skill and money and labor could command was poured out unstint- 
ingly. The result is a matter of history. No nation ever had a finer 
fighting army than ours, its morale was the wonder of the world. 
It sang, it fought, it cheered, it bled and it died. But, it made a 
‘“game” of it, and we won the war . . . . on our athletic 
field. 
When the men came home, it was hoped that the Nation had 
learned its lesson. The whole country was filled with a bigness of 
heart and spirit, a desire to do fine things. The Nation had been 
thinking in terms of ideals and unselfishness; it was drunk with 
accomplishment: It was still thinking in terms of the mass and  
-P-A-G-E-18
  20 INTRODUCTION 
mass accomplishment. It meant to live up to those principles. 
Colleges had their athletic disarmament conferences and they 
almost agreed to destroy their big battleships, to cut down inter- 
collegiate warfare—almost, but not quite. They did not quite dare. 
Like all of the little principalities in Europe, they sat watching each 
other suspicious and afraid,and . . . . once again, the grand- 
stands are full; 70,000 people watch 22 men play a thrilling game. 
Those 22 men are as nearly perfect physical and mental machines 
as careful selection, weeks of practice and care and attention from 
coaches, assistant coaches, rubbers, masseurs, dieticians, doctors 
and a corp of other attendants can make them. There is talk of 
adding rims to the bowls so that they will seat 100,000 spectators 
instead of only 70,000. Can any one think of anything more 
grandly humane than for some public spirited man or woman or 
community to offer $1,000,000 and say, “This is not for a huge 
stadium where 75,000 will watch 22 men perform, but this is to 
equip one dozen athletic fields and pools where a few may superintend 
the playing of thousands?” 
Alexander Meiklejohn in The Atlantic Monthly, November, 
1922, writes the following: 
“Were is, I am sure the radical blunder which has made our 
double-minded administration. We have put together play and 
money making when every interest of play demanded that they be 
separated. When it appeared, thirty years ago, that our games 
were arousing public interest and could therefore be made sources 
of revenue, what did we say? More or less clearly two statements 
were made. First, this public interest. though bad for sport, is good 
for other reasons, and must be cultivated. And second, the amounts 
of money involved are too large to be managed by undergraduates; 
we must establish boards of control to see that proper management 
is given. And so we took from the undergraduates the manage- 
ment of their own games—much to their delight as they saw our 
more ‘efficient’ administration. In their place we have established 
great systems of administration which have built stadiums, bowls, 
coliseums, have increased gate receipts, have aroused public interest, 
have ‘developed’ teams, until the whole system has become an 
absurd travesty of the motive from which it sprang, the impulse 
of play which it was intended to serve.” 
The Advent of the Professional Coach.—The suggestion is ventured 
that the explanation lies in the fact that physical education in the 
past has been teo much in the hands of schoolmen and coaches.
-P-A-G-E-19
INTRODUCTION 21 
The schoolmen felt that formal gymnastics were physical education, 
and that play and recreation took care of themselves, When 
athletics began to forge to the front, the professional coach took 
charge. He was for the most part a man with technical skill in his 
particular branch of sport. He might possess a good general educa- 
tion; he might be a man of culture and splendid character, but 
that was secondary. Very often, he was not. The important con- 
sideration was that he could develop a winning team. As competition 
increased and rivalry between colleges and institutions grew, as 
championships and athletic prestige became more and more import- 
ant factors in the academic world, his importance also grew until 
he became the highest salaried man on the faculty, paid an enor- 
mous fee out of all proportion to his actual worth as an educator. 
College presidents and faculties have recognized the danger. 
Some educationally-minded physical educators also have sensed 
it. Many meetings and conferences have been held for the purpose 
of discussing and suggesting remedies; many articles in the press, 
and various publications have appeared from time to time on the 
subject. A prominent educator further writes: 
“The absurdity of our present administration of games reaches 
its climax in the institution of the coach, the armies of coaches. 
These are men who are brought in to develop the playing skill of 
. the team to the highest possible pitch. They are given full and com- 
plete charge of the players and the play; far more than anyone else 
they are held responsible for victories or defeats. In return for this 
they are paid large, exceedingly large salaries, as judged by the 
standards of the college community. Now the growth of this 
institution is ef course directly traceable to the administration of the 
gate receipts. If large sums of money are available then many and 
good coaches can be secured by paying for them. If good coaching 
is provided, the level of play is raised, more victories are won, and 
the gate receipts are still further increased. The making of the 
money enters directly and essentially into the winning of the games. 
The sport is commercialized at its very center. It is not too strong 
a statement to say that undergraduate responsibility for the winning 
or losing of games has very largely disappeared.” 
There are special instances where institutions and organizations 
are putting over “mass programs” in addition to their specialized 
one. There is a certain alertness to the dangers of the situation, 
and the men will probably not again drift back into quite the old 
condition. But, that does not alter the fact that the seasonal coach,   
 
-P-A-G-E-20
22 INTRODUCTION 
and the whole system for which he stands, is a pernicious one, and 
that too much emphasis is being put upon the making and breaking 
of records. A wholesome note has been injected and a considerable 
impression made by the National Amateur Athletic Federation, 
whose aim is “play and recreation for everybody,’ and whose 
physical tests distributed on a nation-wide scale have done much 
to interest the mass in physical prowess and fitness. Also, a different 
type of physical educator is coming into the field, men and women 
with broad educational ideals; men and women who see, back of the 
athlete, the boy and the girl, the future citizen; men and women who 
realize that games and sports are but a means to an end, and not an 
end in themselves. 
Furthermore, there is a tendency to realize that “athletics” are 
a legitimate and most important part of the regular work of a Depart- 
ment of Physical Education, not a department in itself to be regu- 
lated and administered by undergraduates and alumni and by 
coaches whose greatest desire is a winning team. They are but part 
of an educational scheme, and, as such, must be adapted to the 
needs of the masses and the regular curriculum. This is giving 
more responsibility to the legitimate heads of physical education 
departments and placing the emphasis where it belongs. Even so, 
physical education has a long road to travel and many battles to 
fight before it can get proper control of the situation. 
These remarks are not intended as an arraignment of men’s 
athletics, nor are they made in a spirit of destructive criticism. 
This book is addressed not only to the girls and women of the coun- 
try, but to every person who is associated in any way with the 
physicial activities of girls and women. The author feels that a 
constructive educational attitude on the part of the men has, until 
quite recently, been wanting. They have lacked vision and, if they 
have had convictions, they have lacked the courage to stand up and 
fight for them, or else they have been to much in the minority to be 
really effective. The case cannot be put too strongly. A crisis is 
at hand where the recreation of girls and women is concerned and 
unless the danger signals are heeded, the history of the men’s 
mistakes will but be repeated in women’s athletics. 
ATHLETICS FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN. 
The development of physical education among girls and women 
has been, until lately, rather uneventful, but it has been slow and  
-P-A-G-E-21
    
INTRODUCTION 23 
steady. Emphasis varied between “calisthenics,” formal gymnas- 
tics, folk dancing, esthetic dancing and games, until about twenty 
years ago, when girls began to participate more actively in games 
and sports. The interest gradually increased and was carried along 
on the wave of men’s participation with no particular guidance and 
no particular outstanding evils. Until recently, little importance 
was attached to specialization in athletics by girls and women. 
However, partly due to requests from certain industrial groups, 
partly due to the desire on the part of a few men to exploit women 
as athletes and partly due to the natural influence of masculine 
athletics, a number of objectionable tendencies developed. These 
resulted in women and girls participating in open meets conducted 
by various organizations and finally in a team of girls being sent to 
Paris to compete in the Paris games. In certain sections of our 
country there has also been an alarming increase in interschool 
competition among high school girls, especially in basket-ball. 
This has been particularly deplorable as it has in many instances 
received the backing and the encouragement of school boards and 
public-minded citizens, eager to see championships won—not 
realizing all that this involved for the girls. Strong objection to this 
was expressed by the National Physical Education Association, 
by the Association of Directors of Physical Education in Colleges 
for Women, by the National Committee on Women’s Athletics, 
by many sane individuals both men and women, and by both laymen 
and physical educators. 
In spite of this, various individuals in various sections of the 
country have continued to exploit the girls and women in this way. 
Quite recently a girls’ basket-ball team from the southwest journeyed 
east twice to play so-called ‘eastern champions” for . . . the 
championship. These teams were composed of high school girls, 
coached by men. They made these long trips missing many valuable 
hours and days of school work. Yet, misguided, good-hearted citi- 
zens raised the funds necessary to exploit these young girls. 
One state has just abandoned a basket-ball tournament, after 
much opposition and hard feeling, in which 64 teams, girls and boys, 
were accustomed to gather from all parts of the state and play day 
and night until winners finally emerged. The harm done to adoles- 
cent boys and girls, more especially to the girls, by the excitement 
and nervous strain alone of such contests can hardly be estimated. 
These are but samples of what is happening in all parts of the 
country. The situation seems to be worse in the more rural districts 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  24 INTRODUCTION 
than in the strictly urban. John J. Tigert, United States Commis- 
sioner of Education, says:! 
“Of all the crimes I ever committed, the one I plead guilty to is 
that back in those days, when I was young and thoughtless and 
directed athletics not only for men but for women, I coached a 
girls’ basket-ball team without losing one game in four years. That 
group of girls went into the game with all the motives that are 
instilled into boys and men in contest, and whether they were 
physically unfit or not they went into the game. I have often said 
since then that I never committed a greater crime than that. God 
only knows how much damage I did those girls. Now if that 
thing is going on all over the country today, and it is, it is not possible 
to say whether more good is being done in interscholastic contests 
among girls than harm. When you begin to think about it you will 
find that practically all the evils and dangers that come from the 
present system of physical training in America go back to this 
desire to win.” 
The sane women in physical education finally became thoroughly 
aroused and alarmed, and organized a very definite opposition. 
This opposition has taken the form of the Women’s Division of the 
National Amateur Athletic Federation, with Mrs Herbert Hoover 
as Chairman, and a strong group of physical educators as an Execu- 
tive Committee. Further mention of this will be made later. The 
aim of this organization is not only to combat the harmful influences 
at work, but to formulate definite constructive policies and programs 
for girls and women. For the most part, the women have had none 
up to the present time. They have had no leaders. They have been 
drifting. The men naturally took the tiller. They offered the 
women a tow, and they, forgetting that their craft is more frail 
than that of the men, accepted. It was generous of the men, and 
the women appreciate their spirit. The fault was not with the men. 
The women failed to remember that, although their objectives 
might be the same, and their ultimate ports the same, their lines and 
method of approach should be entirely different ones. The organ- 
ization of this Women’s Division was one of the most noteworthy 
forward and upward steps general education has witnessed in years. 
While general education probably knows little about it as yet, as 
time goes on, it cannot help but feel its influence. At the time, it 
meant that the women were refusing to be towed longer behind a 
doubtful physical educational scheme, that they were setting forth 
1 The Playground, February, 1924, Campaign for National Physical Fitness.
-P-A-G-E-23
  INTRODUCTION 25 
under their own sail with women at the tiller and only women 
propelling the craft. It meant that at last the women were a unit 
with certain’ definite ideals and were agreed for the most part on 
standards and procedures. They know their objectives although 
as yet they are not always quite clear as to the best methods of 
approach. 
The war has given a tremendous impetus to physical education. 
The wholesale physical defects disclosed by the examinations, the 
wonderful results obtained by corrective and remedial measures, 
the wholesome effect mentally and morally as well as physically 
of the huge recreation program prescribed for the soldiers and 
sailors has left the Government and the public at large in a more 
responsive and receptive frame of mind. These are powerful argu- 
ments and various individuals and organizations have not been slow 
to strike while the iron is hot. According to Dr. Willystine Goodsell: 
“Another reason why the intelligent public is more favorable 
to the physical education of girls than ever before is the fact that 
thoughtful people are coming to understand that adolescent girls 
need outlets for their nervous energy no less than boys if they are 
not to harbor unwholesome ideas and desires or nourish excessive 
sentimentality in ‘the cobwebbed corners of their minds.’ The 
gymnasium and the playing field are the best correctives of the 
insurgent sex impulses of adolescence yet devised—for girls as well 
as boys.” 
Thirty-three states now have compulsory physical education 
laws, there is a more general interest in physical fitness, a more 
general desire for recreation and play, a keener realization of the 
high correlation between fitness and proficiency, between health and 
efficiency. Health, and a constructive attitude toward health, is 
being preached as it has never been. It is just at this most psycho- 
logical moment that woman finds herself a force in physical educa- 
tion, and through the influence of that force upon general education, 
she is beginning to be a power. 
THE AIMS OF GENERAL EDUCATION. 
In a pamphlet published recently by the Alumni of the University 
of Chicago dealing with “The Business of a College,’ Ernest DeWitt 
Burton, President of the University, who is responsible for the 
article, makes the following statement: 
1 Dr. Willystine Goodsell: The Education of Women.
-P-A-G-E-24
26 INTRODUCTION 
“The central business of a college is, I believe, to develop not 
ideas in the abstract, nor the human tools of the trades, but personal- 
ities capable of a large participation in life and of a large contribu- 
tion to life. One argument only I advance for this opinion, viz., 
that personalities of this type are the world’s greatest need, and that 
the college rightly administered is capable of producing them— 
not, indeed, of finishing their training, but of starting them in the 
right direction. The process of education will necessarily be life- 
long. 
“But if this is the central business of the college, what are the 
specific things that it ought to do for all its students? Three things, 
as I see it: First, a college ought to enable all its students to place 
themselves in the world, to recognize where they are. It ought to 
help each student to acquire such a knowledge of the physical 
universe, of the history of the race, of the structure of society, and 
of the nature of the individual that, taking his stand at the center 
of his own being, he may have a sense of where he is. I pity pro- 
foundly the man to whom all past history is a blank, who. looking 
back, sees an impenetrable wall at the moment to which his own 
memory extends. He lacks the fundamental condition of the high- 
est enjoyment of life and of any large service to the world. The 
college ought to save him from such isolation, and enable him to 
find himself. 
“The second thing that a college ought to do for its students is 
to teach them to think, not to follow precepts, not to practice an 
art according to fixed methods, or to play a game according to the 
rules of the game, but to observe facts, to set them in relation to 
one another. to view them dispassionately, to draw conclusions 
from them. The impulse to do this is inborn; but it needs encour- 
agement, development, practice, intensification. The thinker, 
dispassionate but acute, is one of the world’s great needs. 
“The third thing that is necessary to the achievement of the 
business of the college is the development of character. If once we 
thought that an education that consisted in the acquisition of facts 
was all that was needed to make democracy safe for itself and the 
world, we have surely been thoroughly disillusioned. Breadth of 
knowledge, power to think, are indispensable prerequisite sto large 
participation in life or large contributions to life. But apart from 
high moral character they are not only inadequate but positively 
dangerous. And because this is so, no institution that undertakes 
to give these former things can escape the obligation to concern itself
-P-A-G-E-25
  INTRODUCTION 27 
for the latter also. It is my conviction on this point, indeed, that 
largely influenced me in the choice of that rather vague word ‘per- 
sonality.’ I recently read an address in which, if I followed the 
writer’s thought correctly, he summed up the duty of the college as 
teaching the student to think. I feel obliged, on the other hand, to 
maintain the old-fashioned doctrine, if it is old-fashioned, that any 
definition of the function of the college in purely intellectual terms, 
however broad and inclusive, or however rigid and exacting, is 
fatally false by defect. Unless to whatever it does for the student 
by enlarging his horizon and by sharpening his power of intellect 
it also does its best to see that he acquires sound principles and right 
habits of action, it has failed at a point where failure is fatally 
serious.” 
In this, according to Dr. Burton, the college should seek to give a 
student knowledge, to develop personality and character and to 
see that he acquires scwnd principles and right habits of action. 
Again, speaking before the Sixty-second Annual Convention of the 
National Education Association in Washington on June 29, 1924, 
Dr. Edwin W. Starbuch, Professor of Philosophy at Iowa State 
University, made a strong appeal for making the public school a 
character-developing institution. “The school is like a garden, 
not like a factory; character is something that grows as the fruit- 
age of personal conduct. It cannot be produced by machine-like 
methods. . . . Plant the good life in the muscles and motives 
of the children rather than in their thoughts about conduct. 
“Use the entire school program for character development. 
Desist, for the most part, from setting aside periods for moral 
instruction. See that all studies and activities have such content 
and such atmosphere that they will have a natural drive toward 
character objectives. The good person is not good in general. He 
is one who meets every vital situation gracefully, thoughfully, help- 
fully and ideally. 
“We are now gaining conscious control of human development. 
The future of humanity, the destiny of nations, the direction of 
human progress are in the hands, not so much the makers of law 
or captains of industry as of the teachers who are shaping the citi- 
zenry of the world.” 
Physical education has a distinct contribution to make to general 
education, and its aims and purposes should harmonize with those 
of general education. The basic principles should be the same. As 
a result of education, an individual ought to be of more value eco-

nomically, have more power personally, and, as a result of this. be 
more of an asset to her community and to the world. It has often 
been said that college is not just preparation for life, but it is life 
itself. On the other hand, the more fully and richly an individual 
lives those early years of womanhood and manhood, whether in a 
college or out of it, the more abundantly will he be able to con- 
tribute to life in after years, and that much richer and fuller will 
be his service. What can physical education contribute to that 
richness and fulness? 
AIMS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION. 
Are the objectives of physical education educational? Arephysical 
education programs being administered in an educational way? 
Do directors and supervisors ever stop to think about this at all? 
Or, do they just take a syllabus which has been handed to them, 
a couple of rule books and plunge ahead, living from day to day? 
Do they think of the girls and boys who are under supervision 
as individuals and as human beings or do they regard them as so 
much athletic material—a runner, a forward, a pitcher or dancer? 
Do they realize that these girls and boys have lives to live, that 
they (the teachers) are helping to shape those lives, and that, in 
so far as time and equipment permit, each girl is an individual 
problem, with individual needs and individual requirements, and 
that each one should receive an individual prescription? 
When the aims of physical education are referred to, there is in 
mind not alone an improvement of the physical being, a muscular 
development and a gain in organic vigor, but there is in addition a 
mental, moral and social education by means of physical tools. 
It is customary, or has been in the past, to think of physical educa- 
tion too much in terms of “perspiration and gymnastic contests,” 
muscle building and spectacular exhibitions. The new physical 
education is seeking to do the commonplace . . . to develop 
the masses, to raise the standards of the masses, morally and men- 
tally as well as physically and to make of them social assets. 
The aim is for (1) health—not just a negative condition repre- 
sented by absence of physical defects, but glad, radiant, positive, 
abundant health. The old Ivory Soap advertisements which 
appeared in the street cars stating that the soap was 98 per cent pure, 
were always highly amusing. Nothing is pure unless 100 per cent 
pure. No one is healthy who is not 100 per cent healthy. Health
-P-A-G-E-27
  
INTRODUCTION 29 
is as infectious as disease, and through the combined efforts of all 
physical educators, an epidemic of health could be started which 
would sweep the country. It will never be possible to “isolate” the 
health germ. The family is too large and varied, but its environ- 
ment can be made more favorable and its production increased to 
such an extent that disease in time will represent a disappearing 
minimum. 
Physical education should (2) develop strong muscles and 
strong, well-poised bodies, mechanically correct and able to carry 
their loads easily. It should relegate to the physical education junk 
heap the “athletic slouch” and the “debutante slouch.” It should 
help to make boys and girls (3) organically sound, give them hearts 
and lungs and stomachs and livers which functionate properly, 
it should develop in them (4) good neuromuscular control as repre- 
sented not only by their reactions to motor activities, but by their 
quick adjustment to any situation which arises. This means the 
necessity and opportunity for adequate motor education. It should 
also set (5) standards of living, establish ideals, make every boy 
and girl a finer, bigger, broader man and woman and not put a few 
on pedestals and worship them because of records in this and that 
sport or event. 
Its aim also should be to teach girls and boys (6) a wise use of 
leisure time, and to give them the means for using it more wisely. 
In these days of fads and fancies, of automobiles and movies; in these 
days of crowded cities, keen business competition and money 
craze, it is a valuable asset to have within ourselves a desire for a 
little leisure time and the ability to use it worthily. It has been 
truly said that “‘major’ sports are those a man cannot use after 
leaving college.” Too much time is spent on, and too much emphasis 
placed upon the very sports which cannot be indulged in after leav- 
ing college. While these highly organized team games have a tre- 
mendous value, and there is no desire to underestimate their import- 
ance, ought not more emphasis than is commonly accorded them 
be placed on such activities as tennis, swimming, golf, hand-ball 
and archery in addition to the other sports? These activities are 
distinctly individual and for that reason lacking in some of the 
educational content the team games possess, but they are highly 
recreational, healthful, and distinctly valuable as activities which 
can be maintained throughout life. 
The program should be based upon sound educational psychology, 
as well as upon sound physiological, anatomical and biological prin-  
-P-A-G-E-28
  30 INTRODUCTION 
ciples. One must consider the psycho-physical needs of the girl and 
boy, and make the program to fit those needs. It is a sad mistake 
to make a program and try to adapt every boy and girl to it. The 
author is not a strong believer in syllabi, except as guides or outlines 
which will be altered or abandoned as the weather, time of day, 
season, environment, type and temper of the group may suggest. 
Every program should be based upon a complete study of the indi- 
vidual and his or her needs—not alone upon his musculature. 
Further Objectives are: 
1, A realization of periodic health examinations. We inspect 
our elevators regularly; we never start on a long motor trip without 
overhauling the machine; yet, how do we treat our bodies? 
2. Universal participation in games and sports of the right sort 
under proper conditions and leadership. 
3. Trained recreation leaders with educational ideals (women 
where girls and women are concerned) in our school systems, our 
colleges, our parks, or recreation centers, our industries, etc., not 
just professional or untrained coaches. 
4. Constructive programs of activities worked out on a basis 
of age and ability groups. 
5. A constructive and educational and intelligent attitude and 
standards on the part of not only the leaders, but the public at large 
toward games and sports and their uses and abuses. 
6. A love of exercise and recreation for itself, not for personal or 
institutional prestige, not for reward or glory, but for the fun of 
participation. 
The next question which arises is: How is this going to be accom- 
plished? Experience has proven that it will not be brought about 
by interscholastic or intercollegiate competition, at least not as con- 
ducted in the past, not by placing the emphasis on championship 
teams and the making and breaking of records, not by anything 
spectacular. 
The public must be educated to this ideal, which means that they 
must be made to realize that our games and sports are not Roman 
spectacles, that they are not an end in themselves, but a means to 
an end and that end a finer and better equipped citizenship. The 
public must be made to grasp the idea that they belong not in the 
grand stand but on the field. That idea must be emphatically 
impressed upon college presidents corporation presidents, faculties, 
schoolmen, legislators, state and city boards and upon governments 
everywhere. Industries must realize that a winning basket-ball
-P-A-G-E-29
  INTRODUCTION 31 
team may be a good advertisement but that having all of their 
employees 100 per cent efficient is much better business. Com- 
munities must be educated to the point where they realize that to 
have a girls’ basket-ball team representing New York State defeat 
a girls’ basket-ball team representing your state means compara- 
tively little from the sport or health point of view, but that for a 
larger percentage of the girls in my state to be participating and 
competing under proper circumstances with the right sort of stand- 
ards and ideals, than is competing in your state under like condi- 
tions, does mean a great deal. 
Of what special significance is it that a girl from New Jersey 
representing the United States jump higher than the girl from 
France or England? It may bring a patriotic thrill but does that 
mean that our young womanhood is stronger or more efficient men- 
tally and physically than the womanhood or girlhood of Europe? 
It does not. What is or ought to be of interest is: Do the majority 
of our girls jump higher and run faster and throw farther than the 
majority of European girls because that would mean that they have 
better lungs, stronger hearts, stronger arms and legs and better 
neuromuscular control and coérdination. 
There is a pretty fair unanimity of opinion among women that 
intercompetition is wrong even under ideal health supervision, if 
it means as it generally does, neglect of the masses. Yet, when 
adolescent high school girls begin to play long schedules of outside 
games and to travel about the country; when other groups begin 
competing in open meets as they are doing in the east, wearing 
immodest costumes before mixed audiences, even attended by men 
rubbers and patted on the back by Tom, Dick and Harry, the turn- 
ing point has come, and it is time something sane and intelligent 
was done by sane, intelligent women. 
When larger portions of our girls and women have little or no 
opportunity for recreation, or have improperly controlled recreation 
and sport, it is time for thinking women to assert themselves. 
Physical education seems to have at present four big needs: 
1. A more intelligent program of activities, more intelligently 
administered with proper emphasis upon preventive and remedial 
measures. : 
2. A more educational attitude toward physical education among 
physical directors and physical educators and educators in general. 
3. A keener realization on the part of the public, governments 
and institutions of the real value and needs of physical education,
-P-A-G-E-30
  32 INTRODUCTION 
of the gradually increasing necessity for more physical education 
and recreation properly controlled and administered for the masses. 
4. A more active promotion of physical education and recreational 
programs—more advertising, a greater endeavor to “sell” physical 
education. ‘ 
This brings the problem down again to leadership, to you, for, 
after all, it is a question largely of the right sort of leadership.
-P-A-G-E-31
CHAPTER II. 
LEADERSHIP. 
Ir the business of a college is to develop personality and character 
in addition to equipping an individual with certain kinds of knowl- 
edge, and if the ultimate aim of physical education is a better social 
being, with all that that means in the way of character, physical 
efficiency and personality, then the teachers who are to train girls 
for the realization of those ideals must themselves be endowed with 
these qualities. 
Woman’s Opportunity.—There has probably never been a time in 
the history of the world when the right sort of leaders were as much 
needed as they are now. There certainly has never been a time in the 
history of physical education and recreation when the right sort of 
instructors were as necessary as they are at present. This is espe- 
cially true where physical education for girls and women is con- 
cerned. Whether or not women are going to be able to attain their 
objectives and realize the high ideals which they have set as their 
goal, will depend upon the leadership which they develop and follow 
in the next few years. 
Their task will be no easy one. They will have man-made tradi- 
tions to break and the influence of men’s athletics to counteract. 
Public opinion itself will need to a certain extent to be remolded 
and the prejudice overcome against women as directors and super- 
visors, especially in large systems. 
Woman has not much athletic history or background, but with 
the influence of a sane public on her side, with intelligent men in 
physical education realizing the short-comings of the present con- 
ditions, with the strongest organizations already enlisted in her 
behalf, the outlook for the future of physical education for girls and 
women is much more hopeful and encouraging than that for the men. 
WOMEN AS LEADERS. 
From the very outset, it should be understood that women, 
and only women, should be put in immediate charge of athletics 
3 (33)
-P-A-G-E-32
34 LEADERSHIP 
and other physical activities for girls and that these women must 
be well trained and properly qualified. The ultimate success of 
any scheme of physical education for women also demands that 
they work toward placing the administration as well as the imme- 
diate leadership of all physical activities for girls and women in 
the hands of the same type of women. Women, at least, are 
practically unanimous in their opinion regarding this. The Women’s 
Division of the National Amateur Athletic Federation, the largest 
organization of its kind in the United States, adopted resolutions 
to that effect at a meeting in Washington, in April, 1923. These 
were endorsed by the women at the Annual Meeting of the American 
Physical Education Association in April of the same year, and by 
the representatives of some fifty organizations which have united 
to form a local Federation of the Women’s Division in New York 
City. The Athletic Conference of the American College Women 
at its last annual meeting in April recommended “That only trained 
women physical education directors supervise W. A. A. sports.” 
These organizations represent not only colleges and private schools, 
public schools and normal schools, but girl scouts, camp-fire girls, 
settlement leagues, Young Women’s Christian Associations, girls 
clubs, industrial groups and many others; they represent the feeling 
not only of trained physical educators, but leaders without technical 
training in physical education, and this feeling represents the reac- 
tions not only of trained adult leaders, but of thousands of girls all 
over the United States. i 
The men have naturally set a man’s standards. In physical 
education he is the product of his own experience and training and 
cannot be changed over night. He fails to appreciate the limita- 
tions of girls, anatomical, physiological, emotional and functional. 
Girls will not be frank with men instructors at menstrual time, they 
cannot be, they cannot discuss health problems freely with them. 
Because the majority of women realize these limitations, the types 
of their exercises and their standards and goals should be set by 
women. 
WHAT IS SUCCESSFUL LEADERSHIP? 
The success of any movement depends for the most part upon the 
leaders in that movement; the success of any activity or sport or 
program of sports depends for the most part upon the director, 
the teacher or the “coach,” not only upon her ability, but upon 
her personality, her character and her ideals,
-P-A-G-E-33
  LEADERSHIP 35 
“Success” is a word often used in describing a season of sport. 
It might be well to define “success” as used in this particular con- 
nection. Does it mean that the team or institution has made big 
scores, won championships, broken records? Or, does it mean that 
the whole group has improved in health gained in efficiency, devel- 
oped in character, and is possessed of finer and broader ideals and 
higher standards? In short, does it mean that they are better poten- 
tial citizens and better potential mothers? To have the former 
attitude is to have the attitude of the coach; to have the latter, is 
to have the attitude of the educator. Our present and past physical 
education has fallen down mainly because it has lacked leaders with 
this educational attitude toward physical education. There has been 
too much of the attitude of the professional, and not a professional 
enough attitude toward physical education objectives. A leader 
or an instructor. should never be judged by the number of games her 
teams win, but rather by the type of games her girls play, by the 
way they conduct themselves, by the form they show, by their 
physical condition, by the number who participate, by the number 
who improve and by their happiness and morale and enthusiasm. 
A leader is successful or not according as she has attained the latter 
objectives. Whether or not she is able to attain them, or has the 
vision to realize their value, depends upon her personality, her char- 
acter, her philosophy and her general attitude toward physical 
education and recreation. 
Personality.—Personality is an instructor in physical education 
is a most important consideration. If she is to lead, she must have 
the qualities of leadership, initiative, sense of responsibility, good 
judgment; and also the qualifications which make for “follower- 
ship” among her girls. These include enthusiasm, force without 
aggressiveness, poise, a sense of humor and self-control. So many 
teachers in physical education fail because their personalities are 
negative and colorless, because they are not real teachers or leaders 
—they should be followers. 
Character.— The teacher should have embodied in her the qualities 
of good sportmanship which she is trying to develop in her girls. 
She should at all times be fair, honest, unselfish, broad-minded, trust- 
worthy, coédperative and, above all, patient. She should be high- 
minded and her outlook on life and education should be positive 
and wholesome. 
Physical Appearance.—<As teachers should at all times endeavor 
to be models of the principles they are trying to teach, health, pos- 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
    
36 LEADERSHIP 
ture and carriage of the body are very important. The teacher 
should be an example of correct posture. How often in the course 
of a day have you seen a student straighten up as she saw you 
approaching? She should always dress neatly, modestly, and in 
keeping with the work she is doing. Her dress for teaching should 
be appropriate to the type of activity she is teaching. She should 
never wear conspicuous jewelry while teaching. On the street, or 
“off the floor” her dress and general appearance should again be 
such as to serve as an example for her girls—never ultra or bizarre 
in style. 
Philosophy Toward Physical Education and Recreation.— The 
teacher should know and appreciate the objectives in physical 
education. It is most essential that she believe in extensive partici- 
pation in sports and games, not intensive; that she believe in a pro- 
gram of games and sports which makes possible the participation 
of the whole group, not just the star athletes; that she believe in 
emphasizing the general improvement of the mass rather than the 
specialized training of the few at the expense of the mass or group. 
She should believe in intramural competition as opposed to inter- 
mural, especially for the adolescent girl. She should believe abso- 
lutely that sports and games and all recreational and physical activi- 
ties are but tools, a means to an end and not an end in themselves. 
By proper organization, by informal talks at opportune times, 
by the proper conduct of all the activities she supervises, it will be 
possible for her to establish her standards and create the spirit 
which makes for educational athletics, provided she believes in 
them thoroughly herself. 
The following is a good example of one instructor’s influence. 
The day after an interclass baseball game in a women’s college the 
instructor met the captain of the defeated team and remarked, 
“Well, Mary, it was too bad you lost.” “Yes,” replied the captain, 
“but didn’t we play a good game, and didn’t we have a good time:” 
The instructor smiled. A few days later she remarked to the pitcher 
of the Freshman team which had also lost a game, “What became 
of your team after the game yesterday?” “Oh:” said she, “We 
were so ashamed, we disappeared.” “Why,” said the instructor, 
“Ts that the way to take a defeat?” With a solemn face the pitcher 
answered, “ We weren’t ashamed of losing, but ashamed of the rotten 
game we played.” ‘Those were the very things that that instructor 
had been striving and working for—the spirit, which in defeat 
appreciates good work and has a good time, and the spirit which
-P-A-G-E-35
  
LEADERSHIP 37 
is ashamed, not of defeat, but of the poor quality of play which 
made defeat possible. That is education. 
| The following four planks from the platform of the Women’s 
Division of the National Amateur Athletic Federation still further 
illustrate what her aim should be 
“1, To promote programs of physical activities for all members 
of given social groups rather than for a limited number chosen for 
their physical prowess. 
“2. To protect athletics from exploitation for the enjoyment of 
the spectator or for the athletic reputation or commercial advantage ~ 
of any institution or organization. 
“3. To stress enjoyment of the sport and development of sports- 
manship and to minimize the emphasis placed on individual accom- 
plishment and the winning of championships. 
“4, To eliminate types and systems of competition which put the 
emphasis upon individual accomplishment and winning rather 
than upon stressing the enjoyment of the sport and the develop- 
ment of sportsmanship among the many.” 
General Attitude.—The right sort of a leader will not “play to 
the gallery,” will not work for her own popularity at the expense 
of the policies of the department or organization which she repre- 
sents. She will be actuated by principles and ideals, not selfish 
motives; she will not “play politics” and will not hesitate to stand 
back of her convictions openly and firmly when necessary. She 
should be loyal to the other members of her department or group, 
loyal to the policies of the institution or organization with which 
she is associated. If she does not agree with those principles or 
policies, she should not remain a member of the organization. Her 
attitude toward her students or the girls under her supervision should 
be a friendly and sympathetic one, with no silly sentimentality 
permitted. The adolescent and even postadolescent girl is often 
prone to indulge in “crushes.” Young instructors in physical 
education are more generally the objects of such attention because 
in physical education the relationship between pupil and instructor 
is a more personal one than that in other departments ordinarily. 
Further than that, the adolescent girl is given to “hero worship.” 
She admires intensely the one who can “do things.” So the instruc- 
tor in physical education is often put upon a pedestal and worshipped 
and not always from afar. Many times instructors fail to check 
this attitude partly through vanity, partly through a real desire 
for companionship and partly through a natural diffidence in hand-  
-P-A-G-E-36
38 LEADERSHIP 
ling a personal situation which is somewhat embarrassing to them. 
An instructor who permits such relationship, who fails to check it 
or does not endeavor to turn it into wholesome channels is not a 
wholesome influence and might be a positively harmful one. 
EQUIPMENT. 
1. General Training.—The teacher of physical education should 
be trained for that special profession. Too often it is the case 
that an instructor in the English or Latin or Botany Department 
in an institution is asked to “read up on physical education,” 
to study the rules of a game and then teach it. Colleges and 
teachers’ agencies frequently have requests for instructors who 
can teach academic subjects and physical education. This is in 
itself a pretty fair criterion of the position which physical education 
has occupied in the minds of schoolmen. Physical educators must, 
by their procedure and their results make laymen understand that 
physical education is just as much a profession as medicine or law, 
and that, as such, it requires just as careful preparation. 
Choice of School.—The teacher of physical education should know 
her problems and be prepared to meet them. The usual preparation 
is a two- or three-year course at a normal school of physical educa- 
tion. ‘Normal schools vary as much as colleges do in their standards 
and methods. The wise applicant will choose a school which puts 
the proper amount of emphasis upon play, games, sports, dancing 
and the less formal types of activities, while not neglecting formal 
and individual training. To attend a school which limits itself 
to one type of training, or which emphasizes any one system of 
physical education to the exclusion of the others is but to limit 
the field of knowledge and usefulness of the physical educator 
who attends it. 
The best type of school is one whose aims are educational, not 
commercial; which puts the proper amount of emphasis upon char- 
acter training and building, upon “ professional-mindedness,” 
and not a school which merely turns out good gymnasts and whose 
aim is quantity rather than quality of production. 
A teacher with a college education in addition to her special train- 
ing is better prepared to meet the problems she will have to solve. 
Her broader training gives her a broader view-point, her contact 
with men and women of college rank broadens her horizon and
-P-A-G-E-37
LEADERSHIP 39 
deepens her culture. She has more background, more general 
education and a more educational attitude toward physical educa- 
tion. This cannot but react more favorably where academic depart- 
ments are concerned and the physical educator will become a greater 
power and influence in the educational world as a result. 
2. Practical Training.—The practical training of the teacher of 
physical education should be broad and thorough. While it is not 
necessary or possible for her to be an expert in all branches of activi- 
ties, she should be able to perform well in the events and activities 
she endeavors to teach. On the other hand, a good performer is 
not always a good teacher, and it must not be inferred that a good 
basket-ball player will necessarily make a good instructor in basket- 
ball. That is one great argument against the athletic system of 
the men. Too often a star football player has been secured to coach 
boys’ teams regardless of his teaching ability, his teaching method 
or of his social philosophy. 
It is far better for the future of our physical education that we 
have instructors with mediocre ability, but with high ideals and 
standards, than that we have experts with indifferent standards 
and low or no ideals. 
3. Eaxperience.—The amount of experience in addition to the train- 
ing which an instructor or leader will need, depends entirely upon 
the character of the group she is to work with. A supervisor should 
have had long and varied experience with children; an industrial 
leader should know something about industrial conditions, the type 
of girl she will deal with. her needs and capacities; a college director 
to bring to her work an intelligent understanding of the situations 
should have had a very varied experience including public and 
private schools and college. Only then will she be able to make 
the appeal to her students which is needed. 
The last requisite is “health.”” She should not only be well, but 
look well. The girl or woman who is not possessed of a sound phy- 
sique and good health should not even think of taking up physical 
education as a profession. Not only would she not be able to stand 
up under the hard physical work demanded, but the strain upon the 
nervous system is tremendous. The intellectual and emotional 
demands upon her are even more fatiguing to the one who gives 
herself freely than the actual physical work. 
Finally, too much emphasis cannot be put upon proper “leader- 
ship,” for the whole future and success of the physical education 
program for girls and women depends upon that.
-P-A-G-E-38
  40 LEADERSHIP 
G. Stanley Hall in his new book Youth writes, relative to physical 
education. 
“The world now demands what this country has never had, a 
man who, knowing the human body, gymnastic history, and the 
various great athletic traditions of the past, shall study anew the 
whole motor field, as a few great leaders early in the last century 
tried to do; who shall gather and correlate the literature and experi- 
ences of the past and present with a deep sense of responsibility to 
the future; who shalhexamine martial training with all the inspira- 
tions, warnings and new demands; and who shall know how to 
revive the inspiration of the past animated by the same spirit as 
the Turners, who were almost inflamed by referring back to the 
hardy life of the early Teutons and trying to reproduce its best 
features; who shall catch the spirit of, and make due connections 
with, popular sports past and present, study both industry and edu- 
cation to compensate their debilitating effects, and be himself 
animated by a great ethical and humanistic hope and faith in a better 
future. Such a man, if he ever walks the earth, will be the idol of 
youth, will know their physical secrets, will come almost as a savior 
to the bodies of men, and will, like Jahn, feel his calling and work 
sacred, and his institution a temple in which every physical act will 
be for the sake of the soul.” 
Physical education needs not one, but many such men—many 
ch women. 
Do you, teachers and instructors and physical directors believe 
in the high objectives of physical education as outlined in these 
chapters? Do you believe that the mission of physical education 
is to mold character as much as to develop bodies? To create and 
develop personality as well as strong muscles? Do you believe that 
your work is sacred? If you do not, you have missed your calling 
and it were better for the future good of our girls and women, for 
the future generations, that you abandon it entirely. /

CHAPTER III. 
DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION. 
Tue author has discussed the subject of “Leadership” contrary 
to the ordinary procedure before that of “Organization” or “ Pro- 
gram,” because she feels that.the realization of the objectives in 
physical education is more dependent upon the leader than upon 
the character and content of the program. The leader should not be 
regarded merely as one of the factors in the making of a program, 
but the program should be regarded as the tools with which the leader 
is to work. 
If physical education is going to realize its aims and ideals, these 
tools must be adequate, they must be. sound, they must be up-to- 
date, they must be fitted to the task at hand. The next question, 
then is:( What should be the aims of a program of physical educa- 
tion; what constitutes an adequate program; and what should be 
the outstanding features of a good departmental organization; 
THE GENERAL AIMS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION. 
The results of a questionnaire quoted in a paper read by Miss 
Elizabeth Barrett, official delegate from the University of Chicago 
to the Athletic Conference of American College Women at the annual 
meeting of that body in April, 1924, gave as the purposes of physical 
education departments the following inclusive statements: 
“The aims of the department are the development of organic 
, power, the basis of vitality, the prerequisite to physical and mental 
efficiency; to secure and maintain a harmonious muscular develop- 
ment and a reasonable degree of bodily skill and grace; to provide an 
incentive and an opportunity for every student to secure physical 
recreation as a balance to the sedentary demands of university life; 
to conserve the social and moral values of games and sports; to 
establish high ideals and efficient administration of athletics; to 
develop judgment, leadership, ‘followership’ and a love of recrea- 
41)  
-P-A-G-E-40
42 DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION 
tion; to teach types of recreational activity which will hold over 
after college.” 
The specific aims of the program should be the development among 
girls and women of: : 
Strong, pliant muscles. 
Well poised bodies. 
Sound organs. 
Good neuromuscular control. 
Ability to swim. 
Ability to dance. and an appreciation through it of music, 
sculpture and painting. 
Ability to play certain games. \ 
An active play spirit. 
A love of play and exercise. \ 
10. Definite health habits. 
11. High ideals of living, high standards of conduct. 
No mention has been made in this list of health. personality or 
character, as such, because these should come to an individual in 
proportion as he attains perfection in all or any of the above. Health 
does not come as a result of any one prescription; character is not 
developed through any one agency; nor personality by any one 
contact; but, they are all, as it were, natural products of the whole 
process and scheme.) 
In other words, an institution or an organization through its 
physical educational activities and their administration should seek 
to give a girl an equipment which is above normal, show her how to 
“keep it up;” then teach her how to use that equipment so as to 
obtain the maximum results, how to develop the greatest amount 
of energy with the least expenditure on her part. In addition, she 
should be given an opportunity to learn how to swim, not only for 
health and recreational purposes, but as a safe-guard against 
accident. She should be asked to take an active part in team 
games, again with ulterior motives, for team games make for a 
spirit of codperation and fair play and offer a splendid opportunity 
for social education. She should be urged to learn to play at least 
one individual game for use in later life, when team mates are not 
available, equipment not at hand, or the body has slowed up and 
no longer reacts so quickly. 
With it all, she should be given certain definite, priceless informa- 
tion. She is her own engineer and she must know just how to care Saw Oo Sort
-P-A-G-E-41
  
  DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION 43 
for this delicate machinery which is hers. As a result of all of this, 
if the leadership has been of the right sort, should come better health, 
courage and initiative and a sense of responsibility; a love of the 
beautiful, and rules of conduct for future living. If properly con- 
ducted, out of it all will come an active play spirit and a joy in the 
doing of it. If there is joy and happiness in the doing, and the habit 
is once created, it will persist. 
GENERAL CONTENT OF PROGRAM. 
In order to realize these aims, there must be included in the scheme 
of program and organization, provision for: 
‘1. Adequate Medical and Physical Examinations and Frequent 
Medical Inspections.—The ideal condition would provide for a com- 
plete physical examination annually and frequent medical inspec- 
tions. The most usual procedure in colleges is a complete examina- 
tion on entrance, another at the end of the first year and a final one 
upon graduation. Where this system is in vogue, students should 
have at least a medical inspection each fall, especially before being 
- allowed to participate in any strenuous sports or games. Until 
that inspection has been made, girls appreciably below weight or 
who have had a serious illness during the summer should be excluded 
from strenuous activities of any kind. 
2. A Careful “Follow-up” System Employing Preventive as Well 
as Curative Measures.—The value of prevention as a guarantee 
of health is being recognized as never before; our many sanitary 
codes and laws offer sufficient evidence of that. \More attention to 
exercise, diet, sanitation, dress, fresh air, etc., is being preached and 
advertised as the surest and safest insurance for healtly. 
8. Adequate Play Space—Indoor and Outdoor.—Play and recrea- 
tion for all is becoming the universal cry, athletics and play should 
be organized and administered along lines which make it possible 
for the masses to participate; there should be plenty of intramural 
competition wisely conducted, including games of low organization 
as well as those more highly organized. Play and athletics should 
be so administered that there will be ample opportunity for develop- 
ing student responsibility, leadership, initiative, ete. 
4. Dancing for All.—Including folk, character, “Natural,” and 
social with opportunity for festivals, pageants, dramatic panto- 
mimes.
-P-A-G-E-42
    
44 DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION 
5. Swimming, Diving and Life-saving. 
6. Extra Curricular Activities.—Outing clubs for hiking, skating, 
skiing, riding, week-end parties, a camp or cabin within reasonable 
distance for such purposes—the activities worked out through and 
in coéperation with athletic association. 
7. Provision for the Formation of an Athletic Association, and for 
Utilizing in Every Possible Constructive Way that Association.— 
Making of it an instrument, not simply to carry out the program 
and will of the department, but an organization which is a practical 
training school for future life, an organization which, working in 
conjunction with the department will help to shape the mental, 
moral and physical life of the institution. 
8. Research Work.—An opportunity to use the statistics gained 
by various examinations, to work out correlations, to work out 
problems which present themselves. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT. 
For all of these purposes, regardless of the size of the institution 
or organization, its meagerness or abundance of equipment, the . 
organization of the department of physical education quite naturally 
groups itself under three distinct divisions: 
A. Staff. 
B. Program. 
C. Equipment. 
These subdivide themselves into: 
A. STAFF: 
I. Technical and Executive: 
1. Physical director and medical examiner.

A. The Staff.—If the head of the department is also the medical 
officer, the staff should include the head, any assisting physicians, 
the regular instructors, special instructors and nurses. Associated 
with these under their supervision but not regular members of the 
department, should be included student assistants, captains, mana- 
gers, and heads of sports. If the head of the department is not the 
medical officer, and the medical department is a separate department, 
then the staff of the department of physical education would be com- 
posed of the head or physical director, regular and special instructors 
and assistant instructors, the student representatives associated in 
the same manner, and the department secretary with assistant secre- 
taries or student clerical assistance. This regular staff may be 
supplemented at times by special lecturers in hygiene, biology or 
other subjects pertinent to the work in physical education depend- 
ing entirely upon the type of institution or organization and its 
objectives.

organization where the physical director is not the medical officer.

each other. It brings the students into the organization, not as 
paid assistants, but under the supervision of the department.

attempt to include all of the activities in a department, but merely 
enough to serve as an example. This organization is being used with 
much success at Barnard College, Columbia University, and is 
especially to be noted because each instructor is the head of one or 
more activities. The general schedule and program is worked out 
by the head of the department, after consulting with each head 
of the various activities. That head then discusses her particular 
activity and plans connected with it, with the student head of sport, 
who has previously discussed it with her class managers and has 
already mapped out a tentative scheme for practises, schedules 
for games, ete. Together they outline their more detailed program 
and objectives and refer it back to the head of department and the 
athletic association board. The head of department in consulta- 
tion with her department acts as the departmental clearing house 
and the athletic association board as the student clearing house. 
This prevents friction and conflict of ideals and policies to a very 
great extent, although the success of the scheme depends upon the 
vision and character of the student managers or heads to a great 
degree. It resolves itself into a problem of educating the student 
body. 
Administration Under One Head.—In order to work for unity of 
results and to avoid a duplication of effort and administration of 
these three divisions, they should be under the immediate super- 
vision of the head of the department or the physical director. If 
the head of the department is not a graduate of a medical school, 
or the college physician is not a graduate of a normal school of phys- 
ical education, only absolute team work and mutual agreement 
and approval of policies, principles and methods will make possible 
the realization of the work of the department. Dr. Eugene C. Howe 
in his article Will Instruction in Hygiene and Physical Education 
in the College be made Demonstrably Worth While? which appeared 
in the March, 1924 number of the American Physical Education 
Review, says: 
“A successful program planned for concrete results can grow only 
in an atmosphere of unselfish codperation between the faculty and 
the departments of hygiene and physical education, the medical 
staff and the remainder of the faculty of the college.” 
For the sake of unity of purpose and objectives and for the best 
morale of a department, special instructors in baseball or basket-ball 
or in any one line of sport ought not to be employed by a department

or institution unless she has other duties in the school. An instruc- 
tor should realize that she is but one of a team, a spoke in the 
wheel, and that the activities which she is teaching are but parts of 
a well rounded program and scheme. A leader engaged to instruct 
in but one activity is apt to fail to grasp the whole, to get an exag- 
gerated idea of the importance of her one activity and to fail to see 
it in its proper relation to the other activities. 
The following guiding principles ought to insure a safe method of 
selection of instructors: 
1. All members of the physical education staff should be selected 
in the same manner as the other members of the teaching staff in 
the institution. 
2. They should have the same permanence of appointment as 
other members of the faculty. 
3. They should be in residence throughout the year. 
4. They should be paid by the institution at the same rate as the 
other members of the faculty. 
5. They should be engaged in teaching regularly in the department 
or in some other department in the institution. 
The qualifications of the staff as to personality, character, ideals, 
ability, training and experience, have already been dealt with, but 
it cannot be emphasized too often that all members of the staff 
should be women and only women of the highest character. They 
should be keen and alert, interested in all phases of physical educa- 
tion and education. They should regard their profession as social 
service, and themselves as public servants. They should never 
look upon their education as completed, but by studying, by read- 
ing, by associating themselves with organizations and committees, 
by working on problems, by attending lectures, meetings and con- 
ventions, endeavor through themselves to raise physical education 
to the ranks of a real profession and make it the positive force for 
good which it ought to be. 
Objectives to work for in putting the department on a sound 
academic basis: 
I. Required physical education for four years, including: 
1. A course in hygiene. 
2. A course in biology. 
3. A certain motor proficiency. 
4. A certain proficiency in swimming. 
5. A certain proficiency in games.  
-P-A-G-E-49
  DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION 51 
II. Credits in physical education to count as college credit toward 
a degree or diploma, those credits to be a part of the total require- 
ment for a degree, 7. ¢., not 120 academic credits plus 6 in physical 
education, but 126 credits. 
III. Academic recognition of the teaching staff in physical educa- 
tion, on the same salary basis and with the same academic standing 
as the rest of the faculty. All regular instructors members of the 
faculty. 
IV. The same grading used for physical education as for academic 
work. 
VY. “F” or poor grading in physical education to affect academic 
honors and scholarship. just as an “F’”’ in academic subjects does. 
Only educational procedures on the part of physical educators 
and instructors will ever bring this about.

  CHAPTER IV. 
DEPARTMENTAL OFFICE ROUTINE AND REGULATIONS. 
Secretary.—In a large department or institution a clerk or secre- 
tary with assistance as needed is an absolute necessity, in order 
that the regular staff may be free from the petty routine and detail 
of clerical work coincident with all large institutions or organiza- 
tions. A secretary or clerk, with professional training will also 
develop an office routine which will make the keeping of records 
and filing much more accurate and systematic. A secretary’s duties 
may include: Records, files, statistics, reports, notices, correspond- 
ence, assigning lockers and giving out keys, assigning swimming 
numbers. 
The filing system for records, physical examinations, excuses, 
statistics and correspondence should be so well worked out that the 
correct information and data may be made instantly available. 
Records for daily attendance, excuses, etc., should be accurately 
kept and carefully filed. Too often this is done in such a “slip- 
shod” careless manner that when there is a dispute over a record 
the evidence is so inaccurately kept that it cannot be relied upon, 
and the student wins her point “by default.” The record system 
should be as infallible as is humanly possible. Charts 3 and 4 furnish 
two samples of record sheets used by colleges. There is a sheet 
for each student, and these are filed alphabetically in temporary 
bindings. At the end of the week or at certain intervals each 
instructor transfers to this sheet her attendance record for each 
student. The secretary transfers the excuses and reports for sub- 
stitute work, including menstrual excuses and cuts. Symbols are 
used to indicate each variety of activity. Barnard College includes 
on the margin, the term grade, and any necessary individual infor- 
mation. This forms a complete record at any time, including the 
menstrual record and the health record as far as absences and 
excuses are concerned. The activities at the bottom are checked to 
indicate whether or not a girl is physically fit to participate. It 
includes her health grade and physical efficiency scores.

The routine rules and regulations should be such as will tend to 
emphasize the positive side of health and make the student feel 
that illness is generally lack of responsibility on her part in some 
form and as such should be penalized. Therefore frequent or con- 
tinued absence on account of illness should be penalized and not 
excused. The following suggestions are made relative to cuts and 
excuses: 
Menstrual Period.—In case of severe cramp and discomfort, sub- 
stitute rest, preferably in the rest room supplied for student rest 
1 Smith College, Department of Hygiene and Physical Education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  
  DEPARTMENTAL OFFICE ROUTINE AND REGULATIONS 55 
periods; otherwise report to the remedial room for mat work and 
light exercise during the first two or three days of the period. After 
that (depending on the length of the period and the type of activity), 
report for the regular activity. Swimming, of course, for obvious 
reasons, should not be attended during the period. 
Illness.—All girls unable for minor physical reasons to participate 
in regular activities, should report to the remedial room. Girls too 
ill to report should report to the medical office, a report of such illness 
to be sent to the office of the department of physical education. All 
illnesses requiring absence from college or school should be excused 
by the medical office and reported to the office of the department. 
Cuts.—A few “cuts” should be allowed, but no cuts or absences 
should be allowed to be made up. The principle is wrong, girls 
have been known to make up a month’s absence in a week. The 
principle is just as wrong as allowing an invalid to eat several meals 
in quick succession in order to make up for one missed. If the 
“make-up” is in the nature of a punishment or penalty, let the 
“grade” indicate that. Insist on a “cut slip” being filed, giving 
the reason. Often it is a good one and unavoidable. 
Grades.—Monthly or term grades in physical activities are always 
somewhat of a problem, as the feeling is general that ability alone 
should not be considered. The majority of institutions take into 
consideration: (1) ability; (2) improvement; (3) effort and spirit, 
and (4) posture. 
The final grade can then be lowered by the attendance record, a 
certain number of absences automatically lowering a grade a certain 
per cent or letter. For example: in a school where the grading is 
done by the letters A, B, C, D, F, four cuts per term are allowed. 
After that the final grade is automatically lowered one letter for 
every two cuts. This may be still further influenced by a great 
many excused absences. These cases are treated individually. 
An “F” may be due to poor work, failure to improve or to try to 
improve, or to too many absences even though excused by the 
medical office. An “incomplete” may be received for poor work or 
for too many “excused” absences. 
Penalties.—The penalty for an “F” in physical education is 
another problem for departments. The majority of failures are due 
to absences, and yet the principle of the “make-up” seems to the 
author to be wrong. If we are to maintain our standards there 
should be a penalty. Barnard College has obtained fairly good results 
by requiring the girl to wait until her junior or senior year, when
-P-A-G-E-54
    56 DEPARTMENTAL OFFICE ROUTINE AND REGULATIONS 
she would be normally electing her type of activity, and require 
her to take regular gymnasium work for one term at that time, not 
with the intention of using the gymnasium work as a punishment, 
but because in classes in gymnastics, the work is a little more closely 
supervised and the routine a little more formal. Because the girl 
naturally prefers to elect her activity, and because, by this time, 
she is generally interested in some particular activity, this generally 
has a wholesome effect. Instead of taking her required two hours 
per week in her special activity, she takes it in a class in gymnastics. 
If she wishes the other in addition, she may take it without credit. 
An “incomplete” is generally given as a warning, the student 
must do creditable work the following term in order to remove it, 
and have a good attendance record. If she does not remove it, it 
automatically becomes an “F.” 
EXTRA CURRICULUM ACTIVITIES. 
It is commonly agreed that some students spend too much time 
and energy on “extra curriculum activities’ —including not only 
sports and games, but plays, committees, publications, etc. In 
addition, it is known that invariably the same students engage in 
these activities, not only to the detriment of academic work, but 
of health as well. Some sort of an effective “O.K.” and follow-up 
system, which will tend not only to scatter more widely these various 
responsibilities, but will in addition prevent poor physical specimens 
from assuming responsibilities beyond their strength, is a worth- 
while and wise procedure. In a small institution such a precaution 
is not as necessary as in a large one. The following system (Chart 
5), as used by Barnard College for several years has not only tended 
to prevent the same girls from assuming too many responsibilities, 
but has prevented many break-downs, by making it impossible for 
a student to accept a big responsibility until she has gotten in the 
proper condition to do so. Before a cast for a play can be chosen, 
a list of names for offices agreed upon, an athletic squad chosen, or 
any “job” of any kind accepted by a girl, the list must be written 
out and O.K.’d by the academic authorities, the Department of 
Physical Education and the Medical Department. Even with these 
precautions, the more responsible students have felt that girls 
were still undertaking too much. They felt that girls often concealed 
their real condition from the physician and the physical director, 
and so, on their own initiative, through student government, they
-P-A-G-E-55
DEPARTMENTAL OFFICE ROUTINE AND REGULATIONS 57 
adopted last year a scheme for further censorship. In addition 
to the three O.K.’s listed above, the student must be voted upon 
by a committee from her own class, after it has thoroughly investi- 
gated the student. This presents a piece of constructive social- 
mindedness on the part of students rarely seen. Copies of these 
O.K. slips are filed in the office of the director, and notes of the 
various offices and responsibilities are made on the student’s attend- 
ance sheet so that the director or the instructor can at any time 
find out at a moment’s notice just what extra curricular work the 
student is carrying. This means much extra work and additionl 
detail, but the department and the students and the administra- 
tion all feel that the results justify it.

The following general suggestions connected with general routine 
may be of service: 
1. Have printed booklets or announcements ready to hand out 
to new students at the opening of college, containing all rules and  
-P-A-G-E-56
  
  58 DEPARTMENTAL OFFICE ROUTINE AND REGULATIONS

penalties for F’s and incompletes, general information. This may 
be combined with an A.A. hand-book and certain special A.A. rules 
and regulations, outline of program for the year, conditions for 
playing on teams, etc. 
2. Keep a calendar of opening duties. with approximate dates 
for performing each. 
3. Keep on file an annual calendar, containing dates for all 
games, meets. and events of any kind. These are valuable to refer 
to. 
4. Request from instructors an annual report of her special 
activities with suggestions and recommendations. 
5. The instructor should request the same from the various stu- 
dent managers associated with her.
-P-A-G-E-57
  CHAPTER V. 
PROGRAM. 
Tue program, or “ B,” in any departmental organization quite 
naturally falls into three main divisions as the author sees it, 
although there will always be some over-lapping and duplication: 
I. Practical Health Service. 
Il. Informational Hygiene. 
Ill. Physical Activities. 
Dr. T. A. Storey of the College of the City of New York uses 
practically the same scheme.! 
“The plan of organization for the program and the methods by 
which it is put into effect are of far more importance than the activi- 
ties offered. This carries back again to an earlier statement that the 
program is the tool with which the leader works, and is, to a certain 
extent, a reflection of that leader. A program is not just a question 
of a selection of the proper ‘system,’ it is not a decision between 
formal and ‘Natural’ gymnastics; it is a question of results and 
objectives and what is going to realize them. A little country school 
teacher with little technical knowledge and with almost no equip- 
ment, but with ideals and vision plus personality, may come nearer 
to reaching the desired goal than the physical educator in a big 
college with an elaborate equipment. The author is reminded of the 
story of three laborers working on a beautiful cathedral. When 
questioned as to what they were doing, the first replied, ‘I’m wait- 
ing for the 5 o’clock whistle.’ The second replied, ‘I’m earning 
$7.00 a day; and the third replied, ‘I am building a wonderful 
cathedral.’ The world is full of workers with their eyes on the clock 
and their minds on their pay checks. Too few of them realize that 
they are ‘building a wonderful cathedral.’ ” 
To repeat, the program should be based upon sound educational 
psychology as well as upon sound physiological, anatomical and bio- 
logical principles. It should be based upon the needs of the girl and 
the woman. It should be governed by the fact that every girl is a 
potential mother, that every girl is a future citizen. It should be

most carefully organized not only from the point of view of the 
physical activities to be offered and the many problems involved in 
their conduct, but with a health service in the form of physical 
examinations, follow-up systems, and information so intelligently 
planned and sympathetically administered as to enlist the interest 
of even the most blasé little flapper. Such a task is not an easy one 
and requires not only knowledge and skill. but real ingenuity. 
The first main topic under “Program,” that of “health service,” 
may be further elaborated as follows: 
I. Practical Health Service Involves: 
1. Puygtca EXAMINATIONS: 
(a) Medical: 
1. By physicians. 
2. By nurses. 
3. Outside specialists. 
(b) Orthopedic: 
1. By physicians. 
2. By physical director. 
3. By specially trained instructor. 
(ec) Anthropometric: 
1. By physical director. 
2. By selected members of physical education 
staff. 
2. ADVICE: 
(a) From physicians. 
(b) From physical director. 
(c) From staff later. 
3. TREATMENT: 
(a) By physicians. 
(b) By nurses. 
(ec) By physical director. 
(d) By special members of staff. 
(e) By outside specialists. 
(f) By clinics and hospitals. 
4. Fottow-up Work: 
(a) By physician. 
(b) By nurse. 
(c) By physical director. 
(d) By staff. 
1. Physical Examinations.—Physical examinations should always 
be made thoughtfully and intelligently, and not automatically; they
-P-A-G-E-59
  
  PROGRAM 61 
should be taken in a dignified manner and in a cheerful environment, 
if possible. Too often the examiner shows how bored she really is, 
is indifferent, careless and impatient. The girl or woman who was 
already nervous and timid when she entered the examiner’s presence, 
becomes more so, and the opportunity to establish a confidential 
relationship and glean some really valuable information is lost. 
Examinations should be made with a view to discovering defects and 
weaknesses, and by means of medicines, treatments, advice and exer- 
cise (special and general) endeavoring to eliminate all defects. They 
should not be treated as so much necessary routine with so many more 
statistics to file away and forget. Whether or not the medical depart- 
ment makes the triple examination as outlined above under No. 1, 
depends upon whether or not the physical director is also the 
examining physician. If she is, the complete examination can be 
made by her and her staff composed of assistant physicians and 
nurses who may be permanent members of the staff or who may 
have been called in temporarily during the rush of examinations 
incident to the opening of college, assisted by qualified and trained 
members of the teaching staff. The procedure in the examinations 
depends entirely upon the size of the institution, the number to be 
examined, the arrangement for time, etc. It facilitates matters 
greatly and prevents delay in starting the regular schedule if the 
bulk of the examinations can be made before the opening of the 
college or institution. 
(a) The Medical Examination.—The complexity of the medical 
examination may vary according to the facilities, equipment, intel- 
ligence and vision of the physical director or medical advisor. The 
minimum examination should consist of a heart and lung examina- 
tion given by a responsible physician. Where such an examination 
is not possible, the amount and kind of exercise should be curtailed. 
Of course, such a minimum is far from satisfactory and merely 
represents the margin beyond which it is not safe to go. It is too 
often the case that, where more detailed examinations are given, 
the results represent just so many figures filed away. No intelligent 
study is made. of them, no effort is made to relate them to the 
individual, and, as a result, to relate the individual to the proper 
type of activity. As a rule it is wise to spend time in taking only 
those measurements and tests which it is going to be possible to 
study and use. On the other hand, it is true that just the making 
of the examination, the personal contact it furnishes with the student, 
the opportunity it offers to give advice at the time has a very posi-
-P-A-G-E-60
  62 PROGRAM 
tive value. Also these statistics when intelligently used may form 
the basis for many interesting studies and pieces of research work 
later on. An adequate medical examination should include: 
I. The examining or testing of: 
1. Teeth. 9. Blood-pressure. 
2. Nose. 10. Circulation. 
3. Throat. 11. Hemoglobin. 
4. Eyes. 12. Heart. 
5. Ears. 13. Lungs. 
6. Glands. 14. Kidneys. 
7. Joints. 15. Reflexes. 
8. Skin. 
II. A frank discussion of condition of the bowels and daily habits 
relating to them. 
III. A frank discussion of the menstrual period as to pain, interval, 
length and amount of flow. 
IV. A discussion of habits of sleep, exercise, bathing and diet. 
The medical card should include space for this information. Chart 
6 is a sample of the medical examinations given in an eastern col- 
leges for women. 
A separate card (unless the medical card is large enough) should 
contain the clinical or health history of the girl, and space for 
answers to such questions as will serve to furnish a background for 
the girl, her health habits, habits of daily living and her past health 
history. Chart 7 and 8 are samples of such a card. 
Chart 9 furnishes a good idea of the type of health examination 
given by a Young Women’s Christian Association. 
(b) Orthopedic Examination.—This examination may be made 
by the medical examiner at the same time and as a part of the 
medical examination. This depends upon the training and experi- 
ence of the medical officer along that line. It is best made by the 
member of the staff best qualified, and should consist of: 
I. Generat Inspection To ASCERTAIN: 
(a) Posture, real and assumed. 
(b) Position of feet. 
(c) Position of knees. 
(d) General contour of body. 
(e) Musculature. 
(f) General flexibility. 
(g) Type of structure.
-P-A-G-E-61
PROGRAM 63 
Il. Specrat INsPEcTION oF: 
(a) Back. (f) Chest. 
(b) Shoulders. (g) Abdomen. 
(c) Spine. (h) Knees. 
(d) Scapulee. (i) Feet. 
(e) Hips. 
With a view to discovering definite postural defects, definite 
foot defects, curvatures, bad body mechanics and lack of muscle 
tone. Some of the points to be especially noted are: 
1. Back.—Is it round, hollow or flat; is it strong or weak or a 
combination of these, or flat and strong? 
2. Shoulders.—Are they even and normal? Or, are they uneven, 
forward, or high and rigid? 
3. Spine.—Is it curved, rotated, straight, flexible? 
4. Scapule.—Flat or prominent? 
5. Hips.—Even or uneven? ‘Tilted, or proper angle? 
6. Chest.—Broad, flat, depressed, narrow, round, flexible, elastic, 
rigid? 
7. Abdomen.—Protruding, flabby or firm? 
8. Knees.—Knock-kneed, bowed or straight? 
9. Feet.—Pronated, everted, arches flat, weak or strong and 
efficient looking with weight in correct place? 
An experienced examiner will know whether these defects are 
functional or organic, whether they are the result of faulty habits 
or due to defects in structure and organism. Such knowledge is 
necessary in order to prescribe intelligently. Her findings should 
largely correlate with the results of the anthropometric examination. 
The examiner can be further assisted at this time by the use of 
the schematograph and foot-o-print machines. 
The Schematograph is a simple camera-like instrument which does not 
take a picture, but which reflects on to a sheet of transparent paper the 
outline of the student. This outline is quickly sketched by the instructor 
and is an accurate reproduction of the posture in profile. It is a simple 
way of securing a student’s interest, and is far more effective than verbal 
descriptions or arguments. The instrument may be obtained through the 
American Posture League office at 1 Madison Avenue, New York City. 
Mr. Norman Fradd and Mr. M. C. Reed of the Eastman Kodak Company 
have been experimenting with a kodak for this purpose and have succeeded 
in developing a method which produces a very satisfactory silhouette. A 
special camera was obtained from the Robey French Company of Boston, 
called a “Silhouetteograph.” Recently the Eastman Kodak Company, 
of Rochester has been attempting to adapt a camera that will be more 
satisfactory for use in the examining room. The routine expense involved 
is about 4 cent for each exposure. Smith College is using this method and 
finds the results very satisfactory.

Remarks 
The Foot-o-Print is a large flat pad, mounted in a frame, similar to the 
ink pads used in connection with rubber stamps. It is inked and covered 
with a movable sheet of rubber. For use, a piece of paper is inserted under 
the rubber and the student in bare foot stands upon this. The result is an  
-P-A-G-E-70
  72 PROGRAM 
impression on the paper where any part of the sole of the foot touches the 
paper. This device is made by the Foot-o-Print Company, in Chicago, 
Illinois. The same results can be obtained although it will not be permanent 
and cannot be filed for future reference by having the student wet the sole 
of her bare foot and stand on a sheet of paper. 
Another piece of apparatus being experimented with at present by some 
colleges and normal schools, is the Angleometer. Miss Helen McKinstry 
of the Central School of Physical Education, New York City, is responsible 
for this instrument which is made by the Marine Compass Company. It is 
metal and compass-like in shape, and is designed to measure in degrees the 
size of the angle at the base of the sternum and between the ribs. The 
theory back of the procedure is an interesting one and is being tried out 
in the hope of proving that individuals with larger angles and larger degrees 
of increase in size of angle upon inhalation, have more initiative, ability, 
courage and greater powers of leadership. They are the people who “do 
things in the world.”’ This has yet to be verified. 
(ec) Anthropometric Examination.—Of all the examinations taken, 
this examination is probably of most interest to the girl because 
here she has an opportunity to see results in actual figures, and that 
is one reason for taking it. These figures are never absolutely accu- 
rate so far as girths, breadths and depths are concerned, because no 
two examiners ever place the tapes or calipers at exactly the same 
angle or spot, nor does the same examiner ever repeat an examination 
inexactly thesamemanner. However. the results are accurate enough 
for intelligent deductions and they furnish a means of enlisting the 
interest of the girl, which is a big item. They also furnish important 
data as to muscle tone, relative strength and weakness and type 
of breathing. Since these results are in actual figures, it is possible 
to work out “norms” in each measurement. Each college or settle- 
ment or high school or scout troup may thus have its “norm” for 
lung capacity, grip, chest expansion, etc. Each class in a school 
may have its “norm.” This furnishes a wonderful incentive for 
improvement for it makes a game of the whole situation. A girl 
becomes interested not so much in improving her condition as in 
increasing her individual measurements or score. Incidentally, she 
is improving what lies back of the figures, but she does not realize 
that. All that interests her is that “Mary,” in her class, has a 
higher lung capacity and a stronger grip than she has, and the idea 
of beating Mary appeals to her competitive instinct. So she asks 
her teacher how she can increase her lung capacity, and soon she is 
playing games, taking hikes and learning to swim, and the lung 
capacity has become incidental. This opens a big field of interest, 
for, by using the competitive instinct in a healthy way, by gathering
-P-A-G-E-71
  
  PROGRAM 73 
statistics, and tabulating them, it becomes possible to establish a 
sectional “norm” or a national “norm” for girl scouts, for camp- 
fire girls, for seniors in high school, for freshman in college, which 
may furnish a wonderful incentive for improvement, and raise the 
physical standard of girls all over the country. 
This is exactly what is happening at present as is evidenced by 
the increasing number of physical efficiency tests, motor ability and 
proficiency tests, and achivement tests which are being advanced 
and advocated by various individuals and institutions and organ- 
izations. This subject is so big and so interesting that it will be dealt 
with at length in a later chapter. 
The ordinary anthropometric examination should include the 
following measurements and tests: 
1. Weight. 
2. Height. 
3. Height, sitting. 
4. Girths:

PROGRAM 77 
Chart 11 shows a type of anthropometric examination used by a 
professional school of physical education; Chart 12, one used by a 
health foundation. In this a point system is used. Chart 13 is a 
rather typical college examination; Chart 14 is used by a health 
foundation and combines an orthopedic and anthropometric exami- 
nation. Charts 15 and 16 show the results of the triple examination 
on one card. 
The important thing about an examination is not the amount of 
data and statistics which the examiner accumulates, but the use to 
which she puts these results. Are they used? Are they made the 
basis for assigning the girl to the type of activity which will interest 
and benefit her, for giving her information and advice which the 
records show she needs? 
One Type of. Procedure.—In one eastern college where the head of 
the department is not a physician, the following routine has been 
followed for several years with great success. The student fills out 
her “history blank.” With that, she reports in examining robe to 
the instructor in charge of the measuring room where her height, 
weight and anthropometric tests are made. With this information, 
she goes directly to the medical office, through communicating 
doors. The examining physician, her assistant doctor and nurse 
make a complete medical examination. If further examination 
is needed requiring outside equipment, she is furnished with neces- 
sary information, addresses, etc. Special advice for her special 
case is given her at this time. Furnished with all of this data, she 
reports to the office of the physical director. The physical director 
makes the orthopedic examination goes over all of the student’s 
measurements and medical data and history card. After checking 
up on this and any further information which the interview may 
have furnished, the student is told what her defects are, in what 
respects she is below normal, is advised as to the correct line of 
procedure to follow, is given copies of specific exercises and is told 
to report for regular or modified work, depending upon her condi- 
tion. Posture and feet are especially noted at this time—schema- 
tographs of the former, foot-o-prints of the latter are taken. She 
is at this time given a health rating—“A,” “B,” “C,” or “D,” 
and a posture and foot-rating using the same letters. The-health- 
rating has the following significance, and serves as an intelligent 
means of classifying students: 
“A.” —O.K. for all physical activities.
-P-A-G-E-76
  78 PROGRAM 
  “B.”—Work restricted and modified for organic or functional 
reasons. Must consult doctor and physical director before register- 
ing for any sport. No strenuous activity.

“C.”—All work prescribed, may be assigned to a class for medical 
or individual corrective work. No strenuous activity allowed. 
“DD.” —All substitute work (prescribed). May be walking or rest- 
ing or some outside activity. 
(Nobody is given an absolute excuse from work in physical 
education). 
Further pertinent information is later given the student in hygiene 
lectures. The director within a day or two after the examination 
studies each blank again, and, as a result, assigns each student to 
the type of work and the special class which her individual case calls 
for. If there are no marked defects, she is assigned to regular class 
work. This may be a combination of gymnastics and sports or 
dancing or just sports or dancing, depending upon the student’s 
academic classification and previous training. Cases of poor body 
mechanics, constipation, dysmenorrhea, defective hearts. etc., are 
assigned to special small remedial classes for more individual 
attention. Gymnastics of this type are sometimes called “Medical” 
and again “Individual,” so that no odium may be attached to 
being thus classified. Curvature cases and extreme cases of mal- 
posture and poor feet, dysmenorrhea, constipation, etc., are assigned 
to the corrective instructor for special individual attention and 
treatment. These latter cases are given more detailed exami- 
nations by the instructor in charge of the corrective work and special 
prescription cards are made for them. 
This detailed description of the work in this special college has 
been given because it represents the tendency in many colleges at 
present and may serve as a model and incentive for institutions 
where such has not been the procedure. It may also by reason of 
its contrast to the superficial mass examinations given in the major- 
ity of public schools, serve to stimulate those in authority to set 
machinery in motion to provide better and greater facilities for 
examinations and follow-up work. 
To allow adolescent girls to participate in any type of strenuous 
physical activity without at Ieast a heart and lung examination, 
is nothing less than criminal. The percentage of heart cases at 
Barnard College has jumped from 2 per cent to 17 per cent of the 
entering classes in the past four years. This may be due to over 
participation in athletics in secondary schools, to lack of proper 
examinations and supervision there, and it may be traceable to 
the results of the “flu” epidemic. At any rate, it only furnishes 
another strong argument in favor of periodic health examinations 
and a closer supervision of the activities of the growing girl.

PROGRAM 83 
A recent “heart and lung examination” of some 900 girls in a 
high school in a large eastern city, coincident with a field-day 
celebration held in the spring, brought to light a number of heart 
cases. Yet, these girls had been taking part in regular physical 
activities all year and probably would have continued to do so had 
not the physical director in that high school insisted on this special 
examination. This is but one instance of many, which fact shows 
that there is an appaling ignorance or indifference on the part of 
school authorities and parents to a serious danger. 
On the other hand, most encouraging is the tendency represented 
by Chart 17, a standard medical certificate adopted last winter by 
the National Camp Directors’ Association for use in girls’ camps. 
The conscientious use of this will at least tend to decrease the number 
of girls annually over-exerting themselves at summer camps, who 
were not aware of their defects or whose weaknesses were not known 
to the camp director. 4

The “New York Workshop Group” which is the local Federation 
of the Women’s Division of the National Amateur Athletic Federa- 
tion recently adopted the following among other resolutions: 
Physical Examination.—‘‘Whereas medical supervision is an 
essential part of any properly conducted program of sports and 
games we recommend, as a means for building and safe-guarding 
health, adequate medical examinations and medical follow-up 
advice for all girls and women as a basis for their participation in 
physical activities. Such examinations should be made by a 
physician and should include as an absolute minimum an examina- 
tion of heart and lungs.” 
In as much as this group represents about 75 different organiza- 
tions in and around New York City, including public and private 
schools, colleges, normal schools, Y. W. C. A.’s, Y. W. H. A.’s, girls’ 
clubs, girl scouts, camp-fire girls, settlements, industrial groups, 
etc., its influence is bound to be wide-spread and effective. 
In addition to a feeling of relief that it is over, what is the girl 
or woman to carry away from her physical examination? Is she 
going to remember the advice, is she going out with a determination 
to overcome those defects and weaknesses, or is she going to try 
to forget it all as soon as possible? The answer lies in the ingenuity 
and wisdom of the department in the follow-up system.

THE USE OF STATISTICS. 
The statistics from the various examinations tabulated and used 
in the right way may also take on a competitive aspect and increase 
the interest in a class, college or organization. The statistics of 
the entering class, taken in the fall, may be published in the college 
paper, read to the class in hygiene or to the regular gymnastic classes, 
or posted. They may be compared with those of the class before, 
the attention of the class called to items in which it is stronger or 
weaker than the preceding class for instance: 
The Mythical Freshman.

Average lung capacity . . 178.40 cu. in. 186.32 cu. in. 
Average grip. © 2 wr 4 98 Tbs, 49.33 Ibs. 
By ‘comparing the results of the examinations in the fall with 
those taken in the spring of the same class. or at the next examina- 
tion, some idea as to the progress of the class as a whole may be made. 
These latter figures may serve as a judgment to a certain extent of 
the effectiveness and value of the work of the department of physical 
education. A general falling off in all results might indicate a need 
for different methods, or a lack of something somewhere. An intel- 
ligent study of these statistics may furnish much valuable food for 
thought. The following figures will serve to illustrate the point: 
A girl may not take very seriously the information that her posture 
is poor, or her lung capacity below normal, but, when she hears that 
only 21 per cent of her class has a posture grade of “A” and in last 
years class 35 per cent had an “A” grade, she begins to feel a sense 
of responsibility, a “team feeling.” If she knows that the normal 
lung capacity for a freshman is 170 cubic inches and hers is only 
155 cubic inches, she begins to wonder why she is below normal.

A detailed study of all information gained from the triple physical 
examination should result in the following: 
1. A general health grade, either a letter or a figure which the girl 
will understand. 
2. A posture grade. 
3. A foot grade. 
4. A report card containing some significant facts. 
5. An assignment to the type of activity calculated to fit her 
particular case: 
(a) Regular gymnastics and regular sports and games. 
(b) Remedial or individual gymnastics. 
(ce) Corrective gymnastics. 
(d) A combination of a and b, or 
(e) A combination of b and e. 
(f) Substitute work. 
ADVICE AND FOLLOW-UP WORK. 
The advice and follow-up work should proceed in natural routine, 
and should be made a part of each activity the girl is assigned to. 
Each instructor with whom the girl comes in contact should know 
the conditions of the “case” and work as a member of a team in

helping the girl to overcome her defects. Special treatment should 
be given only by physicians, nurses and members of the regular 
staff who are especially trained for such purposes. It may take 
the form of: 
1. Medicine. 
2. Surgery. 
3. Osteopathy. 
4. Exercise. 
(a) Remedial 
(b) Corrective 
5. Applied hygiene, bathing, diet, dress. 
6. Related treatments. 
(a) Physiotherapy. 
(b) Hydrotherapy. 
(c) Electrotherapy. 
Most institutions give only emergency treatments, except to 
resident students and refer all other cases to home physicians, 
dentists, oculists, clinics, hospitals, ete. 
The follow-up system should include a frequent checking up of 
the above treatments, by means of reports, interviews, reéxamina- 
tions and tests. As the girl shows improvement, she should be 
advanced from corrective to remedial work or from remedial to 
regular work; her health grade should be changed as her condition 
changes, also her posture, and foot grades. All of this changing 
data should be kept on a card designed for that purpose in the 
medical office or the physical director’s office or in both offices. 
Such a card may be called a “Treatment Card” or a “Consultation 
Card.”’ It need contain only spaces for the students name, address, 
class and any pertinent data deemed necessary. The remainder 
of the card should then be ruled in spaces large enough to admit of 
date and the results of each interview. This, when kept up-to-date, 
forms a complete record of the case, and is easy to refer to when 
ever the student enters the office. \ active and passive. 
HEIGHT-WEIGHT-AGE RATIO. 
The question of the height-weight-age ratio as being indicative 
of the physical condition of the individual has been receiving more 
and more attention in the past few years. Too much importance 
is being attached to overweight and underweight in the adult, 
especially as judged from the insurance tables. These tables, while

and with small bones. Should their weight be identical? Obviously 
not. Miss Katherine Sibley, Head of Department of Physical 
Education for Women at Syracuse University has been doing some 
interesting research work along this line during the past few years. 
While her statistics are not complete, her results to date are worth 
publishing. Her division into slender, medium and stocky is made 
on the basis of the breadth of shoulders. Having placed an indi- 
vidual in one of the three classes, her correct weight for height and 
age can easily be ascertained from these tables. (Chart 26) 
The height-weight tables cannot always detect “under-nourish- 
ment” or “malnutrition.” If a child is underweight according to 
the tables, she is not necessarily suffering from either of the above. 
After all, only a qualified physician is able to decide as to whether 
a girl is poorly nourished or not. 
Chart 27 published by the Department of the Interior, Bureau 
of Education, Washington, is the most accurate available for 
girls. The class-room weight record (Chart 28) hung in the school 
room, or at the camp or in the club room, will help to keep the girl 
interested in her problem, and should serve as an incentive in keeping 
“in training” and living up to all health rules and regulations. 
How to Usr Turse Tastes. 
1. Take the Height First.—Nail an accurate measure on the 
wall. Two yardsticks, a new tape measure, or a drawn scale will 
serve. Let the child stand, without shoes, flat against the wall, 
with heels, shoulders, and head touching the wall, and place a right- 
angled piece of wood (a chalk box will answer) firmly over his head 
and against the measuring scale. 
2. What is the Child’s Age?—Take the nearest birthday. 
3. Then Consult the Chart for the Proper Weight for this Child’s 
Age and Height.—First find the height in the left column and follow 
across the chart to the appropriate age column. The figure so found 
is what this child should weigh. 
4. Now Weigh the Child.—Have the child, in indoor clothing 
but without shoes, stand in the center of the scale platform. Teach 
the child to weigh himself, but in the monthly weighings the teacher 
should do the weighing. 
5. Neat, the Record.—Enter the weight on the class-room weight 
record. State the monthly weight on the monthly report card.
-P-A-G-E-95
  
  PROGRAM 97 
Use one record for each section of the class and pass on with the 
section when promoted. 
6. Since this Chart is Chiefly for its Educational Value, the Health 
Lesson is the Most Important Part of the Procedure.—Emphasize 
the need of weight gains each month. Study foods and their rela- 
tion to growth. Study health habits and their effect upon the 
weight curve. 
These new weight-height-age tables are a revision, by Bird T. 
Baldwin and Thomas D. Wood, of the Wood tables formerly used. 
The figures represent a large group of presumably healthy children, 
most of whom are native born. These figures are believed to be 
the most accurate available.

    CHAPTER VI. 
INFORMATIONAL HYGIENE. 
How ro Kemp Sick. 
By Dr. Frank Crane. 
“Dr. C. F. Wetche has published an interesting little pamphlet on how 
to get sick, how to keep sick and how to make others sick. 
“This is welcome information and fills a long-felt want. 
“Among other suggestions made by Dr. Wetche, I note that the leading 
one is ‘Think Sickness.’ That is, if you want to have any particular dis- 
ease, concentrate your mind upon it. There are times when a disease is 
very handy. When you want to dominate your husband it is often very 
effective to use the tyranny of tears: If you have worked up a lather of 
self-pity and want your wife’s sympathy, it will be much easier to get it 
if you can come home, fall'limp into a chair and roll your eyes. 
“Hence, if you wish to have a bad spell, say to yourself, ‘Day by day in 
every way I am feeling worse and worse.’ 
“Another valuable piece of advice is—Talk sickness. 
“Tt is well known that our words affect our opinions by a sort of reaction. 
Therefore, make it a point to talk about every sort of pain, itch, megrim or 
gripe that you may have or have had or expect to have. Talking sickness 
is easy and pleasant. 
“Other pertinent hints are: 
“No work of any kind. Work greatly interferes with the progress of 
disease and sometimes even stops it. People who work right along do not 
seem to find time to be sick. 
“ Always drink ice water after meals so as to chill your stomach and 
prevent digestion. 
“Do not chew your food. Bolt it. Wash it down with plenty of liquids. 
This saves time and is a good health preventive. 
“Scorn all information regarding calories, vitamines and such nonsense. 
Eat plenty of candy and drink quantities of soda water and ginger ale and 
the like. This will help you get rid of your teeth and also assist in securing 
diabetes. 
“Worry as much as possible and do not forget that everybody who is 
cheerful is a hypocrite.” 
It has been aptly stated that we have kept our eyes too intent 
upon the birth- and death-rate and not enough upon the health- 
rate. Society is now beginning to be interested in the “health- 
rate.” One proof of this is the emphasis now being put upon 
(98)
-P-A-G-E-97
  INFORMATIONAL HYGIENE 99 
“prevention” and “preventive medicine.”” A wise public is begin- 
ning to realize that the time to lock the stable is before the horse 
is stolen. Laws are being made, codes being enforced with a view 
to preventing disease, with a view to making impossible infections. 
Another proof is in the reform in our methods of teaching hygiene. 
THE TEACHING OF HYGIENE. 
The object of all teaching is to educate the child by means of the 
subject and not just to fill his mind with unrelated facts. The 
teaching of hygiene is no exception to this. Its failure to “get across” 
in the past has been partly due to the fact that it was not human- 
ized. It lacked incentives. The teacher of hygiene has lacked vision. 
She has failed to correlate her subject with other subjects in the 
curriculum, she has failed to “tie-up” the subject matter of her 
department with the subject matter of other departments and to 
relate it to daily living, to work and to play. She has dwelt too 
much upon the strictly physiological and anatomical aspects of the 
subject and not enough upon the human elements. For primary 
and secondary girls there is little need of spending much time upon 
physiology and anatomy. One talk upon the general construction 
of the body is sufficient. It is almost impossible to persuade a group 
of high school girls, or college girls, or Y. W. C. A. girls to sleep nine 
hours daily, refrain from eating between meals, exercise one hour 
daily, to omit certain foods or to eat others, for the sake of health 
as such. But, if they can be made to realize that by not doing it, 
their class will be penalized so much, or they may lose a certain 
game or contest, they will almost invariably fall into line. It is a 
question of incentives entirely. 
Just the past few years have seen a great step forward. The 
results of the draft gave the teaching of health and fitness a big 
impetus which has been fostered not only by official organizations, 
but by many voluntary, unofficial civic organizations. Bulletin 
No. 33, published by the Bureau of Education, Department of the 
Interior, has listed these as follows: 
“1. Organizations, the membership of which consists in whole or in 
part of children and adolescents and which includes in the general 
program of activities, a more or less specific program of health 
activities, such as Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Camp-fire Girls, Young 
Men’s Christian Association, Young Women’s Christian Association 
and Junior Red Cross.

“2. Organizations to promote programs of health instruction: 
and training in the schools and other organizations that control 
children, such as the Child Health Organization of America, the 
Modern Health Crusade of the National Tuberculosis Association, 
the Playground and Recreation Association. 
“3. Professional organizations which directly or indirectly influ- 
ence the standards and practices in the field of educational hygiene, 
such as the American Public Health Association, National Organi- 
zation of Public Health Nursing, American Physical Health Asso- 
ciation, American Medical Association. 
“4, Organizations for the promotion and study of special fields 
in hygiene, such as the American Social Hygiene Association, 
National Committee for Mental Hygiene, National Committee for 
Prevention of Blindness. 
“5. Operating organizations which carry on _ investigations, 
demonstrations, ete., either with their own funds or as supplied by 
other organizations such as the Elizabeth McCormick Memorial 
Fund, National Child Health Council. 
“6. Foundations which generally are non-operative but supply 
funds for research, demonstration and promotion through other 
existing organizations, such as the Rockefeller, Commonwealth, 
Milbank. 
“7, Organizations devoted in whole or in part to promotion of 
child welfare through creation of public opinion, promotion of legis- 
lation, and other means, e. g., National Child Labor Committee, 
National Congress of Mothers and Parent Teacher Associations, 
Women’s Christian Temperance Union, National Physical Educa- 
tion Service.” . 
The Federal Bureau of Education has made invaluable contribu- 
tions through its conferences, investigations and publications. 
Public schools, colleges and universities are rationalizing their 
programs and their methods, they are endeavoring to make the 
course in hygiene a practical one. . 
“No one text-book in hygiene, any more than in any other study, 
is sufficient or complete for the use of the students, nor should they 
be permitted to think that one text- or reference-book will cover 
the field. Valuable training results from intelligent use of reference 
material and comparison of text-books.” In fact, no text-book at 
all is more effective. Rather, topics for discussion, should be chosen, 
a number of references suggested and the girls encouraged to supple- 
ment this knowledge and material by material and facts gained
-P-A-G-E-99
INFORMATIONAL HYGIENE 101 
from individual reading at home or in connection with other studies, 
investigations and experiments carried on in connection with clubs, 
organizations, school groups, etc., always with a view to relating 
all aspects of the subject to daily living. An intelligent application 
of facts presented in an interesting and appealing way in an effort 
to develop a “health consciousness” among girls and women should 
be the ultimate objective in a course in hygiene. 
Medical inspections, physical examinations, physical efficiency 
tests, height-weight charts, keeping of hygiene cards, should all 
vitalize the teaching of hygiene. Discussion of the meaning of the 
various tests and findings, dividing of the hygiene classes into teams, 
using as a basis a point system developed in connection with a part 
or parts of the examinations tends to make of the hygiene period, 
a laboratory where every girl is a keen experimenter. 
Once again, we are impressed with the responsibility of the teacher 
in successfully presenting such a program. Miss Dorothy Hutchin- 
son in a pamphlet issued by the Bureau of Education, “Health 
Education, No. 15,” describes such a teacher as follows: 
“1, In the first place this teacher must be in possession of an 
accurate, technical and scientific knowledge of the laws and prin- 
ciples of physiology and anatomy and their application to hygiene 
and health habits. 
“2. This teacher must be capable of vitalizing and humanizing 
the information. 
“3, Most important of all, this teacher must aim to be always 
‘gloriously well.’ A glowing example is half the battle, particularly 
with high school students in whom hero worship is strong. 
“4. To be a successful health teacher, one must and should be 
cognizant of the psychology and methods of salesmanship. One 
has to be a particularly clever salesman to teach health knowledge 
‘to a group of high school students. You have to prove to them that 
health is an essential element to the complete enjoyment of life.” 
This applies no less to the college girl than to the high school 
girl. According to Dr. Hetherington: “The objectives in teaching 
health are to establish the capacity in children for self-direction 
according to the laws of health. . . . The capacity for self- 
direction is not fully established until late adolescence, if then; 
and there is always a dependence, even of adults, on the control 
of public health by public health officials. Health, in so far as any 
individual can determine his own health, is due to his personal 
behavior according to the laws of health.  
-P-A-G-E-100
  
102 INFORMATIONAL HYGIENE 
Hygiene sets up these laws, and it is with these laws that we are 
concerned in the organization of a teaching program in hygiene. 
What should such a program contain? In making out a program 
for any group two factors should be considered: 
1. The age of the group. 
2. The previous amount of instruction. 
The following outline of material for lectures, discussions and 
study is suggested with the understanding that the instructor will 
choose and arrange her material with those two considerations in 
mind. The outline suggested by Miss Dorothy Hutchinson in 
Health Education No. 15 was used as a basis in working this out. 
1. Function, structure and hygiene of the respiratory system; 
processes involved in respiration; hygiene of respiration; effects of 
exercise. 
2. Function, structure and hygiene of digestive system; processes 
involved in digestion; foods, fate of foodstuffs; nourishment; under 
nourishment; relation to health and fitness; hygiene of digestion; 
effects of exercise. 
3. Function, structure and hygiene of the blood, circulatory 
system; the blood, anemia; causal factors in blood flow; health 
problem in relation to circulatory system; effects of exercise. 
4. Discussion of health in general—definition; obstacles to health; 
importance; influence of mind on health; false notions; patent 
medicines; factors in health promotion; relation of individual health 
to community health. 
5. Personal health; physical examinations; necessary knowledge 
concerning structure, function and care of skin, hair, eyes, teeth, 
ears, nasal passages, throat, feet, spine. 
6. Clothing and health—shoes, corsets, garters. 
7. Posture, value of good posture; relationship between posture 
and efficiency, kinds of malposture; remedies; preventives. : 
8. Feet, value of good feet; relationship between feet and effi- 
ciency; kinds of foot defects, remedies, preventives. 
9. Bathing—value of different types. ; 
10. Exercise and recreation—relation to health and efficiency. 
11. Food and health: food supply and control; Pure Food and 
Drug Act; meat inspection, preparation of food, preservation of food. 
12. Water supply, source, examination, epidemics, purification. 
13. Milk supply, importance, inspection, sanitary production, 
control. 
14. Sewage and waste disposal. Home, community, sanitary 
engineering.
-P-A-G-E-101
  INFORMATIONAL HYGIENE 103 
15. Disease—history and knowledge of; prevention; types of 
disease; transfer; precautions. 
16. Disinfection. Purpose; time for; agents; terms used. 
17. Public health administration—Federal, state, local. 
18. Health education—need for, use of exhibits, community 
organizations, public meetings. 
19. Home nursing. 
20. Sex hygiene. Menstruation, reproduction, social diseases, 
eugenics. 
21. Infant care. 
22. Care of child of preschool age. 
23. First aid. 
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION. 
In order to place this information in the reach of the girls or 
students a regular period for instruction should be provided, such 
as is allowed for Latin, mathematics, or any other academic sub- 
jects. Where the curriculum will not permit of a daily period, two 
periods each week should be the minimum. ‘Ten or fifteen min- 
utes at the beginning or end of a gymnastic lesson is not sufficient, 
nor is it dignified, although much “hammering home’’ of informa- 
tion already given may be done in connection with a gymnastic 
lesson or an athletic period. The gymnastic lesson often offers 
a splendid opportunity for correlating the theoretical with the 
practical. A special room set aside for the hygiene period, contain- 
ing long tables, space for equipment, materials and specimens, 
whose walls may be hung with special charts, posters, etc., would 
make possible a more “‘socialized”’ recitation. 
A program of the above suggested type in order to be fully and 
effectively realized must necessarily be correlated with:

1. Physical examinations. 
2. Statistics. 
8. Motor ability tests.

will serve not only as valuable material, but which will vitalize and 
humanize the whole study of health and hygiene, by taking it out 
from between the covers of a book and relating it in a fascinating 
way to every-day life and living. 
The girls themselves, if intelligently led and stimulated, will 
suggest and work out many interesting projects and methods for 
“putting over” such a program. The following “projects” may be 
welcome to the readers of these pages, and may furnish them with 
ideas hitherto untried. They represent successful experiments and 
programs carried out in two universities and a public high school, 
by girls. 
SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS. 
A, Under the leadership of Dr. Matzke, Woman Physician of 
the University Student Health Service at the University of Missouri, 
an experimental health program, under student initiative, in 
which social hygiene was integrated, was worked out and put into 
effect 1921-1923. All of the individual student organizations 
pledged themselves to individual health programs. Through the 
Women’s Self Government Association, a committee of three 
upper class women was appointed to find out the physical needs 
of each group, regulate the sanitary conditions of their houses 
and to keep its members in touch with the medical advisers in 
case of minor indispositions. The Health slogan of the Women 
carried three emphases: (1) Health—the final test of woman’s 
efficiency. (2) Scholarship. (8) Social activities. Permission was 
received from the President’s office for the introduction of a required 
course in personal and social hygiene to be given by the woman 
physician. 
The health policy of the executive council of the Women’s Self 
Government Association during the years 1922 and 1923, included 
the following provisions: 
“1. That one mass meeting, called a ‘health meeting’ be held 
during the course of each year. 
“2. That the course in social and personal hygiene be required 
of all freshmen women in the second semester. 
“3. That in any house where there are three or more university 
women, there be appointed one woman as health commissioner to 
regulate and report all unsanitary conditions and all cases of illness.
-P-A-G-E-105
  
INFORMATIONAL HYGIENE 107 
“4, That the following recommendations at large be observed: 
(a) Balanced and regular meals, systematic daily exercise, an 
average of eight hours of sleep, suitable shoes, suitable 
clothing and a limitation of social activities.” 
The health activities that are of urgent consideration, are: 
“1, Medical consultation and health conferences for the well 
students. 
“2, Physical examinationsas a requirement for all entering women 
students, and to be given by the woman physician. 
“3. Medical supervision, physical. inspection and periodic phy- 
sical examinations of all upper class women. 
“4, Health lectures by the medical and allied faculties, and from 
other universities. 
“5, Sanitation, a study of the student’s environment both on and 
off the campus. 
“6, Preventive treatment as individual and community defense 
(these measures deny the right of the sick to become a menace to 
the well).”! 
Each sorority and student organization wrote letters pledging 
their support, individual and collective, in carrying out this health 
program and enumerated in detail the methods they would employ 
in putting it into effect. 
Such an intelligent educational procedure could not but have 
a wholesome, far-reaching effect, not only upon the University and 
community, but upon every community with which those students 
later came in contact. 
B. Health Week Program. Students of Washington Irving High 
School, New York City. Preliminary Preparations.2—Health posters 
borrowed from various city health organizations were hung on the 
walls of the entrance hall of the school. A measuring stand and a 
pair of scales were placed in the center of the hall. Pamphlets and 
leaflets, secured through the aid of a social worker from a near-by 
health center, were distributed by the girls to all whom they thought 
might profit by the suggestions contained therein. One girl gave hers 
to a relative who was a dentist, to be placed in his waiting room. 
Another hung hers in her father’s grocery. <A third gave hers to a 
woman “who has no children to bring things home to her.” Another 
girl, who is a volunteer playground leader, awarded her leaflet as a 
prize for a relay race.

The following slogan was placed on all the blackboards: “Health 
costs effort, but health is worth the effort it costs.” 
The following 20 projects were mimeographed and distributed 
several days preceding Health Week. Projects 2, 3, 4, 8 were given 
to only a few pupils, in order that the city officials concerned might 
not be deluged with visitors.

(a) A college boy who has gone into training for some athletic 
contest; if possible, an athlete who has won his letter. 
(b) A physical-training teacher. 
(c) A successful business man. 
(d) A nurse, a physician, or Red Cross worker. 
(e) A Sunday-school teacher, settlement-house worker, or club 
leader, and ask for concrete cases and human-interest stories to 
illustrate these two facts: (1) Health costs effort; (2) health is 
worth the effort it costs. 
2. Find out from your school clerk the total amount of money 
paid to substitutes in your school for teachers absent last month 
(or last term) on account of illness. What would this amount of 
money buy for your auditorium or gymnasium? 
3. Interview or write to one of the following: A labor-union 
official; the National Civic Federation; the Board of Sanitary 
Control; the American Federation of Labor, Washington, D. C.; 
the National Manufacturers’ Association; and try to discover dif- 
ferent ways in which illness interferes with production, increases 
the cost of living, aggravates industrial unrest, and becomes a 
menace to our national prosperity. Report your findings to your 
class. 
4. Interview or write to one of the following: Your school doctor, 
your family physician, the Life Extension Institute, the Metro- 
politan Life Insurance Company, the representative of the Charity 
Organization Society of your district. Try to discover: 
(a) How large a share does illness play in our problem of poverty? 
(6) How much of our community’s illness is preventable? Report 
your findings to your class. 
5. Submit the following questionnaire to ten of your friends and 
classmates: 
(a) Have you ever been ill with a contagious disease? If so, what 
was the disease? (b) How long were you ill? (c) Did you suffer 
any bad after-effects? If so, describe. (d) Name as many ways

as you can in which this sickness cost you or your parents’ time, 
money, anxiety, suffering. (e) Do you know how you contracted 
the disease? If so, describe briefly. Could you have been safe- 
guarded from it? How? Tabulate your results and present them 
in class. (The teacher will get ideas for the discussion from “What 
Happened to the Parker Children,” Woman’s Home Companion, 
December, 1921.) 
6. Watch for anyone of the following sources of danger to the com- 
munity’s health and report to the proper authority: (a) Contagious 
disease unquarantined; (b) for flies or mosquitoes, stray dogs or 
cats playing close to little children; (c) neglect of waste disposal; 
(d) bad housing conditions; (e) impure food. 
7. Observe junior and adult citizens in school, on the street, in the 
subway and elevated trains, in the parks, in your own home, and 
list (a) five acts which help the individual to keep well; (5) five acts 
which interfere with the individuals’ health; (c) five acts which 
interfere with the community’s health; and (@) five acts which tend 
to promote the community’s health. 
8. Write letters to the following Government agencies asking 
for lists of their publications or for sample leaflets: City depart- 
ment of Health; State department of Health; U. S. Public Health 
Service, Washington, D. C.; U.S. Bureau of Education, Washington, 
D.C. 
List ten problems with which these agencies are concerned, indi- 
cating after each problem the name of the agency interested. 
9. Watch the newspapers every day for a week, clipping any news 
article which has to do with the subject of community health. 
Paste into your civics notebook, noting the name of the newspaper, 
the date, and a brief summary of the item. At the end of the week 
try to draw some general conclusion from the articles you have 
found. : 
10. Ask some man who was in service in the World War what 
precautions were taken in camp and in the trenches for the same 
of the health of our soldiers, or ask some one who used to live in 
Europe to help you contrast the methods of the Old World with 
those of the New concerning the treatment of colds, tuberculosis, 
skin infections, and capillary pediculosis. 
Projects on Community Health.—11. Visit a milk station or health 
center and note what is done for the decrease of infant mortality 
and the betterment of the health of mothers and their babies. 
12. Visit the headquarters of the department of health and see (a)

the exhibits; (b) experiments in one of the chemical laboratories; 
(c) testing of milk; (d) examinations of applicants for working 
papers; (e) the city’s records of its vital statistics. 
13. Visit the museum of natural history and study the public- 
health exhibit. 
14. Visit one of the exhibits of an antituberculosis association or 
any other exhibit recommended by the New York County Chapter 
of the American Red Cross, or advertised in the daily press, and 
study the different activities of the community which help to keep 
us well. 
15. Report on what is done to protect us from “imported diseases.” 
16. Watch in the subway, in the grocery store, in school, in the 
dairy, in the butcher’s shop, for notices posted by order of the board 
of health to carry out these orders. 
17. Make a sanitary survey of your neighborhood, using Health 
News, published by the State department of Health of New York, 
May-June, 1921, as a help. 
18. Teach the “rules of the game” to some child, preferably 
your younger brother or sister, and check your pupil on these rules 
every day for a month. See that you follow these rules yourself. 
Find the average weight for your pupil’s height and weigh your 
pupil at the beginning and at the end of the month. If possible, 
organize a band of Modern Health Crusaders in your neighborhood. 
19. Make a poster which will convey to the community some 
health message it needs and get permission to post in your school 
or in the nearest library. 
20. Organize a “Clean-up Campaign” in your school or neighbor- 
hood in the interest of health, safety, and beauty. Chalk marks, 
papers, rubbish, stagnant pools of water, piles of old tin cans must 
go. (1) Pick up; (2) paint; (3) plant. Take time in collecting your 
publicity material, such as posters, banners, speeches for the school 
assembly, articles for the school paper; keep it under cover until 
you are ready to use it and then—a whirlwind campaign. Follow 
up with reminders six weeks later: 
Are we still all nice and clean? 
How clean we looked six weeks ago. 
???2?Do we look today???? 
The paper’s in the basket, 
The fruit skin is canned, 
The floors, walls, and desks are clean,

Weighing and Measuring.—The girls of the domestic science class 
took charge of the weighing and measuring. Everybody—teachers, 
students, and visitors—was measured and weighed and average 
weight for height and age computed from tables which hung con- 
veniently near. If the individual being weighed was perfect, she 
was given a green tag; if underweight, a red tag and a talk; if over- 
weight, a yellow tag and also a talk. 
Health Address.—The services of “Happy,” the Health Clown, 
were secured by arrangement with the Child Health Organization. 
Two physicians accepted invitations to address the students on 
the subject of the prevention of tuberculosis. 
Two speakers were also secured to present addresses on “The 
Prevention of Blindness” and “The Care of Convalescents to Pre- 
vent Bad After-effects.” 
Classroom Activities (Coéperation in All Departments).—Language 
departments: Use of vocabulary in discussing several of the rules 
which make for good health. “Mangez les legumes,” in French, etc. 
Civic department: Discussions on the city health department, 
its function and service to the city. 
Mathematics department: Graphs were made showing the effect 
of fresh air on disease. The graphs conclusively proved “that there 
are fewer cases of pneumonia in May, when the windows are open, 
than in January, when they are closed.” (Graphs may also be pre- 
pared on vital statistics which can be secured from the U. S. Bureau 
of the Census, Department of Commerce.) 
English department: Each girl in each English class wrote a set 
of seven health epigrams, one for each day in the week. There were 
reports and discussions on the gathering of reliable data before these 
epigrams were written in order to insure the collection of valuable 
information. 
Some of these epigrams are as follows: “Follow the green line.” 
“Eat vegetables and keep safe.” “A bath should be a habit—not an 
event.” “Fresh fruits will take the kick from your disposition, and 
put a punch in your personality.” “Be a shifter—shift from candy 
to calories.” 
Fifty-two $1 prizes were given by the Child Health Organization 
to the 52 girls having the best sets. 
Art department: Preparation and arrangement of big charts, 
posters, and models. 
Biology department: Circulated a set of “rules” on the methods 
of preventing the spread of “colds.”

Bookkeeping department: Classification of the health problem in 
true bookkeeping style, 7. ¢., good health was shown to be a business 
asset, poor health a liability, and loss of health bankruptcy. 
Physical training department: During health week this depart- 
ment endeavored to find out all the cardiac cases. 
Such a Health Week might be organized and carried out with 
success by any school, college, university, urban or rural, by a settle- 
ment house or by a scout troop. It furnishes material and ideas 
for a vast number of projects and a whole program of health educa- 
tion, socialized. 
C. Posture.—In these days of the “debutante slouch,’ when 
fashion has decreed that the chest must be concave and the abdomen 
convex, when the type of social dancing only serves to exaggerate 
these ludicrous positions, the physical director who can interest her 
girls in good posture to the extent of actually maintaining good 
posture is a marvel. Good carriage is not uncommon in a class in 
gymnastics but for the most part it does not “carry over.” Posture 
grades and marks represent for the most part the posture at the time, 
not the habitual posture. All sorts of devices and schemes must 
be used in order to really interest a girl in her individual case. The 
most common devices are: 
1. Posture tests with grades. 
Schematographs. 
Photographs. 
Stereopticon lectures. 
Movies. 
Songs, poems, plays. 
Posters. 
Tag days or a tag week. 
Shoe exhibits. 
10. Posture requirement for making teams. 
11. Posture requirement in a physical efficiency test. 
12. Points given in athletic association system. 
13. Posture grade, a part of the physical education grade. 
14. Posture contests. 
Slides and movie reels made from life may be obtained from the 
Educational Department of the Young Women’s Christian Associa- 
tion. Many moving picture companies are devoting time and money 
to educational service and will furnish lists of such films upon 
request.

ation of the students of the University, presented the subject in a 
clever way which interested not only the University, but the whole 
state. Her article entitled “ Putting the Punch in Posture”! con- 
tains so many novel and live suggestions that it is quoted here at 
length. 
“The girls read all they could find on posture work. Then each 
one made out a scheme of her own, trying to put into it as much 
originality as possible. The best ideas from each were selected and 
built together into the plan herein described. Most of the ideas 
were original with the girls. 
“On the principle that if you work for a thing you become inter- 
ested in it, they enlisted as many different groups as possible. The 
school paper, run mostly by the men students of the University, 
served as advance agent with daily write-ups, some serious, some 
comic. The eye would light unexpectedly upon a phrase in black 
type such as ‘R U A Leaner,’ ‘Not what zs your standing, but 
how are you standing.’ 
‘Spine curved 
Lungs cramped 
Uneven shoulders ; 
Muscular strain 
Protruding abdomen.’ 
The columnist—a man—gave us, ‘Did you Know that Cleopatra’s 
Pose won Caesar?’ The following is a paragraph from it: 
“Tt is a strange thing that a woman will be careless of her posture; 
that she will powder and tint, marcel and kalsomine, all with a 
skill worthy of a Rembrandt, and then, being fully slicked up for 
the evening, step out with a carriage which would not do justice 
to a broken-down truck horse.’ 
“Each of the senior majors made a poster. These were hung 
in the gymnasium and classes going in and out voted on the best 
not from the point of view of art, but as to its power of putting 
over the idea. First place was won by the ‘Hump Family—Ma 
Hada Hump, Iona Hump, Pa Hada Hump, Heza Slump.’ Other 
good ones illustrated the slogans, ‘Posture Expresses Personality.’ 
‘The Debutante Slump brings the Middle Aged Hump,’ ete. 
“All the shoe stores in Eugene and Portland were given the 
opportunity to send shoes to our exhibit. The shoes were classified 
by the seniors under the corrective department into excellent, 
good, fair. Each shoe bore the name and address of the dealer, the

different styles in which it was made, the price, and its rating. A 
list was also made to be posted permanently for reference on the 
bulletin boards. Over the exhibition table was hung a sign saying, 
‘Good posture depends on a good understanding.’ 
“On the morning of Posture Day tags greeted the eye everywhere. 
The trees that carried themselves poorly received C tags. One 
tree against which there is always a languid group of boys smoking 
cigarettes, bore the caption, ‘This tree has fatigue posture due to 
nicotine fumes.’ The sturdy Pioneer statue won an A tag. The 
manikin wore around his neck, ‘Poor me, I can’t change my 
posture, you can.’ 
“Three mirrors were placed where the majority of students pass. 
One, shoulder high, read, ‘Are you slumping? Pull yourself 
together.’ The next, waist high, said, ‘Have you a sway back? 
That is not the style. Try flattening your spine once in a while.’ 
The last one reflected the passing feet with ‘Do you toe out like a 
duck? Don’t! On the sidewalks in several places the value of the 
straight foot position was depicted.

“As posture is not a matter for the physical education department 
alone, the psychology department was asked to talk to its classes 
that day on the psychological effect of good posture, the educational 
department to discuss good posture as a vocational asset, the art 
department to bring out the beauty of good posture, and so on 
throughout the University. Needless to say, the anatomy, physi- 
ology, hygiene and kinesiology of good posture were also stressed. 
“At five o’clock, when all classes were over, the ‘Posture Follies 
of 1923’ was presented. This had been well and mysteriously 
advertised by the University paper, also by the Eugene and Port- 
land dailies, which had become interested in the drive. The Follies

began with the film, ‘Foot Follies.’ After that there appeared 
against a dark curtain two girls dressed in black union suits, on which 
had been outlined in white the bones of the skeleton. To the accom- 
paniment of the piano they half sang, half chanted the ‘Ode to 
Posture’! and acted it out. The effect of the black suits against 
the dark background was to make only the white skeleton visible— 
most gruesome and striking: 
Ope to PostuRE. 
Good posture is an asset 
Which very few possess, 
Sad to relate, the favored ones 
Seem to be growing less. 
We see the folks around us 
All slumped down in a heap, 
And the way that people navigate 
Is enough to make you weep. 
Some elevate their shoulders, 
Some hollow in their backs, 
Some stiffen up their muscles, 
And some just plain relax. 
The one who walks with grace and poise 
Is a spectacle so rare, 
That even down on gay Broadway 
The people turn and stare. 
If you would cut a figure 
In business, sport or school, 
Just mind the Posture Precepts, 
Obey the Posture Rule. 
Don’t thrust your head out turtle-wise, 
Don’t hunch your shoulders so, 
Don’t sag and drag yourself around. 
No style to that, you know. 
Get Uplift in your bearing, 
And strength and spring and vim. 
No matter what your worries, 
To slouch won’t alter them. 
Just square your shoulders to the world— 
Your’re not the sort to quit. 
“Tt isn’t the load that breaks us down, 
It’s the way we carry it.”

“This was followed by an adaptation of the Doll Dance. A child 
brings in her big doll (another girl) to show to her friends. She is 
distressed by its poor posture. She winds it up to exhibit how it 
can walk and dance. But alas! it persists in slouching, toeing out, 
thrusting forward its head, arching its back. The little girl gives 
it ‘manual correction’ which it takes most graciously but it cannot 
‘maintain its correction.’ Finally, it is completely run down and 
slumps beyond repair. The child, with tears of distress and mor- 
tification, drags the doll behind the scenes. 
“The next was aimed to show how faulty carriage neutralizes the 
effectiveness of stylish clothes, intelligence, beauty, and charm. 
It was put to a parody on the popular song, ‘Oh, is She Dumb?’ 
A stanza was devoted to a girl dressed for each of the following: Golf, 
street, dinner, afternoon tea, student, dancing. As the stanza is 
sung, a girl walks across the stage depicting the faults typical of 
that occupation. Toward the end of the chorus she assumes a 
perfect posture, walks easily and gracefully off while the moral is 
being pointed out. The following is the stanza for the dinner givl: 
“There’s a girl I know who came from college, 
She’s supposed to have a lot of knowledge 
Just seventeen 
And oh! so keen, 
Sweet face and figure as ever you’ve seen 
But when she is clothed in a dinner gown, 
She sticks out her stomach and her shoulders are round. 
Chorus. 
“Oh is she dumb? 
Oh is she dumb? 
She thinks she’s clever as can be. 
She’s so dumb I’ve often heard her say, 
‘Now don’t you think I have good poise today?’ 
What a mistake! 
What a mistake! 
Look, don’t you think she’d look better straight? 
Now don’t you like the way she walks? 
And wouldn’t it impress you when she talks? 
Oh such a treat! 
Oh such a treat! 
Take a good look while you can. 
Interspersed among these features were several snappy, semi- 
serious talks giving the ill-effects of poor posture and the reasons 
for trying for a good one.

“After dinner that night the senior majors dressed themselves as 
Posture Police, tailored waist, sport skirt, sombrero hat, borrowed 
from the men students and a big silver star—the badge of authority. 
Two policemen went to each living house and gave the girls a posture 
test. Those passing received a tag with ‘Perfect Posture’ printed 
on it and a cut of the side view of the statue ‘Peter Perfect Posture.’ 
The house winning the largest per cent of tags received a very lovely 
and artistic bronze plaque made for us by the sculpture department. 
It expresses not static good posture but the buoyancy and life that 
come through poise and control. 
“The house that won made a score of 80.9 per cent. This seemed 
rather high after the figures obtained from the freshman and sopho- 
mores. The policemen decided that it was due to the fact that there 
were several physical education majors in that house, and that 
very nearly every girl in it was taking active part in one or more 
or our voluntary sports: 
“The girls all declared that they got the proper thrill out of it all, 
that they not only walked and talked posture but they ate, thought 
and dreamed it. This would seem to be convincing that more 
attempts to popularize our work would make it much more vital 
to our young people. A drive like this does not need a university 
and a normal class to make it go. With modifications it could be put 
over by any grade or high school, provided, always, that it was 
done with the spirit of play and not as an assignment. 
“Of course the test of the value of a drive is in how much it carries 
over and in how lasting its effects. Follow-up work should certainly 
be done. Unfortunately ours came so near the end of the year that 
this was impossible. But at least it aroused interest—not only in 
the University but throughout the state—and took posture out 
of the realm of academic abstractions and made it a living thing 
worthy of effort.” 
These suggestions are valuable not only as applied to posture 
and posture tests, but the whole treatment furnishes an interesting 
example of the way to handle what is in itself an uninteresting 
subject to the ordinary girl. Who could not get a thrill out of such 
a day? 
The intelligent instructor with vision will find many such schemes 
and devices for vitalizing her subject. 
Probably the following samples of examination questions in 
hygiene represent as truly as anything the old and the new tendency 
in the teaching of hygiene.

  CHAPTER VII. 
PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES. 
TuE program of physical activities for girls and women should 
always be carefully worked out regardless of the size of the institu- 
tion or organization. Its type and content should be governed by 
the seven following considerations which should always be regarded 
whether the “program” is a special one for a special event or 
whether it is a season’s or an annual program: 
Sex. 
. Age. 
. Capacities or abilities of the group or individual. 
. Climate. 
. Geographic location—local and national. 
. Season of year. 
. Time of day. 
The first three items are of special importance where girls and 
women are concerned. 
1. Sex.—It is commonly agreed by the medical profession and 
among physical educators that girls and women present certain 
physiological, anatomical and emotional differences which should 
limit to a certain extent their participation in physical activities. 
This narrows somewhat their field of endeavor. Some of these 
differences are pointed out in the following extract from an editorial 
in the American Physical Education Review for April, 1924: 
“Tf intercollegiate sport is to be developed for girls along similar 
lines to those for men, the physical differences should be clearly 
recognized. The rapid increases in weight of the lungs begin in 
girls at twelve years; in boys at fourteen. They are of similar 
weight up to puberty, the girls lungs decreasing relatively in weight 
after this period. Is this due to decreased activity, or is it a biological 
difference? 
“The vital capacity of the lungs in women is roughly one-third 
less than in men. Would more big-muscle activity increase this 
capacity up to that of the men? Men have, on the average, 5,000- 
000 red blood corpuscles per cubic millimeter of blood; women 
(120) 
Noapwnre

PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES 121 
4,500,000. The heart weighs roughly 11 ounces in the male, and 9 
in the female. At birth, boys are taller and heavier than girls. 
From the eleventh to the sixteenth year, girls are taller than boys, 
and from the twelfth to the seventeenth year the girls are also 
heavier. From the seventeenth year to maturity the boys forge 
ahead in height, weight and strength. 
“The girl has relatively larger organs below the diaphragm 
and smaller ones above the diaphragm. The hips and thighs have 
more adipose tissue and less muscle. The center of gravity is thus 
lower. Metabolism is less rapid in women than in men, the ratio 
being 100 to 141. Women do better in exercise of moderate endur- 
ance than men. They do not do as well in exercises of support on the 
hands or in exercises of speed. Women, biologically, are in general 
anabolic in type, while men are katabolic. Because of her structure 
women have less ability than men in heavy gymnastics and in those 
competitive games which require heart and lung power. 
“The long experience of men in competitive athletics, coupled 
with their many mistakes, should aid the women leaders in physical 
education in avoiding their chief mistakes. The newer knowledge 
of the physiological factors should have more careful consideration 
than has been given in the development of men’s athletics.” 
The fact that men, as a rule, in dealing with girls and women in 
games and sports do not appreciate nor recognize these differences, is 
one strong argument in favor of abolishing all teaching or administer- 
ing of physical activities for girls and women by men. Furthermore, 
it has not yet been scientifically established that vigorous physical 
activity during the menstrual period is destructive to health, neither 
has it been proven that it is not. Physicians state that the hospitals 
and sanitaria are increasingly full of girls and women who will never 
be able to become mothers—girls with misplaced organs “nervous 
diseases” and other ailments due, the physicians state, to partici- 
pation in the wrong kinds of sports or to over-participation in activi- 
ties themselves not harmful. Every professional person as well as 
lay man can cite instances of girls whose health was injured pre- 
sumably through gymnastics or sports or games, not because the 
sport was at fault but because the participant was a girl. 
A committee appointed by the Women’s Division of the National 
Amateur Athletic Federation headed by Dr. Marie Ortmayer of 
the University of Chicago, is being organized to undertake definite 
scientific study and experimentation along this important line. 
The work will require some years of research and in the meantime
-P-A-G-E-120
    122 PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES 
it is well to be guided by Dr. Ortmayer’s suggestion in her report 
given in April at the Annual Meeting of the Women’s Division. 
“The question of the facts during and preceding the menstrual 
period remain unsolved, as there are no conclusive experiments, 
but it seems rational to advise avoidance of excesses of inactivity 
and activity and to let the individual be guided by her medical 
advisor.” 
Of course there are medical advisers who, never having partici- 
pated in strenuous competition and therefore not knowing from 
actual experience the nervous, emotional and physical strain, are 
not competent to judge and are sometimes too lenient in their 
advice and “permissions.” 
The recommendations made by the New York “ Workshop Group” 
would seem on the whole to be safe: 
“Whereas we believe that our object should be to build up a pro- 
gram and standards which will entail no risks to the health and well- 
being of any individual, we recommend that no girl be allowed to 
enter into competition or do any work of a vigorous nature during 
the menstrual period.” 
Dr. Ortmayer’s suggestion that she refrain from “excesses of 
inactivity” is well taken. There is no doubt that much discomfort 
at the menstrual period is caused by inactivity. Many girls stay 
in bed during the first day of the period, principally because their 
mothers did. This very inactivity may cause the congestion which 
in turn causes the discomfort and pain. A little judicious exercise 
might relieve the whole condition. As Dr. Ortmayer suggests, this 
is a matter for the medical advisor to decide. It should not be 
decided by tradition or a pampering mother. 
Granted that functional and structural differences are strong 
enough arguments against girls and women participating in all 
types of activities as indulged in by boys and men, there is in addi- 
tion no real reason why girls should participate in the same games 
and sports as boys. The girl does not need to have her combative 
instincts developed. She is not or should not be interested pri- 
marily in making or breaking records. She should be interested in 
events and types of activities which make for grace, poise, supple- 
ness, quickness, agility, dexterity, beauty, general strength and 
endurance. For that reason girls should interest themselves more 
in events where form and skill is emphasized, rather than in events 
requiring great strength and speed. 
Much of the present alarm and uneasiness regarding athletics
-P-A-G-E-121
  
PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES 123 
for girls and women has been caused by the fact that in many 
instances boys’ programs of events have been taken over bodily 
and adopted by the girls. That is the explanation of much of the 
harm which has been done in the past. Back of it all is the cause— 
poor, inexperienced leadership, short-sightedness, and the failure 
of the women physical educators to exercise proper initiative. 
The author has dwelt at length upon this one aspect of the whole 
subject because the word “sex” is the keystone around which should 
be built the whole structure for women, the newer physical educa- 
tion. 
2. Age.—No program of activities for girls and women is sound 
which does not take into consideration the age of the participant. 
The adolescent girl cannot, with safety, indulge in the same type 
or in the same amount of activity as her older or even her younger 
sister. From the point of view of health, the safest age division for 
girls is not the chronological or mental one, but the physiological 
one. “Prepubescent,” “pubescent, ”and “postpubescent,”’ are the 
terms best fitted to describe a girl’s degree of physical development. 
These three stages of development in a girl’s life have been defined 
by Dr. Ortmayer as follows: 
PREPUBESCENT: 
Physiological age—before menses appear equal to 
School age—(mental age) 7th grade through first year high 
school (junior high). 
Chronological age—nine to fourteen years. 
PUBESCENT: 
Stage during which individual type and regularity of menstrual 
cycle is established, equal to 
School age—second, third and fourth year high school (senior 
high) 
Chronological age—fifteen to seventeen years. 
PosrPuBESCENT—period after full establishment of menstrual 
cycle, equal to 
School age—four years of college. 
Chronological age—after seventeen years—(eighteen to twenty- 
one years). 
This ought to furnish a fairly safe basis for working out types 
of programs; although it is realized that the administrative diffi- 
culties involved would at times be great, especially in large school 
systems. Instructors who do not realize the physiological, ana- 
tomical as well as psychological changes which are taking place in 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  
  124 PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES 
a girl during the adolescent or pubescent period and adapt their pro- 
gram to these conditions, should not be intrusted with either the 
making or the carrying out of her program of physical activities. 
All of the organs in the body are at this time undergoing changes, 
the body itself is growing and taking on gradually, the form of the 
woman. Sex instincts are beginning to manifest themselves. As 
a result, the girl is changeable and moody at times. It is during 
this period that continued strain and exertion is dangerous and 
unwise. Long halves in basket-ball should not be permitted, but 
the game should be divided into quarters. The individual prowess 
should not be emphasized but stress laid upon group effort. 
Psychologically, the interests and the incentives vary with these 
stages of development, and that varying interest and appeal is 
another important factor to be considered in the choosing of sports 
and games. This is one of the reasons as to why it is so difficult to 
make a satisfactory program for a group made up of varying ages. 
A careful consideration of this question is especially recommended 
for club leaders, scout and camp-fire leaders and all others who are 
concerned with groups of varying ages. This question is more or 
less arbitrarily settled in schools by the grade where the girls are 
apt to be more or less of the same age. 
3. Capacities and Abilities of the Group or Individual.—In so far as 
possible girls of varying capacities and abilities should not be placed 
in the same groups or on the same team. This is an ideal which 
again cannot always be realized because of administrative difficul- 
ties. Academic departments have always had to deal with the same 
problem. A few “physical morons” in a class in gymnastics, will 
retard the advancement of the whole class. A few “stars” in a class 
will either cause a class to work too hard and beyond its capacity, 
or the “stars” lose interest and slump. FEither situation is bad. 
There are two suggestions for the first case: Try to find out the 
cause of the disability of the “physical moron” and endeavor to 
remove the cause. It may be self-consciousness, timidity, lack 
of previous opportunity, poor eyesight, adenoids or poor hearing. 
The girl may require medical attention. She may need a little extra 
attention and “coaching” outside of class. The following experi- 
ment tried at Barnard College last year proved very successful. 
Each class in gymnastics was divided into “A” and “B” groups 
as a result of the motor ability test. All of those who obtained a 
score which was normal or above were put into “A” group. All 
others in the “B” group. A further grouping into “C” would have 
   
-P-A-G-E-123
  
PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES 125 
been still more effective. An instructor was assigned to each group, 
the floor divided and each group given work adapted and suited to 
its degree of development. The groups were further divided into 
squads of ten each with a student leader for each squad. Some 
of the “stars” were made squad leaders in both groups and given 
extra training between classes. 
The result was more than satisfactory not only to the department 
but to the students themselves. The girl with poor neuromuscular 
control lost her feeling of hopelessness and began to try. She became 
interested in the number of points she was accumulating in the var- 
ious events and exercises. The “stars” became interested in improv- 
ing their squads and in raising their squad scores. The “game 
instinct” and the “competitive instinct” crept into the class work 
and the gymnasium became a real “workshop” or laboratory. 
Whereas in the fall only 53 per cent of the class were above normal 
as shown by the motor ability tests, in April, 89 per cent were above. 
Where games and sports are concerned (especially more highly 
organized games), a system should be worked out whereby the green 
and inexperienced material may be more or less concentrated in the 
same groups, a system of beginning, intermediate and advanced 
classes in sports, games and dancing as well as gymnastics. Student 
leaders can here again be satisfactorily utilized in assisting in the 
instruction and in umpiring and refereeing. 
To sum up: a girl’s type of sport or activity should be decided 
by her physiological age; this should be still further governed by 
her capacity, ability, and previous amount of training. 
4, Climate.—The program must of course be governed by the cli- 
mate. A program of sports for winter in the south naturally could 
not include ice-hockey, skating, skiing, etc., except in unusual 
situations. Even where physical conditions permit, the temperature 
might make participation in certain strenuous sports and games 
unwise and unsafe. In the midwest and east, tennis as an outdoor 
sport can be indulged in only at certain times of the year, while in 
the south and in parts of California, it is an all-year sport out of 
doors. 
5. Geographical Location (Local and National).—'The same thing 
applies to the topography of the country as applies to climate. 
Sports which are possible on the prairies or in country with flat open 
spaces, are not possible in the mountains, while the mountains 
afford opportunity for skiing, climbing, etc., which the plains and 
prairies make impossible except by artificial means.
-P-A-G-E-124
  126 PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES 
6. Season of Year.—Games, like flowers and vegetables, have their 
seasons, and it is very difficult to make them popular at any other 
time. Tops and marbles, jacks and jumping rope appear at about 
the same time, run their season and disappear. So it is with baseball, 
football, track, tennis, ete. Although with our present increase 
of indoor space and facilities and our present adaptation of games 
to indoor and outdoor spaces, with the exception of football, the more 
highly organized sports and games can be indulged in at almost any 
season. With girls, basket-ball is either an indoor or an outdoor 
game; in many places field hockey is played both fall and spring, 
indoor baseball takes the place during the winter of outdoor ball. 
We have indoor and outdoor tracks, so seasonal limitation is less 
marked. 
7. Time of Day.— Although this consideration is the least important, 
it is still important enough to be discussed. No physical activities 
should be indulged in immediately after a hearty meal. The latter 
part of the afternoon, especially the late afternoon, is not a good time 
for formal types of exercise, especially if the girl has been reciting 
and studying during the greater part of the day. This is the time 
for more recreational types of exercise, for games and sports and 
athletics. Heads of departments or physical directors in making 
out their programs should be governed by this. 
The type and content of the program or of the day’s lessons 
should be still further influenced temporarily by 
1. Condition of the weather. 
2. Temper or morale of the group. 
No program should be so inflexible that it cannot be temporarily 
altered, and no instructor should be so lacking in her knowledge of 
psychology that she will insist on carrying out a day’s order pre- 
pared for a cold day if the atmosphere happens to be warm and 
humid and lifeless on that day. Nor will she give to a lively “peppy” 
group the same type of lesson she might give to a group suddenly 
turned sleepy and cross.

The author gave her list more or less in detail so that instructors, 
especially young and inexperienced ones, might realize what a wealtli 
of material they have to draw from in organizing a program for any 
special group and what an endless variety of tools they have with 
which to work in order to reach their objectives. No attempt will 
be made to suggest programs for the prepubescent girl, as that 
problem has already been most adequately treated by Dr. Jesse 
Williams, by Dr. Wilbur P. Bowen, by Dr. Elmer D. Mitchell and 
others.! All of the games and activities recommended for the pre- 
pubescent girl may be indulged in by the pubescent and post- 
pubescent girl and are often invaluable as a means for developing 
a “play” spirit in an older group especially if that older group has 
not had much experience in playing games. Such games as dodge 
ball, circle ball, captain ball, punch ball, goal throwing relays may 
also be used as preliminary games for the more advanced group 
games. 
CONTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS. 
Any program intelligently planned will always have its climax. 
This climax may take the form of a contest, an exhibition, a tourna- 
ment, a meet, a demonstration of some kind, tests or examinations. 
It may include a series of demonstrations, and may continue over 
a period of time, or it may confine itself to one day. Care should 
be taken that the demonstration is not the raison d’étre for all the 
preliminary work and play. It is too often the case that the instruc- 
tor begins to work toward the demonstration or exhibition or tour- 
nament on the first day the class meets. This is not always the 
fault of the instructor, as many schools and institutions consider 
the department of physical education the “show” department of 
the institution, and use it as a means of publicity for the institution. 
Such institutions or organizations make the mistake of judging 
the instructor by the perfection of the demonstration and its more 
spectacular features, rather than by the educational value of the 
routine instruction and the number interested and improved. 
Hence, the instructor learns to do the type of thing which will make 
her popular with the administration and goes the way of least 
resistance. 
Whatever the reason for over-emphasizing this side of the activi-

tion. Bowen and Mitchell: The Theory of Organized Play and the Practice of 
Organized Play.

ties of the department of physical education, evil results are certain 
to follow, especially if an admission fee is charged, because: 
1. Only the expert performers are used for the public presentation. 
2. These are given special attention and training and as a rule 
they need it least. The mass is neglected. 
3. Types of events, dances and activities are chosen which will 
interest the audiences, and not those of most value to the girl. 
4. Class hours and practices become rehearsals instead of periods 
for instruction and mass participation. 
5. The mass loses interest and slumps. 
This has given rise to the term “spectator athletics” as opposed 
to “educational athletics.” In order to prevent such a situation, 
types of contests and demonstrations should be worked out which 
will include every member of a group in some capacity. To do this, 
types of events and games should be emphasized which are adapted 
to the varying capacities of the groups and individuals within the 
group. 
Group events should be emphasized and a scheme for group 
scoring employed which will make it possible for even the dullest 
and slowest girl to contribute to the sum total. 
While contests and demonstrations may become an evil with 
harmful results when unwisely planned and administered, when 
intelligently organized they are not only educational in their con- 
tent, but furnish wonderful incentives for improvement in groups 
and individuals and result in much joy and happiness. 
The following list contains suggestions for various types of 
demonstrations, contests, etc., which may grow naturally out of a 
season’s work in any activity or combinations of activities and 
related interests.

  CHAPTER VIII. 
THE ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE 
GYMNASTIC PROGRAM. 
The Type of Gymnastics to be Used.—One of the questions which 
the modern instructor in physical education has to decide if she is a 
thinking individual, is, “What type of gymnastics shall I teach or 
use, and which of the so-called ‘systems’ shall I follow?’ Until 
recently she has had her choice between the Swedish and the German 
systems and the so-called “ American”’ system which aimed to adopt 
to its use the best in both of the former systems. Within the past 
few years, a new school of gymnastics has begun to assert itself, 
born of the movement of recreation and athletics which has swept 
the country. It puts forth its claims based upon the newer child 
psychology which stresses “self-expression” and “satisfying” 
responses and reactions. 
This system of so-called “Natural gymnastics” represents a reac- 
tion against the didactic and pedantic formalism of the Swedish 
and German systems. Through “natural” movements, movements 
which are related to daily living, movements which are concerned 
in the playing of games, through “activities which arise out of 
instinct tendencies” and “activities arising out of necessity or a 
‘Nature’ or industrial interest,” it claims to accomplish all that the 
other systems ever claimed, and to accomplish them with more 
joy and satisfaction and lasting results to the participant. Teachers 
College of Columbia University is one of the foremost pioneers in 
this new field. It is yet too early to judge of the merits of the 
practices of this new theory, but on the face of it it would seem to 
present serious problems of administration where classes are large 
and the space limited. After all, results depend in this system as 
in other systems, upon the character and personality as well as the 
ability of the leader. A real teacher can make a Swedish lesson 
“satisfying” just as a poor teacher can make a failure of a lesson 
in “Natural” gymnastics. It is not so much a question of “con- 
tent” as it is a question of method and presentation. 
An American System.— However, there is no necessity to follow 
in the foot-steps of either extreme. Intelligent teachers in many 
places, influenced by the feeling of limitations of the old schools, 
have been changing to some extent the content of their gymnastic 
(136 )
-P-A-G-E-135
  
ADMINISTRATION OF THE GYMNASTIC PROGRAM 137 
lessons, but to a greater extent their methods of presentation in 
the following ways: 
1. Rigidity of position has been replaced by relaxation while 
in a position of good posture. 
2. Tense muscles and static contractions are no longer empha- 
sized. 
Exercises are used which are more recreational in type. 
More stretchings and twistings. 
Greater amount of “mat work.” 
Stunts and simple tumbling made a part of the lesson. 
Mimetic exercises. 
Tests and the element of competition and play introduced. 
In other words, the tendency is “to avoid extreme formalism 
and its results on the one hand, and mob emotionalism and action 
on the other hand.” This seems to be a sane method of procedure 
and from it all should come eventually a school or system of gymnas- 
tics which will be distinctly American and rational. 
The Danish Gymnasts.—The invasion of the Danish gymnasts and 
their wonderful performances will no doubt have some influence on 
the future of our gymnastics, as not only the type of work which 
they did, but the wonderful results they obtain in a short time com- 
bined with their evident good time while exercising, made a pro- 
found impression upon many physical educators, who saw and 
talked with Nils Bukh and his troupe of boys and girls. Already 
his system of “fundamental gymnastics” is being taught in at 
least two normal schools of physical education in America, and 
two teachers from one of these institutions studied with Mr. Bukh 
last summer at his Peoples College in Ollerup, Denmark. Mr. 
Bukh when he returned to Denmark left behind one of his pupils, 
a girl, who is studying and teaching at one of these same normal 
schools in New York City. 
It is interesting to note that, although her only preparation had 
been three months of gymnastics, one hour a day at Ollerup with 
no training in games or sports, so thorough was that training and 
so finely developed her poise, balance, codrdination, etc., that she 
easily stood at the head of her group in all games and sports at the 
school camp here this past summer. Her “transfer of training” 
was only too evident. 
Of course, the above discussion applies to formal gymnastics as 
taught in a regular class lesson, and not to remedial or corrective 
exercises although even they have felt the influence of the wave 
of recreation and informality.

Suggested Content for a Lesson in “Formal” Gymnastics.— A modern 
lesson then, instead of containing the old stereotyped day’s order, 
might contain a combination of the following: 
1. Marching (tactics, figure marching), running, skipping. 
2. Postural exercises—standing and lying or sitting, for chest, 
back, abdomen, neck—alternated with stretching and _ relaxing 
exercises. 
3. Foot exercises. 
4. Combinations of 2 and 3 with walking and hopping and 
rhythmic steps. 
5. General all-round “hygienic” exercises for big muscle groups. 
6. More stretching and relaxing exercises. 
7. Stunts. 
8. Tumbling. 
9. Apparatus work. 
10. Group games or relays. 
11. Folk dancing—athletic or gymnastic dancing, clogging. 
12. Mimetic exercises. 
13. Tests. 
This is but a general outline in which no attempt is made at the 
correct order as this would depend upon the type of activity chosen. 
The author realizes her boldness in presenting it thus, but believes 
that it will meet with the approval of the majority of physical 
educators. There is no intention to omit wands, dumb-bells and 
Indian clubs, but they merely add to the variety without having a 
distinct physical value. 
Attention is called to the following general points to be observed 
in a lesson: 
1. Each movement should have a meaning. 
2. Avoid rigidity and tenseness—study the effect of the voice in 
this particular. 
3. Do not hold positions for any length of time. 
4, Use constructive methods and language. 
5. Use such exercises as will provide wholesome activity for the 
various systems of the body—the circulatory, respiratory, diges- 
tive, excretory and nervous systems. 
6. The class should be dressed in appropriate costume. The 
present tendency to wear “track pants” should be condemned for 
adolescent and mature girls in public places and public perform- 
ances. The same applies to the wearing of the stockings rolled 
down below the knees. The type of costume should not be de- 
termined by style or whim, but by appropriateness and modesty.  
-P-A-G-E-137
  
ADMINISTRATION OF THE GYMNASTIC PROGRAM 189 
A knicker or a scant bloomer fitting above the knee, and a middy 
blouse made with a small sport collar instead of the large sailor 
collar, combined with black stockings and white sneakers or gym- 
nasium shoes furnishes a very useful and appropriate outfit. 
The following program of “formal” gymnastics at an eastern 
college is typical of the trend of the times: 
October.—Track or group games—depending upon the physical 
condition of the student. (Track is offered in the fall instead of 
spring because of shortness of the spring term and the uncertain 
condition of the field and weather.) Motor ability tests. 
November to April.—Tactics—“‘setting up” work, apparatus work, 
tests, stunts, relays and games. 
April and May.—Tumbling, pyramid building, athletic or gym- 
nastic dancing, clogging. 
From November 1 until April students in need of special atten- 
tion for various defects are assigned to special corrective or remedial 
groups at the “formal” hour. It will be seen that in the above 
program the hour devoted to “gymnastics” is “formal” in name 
only, and the content of the lesson changes with the season. 
The time is not far distant when gymnastics will be used as they 
were in the army—merely for body building, corrective and remedial 
purposes, not as a means of exercise or recreation. They will be 
used for conditioning purposes, to put a girl in proper condition to 
take part in sports, games and other activities to better advantage. 
Even then, their effectiveness will depend upon method and content. 
Barnard College recognizes the fact that some sudents already 
possess the necessary muscular and organic vigor, that they already 
have acquired the poise, coédrdination, control, response, strength, 
ete., which we aim to develop through gymnastics. As soon as a 
student can prove this, she is allowed to elect her type of activity 
and substitute it for her classes in formal gymnastics, unless she 
wishes to continue as a squad leader in a regular class. Conditions 
for being allowed to make such choice are as follows: 
1. Motor ability score 50 points—(normal 32 points).! 
2. “A” in daily work to date—(proficiency, effort and improve- 
ment). 
3. “A” Health grade with good health record. 
4. “A” Posture grade. 
5. “A” Attendance. 
6. “A” Spirit.

7. In college atleast one term before being eligible for consideration. 
This procedure not only rewards the student who has progressed, 
but furnishes an incentive for all to improve, even though that 
improvement may in some instances be linked in their minds with 
a chance to “get out of ‘Gym.’” However, the theory back of it, 
is a sound one. Intelligent students recognize that and look with 
more respect upon the department as a result. It removes from 
“required Gym.” the stigma of arbitrariness for it places the whole 
responsibility directly upon the student. 
The Organization and Administration of Classes in Gymnastics.— 
Organization is, in most institutions and unsatisfactory arrangement, 
especially where classes are large and space inadequate as is apt to 
be the case in large public school systems. The following methods 
for registration may be used: 
1. Student registers for class at the hour most convenient (as in 
some colleges)—a very bad method. 
2. Students are assigned to classes by year in college—freshman, 
sophomore, junior, senior—or by terms in high school—5th, 6th, 
7th, 8th, etc., with some choice of hours. This is a better method 
as girls of the same grade are more apt to have had a similar degree of 
training, more especially in a public school system. Does not apply 
to college freshmen. 
3. Registration according to ability—beginning, intermediate 
and advanced. This is most ideal, although seldom possible. 
Number 2 is the most usual arrangement, but, regardless of which 
is used, the “squad” arrangement will facilitate matters greatly in 
addition to developing student leadership. The class may be divided 
into squads—10 or 12 girls in a squad: 
1. Alphabetically. 
2. According to height. 
3. By selection of the student leaders. 
4. According to ability as rated by instructor or as a result of tests. 
The first three are unsatisfactory from the point of view of pro- 
gress, as having girls of varying abilities in the same group tends to 
discourage the more capable because they cannot advance fast 
enough, and the incapable because they cannot keep up. 
The best arrangement is the division of the class into “A” and 
“B” groups, or “A” “B” and “C” groups if there are enough 
instructors, or if the student leadership is well enough developed, the 
“A’s” being the most advanced, and the “C’s” being the least 
advanced. These groups may again be divided into squads accord- 
ing to ability, each squad being under the leadership of a student
-P-A-G-E-139
  
ADMINISTRATION OF THE GYMNASTIC PROGRAM 141 
leader. This arrangement is an especially good one for apparatus 
work or for tests, stunts, relay games, etc. 
This arrangement may be simplified and furnishes a very effective 
working organization:

  142 ADMINISTRATION OF THE GYMNASTIC PROGRAM 
Only such students should be used as leaders as are responsible 
and qualified. They generally feel their responsibility and the 
honor conveyed and work with interest and intelligence. They 
should receive extra training and instruction between, before or 
after the regular class, or at “class leaders’ period” held once or 
twice a week. Their duties may be as follows: 
1. Call roll. 
Note costumes of girls. 
Assist in teaching, correcting positions, ete. 
Take charge of group at apparatus. 
Catch or assist where type of work demands it. 
6. Help give tests. 
7. Record results of tests. 
8. Help mark students. 
Each squad leader should have an assistant leader who may help 
her when needed, or take her place when absent. Squad leaders 
should be educated to feel that they should not work to develop 
“star” performers, but to bring up the general average of the whole 
group. 
Roll Taking.— Roll taking should be rather a formal proceeding 
and take on the nature of an “inspection.” It may be taken in 
the following ways: 
1. By Calling Names.—This is the most satisfactory method as it 
gives the instructor an opportunity to become acquainted with 
students. It is an unnecessary waste of time in large classes and 
is used by lazy instructors as a means for “killing time.” It should 
be employed only in small classes. 
2. By Numbers.—Each student has a permanent number. 
Beginning with No. 1, each student calls out her number, the 
teacher jotting down on a pad the numbers not called. After class 
she notes these absentees in her record book. 
3. Numbers painted at regular intervals on the floor. Each girl 
assigned to a definite spot and instructor or assistant notes empty 
spots. 
4. Lists are posted and girls check up their own attendance 
before class. Rather a careless method—offers opportunity for 
cheating. 
5. By Squads—each squad leader checks up her own squad. 
This is the best method in a large class as it makes the roll taking 
more personal. 
If the instructor can make the members of her class feel that the 
nine 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  ADMINISTRATION OF THE GYMNASTIC PROGRAM 148 
gymnasium is a laboratory, and that each girl is an interesting exper- 
iment, or if she can make them feel that the gymnasium is a “work 
shop” and that they are all “workers;” if she can give an atmosphere 
of play and joy and cheerfulness to the work; can develop the “team 
idea” in the class; if she can by various devices interest them in 
their individual development and that of the whole group, her 
results will be sure and swift and satisfactory. Girls, like boys, 
like to see and know their rate of progress, and this may be tested 
at intervals by: 
1. Demonstrations. 
2. Exhibitions. 
3. Tests. 
4. Contests. 
Demonstrations are more desirable and educational than exhibi- 
tions for they represent the actual class work done, and can and 
should be participated in by the whole group. Exhibitions represent 
work prepared for a special occasion by a select group. They dis- 
courage the mass. Gymnastic contests may be of several kinds: 
I. Group contests. 
II. Individual contests. 
III. Combinations of the two. 
I. Group ConrEsts: 
1. Intraclass: 
(a) Between “groups” in the same class. 
(b) Between “squads” in the same class. 
(c) Between “squads” in each group—the best squad 
: from group “A” competing against the best 
squad from group “B” and group “C.” The 
second best competing against the second best, 
etc. 
(d) Open competition between all members of a class 
regardless of group or squad unless group “‘A” 
contains the best material. 
2. Interclass: 
(a) The winning squads from each class or group com- 
peting against each other. 
(6) Similar groups (“A” “B” and “C”) from each 
class competing against each other. 
(c) Open competition between all members of classes 
regardless of squads or groups.
-P-A-G-E-142
  144 ADMINISTRATION OF THE GYMNASTIC PROGRAM 
The “classes” referred to above are the “gym.” classes and not 
the academic classes. One academic class may have several “gym.” 
classes representing it, meeting at different hours. In non-academic 
groups they may be “troops,” “clubs,” or organizations of the kind. 
(d) Interclass—between academic classes (freshman, 
sophomore, junior, senior), or between terms (not 
advisable except when worked out along the 
lines of mass demonstration). 
Lack of time and space may not make it possible for large groups to 
come together for “inter” competition. The competition may then 
be held at the class or “gym.” hour within the group and the winner 
picked by a comparison of the total final scores or averages in each 
event or the sum total scores or averages in all of the events. 
The following sample score sheets furnish suggestions for an easy 
and graphic tabulation of individual and group results:

Chart 31 above, shows a type of score sheet which may be used   for motor ability tests or group contests where a graded point system 
has been worked out for scoring various events, or where an arbi- 
trary number of points is assigned for each distance, speed, height 
or for certain accomplishments. This is a convenient form for squads 
and classes. From this score sheet may be obtained the following

to compare different schools, sections of the countries or organiza- 
tions in certain events. The following is a practical application of it 
where three exercises have been chosen in each event and an 
arbitrary point system applied.

A type of contest similar to this and especially adapted to mixed 
groups of mediocre or poor ability may be worked out by choosing 
eight or ten simple exercises on various pieces of apparatus, such as: 
1. Vaulting box or buck at low height. 
2. Vaulting box or buck at medium height.

. High jump 14 feet. 
. High jump 2 feet. 
. High jump 2% feet. 
. Doing simple stunt. 
10. Doing more complicated stunt. 
11. Walking balance beam. 
The girl gets either 1 point or nothing in each event. She either 
does it or she does not do it. For this reason events depending upon 
the judgment of the judges should not be used—just events which 
lend themselves to accurate measurements. 
This can be run off at the regular class period and the averages 
found as in the above type. 
From such a group competitive plan as the first (Chart 32) stars 
naturally emerge. It is a simple matter to allow all girls wko 
obtained a score of a certain number or more to compete in a contest 
at a later period, using more difficult exercise and events. A similar 
scoring plan may be used, or the Olympic Festival plan which is 
used in scoring track and swimming meets. (See Chapter XII.) 
Forming the best gymnastic material in each class into teams 
according to ability also adds interest to that phase of the work. 
Competition could then take place between teams, and the Olympic 
scoring system, or the group average system used. Whichever 
scheme or method is employed, emphasis should always be put 
upon group ability and group attainment, rather than upon indi- 
vidual prowess. Only in that way will it be possible to secure the 
interest of the mass and improve the motor ability of the whole 
group. 
The following events and activities either separately or in com- 
bination, by individuals or groups, may be used in a gymnastic 
contest, demonstration or exhibition, under proper conditions and 
supervision:

Care should be taken in the choice of exercises on apparatus for 
girls and in the type of apparatus used. From the anatomic struc- 
ture of girls, it would seem wise “that she should not practice exer- 
cise involving use of the arms alone, that the more vigorous forms 
should be omitted, and that the emphasis should be upon vaults, 
jumps and climbing with arms and legs both. Hanging and swing- 
ing exercises of the usual kind are undesirable for girls, because, in 
comparison with boys: 
(a) The girl’s weight is lower. 
(b) The girl’s strength is less. 
(c) The danger of a fall is greater. 
(d) Results of a bad fall are liable to be more serious.” 
Exercises should be avoided which are apt to give the body a bad 
jar. 
This suggests the problem of the girl with physical handicaps and 
defects. What is to be her status in this program? Shall she be 
left to her fate in a class of normal girls, to get out of it what she 
can? Shall she be asked to avoid taking part in certain exercises, 
or, shall certain exercises, calculated to improve her defects be given 
to the whole class? The answer is: Special work in special groups 
for these girls. More and more in colleges, particularly, it is beeom- 
ing customary to segregate these girls for special attention adapted 
to their individual needs. Even public schools, private schools, 
Y. W. C. A.’s, ete., are realizing its value and making provision 
for it.

various defects noted, that she has had a schematograph or a 
silhouette or a photo taken, a foot-o-print made—assuming that all 
reports have come in from specialists and all information from every 
source gathered and studied—she should then be assigned to the 
type of work she needs. She may be 
1. A girl otherwise normal but with poor posture. 
2. A girl otherwise normal but with poor feet. 
3. A girl with menstrual disturbance of some sort. 
4. A cardiac case. 
5. Extremely underweight. 
6. Extremely overweight. 
7. Extremely nervous. 
8. Suffering from constipation. 
9. A postoperative. 
10. A curvature case. 
11. A girl with ptosis. 
12. A case of chronic fatigue—although no girl should be allowed 
to enter college who is so tired that she cannot indulge in a certain 
amount of exercise and recreation. Legitimate cases may develop 
after entering college; even those should be dropped after a reason- 
able length of time. 
13. A combination of several of these. 
14. A girl who gains more good from individual attention in a 
small group. ; : 
Order of Procedure.—Girls with slight functional defects may be 
assigned to the regular classes in gymnastic and athletic work, 
given special advice and exercise to be taken at home. The regular 
class teacher can follow up such cases. More serious cases, needing 
more individual attention, should be assigned to special instructors 
for “individual gymnastics.” A method which is becoming more 
prevalent and popular is the division of these cases into two types 
of classes for treatment: (1) Remedial groups, and (2) corrective 
groups. 
(150)
-P-A-G-E-149
  
  INDIVIDUAL WORK 151 
I. Remeprat Groups: 
1. Girls whose defects are more functional and medical in 
nature, such as, 
(a) Malposture. 
(b) Weak feet; falling arches. 
(ec) Constipation. 
(d) Painful menstruation. 
(e) Ptosis. 
(f) Fatigue. 
2. Temporary or transient cases: 
(a) Menstrual period. 
(b) Fatigue. 
(ce) Colds. 
(d) Sprains, cuts. 
(e) Any temporary ailment permitting of some exercise. 
Such work is more effective when the classes are limited to about 
8, but it is possible for a competent instructor to handle 16. There 
should be such a class in a room set aside for the purpose at every 
hour when there is a class in gymnastics or athletics or other activity. 
These cases may then be transferred from the regular class to the 
remedial class and back again without disturbing either the girl’s 
program or the routine of the department. 
The instructor in charge should have a list of those who have 
been temporarily assigned to that class by the medical or corrective 
department, and it is then a matter of education to teach the rest 
of the student body to report to that class during temporary dis- 
abilities, rather than to their regular activity. This eliminates 
almost entirely the issuing of permanent or temporary excuses except 
in exceptional and unusual cases. 
Practically the only apparatus needed for a group of this kind is 
stall bars, benches, heavy mats, mirrors, and wall-boards. 
The general types of exercises needed are: 
. Exercises to improve general condition. 
. General relaxing exercises. 
Local relaxing exercises. 
. Exercises for general muscular development. 
Exercises for local muscular development. 
Stretching exercises. 
Exercises and positions to develop muscle sense. 
Rest periods. 
The atmosphere of this room, although “ business-like” OO SOS CORD
-P-A-G-E-150
  152 INDIVIDUAL WORK 
and quiet, should be extremely informal, with no feeling o\tension 
or hurry. By discussing the meaning and value of each eXercise 
with the girls and its effect, by giving short talks on pertinent sub- 
jects suggested by the different defects, the lesson can be made 
most interesting. Rest and complete relaxation should be em pha- 
sized and the girls taught how to relax. The greater part of the work 
should be taken lying on the mats. \ 
Frequently, girls attending classes of this sort for temporary 
disabilities have begged to be allowed to remain, claiming that they 
got more real concentrated exercise from that class with less fatigue 
than in the ordinary “gym.” class. As a result of frequent remarks 
to that effect, Barnard College has been experimenting with this 
type of work in the regular gymnasium classes during the past year, 
and expects to continue doing so. 
Some of the well-known exercises used for this group work are: 
. Aéroplane exercise. 
. Bicycle exercise. © 
. The Adams bicycle exercise. 
. Scissors exercise. 
. Reverse ladder climbing. 
Forward and backward roll-overs. 
Hand stands. 
. The “Dr. Mosher” exercise. 
. Jumping jack. 
10. Toe-gripping exercise. 
11. Stunts. 
12. Dancing—especially rhythmical. 
13. Games. 
14. Relays. 
II. Corrective Grovur.—To the corrective group should be 
assigned the orthopedic cases, using “‘orthopedic’”’ in the broadest 
sense, to include not only impending or existing deformities, but 
extreme cases of functional disorders and defects, cases of: 
. Extreme kyphosis. 
. Extreme lordosis. 
. Severe menstrual difficulty. 
. Severe constipation. 
Scoliosis. 
. Extreme abnormalities of feet. 
The treatment for cases of this type should be absolutely individual, 
and taken only under careful supervision. Some of the general,

INDIVIDUAL WORK 153 
exercises listed in the remedial group may be applied, but most of 
the treatment should consist of passive, assistive and _ resistive 
exercises and massage, which are taken only with the direct assist- 
ance of the instructor. 
Miss Lillian Drew is an excellent authority on this subject and 
her book on ‘Individual Gymnastics” furnishes invaluable material 
and suggestions. Miss Naomie George in the March, 1924 number 
of the American Physical Education Review also offers a very con- 
structive program. 
The two types of defects most prevalent among girls are probably 
malposture and painful menstraution. 
Menstrual cramp and other disturbances are causing no little 
concern among physical educators and medical people at present 
for two reasons: 
I. Because of the increased participation of girls and women in 
athletics and competition with little or no preparation and physical 
supervision, and the tendency to compete during the menstrual 
period regardless of condition. 
Lack of statistics and scientific facts to support any theory makes 
it impossible at present to state the exact effects of strenuous com- 
petition during the menstrual period upon the health of the pubes- 
cent and postpubescent girl. In the absence of such facts, and until 
actual facts are at hand, it is strongly urged that girls and women 
abstain from strenuous competition and exercise during and just 
preceding the period. 
Dr. E. H. Arnold, Director of the New Haven Normal School of 
Gymnastics, and long an advocator of girls’ participating in all types 
of games and sports during menstruation, in a statement at a recent 
convention held at Atlantic City, not only abandoned his former 
position, but claimed to have statistics to prove that this practice 
not only did not prevent menstrual difficulties but tended to make 
sterile the girl who followed it. Coming from the director of a normal 
school, this admission is very important, as the stand which the 
normal schools take on this important question, in the training of 
teachers, will have a great influence for the future. 
On the other hand, in an article in Mind and Body, September- 
October, 1923, Alice E. Sanderson, B.Sc., M.D., B.S., Cheltenham, 
quoting from the Presidential address of Dr. Sarah Gray of Notting- 
ham, warns her hearers against “the dangers of the periodical 
rest,’ and suggests that exercise may be the future treatment for 
both menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea. Certainly, the tendency 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    154 INDIVIDUAL WORK 
to stay in bed during the first or second day of the period should 
be discouraged, and the girl pampered less. 
II. Not only because of the extremely large percentage of girls 
and women who suffer from menstrual disorders of some kind, but 
because their seems to be a universal feeling among girls that pain 
or discomfort of some kind is to be expected and endured. When 
questioned during physical examinations girls will admit that they 
have pain, but “no more than is to be expected,” or “no more than 
the ordinary girl has.” 
The sooner we can make girls and women realize that the men- 
strual activity is a normal physiological function, and to be treated 
as such, the sooner will we have a generation of girls free from it. 
Girls and women do suffer from pain and discomfort at the menstrual 
period; there is no doubt about that. The question is, how can we 
cure it and prevent it? 
First, what are some of the probably causes—direct or indirect— 
of this malady? 
1. Poor posture, causing a relaxation of the abdominal walls, 
with consequent poor circulation and sagging of abdominal organs. 
2. Constipation, causing local pressure and general disability. 
3. High heels, causing a downward sagging of the abdominal walls 
and displacement of the uterus. 
4. Worry. 
5. Omission of the warm bath at the period, which in itself stimu- 
lates circulation and tends to relieve congestion. 
6. Lack of proper exercise—before, and during the period. 
7. Wearing of tight bands and corsets, which interfere with circu- 
lation and cause a downward pull or pressure upon the organs. 
8. A general run-down condition, with consequent poor circula- 
tion, low vitality, ete. 
9. Disease or displacement of the organs concerned with men- 
struation. 
The First Step is to Find Out the Cause. 
According to Dr. Celia Mosher “most menstrual disturbances are 
congestive in type and are produced by (1) ‘the upright position’ 
(Mascati); (2) alteration of the normal type of respiration by disuse 
of the diaphragm and of the abdominal muscles; (3) lack of general 
muscular development; (4) inactivity during the menstrual period; 
(5) psychic influences.”! Of course, inversely, the proper treatment 
1 Celia Duel Mosher, M.D.: Women’s Physical Freedom.
-P-A-G-E-153
  INDIVIDUAL WORK 155 
would include advice about exercises to remove the above condi- 
tions, proper habits of hygiene, correct clothing, worn correctly, 
and the proper mental hygiene. 
If congestion is the immediate cause, then the treatment should 
be aimed at that condition. Dr. Mosher suggests a simple exercise 
which is known as the ‘‘ Mosher exercise” and which has been found 
to be very effective. Her description of it is as follows: 
“All tight clothing having been removed, the woman is placed 
on her back, on a level surface in a horizontal position. The knees 
are flexed and the arms are placed at the sides, to secure perfect 
relaxation. One hand is allowed to rest on the abdominal wall with- 
out exerting any pressure, to serve as an indicator of the amount 
of movement. The woman is directed to raise the hand by lifting 
the abdominal wall without straining, then to see how far the hand 
can be lowered by the voluntary contraction of the abdominal 
muscles, the importance of this contraction being especially empha- 
sized. This exercise is repeated ten times night and morning, in a 
well-ventilated room preferably while she is still in bed in her night 
clothing. She is cautioned to avoid jerky movements and to strive 
for a smooth rhythmical raising and lowering of the abdominal wall. 
This exercise should be taken twice daily every day in the month, 
including the time of menstruation. The bladder should always be 
emptied before the exercises are begun. The breath must not be 
held while the woman is doing the exercises. If she is inclined to 
make the mistake of holding her breath, let her keep her mouth 
open, breathing naturally.” 
Dr. Mosher believes that the results are due to four things: 
“(1) The overcoming of the effect of gravity upon the circulation, 
in the upright posture, by the restoration and tone of the abdominal 
muscles and diaphragm; (2) the proper support in this normal posi- 
tion of the abdominal organs by strengthened abdominal muscles; 
(3) the correction of constipation by the massage of the intestine 
brought about through the descent of the diaphragm and the con- 
traction of the abdominal muscles; (4) the doing away with the idea 
that menstruation is an illness, thus eliminating fear and worry.” 
The surest way of reducing the “incidence of dysmenorrhea” 
throughout the country, is by broadcasting a program of simple 
advice and simple exercise which will reach every school girl, and 
through them their mothers. 
Miss Alice E. Sanderson, with the sanction of the Medical Officers 
of Schools Association (England), has gotten out a little pamphlet
-P-A-G-E-154
156 INDIVIDUAL WORK 
which contains some sane suggestions and advice. She calls atten- 
tion to the fact that the monthly period is not a malady, but a 
natural function, and that therefore at that time a girl or woman 
~ should feel quite well and be free from pain or any unpleasant sensa- 
tions. She advises the observance of the ordinary rules of cleanli- 
ness and hygiene, and states that there is no risk in the use of soap 
and water in spite of prejudice. She advises, if possible, a warm 
bath throughout the period, and if this is impossible, suggests that 
the whole body, including the feet, be sponged with soap and 
water. She calls attention also to the fact that exercise, especially 
in the open air is essential to health and points out the importance 
of continuing during the period exercise of some kind in order to 
prevent discomfort and pain later on. She states that a slight head- 
ache, backache or feeling of fatigue at that time may be cured by 
a brisk walk, light games or work in the house or garden involving 
bending. She warns that the giving up of all exercise, especially 
lying down, may cause pain and increased severity. She points 
out that any ailments associated with the period are more easily 
cured while the girl is young and suggests that when the girl feels 
ill and unable to carry on her regular occupation, she consult a 
physician. She also mentions the fact that there should be a daily 
bowel action as at other times.

CHAPTER X. 
DANCING. 
Dancina@ should have an important place in all programs of 
physical education, and no girl’s physical education should be con- 
sidered complete without participation in some form of dancing. 
The main types—including esthetic, classical, character and folk, 
are well known. Just as the “school of natural gymnastics” has 
come into being as a protest against the old formal systems, so in 
the past few years, a school of “Natural” or bare-foot dancing has 
been advancing its new theories as a protest against the more 
formal types of technique and expression found in the old type esthetic 
and ballet dancing. This newer type places more emphasis upon 
the spirit of the dance and less upon the “acrobatic technique.” 
There is the same danger to be guarded against here as in the natural 
gymnastics—that in the endeavor to place the emphasis upon spirit 
and expression the “instrument” may be neglected, and a “wobbly” 
dance be the result. 
It is as a rule very difficult to persuade the athletic type of girl 
to indulge in dancing—she is generally self-conscious, and the 
arbitrary positions and lines demanded by the esthetic dance of the 
past frightened her. The very naturalness of the newer bare-foot 
dancing appeals to her, and she skips and leaps and frolics with 
the same abandon and unconsciousness as her more esthetically 
inclined sister. 
A broad system of physical education will offer in its program 
some of both schools, the kind depending upon the objectives of 
the dance program. The theories and practices of the “Natural 
school” are having a wholesome effect upon all so-called esthetic 
dancing, as shown by the differences in the technique now being used, 
the softening of all lines, and of a greater emphasis upon the purely 
dramatic and pantomimic side. 
Dancing is the expression of self through bodily movement, 
generally accompanied by music of some type. This brings into 
consideration three factors to be reckoned with: (1) The body; 
(2) the mind or “soul,” and (3) the music. The body with its 
(157)
-P-A-G-E-156
  158 DANCING 
muscles must be so developed that it has the necessary strength 
and the proper coérdinarion and control; it must become an instru- 
ment or tool under perfect control of the mind and soul. This 
necessitates not only the study and practice of the “technique of 
dancing,” but a study of painting, sculpture, pantomime and 
dramatic expression, which implies a further study of costuming, 
dyeing, lights and scenic effects. 
The mind furnishes the intelligence and the soul furnishes the 
spirit or “fire,” without which the dancer becomes a mere mannikin 
or automaton. 
The music sets the rhythm. This implies a study of rhythm and 
musical composition. The music should be inspirational—all cheap 
and tawdry forms should be avoided. Through the music the 
student should come in touch with the great masters and learn to 
know and appreciate good music. 
The dancer may be taught to express herself in several ways— 
having acquired a good working technique: 
1. She may “learn a dance” which someone else has composed, 
and attempt to interpret the composer’s meaning and spirit, just 
as the pianist in playing another’s composition attempts to interpret 
the thought and mood of the composer. 
2. She may choose her music, and through the dance interpret 
the music as she understands it. 
3. She may choose a theme or an idea, select the music which she 
wishes to use to express the idea, and through the music work out 
her theme. It may be a simple dramatic episode; a bit of pan- 
tomime, or a complete dance drama; it may be a solo dance, or a 
festival or pageant in which hundreds take part. 
The two latter methods are of more educational value, as they 
develop the mind and the “feeling,” the intelligence and the soul. 
For recreational purposes as well as for their historical signifi- 
cance the various types of folk dancing will always be valuable 
and enjoyable. No program would be complete which did not 
include either as a part of the gymnastic lesson, or as regular classes 
in dancing, instruction in acrobatic dancing, gymnastic dancing, 
athletic dancing—eccentric dancing of some sort—and clogging, 
jigging or soft shoe dancing. Girls of all ages love it. It can be 
indulged in and enjoyed without first acquiring a certain skilled 
technique. For pure joy, recreation and exercise, the latter forms of 
dancing are highly recommended. 
Social dancing should be valuable, but there is no doubt that
-P-A-G-E-157
  
DANCING 159 
it has degenerated. Instead of being “motion animated by a sense 
of beauty” it has become grotesque and dominated by the purely 
sensuous. One of the chief causes of this, is undoubtedly the type 
of music being used for social dancing. If the music could be 
strictly censored, the dancing would change its character. The two 
most objectionable types of music are the “jazz” and the music 
with hypnotic rhythm. According to Joseph Lee! “The trouble 
with jazz is that it depends for its attraction on the direct, almost 
physical, effect of certain kinds of sound. It is, whether in a good 
or bad sense, purely sensuous. It is the kind of noise which is used 
to heighten the intensity of orgies among savage tribes. It is not 
adapted to civilized society and should not be there admitted— 
least of all as an accompaniment to the dancing of the young people. 
“Another kind of undesirable music is the too hypnotic rhythm— 
that is to say the kind of music that puts the mind to sleep and dulls 
the ordinary social inhibitions. Dancing to be of value must be an 
art, motion dominated by a sense of beauty and expressive of it. 
It is in proportion as it ceases to be a positive art and sinks to the 
level of a morally passive experience that it becomes a danger. It 
is as art, in the mutual consciousness of expression in rhythm, and 
the beauty of motion to which a very pronounced sublimated sex 
satisfaction is incidental, that dancing is of value.” 
Objectionable dance positions are another development of the 
modern dance. The Superintendent of West Point solved the diffi- 
culty by insisting on a “day-light zone” between the dancers. 
The objectionable features of the modern social dancing are 
well known. Physical directors and instructors, by dealing frankly 
with the matter, by emphasizing the esthetic side of dancing, by 
teaching correct forms of dancing and of dancing positions, and by 
endeavoring to cultivate among their girls a taste for good music, 
can do much toward improving a bad situation. It will require 
the sympathy and coéperation of all school and institutional author- 
ities, departments and organizations within and without the school, 
and a campaign of education to develop a social consciousness and a 
public opinion regarding the matter.

  CHAPTER XI. 
SPORTS AND GAMES. 
General Principles Governing.—The athletic girl has come to stay. 
Athletics for women are no longer a fad, but a well-recognized 
factor in the better development of women, and, incidentally, of the 
race. The question is, shall the “athletic girl” be a type and an 
objectionable one, loud and boisterous, with a tendency toward 
masculinity in dress as well as in speech and in general conduct, 
or shall she be just a strong, healthy, normal girl—the rule and not 
the exception—a little saner, a little better balanced, and a little 
more capable of taking her place in life because of the training 
which she has received on the field or in the gymnasium? 
Shall our basket-ball games and other sports be just noisy, 
aimless activities, serving to pass the time pleasantly and perchance 
to improve the girl physically, or shall they be but a means to an 
end, and that end future generations of girls well-balanced and well- 
developed—mentally and morally as well as physically. 
The future of physical education, of sports and games for girls 
and women, depends upon the answer to that question. The answer 
will be largely determined by the attitude of schools and colleges, 
by their vision, and by the type of men and women they engage 
as instructors. The gymnasium and the field offer the finest oppor- 
tunity for character development yet discovered; “the gymnasium 
and the playing field are the best correctives of the insurgent sex 
impulse of adolescence yet devised, for girls as well as boys.” 
The answer will be largely determined by the way in which we 
avoid for girls the evils which have tended to inhibit the good 
results which might have followed from a development of men’s 
athletics. 
Are girls’ sports to be commercialized? Are they to be profes- 
sionalized? Where is the emphasis to be placed—upon the winning 
or upon the playing upon the records of the few or upon the partic- 
ipation of the many? Are they to be conducted for the enter- 
1 Prof. Willystine Goodsell, Teachers’ College, Columbia University: The 
Education of Women.
-P-A-G-E-159
  SPORTS AND GAMES 161 
tainment of a curious, though interested, public, or for the devel- 
opment and pleasure of the participants? These are important 
questions, and they introduce big and vital problems, which are 
giving concern to all intelligent women and many sane men who 
are interested in the educational value of athletics and recreation, 
who see the inherent possibilities for bad as well as for good, and 
who recognize the dangerous drift which women’s athletics are 
taking. 
In the first place, institutions and organizations must realize 
that athletics, that all sports and games, are a part of physical 
education, and should be a part of the physical education program 
—not a separate program to be controlled by a separate set of indi- 
viduals, those individuals often students of immature age and 
without much experience, or biased and one-sided coaches; secondly, 
this physical education program must be a part of the regular pro- 
gram of the institution, on a par with the other departments, subject 
to the same rules and regulations as other departments. It wants 
and needs this educational supervision because of the educational 
possibilities inherent in the conduct of sports and games. ‘Thirdly, 
student assistance and coéperation should be encouraged and util- 
ized in every possible way under proper guidance. The modern 
trend is for the sensational, there is a desire to play, uncontrolled 
by the proper leadership. Therefore the training and development 
of student leaders is a positive educational procedure, and will do 
much toward developing the right student consciousness and the 
right attitude on the part of the public. 
In general, the attitude felt toward men’s games and_ sports 
must be changed, for girls sports must be given their proper place, 
not only in the school program, but in the general scheme of life. 
The “spectator” must be made a secondary shadowy considera- 
tion, the participant and her education the important thing. “‘Spec- 
tator athletics” is a term which has grown up in connection with 
men’s athletics as opposed to “educational athletics.” 
“Spectator athletics” aim to entertain the audience—they neces- 
sitate the use of such events and type of play as will entertain them 
and make them feel that the event was “worth the price of admis- 
sion.” This presupposes the participation in the events and 
games of only such well-trained girls as will by their performances 
interest the audience. 
“Educational athletics” aim at (1) sports and games adapted 
to girls and their needs; (2) conducted in such a way as to allow the 
11 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  162 SPORTS AND GAMES 
greatest number to participate, and to develop an active play 
spirit in larger numbers of girls, and (3) motivated by joy and love 
of play, not play for the purpose of making a record or beating an 
opponent. 
“What are the outstanding features of a good athletic organization? 
“The organization and administration of an adequate athletic 
program for girls and women has four important aspects; and 
according to the adequacy of the provision for these four aspects, 
the efficiency and value of any department may be judged: 
I. Program of Activities.—Variety, opportunity for universal 
participation, attention to individual needs. 
II. Promotion of Activities.—Incentives used, point systems, 
schedules for games, tournaments, meets, awards, tests, 
class or group scoring systems, publicity, athletic associa- 
tion, clubs. 
ILI. Protection of Activities.—Provision for physical examina- 
tions, health inspections, follow-up, training, eligibility 
tules, O.K. systems, costumes, publicity. 
IV. Provision for Activities.—Equipment, space, instruction, 
time allotment.”! 
It was further suggested by Miss McKinstry that this outline, 
more fully developed, be used as a basis for a rating scheme, whereby 
departments, organizations, clubs and institutions could be given 
a definite rating and assigned to a definite class. The growing need 
of organization and standardization in physical activities for girls 
and women is apparent to every observer. Such a scheme could 
undoubtedly furnish a means for standardizing more fully the work 
in physical education, and would furnish a definite incentive for 
improving equipment, organization and administration. A com- 
mittee appointed by the Women’s Division is working at present 
upon this scheme. 
In the meantime, it might have a salutary effect if each organiza- 
tion and institution would inventory its own program and depart- 
ment, using this suggested outline as a basis, in an effort to see what 
their own strength and weaknesses are. As an aid, the author 
offers the following guiding principles, some of which over-lap: 
1. Place the emphasis on participation rather than upon competi- 
tion. 
2. Emphasize extensive rather than intensive training. 
1 From an unpublished report made to the Women’s Division of the N. A. A. F., 
April, 1924, by Miss Helen McKinstry.
-P-A-G-E-161
SPORTS AND GAMES 163 
3. Emphasize all-round ability rather than concentration on one 
sport or game, especially during adolescence. 
4. Emphasize the group and group prowess rather than the indi- 
vidual and individual accomplishment as such. 
5. Choose and adapt and adopt games, sports and events which 
are suitable to girls. Do not imitate or take over bodily boy’s 
programs. 
6. Emphasize form and control rather than extreme height, dis- 
tance or speed. As control is gained power may be added. “Never 
to sacrifice control for power” is a pretty good life principle. 
7. Stress games and sports which can be indulged in all through 
life as well as those which can be indulged in only under certain 
special conditions. 
8. Emphasize the development of student initiative and respon- 
sibility in the conduct of all activities. Under proper supervision— 
let them manage all games and sports. Wherever possible without 
detriment to the activity and the rest of the participants, allow 
them to assist in giving instructions, officiating, ete. Train them 
to do this. Encourage them in originating programs and projects. 
9. Stress the recreational side of all sports and games, the play 
side. Teach your girls to love the race for the running of it, not 
just the winning; to love the game for the joy of playing it, not 
just to defeat an opponent. Teach them to want to win, and to 
play the type of game which will win, not just to defeat, but to know 
the satisfaction which comes from a thing well done. ‘To quote 
from Mr. John Tigert, the United States Commissioner of Educa- 
tion,! “I think the trouble all comes under one great evil; not money, 
the love of which we are told in the Bible is the root of all evil, 
but something that corresponds to money as the fundamental root 
of evil in American ideals, and that is the idea that in order to take 
part in physical training we must have competition. and that the 
aim is to win. The idea that winning is the principal function in 
our interscholastic contests is the root of all evil.” 
10. Do not emphasize intensive competition, for it is through 
that that the majority of evils arise. Do not emphasize the making 
or breaking of records—it is harmful not only to the girl but to the 
sport. Girls and women need participation in sport with emphasis 
upon general competition, not participation upon the part of a few 
for the purpose of specralized intensive competition. Competition 
is the key-note of organized games and sports. It is competition

which brings out the various qualities and traits in a player; so com- 
petition is in itself a valuable force to be reckoned with when con- 
structively organized and conducted. It is only when it is abused 
and over-stressed or wrongly conducted that it becomes harmful 
in its results and tendencies and destructive in its influence. The 
newer idea of physical education for girls and women does not aim 
to lessen competition, but rather to increase it, to take it out of 
the hands of the few and place it within the reach of the many— 
always with the keen realization that it is a two-edged weapon 
which can cut as deeply one way as the other. Beneficial results can 
follow only when it is properly organized, controlled and supervised. 
If we are going to develop bodily strength and vigor through our 
sports and games; if we are going to develop alertness, quickness of 
decision, accuracy of judgment, and such moral and social qualities 
as fairness, justice, unselfishness, loyalty, codperation, honor, 
courage, and all of the qualities of good sportsmanship, (and we 
are all agreed that under proper conditions these qualities can be 
developed), the organization and control of athletics must be taken 
out of the hands of the untrained, out of the hands of professional 
coaches, out of the hands of those whose end and aim is “the cham- 
pionships” and the making and breaking of records, and invested 
in instructors and leaders who have been trained, who believe 
and who are unafraid. The time is at hand when men and women, 
schools and institutions, clubs and organizations, must take their 
stand under one banner or the other. The pit which the men have 
dug for themselves and out of which they are trying so hard to 
climb, has been dug partly by “administrative double-mindedness.” 
“Tt appears to be due not so much to positive offenses by presidents 
and faculties as to failures of these guardians of the college to take 
opportunities, to meet obligations with clean and decisive action.” 
Only clean and decisive action on the part of men and women will 
prevent girls and women from falling into the same pit. 
The Athletic Instructor.—As is the “coach,” so is the “coached,” 
and so is the student body, is an accepted truth. The athletic 
director or instructor should have all of the qualifications described 
in the chapter under “Leadership,” only she should possess them 
to the n-th degree. 
“Coach” versus “Instructor.” —One of the big causes of some of the 
evils surrounding men’s athletics in the past has been the seasonal 
coach, hired at enormous salary to . . . . develop a winning 
team. One of the remedies suggested by college presidents and sane  
-P-A-G-E-163
  SPORTS AND GAMES 165 
physical educators has been the abolishment of that individual as 
such. He is not to blame entirely for conditions, he is but the 
product of his time, the product of keen competition between insti- 
tutions, the product of the desire on the part of institutions and 
organizations, of alumni and the public for a winning team, the 
result of a system which has emphasized records and made a fetish 
of championships. The term “coach” is associated with specialized 
athletics, with the training of a few for certain special performances. 
It has a professional taint. Alexander Meiklejohn says: 
“But the difference between ‘teaching’ and ‘coaching’ is one which 
no genuine teacher will allow to be obscured. The teacher develops 
the independence of his pupil; the coach takes away that independ- 
ence. The teacher is preparing the pupil in general by trying to 
give him understanding of the field in which his activities may lie. 
The coach is preparing him for specific tests, specific occasions, is 
getting him ready for a particular contest which is coming and 
coming soon. For the winning of that contest the coach takes 
responsibility, whether it be an entrance examination or a game 
of foot-ball. The coach studies the actual situation, finds out 
just what the factors are, determines what shall be done with 
respect to each, issues his orders as to what shall be done and what 
not done. It is the business of a teacher to develop in a pupil power 
and intelligence; it is the business of a coach to win a contest. I 
know few things more amusing than a college debate in which a 
‘coach’ has told his automata what to say. But quite as tragic is 
the spectacle of a group of boys using their arms and backs and legs 
at the command of another man’s wits, and supposing at the same 
time that they are playing a game.” 
Lest its odium prevade women’s athletics, lest it carry over with 
it some of the evils associated with it, the word “coach” has pur- 
posely been omitted from the organization of physical education for 
girls and women, and the terms “instructor,” “special instructor,” 
“athletic director” or “leader” substituted. It is to be hoped that 
all of those associated with physical activities for girls and women 
will appreciate this danger and this distinction and help to cultivate 
the use of these other terms until better ones can be found. 
In brief, the things to look for in an athletic instructor are: 
“play spirit, ability to play as well as to teach; belief in the educa- 
tional value of games, a personality which has capacity for leader- 
ship and ability to inspire, and a character which, in addition to 
true culture and a spirit of fairness, possesses the somewhat rare
-P-A-G-E-164
166 SPORTS AND GAMES 
quality of high moral courage.”! To this might be added a profes- 
sional-mindedness and the fact that the instructor should be a 
woman. 
Reasons why men coaches should not be used: 
1. Men teach men’s practices in games, are governed by men’s 
standards and men’s ideals. 
2. Men do not realize the physical limitations of girls. 
3. Men cannot frankly discuss health problems and conditions 
with girls. 
4. Men invariably train for special events and contests. 
5. Men have no patience with incapable or weak girls. 
6. Men have, as a rule, not felt the educational attitude toward 
athletics. 
The carrying out of an educational scheme in athletics demands: 
1. That the athletic instructor shall be elected or appointed in 
the same manner as the other members of the department. 
2. That she shall have the same permanence of appointment. 
3. That she shall be in residence throughout the year. 
4. That she shall have other duties in the department. 
5. That she be paid by the college or institution only and at the 
same rate as the other members of the department and the institu- 
tion. 
A policy of this sort will go far toward preventing the profes- 
sionalizing and commercializing of athletics for girls and women, 
and toward the placing the emphasis where it belongs. 
Possibly the average reader may wonder if all of these precautions 
are necessary, and why all of the discussion. The following is one 
answer and one argument. 
A summary of reports on girls’ basket-ball, 1923-1924, in the first 
class high schools in a certain progressive southern state, elicited 
the following significant information:

When one realizes what these figures mean, that they are positive 
evidence that in one state alone 69 girls’ teams played 629 games, 
that almost half the teams had received no physical examination, 
that about two-thirds of the teams played on the same night and 
the same floor as the boys, which meant mixed audiences, with 
all the attendant excitement, strain, noise and tension of such an 
occasion, and when one realizes that these were adolescent girls, can 
the reader doubt that there is cause for alarm? To the credit of this 
state it must be added that since the report was made, the state and 
sectional tournaments for girls have been abolished, girls’ rules 
have been officially adopted, and in the near future only women 
instructors will be employed. 
The various types of activities and events approved for girls 
and women have already been listed (Chapter VII), but a good 
athletic organization will not only offer types of activities and com- 
petition for those who are physically sound and more courageous, 
who are skilled and are “‘in training,” but will make a special effort 
to provide competition in some form for those who are physically 
defective, or more timid, who are not experts and have had little 
or no opportunity for training. The slogan should be “a game for 
every girl.” This brings us directly to the consideration of the 
second and third aspects of a good organization—the promotion of 
activities and the protection of activities. 
Participation and competition should go hand in hand, and 
should be almost synonymous terms. The confusion in the minds 
of most people arises from the fact that when the term “competi- 
tion” is used, it is generally associated with intensive or specialized 
competition. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  CHAPTER XII. 
COMPETITION. 
Types of Competition.—Organized competition may be conducted 
in four different ways, each presenting different ways of scoring 
and producing a winner: 
I. Round robin or percentage method. 
II. Tournament or elimination method. 
III. Olympic festival plan. 
IV. Group scoring system, and combinations of these, especially 
of I and II. 
I. The Round Robin or Percentage Method is used where it is 
desirable to keep up the interest all through a season. This is the 
fairer method, as in this each team or individual plays every other 
team or individual once, and no one is eliminated. It is sometimes 
customary to repeat the round, so that each competitor has a chance 
to meet her opponent twice. The “standings” of the various com- 
petitors may be posted after each game or at certain intervals. 
The results are announced in per cents. The percentage of any one 
team is found by dividing the number of games won by the total 
number of games played, carrying the results out to three decimal 
places. 
Example where four teams are competing A, B, C and D, 
arrange teams as follows: 
Istdate — A — C 
B— D 
A-B oF 
A-C B-c 2d date -— A — D 
AD? “BD C-D Bi geke 3ddate — A — B 
c—D 
Or, the games may be played on six separate days. 
The total number of games played is 6. The largest possible per 
cent is 1000.

Dae = | - | 2 | 0 | 000 
When a greater number of teams is entered, scheduling is not 
quite so simple. Using for example eight teams, the schedule may 
be worked out as follows: 
Arrange the teams in order as indicated in the diagram below. 
Beginning with A-H, in the lower left-hand corner, draw a line 
diagonally through the letters up to the right, taking in B-G, C-F, 
and D-E. Repeat with B-H and A-G, and so on. All the teams 
covered by the same line may compete at the same time, giving a 
possibility of 4 games being played simultaneously. Where only three 
teams appear on a line, one of the two teams not included at either 
corner may be added. Where 4 games are played simultaneously, 
seven dates would be needed. Where only 2 games are played at 
once, fourteen dates would be necessary, as there would be 28 
games in all. 
    € oa F B<F c oF 
Il. The Tournament or Elimination Method.—Where it is desir- 
able to settle a championship in a shorter time, the tournament 
method is used, as for golf and tennis tournaments. It is not advis- 
able to use the tournament for deciding basket-ball championships 
for girls, or even volley ball, unless only a few teams are entered, 
as it requires too much concentrated play of a strenuous and fatigu-
-P-A-G-E-168

ing nature. The winner emerges by eliminating all other contes- 
tants. She obtains her order in the list of entries by drawing a slip 
of paper from a receptacle. Each slip contains a letter or number, 
and the letter or number drawn determines her order of play. 
Players or teams are paired by chance. As soon as their names 
are drawn they are entered on a sheet of paper opposite that letter 
or number. When the number of contestants is a perfect power 
of two—2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64, the scheduling is simple, as the players 
pair off in order.

When the number entered is not a perfect power of 2, a rule 
is followed in pairing off, in order to reduce the number to a perfect 
power of 2 in the second round, by using a system of “byes” in the 
first round. 
Rule.—The number of “byes” will be equal to the difference 
between the number of competitors and the next higher power of 2; 
when 15 are entered, there will be 1 bye (16—15=1) when 25 are - 
entered, there will be 7 byes (32—25=7); when 45 are entered, 
there will be 19 byes (64—45=19). The number of byes is always 
divided so that half of them appear at the top half and half at the 
bottom. In the case of an odd number, the greater number of byes 
appears at the bottom. In order to conserve space, the illustration 
will contain 9 entries. 16—9=7; so there will be 7 byes, 3 at the top 
and 4 at the bottom.

  The weakness of this method of competition lies in the elimina- 
tion of players from competition. This may be overcome partially 
by organizing “consolations” or losers’ tournaments, containing 
all of those who are defeated in the first round. The losers of each 
round may do the same thing, each player as she is defeated dropping 
down into a place in the consolation tournament (Chart 37). 
III.— The Olympic Festival Plan is best used where the champion- 
ship is to be decided in one or two days—although the group scoring 
plan may be used for the same occasion. This plan is commonly 
used for track and aquatic meets, and may be used for gymnastic 
contests. In it, an arbitrary number of points is assigned for the 
best performance, second best, etc. Ordinarily in track meets, 
first place receives 5 points, second place 3 points and third place 
1 point. The sum total of an individual’s points determines her 
score, and the sum total of all the individual points in a special 
group or organization determines the final score of that organization. 
The winner being the individual or group receiving the greatest 
number of points. (For example, see “Track Meets,’ Chapter XIV.) 
IV. The Group Scoring System is of later origin, and has been 
adopted with a view to encouraging the weaker members of a group 
to enter competition, and to lessen the emphasis put upon record 
making and breaking and specialized training. By its use, emphasis 
is put upon group scoring and the combined efforts of the group.

A. Example of Sum Total of Individual Effort.—A point system 
for motor ability may be used similar to the one shown in Chart 38. 
These points may be obtained at an open contest held on a single 
afternoon, or they may be obtained at intervals during the term or 
year, as fast as the individual succeeds in performing the various 
events. At a given time, the score of the class would be the sum 
total of all the points obtained by all the individuals in that class, 
or the average number of points. To this might be added points

B. Example of Sum Total of Group Effort in Sports and Games.— 
According to this method all points earned by class or group teams 
are counted toward the score for the class in that special activity. 
The class ranks in the all-round championship according to the 
total number of points obtained from and competition in ail the 
activities. The more teams a class can enter in any given activity, 
the larger its score tends to become. ‘This stimulates interest in 
developing second, third, fourth and fifth teams, etc., and tends to 
raise the standards of the mass. First teams in each sport should 
compete against each other, second teams against second teams, ete. 
As a result there would be a first team champion with consequent 
second, third and fourth places; a second team championship with 
second, third and fourth place, a third team champion, etc. As all 
participating players have an opportunity to contribute toward 
the scoring, the tendency ought to be for the stronger players in a 
group to assist the weaker ones in an effort to help raise the class 
standard. On the surface, this seems to be placing an undue 
emphasis upon scores and might undoubtedly, if used to the extreme, 
produce evil results. This, as in all cases, depends upon the proper 
organization and supervision.

COMPETITION 175 
The following scheme for scoring is offered and is recommended 
because every team entered whether winning or losing has a chance 
to obtain points. It seems complicated but is in reality quite simple 
and easily handled. First, there is a key sheet stating the number 
of points each team can make in each activity, depending upon its 
ranking at the end of the tournament or season. This key sheet 
can apply to each activity. In order to simplify the chart, only 
four teams in each class in each activity are considered, with a con- 
sequent first, second, third and fourth place for each team.

This shows a possible maximum of 1120 points to be distributed 
in each sport among 16 teams. Each class should have its own 
official score sheet posted in a conspicuous place. 
A freshman score sheet at the end of a year might read as follows:

team won first place in basket-ball. A glance at the key sheet 
translates that into 100 points. The third team in baseball won 
second place, or 70 points, the fourth team in swimming won first 
place, or 70 points, etc. 
The final score sheet should contain the sum total points for all 
teams in each activity. Transferring the freshman scores to this 
sheet and assuming parallel scores for the other classes, we have: 
CHART 42.—FINAL CLASS SCORE SHEET.

Second place = 4 points. 
Third place = 3 points. 
Fourth place = 2 points. 
The number in the upper left-hand corner represents the ranking 
of that class in that sport, the number in the lower right-hand corner, 
the value in points. 
Interpreted, this score sheet means that the sophomore class 
won the basket-ball championship, the senior class the baseball and 
swimming championships; while the senior class won the all-round 
championship, with the sophomore class second, freshman, third and 
juniors fourth. 
To these scores it is becoming customary to add points for good 
sportsmanship also. 
A permanent score board for group or class scores posted in a 
conspicuous place tends to maintain the interest over a longer 
period. The up-keep of this board should be one of the duties of the 
athletic association. Instead of actual figures being used, a system 
of colored cards tends to make it more graphic. Each color repre- 
sents first, second, third or fourth place, and can be slid into a groove 
under the name of the sport and opposite the name or numerals 
of the class, with a note below indicating the point value of each 
color.

All of the above scores might be kept on score sheets. 
The point system is another device for scoring individual attain- 
ment. This scheme is especially popular in colleges and is gener- 
ally fostered by the athletic association. Its aim is to encourage 
the development of all-round athletic or general ability by reward- 
ing it with points. In some institutions the basis for admission to 
membership in the athletic association is a certain number of athletic 
points. This is a rather narrow viewpoint, as the athletic associa- 
tion should be a democratic organization whose membership is open 
to any girl within the walls of the institution. The non-athletic 
girl should be especially encouraged to join. In other institutions 
these points are made the basis for an “honor membership” or a 
certain number of points is rewarded by an award of some kind, a 
pin, a sweater, a blanket, a letter or emblem of some type. The 
latter type of awards, or those of little intrinsic value, are the ones 
to be encouraged. 
The American conference of American College Women, at its last 
meeting, made the following recommendations: 
1. The members of the conference shall use the 100 point basis 
for the standardized point system, awarding 100 points for a class 
team or the equivalent of a class team. 
2. All points standardized or not must be arranged on a 100 point 
basis. 
3. All points in the standardized system shall be awarded as 
follows: 
100 points for membership on a class team. 
50 points for membership on a class squad. 
15 points for membership on a second team. 
It is interesting to note that no mention is made here of “ Varsity” 
teams.

A point system recently worked out by the Athletic Association 
of Barnard College aims to reward not only the athletic type, but 
is an attempt to interest girls in all-round development, and to 
encourage every type of girl in many types of activities. In addition 
it aims to emphasize health, posture and motor ability as such. 
While the number of points offered for health and posture is small in 
proportion to those offered for activities, it nevertheless represents 
a step in the right direction, an educational point of view and a most 
commendable and encouraging departure. The “Varsity B” 
referred to is for competition with Teachers College, which, like 
Barnard, is a part of Columbia University.

IV. Combined Plan.—Where the number of teams entered is so 
many that the playing of a round robin would be difficult, plans 
I and II may be combined. Each class, for instance, might use the 
tournament plan in securing a winning team or individual; then 
these several winners might meet in a round robin in order to decide 
the final championship. A number of variations or applications of 
the above suggestions may be worked out and adapted to the indi- 
vidual situation and needs. 
These schemes may be applied either within a group or between 
groups—when within a group it is called “intracompetition” when 
between groups it is “intercompetition.” There may be 
Intragroup or Intergroup competition. 
Intraclass or Interclass competition. 
Intraschool or Interschool competition. 
The Jatter type is known as “intramural” and “intermural” and 
it is the question of intermural and interschool competition for 
boys and men which has been agitating leaders in education as well 
as leaders in physical education for the past few years. It has only 
just begun to be a problem in the conduct of sports and games for 
girls and women and as yet has not assumed very great proportions. 
It has been through interschool competition undoubtedly, and the 
emphasis placed upon results that most of the evils associated with 
men’s athletics have arisen, although the results from intracompeti- 
tion might be as bad if not properly supervised and controlled. 
The arguments pro and con are many and can in no wise be better 
covered than in the following statement by Miss Mabel Lee, Director 
of Physical Education for Women in Beloit College, Beloit, Mich-

. Through contact with strangers as their 
guests or as their hostesses they would 
acquire a training in social values and a 
broadening of experience which cannot 
be approximated in playing games with 
but home teams. 
. Through the greater interest in inter- 
collegiate games they would feel the more 
keenly defeat and victory so that their 
instructors would have an opportunity 
to drive home to them the lessons to be 
derived from defeat and victory more 
quickly and more sharply than in the case 
of intramural or interclass activities. 
They would work harder, thereby acquiring 
better muscular control, codrdination and 
increased vigor, also increased mental 
activity in quickened thought reactions. 
. They would acquire alertness, initiative, 
clear thinking, decisiveness, self-discipline 
to a much greater degree than they would 
through lesser interest in home activities. 
(b) Disadvantages. 
i They would be apt to get more “physical 
straining than physical training,” showing 
the most perhaps in nerve fatigue. 
The emotional strain attendant upon com- 
petition would be injurious. 
There would be ever present the tendency 
to take an active part in activities during 
the menstrual period for the sake of the 
trip and the honor of having piayed. Also 
the members of a team who can be the 
least :pared by their team would be urged 
to keep secret their condition so the team 
would suffer no handicap through their 
absence, the desire to play the best players 
being so much more intense in inter- 
collegiate games than it would ever be in 
a series of interclass or intramural games,
-P-A-G-E-179

. The intensive training that would come 
with participation in these activities 
would lead to the neglect of other school 
work due to increase of interest in the 
activity or through physical fatigue from 
this intensive training, which would make 
the girl unable to give proper attention 
to the other work. 
The one idea to win at any cost would be 
bound to creep in, bringing in its wake 
the inevitable qualities of rowdyism, unless 
the activities and the players themselves 
are carefully supervised by competent and 
conscientious instructors. 
With the usual rush of college life there is 
no time that might rightly be given up for 
the intensive training intercollegiate activ- 
ities demand. 
An undesirable newspaper notoriety would 
be sure to come to the girls; especially 
undesirable would be the mention of the 
fact that certain players are to be out of 
certain games, as is always the case when 
men players are out for physical disability 
of any sort.

2. They may not get physical straining but 
would be quite apt to get little physical 
training through neglect if the teaching 
staff had to turn out varsity teams. It 
seems impossible that the “many” would 
not suffer neglect for the “few.” No 
school has sufficient staff or equipment to 
carry out a correct program for both the 
“many” and the “few.” 
The many girls neglected are sure to be the 
very girls who need the most training for 
their physical welfare.

of athletic and department funds spent 
upon their training, so high would be the 
expense of intercollegiate teams. 
II. Errecr uron TrEacuine Srarr. 
A. Advantages. 
1. With a keener interest felt by the players in inter- 
collegiate activities than in interclass games, 
the instructor would be enabled all the more 
quickly to instill into the girls ideals of true 
sportmanship, and the more quickly to drive 
home to them lessons to be learned from defeat 
and victory. 
2. The incentives to make intensive study of the game 
and its possibilities would be greater. 
B. Disadvantages. 
1. It would limit certain instructors’ field of contact 
to those who would try out for teams, so occu- 
pied would be their time with the preparation of 
varsity teams. 
The results of intensive study of the game would 
reach only the few. 
38. It would seriously curtail their activities in other 
directions because of the increased time that 
would be needed for developing school teams. 
4. The work of preparing teams would fall upon the 
regular teaching staff since it seems improbable 
and also undesirable that special “coaches” 
would be engaged by schools to care for this 
work and this would of necessity mean the 
neglect of very important work that should be 
done for the “many” in order to carry on this 
work for the “few.” 
. The increased expense necessary for intercollegiate 
activities would handicap a department in its 
work in other and very important directions.

logical way to interest the vast majority in 
athletics and they would surely suffer if inter- 
collegiate sports should enter the program. to ou

not ‘professionally-minded’ and does not have

a director who speaks from actual experience 
with intercollegiate competition. 
IJ. Errecr upon rue Activities. 
A. Advantages. 
1. Intercollegiate competition would lead to more 
intensive study of the technique of the game 
and its possibilities. 
The type of playing demanded of a team prepared 
for competition would raise the standards of 
interclass playing within the school. 
B. Disadvantages. (Varsity type in particular.) 
1. It would prevent the adaptation of the game to 
meet the needs of the average girl since the more 
intense interest would be in the game the stronger 
girl could play. 
2. It would limit the number actually playing the 
game since only a few can be chosen for teams. 
3. It would tend to produce “fans” out of the major- 
ity, rather than players. 
4. It would lessen the field of interest in the activity 
through a lessening of the number that can be 
chosen. 
5. The highly undesirable commercialism of men’s 
athletics would be sure to creep in. 
6. It would tend toward professionalism, a most 
undesirable thing. 
7. It would produce enemies for the game because 
of disapproval of the physical strain upon the 
participants. 
8. The entrance of women into the intercollegiate 
athletic world would take us still farther away 
from the goal physical educators seek—the goal 
of “play for play’s sake” and everyone on the 
field instead of in the grandstand.

2. It would create a greater interest among the stu-

B. Disadvantages. 
Quoting one of the leading physical directors for women 
Ht np o of the Middle West. 
“Men’s athletic departments are struggling now 
with their difficult situation and are not as yet 
making much progress. In the present unhealth- 
ful state of public and alumni opinion, inter- 
collegiate athletics for women would be subjected 
to the same pressure from the outside as are 
men’s %. ¢., to make the game a good spectacle, 
to have a highly specialized team, so that it 
would be worth paying to go to see, and very 
likely, worth betting on. 
. “The handling of gate receipts and other business 
aspects of intercollegiate competition would tend 
to develop the director into a business manager 
rather than an educational expert. 
“The gate receipts themselves would tend to 
develop extravagance in the department and 
the tendency to expend a disproportionate 
amount of money for the training of the few 
who earn the gate receipts. 
“Tt would mean a reorganization of the physical 
education staff as well as its class work so that 
the intercollegiate squad could be trained sepa- 
rately, questions of eligibility could be passed 
upon and other intercollegiate matters could 
be properly dealt with. 
“The desire to produce a winning team would 
tend to make students and faculty alike forget 
that the game should serve as a recreation for 
its participants as well as for the spectators. 
It is already a criticism of men’s athletics by 
English observers that they take them too 
seriously and magnify their importance, for- 
getting on the other hand, the spirit of “play 
for play’s sake.”

6. “Most of us constantly see ways in which we could 
do more follow-up work, check up our proced- 
ures by more careful records and more study of 
those that we do keep, see ways of adapting 
work more carefully to individual needs, of 
stimulating intelligent effort in posture correc- 
tion, in health habits, ete. Many of us are 
compelled to teach_larger classes than permit 
of real instruction because we have not the 
floors or the staff to permit of organizing more 
classes. Under these conditions it is inevitable 
that attention to intensive competition should 
curtail the development of our departments in 
what to me seem more essential directions. 
7. “My experience at. ————— College where 400 
students take part in the preliminary competi- 
tions and 200 compete on field day, and where 
juniors and seniors whose sport is entirely vol- 
untary, place a team in each of eight different 
sports on the field, has intensified my belief that 
a general interest can best be obtained without 
intercollegiate competition. Our 32 different 
teams in the eight sports bring out this large 
number because no girl is a member of more 
than 1 team.” 
V. SUGGESTIONS. 
1. The few sturdy girls in school who might easily 
have the surplus energy to expend on inter- 
collegiate activities and a great interest in sports 
as well could be utilized to advantage as assist- 
ant instructors for intramural sports. This 
would give them incentive enough to study the 
game intensively. 
2. Impromptu games might satisfy those who 
demand intercollegiate activities and they might 
in a measure do away with some of the criticism 
of matches previously scheduled and practiced 
for. 
3. The intercollegiate interclass type of activities is 
free of a great number of the disadvantages 
mentioned above and may be free of even more  
-P-A-G-E-184
  186 COMPETITION 
of them if the colleges competing are very close 
neighbors, hence eliminating travel and absence 
from classes. It might easily be free of even 
other disadvantages if the schedules would call 
for two series of games only a week apart so 
that the players who are disqualified for physical 
reasons for the first series might not be tempted 
to keep secret their condition and play when they 
should not, since they know they will have an 
opportunity to play the following week. 
4. Telegraphic competition in track, archery, and 
rifle shooting which is gaining in popularity 
is certainly free of most of the disadvantages 
claimed for the usual form of intercollegiate 
activities and might well be fostered for the sake 
of any advantages it may offer.

IV. Conciusions. 
Intercollegiate athletics for women. 
1. Do not exist in the leading colleges of the United 
States except in a very limited number of schools. 
2. The varsity type of competition (that type in which 
one team is chosen from the entire college to 
play against such a team from another college) 
is found only in a very few eastern and southern 
schools. 
. The interclass-intercollegiate type of competition 
(that type in which a team is chosen to represent 
each of the four classes to play against the cor- 
responding four class teams from another school, 
the seniors playing the seniors, the juniors the 
juniors, etc.), is found exclusively in the far 
western colleges. 
4. The telegraphic meet (that type of competition in 
which the two teams hold their contests, each 
on their home campus and compare records and 
scores by telegraph) -is found almost exclusively 
in the middle western colleges. 
5. There is no tendency at the present on the part 
of physical directors to change their attitude 
of disapproval of the varsity type in particular 
to one of approval. The large majority of them 
have been opposed to it for years, and are still 
opposed to it, while on the other hand the few 
who have changed their views recently have in 
every case changed from an approval to a dis- 
approval of it. 
6. Of those who have had actual experience with inter- 
collegiate athletics for women, 93 per cent are 
opposed to them.

. Even those who favor them, claim that they are 
not ardent advocates with the exception of two, 
whereas the great majority who are opposed 
are quite ardent in their opposition. 
. The directors in a large proportion of these col- 
leges state that their athletic association leaders 
are also opposed to intercollegiate athletics. 
Of the colleges that do have intercollegiate com- 
petition only two directors approve of the var- 
sity type. 
Of the colleges where the interclass-intercollegiate 
form of competition exists, all the directors 
approve of it although they declare themselves 
against the varsity type. 
The schedules of this form of competition show 
only a limited number of contests for any one 
school so that there is actually only a very little 
of even this type of competition entered upon by 
the few colleges which do support it. 
TO SUM UP. 
Reasons for: 
1. Good fun. 
2. Develops higher degree of ability among the few. 
3. Promotes social intercourse—may cause good feeling— 
may cause bad. 
Against: 
1. Too much time, space and energy devoted to the few, 
usually at the expense of many. 
2. Too great a strain, nervous and physical, on the few. 
3. Interferes with academic work. 
4. Gives false values—an end in itself. 
5. Puts instructor in false position. 
This report is most encouraging as far as the colleges are concerned 
and shows conclusively that there is no issue there at present. The 
main issue is in the secondary schools, public and private, and among 
industrial groups and girls’ clubs. 
The situation in the public schools is due probably to the fact that 
the schoolmen and men coaches have been in control; although more 
recent correspondence with principals and supervisors in various
-P-A-G-E-187
    COMPETITION 189 
states would seem to indicate that in many instances it is the 
“coaches” themselves who are urging or weakly agreeing to inter- 
school competition for girls, often backed by the business men 
of the community, while the principals are opposed to it. Private 
schools are often actuated by a desire for prestige, they benefit by 
the publicity and they fear the loss in popularity by not allowing 
inter-competition when the girls demand it. In either case, the sit- 
uation is bad because the participants are adolescent girls. 
The condition in industrial groups is somewhat different. For 
the most part, the girls have been exploited by men; in some in- 
stances by their managers, coaches and employers, who realized the 
advertising value of a winning team. In some localities, girls have 
been hired for their ability to play basket-ball and threatened with 
dismissal for refusing to take part in games sanctioned and arranged 
by the company which employed them. Not only that, but they 
have been forbidden by the company to join or form an athletic 
association or organization which disapproves of inter-competition 
and “spectator athletics.” This situation is especially to be 
lamented, because these girls need proper supervision and training 
and the influence of right standards and ideals. Their participation 
in “open meets,” particularly in the East, where they have been 
coached by men, trained by men and where they have adopted the 
conventional “track pants” worn by men athletes has been espe- 
cially deplorable. To a certain extent, the women in physical educa- 
tion are to blame. The girls needed exercise and recreation. The 
men, who were already organized, offered them the only type they 
had any knowledge of or experience with, and the girls were willing 
victims. 
While it is generally conceded that the nervous and physical 
strain occasioned by organized competition is in direct relationship 
to the importance of the stakes, and that therefore “inter” compe- 
tition would be more serious in its effects than “intra,” owing to 
lack of scientific data and statistics, it has never been possible to 
estimate the exact amount of harm done to a girl by excessive and 
strenuous competition. Dr. E. A. Arnold has recently published 
the results of a series of experiments carried on at his Normal School 
since 1913.1 His experiments tend to prove that competitive organ- 
ized games have a decidedly unfavorable influence upon the function 
of menstruation and therefore upon fertility, and that the growing 
1 E, H. Arnold, A.C.: Athletics for Women, American Physical Education 
Review, October, 1924,  
-P-A-G-E-188
  190 COMPETITION 
tendency toward “inter” competition is a dangerous one for girls 
and women for that reason. His conclusions are: 
“Whenever economic efficiency is the deciding feature, restriction 
of menstruation is profitable; whenever fertility is of importance, 
it is undesirable. This would seem to interdict a regimen of exercise 
which will diminish the menstrual function for that period in a 
woman’s life when she should be fertile. . . . What is needed 
is a restriction in quantity of competition in any form. What is 
further needed is to diminish the quality of competition by taking 
the intensiveness of competition out of women’s athletic efforts. 
The exploitation of oncoming womanhood by national or inter- 
national competition is a menace to womanhood, the magnitude 
of which one can only contemplate with a shudder,” 
Those are strong arguments and are especially significant at the 
present time when all sane and educationally-minded persons in 
positions of influence or authority, when all women or men who are 
in any way associated with girls in sports and games should be 
exerting their influence in opposition to “inter” competition and 
the dangers it involves. 
There may be individual instances where there is inter-competi- 
tion of a harmless variety, but it is not the present alone which must 
be considered. Foundations for the future of athletics for girls are 
now being laid and there must be no weak spots in those founda- 
tions. The American girl does not have behind her the traditions 
of sport which her English sister has. The American girl as well 
as her brother, takes her sport too seriously, plays too intensely; 
she is not satisfied at present to play for the fun of playing; there 
must always be a championship of some kind at stake. 
When we have thoroughly established the principle of “sport for 
sport’s sake,” of play for the fun of playing; when we know that 
as a Nation our girls and women are patticipating in recreation and 
sport, and that the desire to defeat an opponent is overshadowed 
by the joy of the game itself, then we may begin to consider spe- 
cializing somewhat with the few who stand out as experts among 
their kind and allowing them to meet under favorable circum- 
stances experts from other groups. That time has not yet arrived 
and the danger we are running of ruining our whole scheme is con- 
stantly before us in the spectacle of men’s athletics and their prob- 
lems. 
Big principles are established and ideals attained only by personal 
sacrifice on the part of some, only by curtailing personal and insti-
-P-A-G-E-189
COMPETITION 191 
tutional freedom at times for the sake of the greater good for the 
greater number. For example: A certain school in California may 
operate under ideal conditions for inter-competition, but a school in 
New Jersey not realizing that its own conditions are not ideal and that 
those in the California school are, copies the school in California 
with bad individual and group results and a resultant step back- 
ward for athletics for girls. The same may happen where individuals 
pattern their conduct after that of others whose background and 
training and experience are entirely different. 
So, for the sake of example, for the moral effect, individuals and 
institutions ought to be willing to relinquish voluntarily certain 
pleasures in the next few years, to give up participation in any 
competition which may be wrongly interpreted or misunderstood 
and which might tend to confuse the issues at stake. 
This is but a sketchy outline of some of the conditions which 
hastened the organization of the Women’s Division of the National 
Amateur Athletic Federation, at a meeting in Washington in April, 
1923. This meeting was called by Mrs. Herbert Hoover, one of the 
vice-presidents of the N. A. A. F., and the only woman on its execu- 
tive committee. The occasion of the meeting was this alarm felt 
by women over the increasing amount of open competition being 
indulged in by girls and women, the lack of proper supervision and 
control of girls’ and women’s physical activities, as well as the lack 
of opportunity for recreation among types and groups of women. 
Its aim is not to dictate or to control, but to supervise and advise. 
It hopes to accomplish its work by correlating all existing agencies 
and programs, by standardizing programs and procedures, by 
working for educational standards and ideals, and to make possible 
a nation-wide program for girls and women which would reach every 
girl and woman. It adopted at this time, practically as its creed 
the following resolutions, with which the convention felt it had 
voiced its absolute disapproval of “inter-competition.    
RESOLUTIONS. 
“1. Resolved: That it be noted that the terms “athletics” as 
used in this conference has often included the problems connected 
with all types of non-competitive as well as competitive physical 
activities for girls and women. 
Whereas, the period of childhood and youth is the period of growth 
in all bodily structures, and
-P-A-G-E-190
  192 COMPETITION 
Whereas, a satisfactory growth during this period depends upon 
a large amount of vigorous physical exercise, and 
Whereas, the strength, endurance, efficiency, and vitality of 
maturity will depend in very large degree upon the amount of vigor- 
ous physical exercise in childhood and youth, and 
Whereas, normal, wholesome, happy, mental and emotional 
maturity depends in large part upon joyous, natural, safeguarded big 
muscle activity in childhood and in youth. 
2. Be It Therefore Resolved, that vigorous, active, happy, big 
muscle activity be liberally provided and maintained and carefully 
guided for every girl and boy, and 
That all governments, village, county, state, and national, estab- 
lish and support adequate opportunities for a universal physical 
education that will assist in the preparation of our boys and girls 
for the duties, opportunities and joys of citizenship and of life as a 
whole. 
3. Resolved, that there be greater concentration and study on the 
problems and program of physical activities for the prepubescent 
as well as for the adolescent girl. 
4. Resolved, in order to develop those qualities which shall fit 
girls and women to perform their functions as citizens 
(a) That their athletics be conducted with that end definitely in 
view and be protected from exploitation for the enjoyment of the 
spectator or for the athletic reputation or commercial advantage of 
any school or other organization. 
(b) That schools and other organizations shall stress enjoyment 
of the sport and development of sportsmanship and minimize the 
emphasis which is at present laid upon individual accomplishment 
and the winning of championships. 
5. Resolved, that for any given group we approve and recom- 
mend such selection and administration of athletic activities as 
makes participation possible for all, and strongly condemn the 
sacrifice of this object for intensive training (even though physio- 
logically sound) of the few. 
Whereas, a rugged, national vitality and a high level of public 
health are the most important resources of a people. 
6. Resolved, that (a) competent women be put in immediate 
charge of women and girls in their athletic activities even where the 
administrative supervision may be under the direction of men.

and women in the hands of carefully trained and properly qualified 
women. é 
7. Be It Therefore Resolved, that the teacher training school, 
the colleges, the professional schools, and the universities of the 
United States make curricular and administrative provisions that 
will emphasize. 
(1) Knowledge of the basic facts of cause and effect in hygiene 
that will lead to the formation of discriminating judgments 
in matters of health. 
(2) Habits of periodical examination and a demand for scien- 
tific health service, and 
(3) Habits of vigorous developmental recreation. To this end 
we recommend that 
(a) Adequate instruction in physical and health education be 
included in the professional preparation of all elementary 
and secondary school teachers. 
(b) Suitable instruction in physical and health education 
be included in the training of volunteer leaders in organized 
recreation programs. 
(c) Definite formulation of the highest modern standards of 
professional education for teachers and supervisors of 
physical education and recreation, 4nd the provision of 
adequate opportunity for the securing of such education. 
8. Resolved, that in order to maintain and build health, thorough 
and repeated medical examinations are necessary. 
9. Resolved, since we recognize that certain anatomical and phy- 
siological conditions may occasion temporary unfitness for vigorous 
athletics, therefore effective safeguards should be maintained. 
10. Whereas, we believe that the motivation of competitors in 
athletic activities should be that of play for play’s sake, and 
Whereas, we believe that the awarding of valuable prizes is detri- 
mental to this objective, 
Be It Resolved, that all awards granted for athletic achievement 
be restricted to those things which are symbolical and which have 
the least possible intrinsic value. 
11. Resolved, that suitable costumes for universal use be adopted 
for the various athletic activities. 
Whereas, we believe that the type of publicity which may be given 
to athletics for women and girls may have a vital influence both 
upon the individual competitors and upon the future development 
of the activity.

12. Be It Resolved, that all publicity be of such a character as to 
stress the sport and not the individual or group competitors. 
The Committee on Athletics of the American Physical Education 
Association in a “report on recommendations regarding intra- and 
inter-stitutional athletic activities” proceeded to indorse especially 
resolutions 4, 5, 6, 10 and 12, with the following additions of their 
own: 
Whereas, we endorse these resolutions, and 
Whereas, we believe them to express the fundamental policies upon 
which any competition in athletics for girls and women should be 
based, 
1. Be It Therefore Resolved, that no consideration of inter- 
institutional athletics is warranted unless— 
(a) The school of institution has provided opportunity for 
every girl to have a full season’s program of all around 
athletic activities of the type approved by this committee. 
(b) That every girl in the school or institution (not merely 
the proposed contestants) actively participate in a full 
season of such activities and take part in a series of games 
within the school or institution. 
(c) These activities are conducted under the immediate 
leadership of properly trained women instructors, who 
have the educational value of the game in mind rather than 
winning. 
2. Resolved, that in cases where 
A. The above conditions obtain and proper responsible 
authorities (preferably women) deem it desirable edu- 
cationally and socially to hold inter-institutional com- 
petitions, the following requirements are observed: 
(a) Medical examination of all participants. 
(b) No gate money. 
(ce) Admission only by invitation of the various schools, 
or institutions taking part, in order that participants 
may not be exploited. 
(d) No publicity other than that which stresses only the 
sport, and not the individual, or group competitors. 
(e) Only properly trained women instructors and 
officials in charge. 
Norre.—The committee feels that it is questionable whether inter- 
institutional athletics are every warranted for children under high 
school age, except when such competition is conducted by the chart 
or communicating by mail, telegraph, ete.”  
-P-A-G-E-193
  
COMPETITION 195 
“Your committee was unable, in the short time available, to pre- 
pare further recommendations for presentation at his meeting, or 
for the proper elaboration of these here presented, but among other 
matters which they desire to emphasize and for which they wish 
further time, are the following: 
1. The undesirability of traveling away from the home town 
or community to take part in competitions, especially in the case of 
girls below adult age. 
2. The necessity of limiting the number of games. 
3. Desirability of working out some type of meet which 
(a) Is an incident of the general program of athletics 
for all. 
(b) Is a logical combination of a season’s program. 
(c) Is not confined to one type or activity. 
4. The desirability of working out a program of activities in 
which the competing unit is a group, and not an indi- 
vidual. 
Finally, the committee does not wish it to be inferred from these 
recommendations that it is advocating or attempting to promote a 
policy of interinstitutional games.”’ 
As this Washington meeting was attended by the leading women 
in all types of organizations interested in the physical welfare of 
girls from all over the United States, a big blow was dealt inter- 
competition for women, and steps taken which have since resulted 
in still more united action for a constructive program by and for 
girls and women. These resolutions were made the basis of active 
membership in the organization, and since that time have been 
endorsed by over 250 organizations, representing public and private 
schools, colleges, universities, normal schools, school boards, depart- 
ments of physical education, athletic associations, the Y. W. C. A., 
Y. W. H. A., girl scouts, camp-fire girls, girls friendly societies, 
settlements, neighborhood clubs, sectional societies of physical 
education organizations, health organizations, the Life Extension 
Institute, industrial organizations—a list too long to publish, all 
bound together to work for an ideal. 
Subsequently it was realized that some members were still encour- 
aging intercompetition under the conditions stated in the second 
set of resolutions, although those statements were not intended by 
either the committee or the convention to give approval. 
At its first annual meeting, held in Chicago in April, 1924, the 
resolutions were restated in a more simple form, and again unani- 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  196 COMPETITION 
mously accepted. It was found impossible to make a concrete 
statement disapproving of intercompetition in general, as corre- 
spondence and observation had brought to light a big difference 
in the understanding of the meaning of “competition.” It was 
found that there are many “community days” held in localities 
in which intercompetition of a very harmless nature is indulged in, 
and there was no wish or intention to discourage such. It is hoped 
that the spirit of these resolutions applied sanely will control the 
situation properly. 
By-Laws, Women’s Division NationaL AMATEUR ATHLETIC 
Feperation oF America. Srecrion X. PLatrorm. 
ApopTep ApriL, 1924. 
A. The Women’s Division of the National Amateur Athletic 
Federation of America believes in the spirit of play for its own sake, 
and works for the promotion of physical activity for the largest 
possible proportion of persons in any given group, in forms suitable 
to individual needs and capacities, under leadership and environ- 
mental conditions that foster health, physical efficiency and the 
development of good citizenship. 
B. To accomplish this ideal for women and girls, it aims 
1. To promote programs of physical activities for all members 
of given social groups rather than for a limited number chosen for 
their physical prowess. 
2. To protect athletics from exploitation for the enjoyment of 
the spectator or for the athletic reputation or commercial advantage 
of any institution or organization. 
3. To stress enjoyment of the sport and development of sports- 
manship, and to minimize the emphasis placed on individual accom- 
plishment and the winning of championships. 
4. To eliminate types and systems of competition which put 
the emphasis upon individual accomplishment and winning rather 
than upon stressing the enjoyment of the sport and the development 
of sportsmanship among the many. 
5. To restrict recognition for athletic accomplishment to awards 
which are symbolical and which have the least possible intrinsic 
value. 
6. To discourage sensational publicity, to guide publicity along 
educational lines and to stress through it the sport rather than the 
individual or group competitor.
-P-A-G-E-195
  COMPETITION 197 
7. To put well-trained and properly qualified women in imme- 
diate charge of athletics and other physical education activities. 
8. To work toward placing the administration as well as the 
immediate leadership of all physical education activities for girls 
and women in the hands of well-trained and properly qualified 
women. 
9. To secure adequate medical examination and medical follow- 
up advice as a basis for participation in physical activities. 
10. To provide sanitary and adequate environment and facilities 
for all physical activities. 
11. To work for such adequate time allotment for a physical 
education program as shall meet the needs of the various age 
groups for growth, development and maintenance of physical fit- 
ness. 
12. To promote a reasonable and sane attitude toward certain 
physiological conditions which may occasion temporary unfitness 
for vigorous athletics, in order that effective safeguards shall be 
maintained. 
13. To avoid countenancing the sacrifice of an individual’s health 
for the sake of her participation in athletic competition. 
14. To promote the adoption of appropriate costumes for the 
various athletic activities. 
_ 15. To eliminate gate receipts. 
16. To discourage athletic competition which involves travel. 
VARIOUS FORMS OF GROUP COMPETITION. 
When the various possibilities for group competition within an 
institution or organization are considered, there seems little need 
for going outside the institution or organization for competition, 
except in the exceptional instances where the organization is so 
small that it has not within itself possibilities for competition. 
The following suggestions for intramural competition are made 
with the following conditions in mind—that in so far as possible 
the competing groups be (1) of approximately the same age (physio- 
logically) and (2) of the same degree of ability and training: 
I. Wrratn Iystrrrurions: 
1. Intercollege (between different colleges within the insti- 
tution, as arts, medicine, education, etc.). 
2. Interdepartment (between departments within a college 
or school).
-P-A-G-E-196
  198 COMPETITION 
3. Interclass (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors). 
(a) First teams in each class competing against 
first teams, second teams against second 
teams, etc. 
(b) Between “all-star” teams from each class. 
(ec) Odd-even first and third years against second 
and fourth). 
Intraclass. 
(a) Color teams (have the whole class divided into 
teams of equal ability). 
(b) “Gym.” classes. 
(c) Sport classes—beginning and advanced. 
(d) “Serubs” vs. “scrubs.” 
5. Miscellaneous. 
(a) Intersociety. 
(b) Interclub. 
(ec) Interdormitory. 
(d) All-star vs. alumne. 
(e) All-star vs. faculty. 
(f) Campus vs. non-campus. 
(g) Giants vs. pygmies. 
(h) Blondes vs. brunettes. 
The same principle may be adapted to social organizations, set- 
tlements, Y. W. C. A.’s, industrial groups, ete. 
Another form of interschool competition being advocated by 
a few enthusiasts is the “Telegraphic Meets.” In this, the con- 
testants do not meet each other in person, but the meets are held on 
the same day and the results telegraphed to each other. This 
seems like a harmless variety, and on the surfact presents no objec- 
tionable feature. However, it might tend to stimulate interest in 
making and breaking records, which is one of the evils to be avoided. 
It was discussed and disapproved of by the Eastern Society of Direc- 
tors of Phyical Education in Colleges for Women as being a possible 
“entering wedge” for intercollegiate competition. 
ELIGIBILITY RULES. 
I. Qualifications for participation in a sport (this refers not to the 
making of teams or entering meets, for championship purposes, but 
merely to join a class or squad for play and practice for purely 
recreational purposes). 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  COMPETITION 199 
A girl should be in such physical condition as will make it possible 
for her to indulge in that particular activity without harm, and with 
benefit to herself. Basket-ball practice would require better phys- 
ical condition than archery or indoor baseball, but a girl might be 
permitted to engage in basket-ball practice, to play basket-ball, 
who could not take part in championship games or be on a regular 
team, where the strain is intensified and multiplied. There is that 
distinction to be observed. 
II. Qualifications for being on a team (this refers to championship 
teams, tournament teams, or events counting toward champion- 
ships). 
Five things should be taken into consideration: 
. Health and physical condition. 
. Ability. 
. Faithfulness at practice. 
. Spirit. 
. Scholarship, and standing in the department of physical 
education. 
1. She must be in good physical condition for that particular 
sport, game or event. The requirement for the 60-yard dash, for 
example, would be more strict than that for target throwing. This 
should be decided by the medical officer and the instructor in charge 
of that group, or the physical director. 
2. She should be skilful in her particular game or event. Where 
there are second, third, fourth, etc., teams, the degree of skill 
demanded would be less for each group. 
3. Mere ability is not enough. A star player or performer must 
attend practices. The minimum standard for attendance should 
be high enough to insure a girl’s being in physical trim for that 
particular event. Enough hours per week should be required to 
develop skill and ability along the line needed. This too might 
vary, but for almost all sports and events the minimum should be 
two practices per week. This might be interfered with in some 
sports by the menstrual period. 
4. No girl deserves to represent her group, nor should a group 
be represented by a girl who is not a good sport, does not codperate 
and does not try to improve. Good sportsmanship should always be 
a requirement for making a team. 
5. No girl with an “F” in academic work or in physical education, 
or who is doing consistently poor work in either or both should be 
allowed to take part in championship events. For the sake of the e 
2. 
3 
4. 
5. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  200 COMPETITION 
educational benefits, she should be allowed to practice, and take 
part in informal competition, but should be deprived of representing 
her class or group, not only because she does not deserve the honor, 
but because she ought not devote the time and energy required. 
III. Qualifications for Receiving Awards.—School or class letters, 
numerals or emblems should represent the highest type of athletic 
endeavor and should be given only to those who typify the best in 
sport as well as unusual ability. An emblem—such as a numeral 
or letter—which has a purely sentimental value—should never be 
given for just winning an event or for ability alone. The girl should 
be made to realize in every possible way that the wearing of that 
emblem sets her aside to be looked up to—not only for her skill, 
but for her character; not only as an athlete, but as a constructive 
force in the community. 
Every candidate for such an award should be made the subject of 
careful consideration by the instructor concerned and the captain 
of the team or the leader of the organization, and should be weighed 
and judged according to these four conditions. 
(a) Participation in at least part of the game or event. 
(b) Ability shown in the game or event, during the season. 
(c) Faithfulness at practice. 
(d) Spirit, loyalty, sportsmanship. 
By giving this value to the awards and thus making them hard to 
obtain, the standards of all sports will be raised. An occasional 
medal or cup might be the reward for skill only. 
Bars or bands may be added for years of service on a team, or 
stars added to the emblem. . Some recognition should be given to 
substitutes and “scrubs” in the shape of bands or bars or ribbons. 
Sometimes being on a team carries with it the honor of wearing 
the class tie, or a middy or stocking of the class or team color, or 
school color. Such regulation and traditions should be carefully 
encouraged and upheld. 
The more emphasis we can put upon the immaterial side of our 
games and sports, the more we can develop not a sentimental atti- 
tude, but a feeling of sentiment toward our awards, the nearer we 
shall come to realizing an ideal of “sports for sport’s sake.” 
There may be too an occasional award representing and empha- 
sizing ability only, such as: 
1. Expert swimmer’s emblem, given for passing certain tests. 
2. Red Cross Life Saving emblem, given for passing life saving 
tests.
-P-A-G-E-199
  COMPETITION 201 
3. Gymnastic awards for accomplishing certain gymnastic feats. 
Whatever the award, the emphasis should be put upon the goal, 
not the award. 
GAMES. 
The type of game a girl plays, the frequency with which she 
plays, and the length of time spent playing each time, all depend 
upon the girl’s age, physical condition and past experience. This 
must be given more than ordinary consideration where the pubescent 
girl is concerned, and even where the postpubescent mature girl is 
concerned, if she is not in the habit of exercising systematically. To 
indulge in strenuous activity spasmodically or at long intervals with 
no exercise in the interim might be as harmful in its effects for the 
mature girl as for the immature girl to continually over-exercise. 
This applies especially to basket-ball, which requires the greatest 
amount of endurance of any game played by girls. It is also prob- 
ably the most popular, and therefore the one requiring the greatest 
amount of thoughtful organization and supervision. 
Bowen and Mitchell! give the following list of activities showing 
the relative amount of strength, speed, skill and endurance 
inherent in each activity which may be used as a fairly accurate 
guide in dealing with girls:

According to this it will be seen that basket-ball, handball and 
long distance runs requires the greatest amount of endurance; field 
events in track, heavy apparatus, chinning, tumbling, throwing, 
combats and football require the greatest amount of strength; base- 
ball and lawn tennis require the greatest amount of skill and dashes 
and hurdles require the greatest amount of speed.

CHAPTER XIII. 
GENERAL CONDUCT OF GAMES AND MEETS. 
THE success of a game or meet, and the pleasure obtained not 
only by the spectators but by the participants as well, depends not 
only upon the ability of the players and the skill of their performances, 
but upon the general conduct of the affair as a whole. No one 
enjoys a meet or a game run off in a slovenly, careless manner, 
where officials are incompetent, equipment lacking, participants 
not ready, and a general air of incompleteness prevails. 
Essentials of a Good Game or Meet.—In order that educational and 
beneficial results may follow, our games and sports must be con- 
ducted in a way conducive to such results. To that end, and that 
they may be enjoyable also, attention to certain details is necessary. 
These details concern not only the players and the game, but the 
officials, the audience and equipment. This naturally presupposes 
much time and though spent upon preliminary arrangements. All 
these arrangements should be in the hands of a committee, gener- 
ally called the “games committee,” made up of (1) members of the 
department; (2) members of the student body or organization, 
managers (class, squad, or general), captains, chairmen group leaders, 
subcommittees; and (3) members of the academic faculty. 
I. The various preliminary duties distributed among the members 
of this committee are concerned with: 
Arrangements for date. 
Arrangements for place, seating. 
Advertising—printing, posters, articles, announcements. 
. Officials. 
. Decorations. 
. Invitations, announcements, tickets. 
. Ushers. 
Cheer leaders, music, song practices. 
Awards. 
10. Equipment. 
11. Special costumes for players.

  GENERAL CONDUCT OF GAMES AND MEETS 205 
II. At the time of the game or meet, special items to be considered . 
are: 
1. Equipment. 
2. Officials. 
3. Audience. 
4. Players. 
The details concerning these four items will be dealt with under the 
discussion of special games and meets. (Chapters XIV, XV, XVI.) 
The following general suggestions which apply to all games and 
meets may contain hints of value. 
I. Begin on Time.—Girls should be trained to that ideal, at least 
where the occasion is a formal one, a basket-ball game or a track 
meet. Set the hour for the time when they agree that they can be 
ready, then begin at that time, even though substitutes must be 
used or participants dropped. 
II. Adapt the game or the program of events to the occasion. If 
the occasion is a festive one, a picnic or a festival, use group events, 
novelty events, events which large numbers can enter and enjoy 
with little or no preparation. 
III. Avoid long waits. 
IV. Have on hand a physician or someone qualified to give first 
aid, and have first aid equipment handy. 
V. See that the ground is marked off and all necessary equipment 
at hand. 
VI. See that there are proper facilities for handling the audience— 
seats, ushers, programs, sanitary conveniences, and limitation of 
audience to fit the capacity and equipment of the place. 
VI. The audience should be a friendly sympathetic one, admitted 
by invitation and not by fee. 
VIII. Officials should be competent women where possible. 
IX. The participants should be trained for their events (in events 
which require training), or should at least be in proper physical 
condition. 
X. The play should be clean and fair. 
XI. There should be a “play spirit” present. 
XII. The players should show a thorough knowledge of the rules. 
XIII. The participants should be dressed in clothing which is not 
only proper but also attractive, and which remains in place during 
the game or event. 
XIV. Provision should be made for keeping the audience posted 
as to results, either by means of a large score board, or through an 
official_announcer. 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
    206 GENERAL CONDUCT OF GAMES AND MEETS 
Poor Form is Shown by: 
1. Chewing gum. 
2. Using slang. 
3. Calling each other by last names, as “Smith,” “Jones,” ete. 
4. Clapping hands, whistling, yelling in order to attract 
attention. 
5. Lying down or lounging around when time is called. If 
unable to stand, call time and leave the floor. 
When girls are coached by men, they generally acquire these 
habits as they are not considered poor form among boys. 
Duties of Managers.—The managers of the games or meets should 
be students or other members of the competing organizations— 
unpaid, chosen because of their executive ability and interest in the 
activity. A manager should have the ability to make others work 
and enjoy the working. Because, in large organizations, their duties 
are many and detailed, it is not advisable for them to be competing 
members of the group. They may be assisted by submanagers or 
committees of various kinds. Their general duties should be: (1) 
To arrange schedules for practices and games through the depart- 
ment of physical education; and (2) to interest girls to enroll for 
sports. 
Their specific duties, where special events are concerned, should be: 
I. Preliminary advertising, by. 
(a) Posters. 
(6) Bulletins. 
(c) Signs. 
(d) Tag days. 
(e) Announcements in.

XI. Awards. 
XII. Luncheons, teas, spreads, banquets, unless there is a social 
chairman. 
In general, the manager looks after all matters not pertaining 
directly to the playing of the teams or the participants. 
Duties of the Captain.—The captain should be chosen because of 
her personality, qualities of leadership and ability to perform well 
her specialty. She should be clear-headed, unbiased and impartial. 
She should be elected and not appointed. Her job in general is to 
help keep up the morale of the group, and assist with the coaching. 
Her specific duties consist of: 
I. Keeping the roll. ; 
II. Helping to place players in proper positions and events. 
ITI. Helping to choose teams. 
IV. Helping to decide the winners of awards, as judged according 
to the qualifications mentioned under eligibility. 
During games and contests she should be in complete charge of 
her team or participants. 
Duties of Instructor.—The qualifications of the instructor have 
been previously discussed (Chapters II and XI). Her general 
duties consist of giving instruction and keeping up the interest and 
morale of her pupils. Her specific duties include: 
I. Placing players in proper positions and 
and events. In consultation with 
II. Choosing teams. the captain. 
III. Deciding on the winners of awards. 
IV. Advising the manager. 
V. Arranging with manager and captain all schedules. On the 
day of the event she sees that all athletic equipment is at 
hand, acts as a hostess, meets the officials and with the 
manager explains their duties and hands out the printed 
instructions necessary to them.

  208 GENERAL CONDUCT OF GAMES AND MEETS 
Methods for Teaching Highly Organized Games.—Girls do not 
throw or catch naturally—hence, when a girl starts to learn a com- 
plicated team game of high organization, such as basket-ball, hockey 
or indoor baseball, unless she is athletic, she must learn not only 
the rules of the game, but the mechanics as well—such rudimentary 
and elementary things as throwing, shooting, passing, running, 
dodging, catching, batting, ete. These elements which make up 
the game must either be taught to her as such in special preliminary 
practice at each playing period, or through the use of more elemen- 
tary games, games of low organization. Games of low organization, 
as a rule, have few rules, and do not require a complicated technique. 
The player is thus able to enter into the spirit of the game at once, 
and learns to use her hands and feet and body more rapidly. 
Each game should be analyzed, broken up into its elements and 
practiced thus before rules are taught. These elements in turn 
form splendid material for the class in gymnastics. 
BASKET-BALL, 
I. Games which are sometimes used as preliminary games for 
teaching skill for basket-ball are: Dodge ball, end ball, circle 
touch ball, captain ball, captain basket-ball, goal throwing relays 
and ball pass relays. These games may be used as preliminary 
games not only in the sense that they may be played in preceding 
grades, but also a part of the basket-ball period may be devoted to 
them, until skill has been acquired. Through these games a knowl- 
edge of simple team play may also be gained. 
The other method is to devote a part of each basket-ball period 
or baseball period, or a part of the gymnastic hour, to practice in 
the elements or mechanics of the particular game. 
1. Elements of basket-ball: 
Running.

  GENERAL CONDUCT OF GAMES AND MEETS 209 
4. In three’s. 
5. In five’s. 
6. In six’s. 
As basket-ball requires the most endurance of any game played 
by girls, care should be taken that only those absolutely fit physi- 
cally are allowed to participate. The instructor should always be 
on the alert for signs of undue fatigue. The playing halves for 
mature girls in games should not exceed fifteen minutes, with ten 
minute intermission. This applies to teams which are in good phys- 
ical condition and in training. For other teams, twelve-minute 
halves should be the limit; with the halves divided into quarters and 
ten-minute rest between halves. For adolescent girls, twelve-minutes 
should be the maximum, with ten-minutes the rule, always using 
the quarter system, with ten-minute rest between halves. There 
is grave doubt about the wisdom of permitting basket-ball in 
competition for the pubescent girl, except possibly during late 
pubescence, the junior and senior years in high school. Even then 
it should be most carefully organized and supervised. 
For rules, see Spalding’s Library, Group V, No. 7 A. 
Some secondary schools have wisely forbidden the playing of 
basket-ball for girls. Certainly it should never be indulged in 
except under the best possible supervision and protection.

INDOOR BASEBALL. 
II. Long ball and punch ball are very good preliminary games. 
Practice in the mechanics of the game consists of: 
1. Throwing. 
2. Catching. 
3. Batting. 
4. Running. 
5. Tagging. 
There should be one ball for every four or five girls. A very effec- 
tive formation for preliminary work consists of lining the class up 
in groups of four or five across the playing field, each group with a 
bat and ball.

4—Fields 
Squads may line up with only 10 feet between them and the girls 
soon become accustomed to the flying balls. Each squad works inde- 
pendently of the others, and there is no running of bases. The girls 
continue to pitch, bat and throw until the instructor blows her 
whistle. Then the batter lays down her bat, takes No. 4’s position, 
and each girl moves up one place. This is continued until all have 
been at bat and played each position. This gives each one a chance 
to practice in each position, keeps a large number working at once, 
and allows the instructor an opportunity to walk around, criticizing, 
correcting, etc. The captains may also be of great help at this time. 
To place directly on the field a green squad whose mechanics are 
poor, even though they know the rules, is a waste of time. 
Indoor baseball is highly recommended as a game for girls. It 
is not only good exercise and good fun, but it has the advantage of
-P-A-G-E-209
GENERAL CONDUCT OF GAMES AND MEETS 21) 
being both an indoor and outdoor game. It does not require great 
strength or endurance, and is one of the finest games there is for 
teaching girls what so many of them lack, the ability to think and 
act correctly instantly, the ability to size up a situation immediately, 
to foresee a play, to out-guess an opponent. It tends to develop 
confidence and self-reliance and good sportsmanship because every 
play is made in the open, mistakes cannot be covered up and a girl 
soon learns not to give an “alibi.” 
Indoor baseball is also valuable because in a large play space, 
by adding extra fielders, a large number can take plart at the same 
time. It can adapt itself to a small play space by making use of the 
17-inch soft ball. A good sized diamond has the 35-foot base-line, 
using a 14-inch ball. When played outdoors, the 45-foot base-line 
with the 12-inch medium ball makes an ideal game. The regular 
outdoor game of baseball is not recommended for girls because: 
1. The throwing distance is too great. 
2. The mechanics of the game are too difficult to master 
because of the small, hard ball, heavy bat and the use of 
gloves. 
3. Too many fingers are injured and with girls this is a decided 
consideration. 
4. It has no advantage over the indoor game. 
In teaching the game to girls, try to teach them not only the 
mechanics of the game and the rules, but try to develop in them 
baseball sense. Most girls do not have it, unless they have played 
since childhood. Baseball sense is that quality in a player which 
makes her instinctively do the right thing at the right time. It is 
the basis of team work and comes only with practice.

HOCKEY. 
III. Field hockey, which was introduced into this country from 
England in 1901 by Miss Constance Appleby, has become uni- 
versally popular. It is highly recommended not only because it 
is played out of doors, but because it employs a great number of 
players at once and because the variety of positions with their 
differentiated requirements give opportunity to many types and 
conditions of girls. 
For rules, see Spalding’s Library Group X, No. 38 R. 
For girls in ordinary training, especially girls in secondary schools 
and colleges, it is suggested that the length of playing time be 
shortened as well as the size of the field. It takes unusual stamina 
to stand the strain of seventy-minutes of intense play over so large 
an area. 
Ordinary “shinny” as played by the boys in the street, and ring 
hockey are good preliminary games. 
Practice in the Mechanics of the Game Consists of: 
. Running. 
. Stick work. 
. Passing. 
. Goal shooting. 
. Attacking. 
. Defending. 
Simple passing in two’s, three’s and finally in line formation.

SOCCER. 
IV. Although not as well known as field hockey and as yet not 
as much played, soccer when properly modified and safeguarded 
is an even more ideal outdoor game for girls than hockey; first, 
because the girl is free and unhampered by not having to carry a 
stick as she runs and may use her arms for balance; secondly, the 
effort in soccer is always upward, the players are often in the air 
to meet the ball, hence, the tendency is to raise the chest and 
improve the posture. This should be less fatiguing than the bent 
position necessarily often assumed in hockey. 
By no means should the game be played according to boys’ 
tules, but according to the modified rules approved by the Women’s 
Committee on Athletics and which are included in the Official 
Handbook, No. 115 Rt

OFFICIALS. 
A game or a meet can be ruined by poor officials who do 
not know the rules, or knowing them, are discourteous, dis- 
agreeable or unfair. The wrong kind of an official can make a 
whole team nervous and unhappy; she can slow up a game or meet, 
or make it move too quickly. By adhering strictly to the letter of 
the rules without regard for the spirit of them, she can create an 
atmosphere of tension and _ ill-will which makes what should be 
recreation for the girls, a task. 
On the other hand, officials who know all the rules and regula- 
tions and adhere strictly to them, but who know when to be influ- 
enced by the spirit back of them; who are strict, but courteous; 
who have a friendly attitude toward the players and contestants, 
can have a psychological effect on the players which goes far toward 
placing the game or contest on a high plane. Good women officials 
have been lacking in the past. Many good instructors have lacked 
the necessary confidence and initiative, the proper combination 
of training, experience and personality. Schools of training and nor- 
mal schools should, and are endeavoring to remedy that. The 
demand for women officials is going to rapidly increase owing to the 
fact that that is one of the principles being advocated by the 
Women’s Division of the National Amateur Athletic Federation 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
GENERAL CONDUCT OF GAMES AND MEETS 217 
and by the Committee on Women’s Athletics of the American 
Physical Education Association, namely, the use of women officials 
for girls’ and women’s athletics. Much valuable training can be 
done among girls in colleges by allowing students to officiate often 
during practice periods and on informal occasions. 
Representatives of about.75 different organizations in New York 
have been holding discussion groups during the past year in an 
effort to formulate a set of principles which would tend to raise the 
standards of girl’s athletics and which might serve as a guide for 
these local groups. They have adopted the following resolution 
relative to officials: 
“Whereas, we recognize the important part played by officials 
in the conduct of our sports and games and in establishing standards 
and ideals, we recommend the use of women officials who are 
properly qualified in character and experience; who are thoroughly 
trained in all rules and regulations governing the special events for 
which they are acting as officials; who have a pleasing voice, who are 
appropriately dressed for their work and who will do all in their 
power to maintain the right attitude and spirit among players and 
audience. 
“While we do not disapprove of the paying of properly qualified 
officials when expedient, we recommend, in order to avoid a ten- 
dency toward commercialism, and in order to foster a spirit of 
friendliness in play, the use of properly qualified unpaid officials 
wherever possible.” 
Of course, local conditions and circumstances everywhere would 
not always make it possible to live up to such a standard, but the 
principle involved represents ideals toward which all physical 
educators should work. 
Do Nor Forerr. 
1. That meets and championship games should be incidents of 
a season’s program—not the end and aim. 
2. That so-called “Varsity” teams or class teams, participants 
informal meets and contests should be the cream which rises 
gradually to the surface as the result of extensive participation 
on the part of many. They should not be a selected group upon 
which time and training and attention has been especially lavished 
at the expense of the many. 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  218 GENERAL CONDUCT OF GAMES AND MEETS 
Do Nor. 
1. Commercialize play and recreation by gate receipts. Games 
and meets should be invitation affairs patronized by those who are 
interested, and not spectacles arranged to amuse and entertain a 
public. 
2. Judge an instructor by the size of the score her team makes 
or by the records her girls make. Judge her by the qualities she has 
developed in her girls of honor, loyalty, good sportsmanship, clean 
living and clean, straight thinking, codrdination, strength, endur- 
ance, bodily vigor and a love of play. 
3. Put winning or participation above the health of any girl. 
Try to educate the girls to believe that no game is worth the risking 
of health, and that taking foolish chances is not loyalty to a team 
or an institution. 
4. Offer valuable rewards, but give awards of little or no intrinsic 
value such as: Letters, numerals, stars, bands, emblems, ribbons, 
an occasional loving cup or something similar, or medals or pins of 
little value. Strive to develop a feeling of real sentiment toward 
letters and numerals and bands, and make the conditions for win- 
ning them hard enough so that their attainment will be appreciated. 
5. Emphasize the playing of the rules of the game to the detriment 
of the playing of the game and the spirit of the game. Try to strike 
a nice balance between the three. 
Facrors IN THE PRoMOTION OF A Goop ATHLETIC ORGANIZATION. 
1. Instructors with high qualifications and ideals. 
2. Programs of activities adapted to the age, sex, condition, 
ability, capacities and previous training of the group.

4. Adequate equipment and time provision for activities. 
5. A strong and interested athletic association. 
6. A faculty or board of control with educational ideals and a

A chance that is equal with all in the strife, 
A courage to strive and to dare;

A tribute that comes from the heart, 
And let me not cherish a snarl or a sneer 
Or play any sniveling part; 
Let me say, ‘There they ride, on whom laurel’s bestowed, 
Since they played the game better than I.’ 
Let me stand with a smile by the side of the road 
And cheer as the winners go by. 
“So grant me to conquer, if conquer I can, 
By proving my worth in the fray, 
But teach me to lose like a regular man, 
And not like a craven, I pray;

CHAPTER XIV 
FIELD DAYS AND TRACK MEETS. 
Fierp days and track meets, with the assistance of banners, 
streamers, decorations, costumes, music, singing and cheering, 
can be made, not only affairs of wholesome recreation and play, 
but really inspiring and worth while spectacles; and should be real 
community assets. They can be made of great value socially because 
they bring together, not only students or members of the same 
groups, but faculty, parents and friends of the institution or group. 
Every effort should be made to make the occasion a friendly one, 
enjoyed by a sympathetic group, and not as has been stated a 
spectacle arranged to amuse a curious public. 
The affair may be a huge pageant or a dramatic event or a series 
of events, in which the field day or the track meet plays but a minor 
part and of which it is but a detail or episode. Or it may take on 
the nature of a typical field day, and begin with a procession, the 
various organizations appearing in costumes, having floats, doing 
stunts, and singing: and it may conclude with a May-pole dance or 
a May festival, with community singing or a general jollification. 
The possibilities are so numerous that it is almost impossible to sug- 
gest all of them and these few hints are dropped with the hope that 
it will stimulate physical educators and recreation leaders to see 
the inherent possibilities and opportunities and make the most of 
them. With a program containing the above features, records and 
winning could not be uppermost, but would sink into relative insig- 
nificance beside the general spirit and atmosphere of the occasion 
and would cease to be a problem. 
A “field day” is a much broader term than “tract meet,” and 
might consist of almost any combination of land activities which 
your space and equipment could accommodate in a day or evening. 
There is no limit to the number of activities and events, nor to the 
number of participants. 
A “track meet” is the narrower term and is usually limited to the 
more formal types of events in running, throwing and jumping, 
although it might also include, and should include for girls, novelty 
events. 
(220)
-P-A-G-E-219
  GENERAL CONDUCT OF GAMES AND MEETS’ 221 
The field-day program is the most logical one for girls, because 
it can include, not only a track meet, but games, relays, drills, danc- 
ing, novelty events, etc. Its character depends upon the ingenuity 
of the department, and the athletic association as well as upon the 
past program, the equipment and the ability and condition of the 
girls. It would be impossible to outline a definite program or list 
of events to fit all conditions. 
There are several suggestions which might be followed in planning 
a field day or track meet. 
GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 
I. Arrange a type of program which will contain events for girls 
of all physical conditions, and of all variety of interests; for novices 
as well as for experts, and which will make participation in some 
form possible to all. 
I. Use events which will include large numbers. 
III. Use a scoring system which will give points for all individual 
accomplishment, not just to the most skilled. 
IV. Do not work for records or emphasize the making or breaking 
of records. 
V. Do not allow girls to enter strenuous events if they have not 
trained for them. Allow a girl to enter only such events as you know 
she is physically fit to enter. This varies with the individual girl 
and the various events. 
VI. Emphasize events for form. 
VII. Avoid sensational newspaper publicity. Use only such as 
will stress the event and the group, not the individual. 
VIII. See that your girls are dressed appropriately. This depends 
upon the age of the girl and the event. Do not allow the adolescent 
or mature girl to wear “track pants” in public performances or in 
public places. 
IX. Be sure the field is properly marked and all equipment at hand. 
TRACK MEETS. 
A “track meet” proper is composed of track and field events. 
The track events include all running events, dashes, hurdles and 
relays. 
The field events include all throwing, jumping and vaulting events. 
The following events in each class may be used by girls—under 
proper conditions and with proper training.

An interesting combination of running and jumping can be made 
by arranging an event so that a girl will run a short distance, 10 
yards; jump a low height, 18 inches; run another short distance, 
climb over something, and crawl under something. Dressing in 
costumes adds to the ridiculousness, carrying a suit case and adding 
to or removing parts of the costume at certain specified points also 
adds to the fun. Such an event could be entered with little or no 
training.

II. Jumping: 
1. Running high jump with soft landing pit. 
2. Standing high jump with soft landing pit. 
3. Standing broad jump with soft landing pit. 
4. Hop, skip and jump with soft landing pit. 
Disapproved of: 1. Broad jumping for adolescent and mature 
girls in competition 
2. High jumping without soft landing pit. 
Doubtful: High jumping for height in competition by adolescent 
or mature girls. 
Great care should be exercised in the use of the jumps either for 
height orfor distance from either one ortwofeet. No jumping should 
be allowed for height or distance unless a soft landing pit is provided. 
As physical educators are not agreed as to the amount of danger for 
girls involved in jumping, it is wisest to eliminate all jumping for 
height or distance from the program of the adolescent girl and con- 
fine it to low jumps and jumping for form. Even the mature girl 
should indulge in jumping for height or distance in competition 
only under the most favorable conditions and circumstances and 
never when the landing pit is not soft. It would be safer to eliminate 
the broad jump entirely except as used in relays where less emphasis 
is put upon the individual jump. 
C. Events ror Form: 
1. Hurdling. 
2. Running high jump. 
3. Discus throw, American and Greek style. 
4. Javelin throw. 
5. Hurl ball throw. 
D. Noveury Events: 
There are a great many novelty events which are neither 
track nor field events, or which are both; also events 
which are tests of certain kinds of skill or agility, the use 
of which tends to turn a track meet into a field day. 
. Group leap, shuttle or addition. 
. Group basket-ball throw for distance, shuttle or addition. 
. Basket-ball goal throw, group or individual.

  FIELD DAYS AND TRACK MEETS 225 
The following events are those which could safely be participated 
in with little or no training or practice. Of course, without practice, 
there would not be much skill exhibited, but the fun and recreation 
would be present without the rush and strain or overdoing, unless 
a girl is in poor physical condition or enters too many events. 
INFORMAL PROGRAM. 
. 20-yard dash. 
. 20-yard hurdle—1 hurdle, 18 inches. 
Relays—each runner 20 yards. 
. All novelty relays of short distance—see A IV above. 
. Throwing basket-ball. 
Throwing baseball. 
Throwing at targets. 
. Novelty events—see ‘D’ above. 
. Group games. 
(a) Long ball. 
(6) Punch ball. 
(c) Dodge ball. 
(d) Dodge volley ball. 
(e) Bombardment. 
8. Stunts. 
9. 20-yard walking race. 
Club groups, girl scouts, camp-fire girls, etc., should find these 
suggestions helpful, as these groups are frequently at a loss to know 
which events can be safely used, for informal gatherings. Groups 
of this type do not have the opportunity for systematic training 
which school, college and institution groups have, and are more apt 
to choose wrong events and to overdo. 
Longer running events, jumping, hurdling, or any events or games 
which are a strain upon the heart and lungs, or upon special groups 
of muscles, or which require endurance, should not be participated 
in, except by those in good physical condition and only after four 
to six weeks of practice (as a minimum), practicing two or three 
times a week. During the first week or two of practice, no attention 
should be paid to speed, height or distance, but attention and effort 
should be concentrated on form and control; as form and control 
are acquired, speed, height and distance may be gradually added.

This does not refer to group participation meets where each indi- 
vidual competes in every event and where the strain is not so great, 
as the individual girls are not competing directly against each other, 
but as one of a group and each girl knows that she will get some credit 
for her performance, no matter how poor it is. 
The Pentathlon is a favorite form of group competition. Five 
events are chosen, which illustrate all-round ability, and a graded 
point system used. Nearly every school or institution has at present 
its own scoring table. 
Events may be chosen in 
1. Running, dashes. 
2. Jumping, high jump, broad jump. 
ana F baseball, basket-ball, hurl ball, for distance, or 3. Throwing at a target. 
4. Cc limbing—up rope or over an obstacle. 
5. Striking—volley ball serve, tennis serve, golf putt. 
Chart 45 below is a sample of such a form of competition with its 
scoring table.!

  228 FIELD DAYS AND TRACK MEETS 
In the Pentathlon the total number of events is five, consequently 
a perfect score is 25 points. 
Mr. H. E. Brown, a member of the committee which worked out 
this special scheme, expresses well the underlying principles of such 
tests or programs of events: 
“There are two or three points in which I believe them to be 
unique, and which I will therefore enumerate here. In the first place 
and contrary I believe to all the present tendency in athletics my plan 
would call for the elimination of specialization. That is, I conceive 
one important purpose of athletics to be all-round development, 
the broadening rather than an intensifying of a girl’s interest in 
athletics. Instead, therefore, of allowing a girl to choose the one 
event in which she is already most proficient and specializing on 
that until she reaches the limit, I would make it necessary for her 
to take part in five events, one from each of the main fundamental 
groups.” 
The greatest objection to the scheme as a whole is, that it requires 
a girl to participate in all five events or none, thus possibly exclud- 
ing some who could participate in some of the tests. 
Barnard College experimented with a similar group meet recently, 
using seven events and allowing a girl to enter as many as she was 
physically able to enter.

Motor ability and achievement tests also furnish good material 
for a track-meet program. 
Group meets of this type are very valuable as they encourage 
the timid and less capable to participate. There is less nervous and
-P-A-G-E-227
  FIELD DAYS AND TRACK MEETS 229 
physical strain than in the ordinary track meet, as the girls are not 
competing directly against each other but against themselves, the 
watch, the tape, etc. In running, they run singly or in groups of 
two, three or four, depending upon the number of stop watches 
available. Each runner is timed individually and receives credit 
for her time in points. According to Mr. Brown, about 50 girls 
can be timed in ten minutes with one watch. He suggests two 
officials, one to act as starter and timer, the other as scorer. 
Method of Timing.— When four watches are available, there should 
be 4 timers and 1 scorer. All stand at the finish line. One timer 
can act as starter or there can be a special starter. When the timer 
acts as starter also, he stands with arm raised, watch held in the 
uplifted hand. Lowering the arm is the signal to start, and each 
timer starts his watch at the same time. When there are several 
timers, each one times a special girl and all report results to the 
scorer. 
MEASURING THE THROWS. 
In order to facilitate measuring in the throwing events, a 
zoning system can be employed, using either concentric circles 
or parallel lines. 
ZONING METHOD. 
  Are ABC = foul lines. X = throwers. 
The use of concentric circles is fairer because measuring from 
the exact spot where the implement crossed the foul line to the 
spot where the implement landed gives the exact distance thrown. 
In measuring, using the concentric circles, it is necessary to actually 
measure only from the line behind the spot where the ball or 
implement struck to the spot where it struck as the distance to 
that line is already indicated on the field in figures.
-P-A-G-E-228
  230 FIELD DAYS AND TRACK MEETS 
This is easily adopted to the group scoring system as follows, 
depending upon the character of the implement. 
For Hurl Ball: 
Zone 1 = 1 point. 
Zone 2 = 3 points. 
Zone 3 = 5 points. 
For Javelin and Basket-ball Throw: 
Zone 2 = 1 point. 
Zone 3 = 3 points. 
Zone 4 = 5 points. 
In this case actual distance is not measured, but points are given 
according to the zone in which the implement strikes. 
In case the rule is followed of measuring from a point on the 
foul line at right angles to the point where the implement fell 
(thus possibly not allowing for the full distance thrown) the par- 
allel line method may be used. 
   X(thrower) © Foul line 
BC = distance marked and credited. 
AB = actual distance thrown. 
X = thrower. 
For specific rules and regulations governing all the various events 
in track and field for girls, see the official handbook of the National 
Committee on Women’s Athletics, Number 115 R, published by the 
American Sports Publishing Company. 
Scoring for Meets.—The scoring system used depends upon the 
character of the meet and whether emphasis is being put upon 
individual or group achievement, or whether both are being taken 
into consideration. The Olympic Festival plan is most generally 
used, but a group scoring or point system is suggested as being more 
valuable for girls. Charts 31, 32, 33 and 34 in Chapter on Gym- 
nastic Contests are examples of group plans. This same scheme 
may be used for a swimming meet.

     This method is shown merely as information. The use of trial 
heats, semi-finals and finals for girls is unwise and especially to be 
condemned when all are undertaken on the same day. Semi-finals 
and finals on the same day are permissible, using the semi-finals 
as one of a girl’s speed events. Another method is to run each 
girl singly, timing each one, and arranging them in the order of 
their various times, the one with the fastest time being first, ete. 
The point system is again the better method for large numbers.

CHAPTER XV 
SWIMMING AND SWIMMING MEETS. 
“Every girl a swimmer” should be one of the slogans of every 
physical director, and every recreational leader; it should be one 
of the aims of every institution and community. The community 
owes it not only to the girl, but to itself, to provide suitable swim- 
ming facilities for all-year swimming. Outdoor swimming is the most 
valuable from the health point of view, but indoor pools have made 
possible all-year swimming and participation for a greater number. 
Of all the various forms of sport and recreation, swimming is the 
ideal activity and is the one sport which can be indulged in by 
young and old alike and from which can be removed all stress and 
strain. It is valuable not only as a means of exercise, not only for 
its recreative and pleasure-giving qualities, but for its ability to 
develop in the swimmer courage, self-confidence, poise and perfect 
coérdination. Add to that the ability to save life, not only the life 
of the swimmer, but of friends and associates, and ability to swim 
becomes a decided social asset. 
Its physical value lies in the fact that it is an all-round form 
of exercise, all of the large muscle groups having an opportunity 
to function to the maximum with the least amount of friction. The 
prone position of the body in the water is restful, and the action of 
the water soothing. Supervised swimming under competent 
direction is being more and more recommended by physicians for 
certain types of cardiac cases, “nerves” and girls below par. 
Because of the dangers of infection and loss of life, the swimming 
pool and swimming require very careful organization and supervi- 
sion. Swimming instructors and swimming councillors should all be 
competent life-savers as well as efficient teachers and performers in 
and on the water. 
The organization of swimming must take into consideration two 
factors. 1. The pool, and 2, the bathers. 
THE POOL. 
It is generally conceded that pools are always potential causes or 
breeders of infections and therefore, sterilization of some sort is 
absolutely necessary. Sterilization may be by:

38. Violet ray. 
Methods 1 and 2 are most uniformly used and are most effective 
in combination and when supplemented by certain necessary pre- 
ventive measures. In addition the pool should be emptied at inter- 
vals and thoroughly scrubbed. The methods used, the frequency 
of the applications of lime and the times when the pool should be 
emptied depend entirely upon the type of pool, how often used and 
the number using it. The engineer or janitor should experiment and 
test until he knows just the treatment needed to keep that particular 
pool pure. 
The pool at Barnard College, Columbia University, has an almost 
negative bacteriological count continually and receives the following 
treatment: 
1. Continual refiltration while in use. 
2. Vacuum pumps used every morning and pool room mopped 
at least once daily. 
3. Hypochlorite applied in a bag drawn through the pool— 
bi- or tri-weekly, depending upon the number of bathers. 
4. Pool emptied semi-annually. 
Dr. J. Williams, of Teachers College, states that 1 pound of hypo- 
chlorite will treat satisfactorily a 100,000 gallon pool at a cost of only 
9 cents per pound or about $17.00 annually. 
In order that the physical director and medical office may know 
at all times the exact condition of the pool, laboratory tests of the 
water should be made at least bi-weekly and the results submitted 
at once to the medical officer and the physical director. The follow- 
ing form for the report is used by Barnard College and the tests 
are made in the laboratory at Columbia University:

Preventive Measwres.—Preventive measures are as important in 
the care of a pool as positive treatment and should be rigorously 
and heartlessly enforced. 
1. Keep the pool room absolutely clean. 
2. Allow no visitors on the pool room floor—limit them to the 
gallery. 
38. Prohibit the use of the pool to all girls with cuts, suspicious 
or infectious skin conditions, respiratory troubles, infectious eye 
or ear disorders or infectious or communicable diseases of any type. 
Allow no one in the pool wearing bandages or plasters. 
4. Require a warm shower or bath with soap before entering 
pool. The bath should be taken with the suit off and hung over the 
door so the instructor or attendant can see it. A bath when leaving 
the pool is suggested, but optional. 
5. Prohibit from use of pool all girls with rouge, powder, cold 
cream or paint on the face or body. 
6. Require every bather to wear a cap. 
7. Require every bather to wear a one-piece bathing suit, prefer- 
ably light gray or a color which will not run. Suits should be owned 
by the institution, but whether they are or not, all suits should be 
uniform, should be sterilized in boiling water on the premises after 
each bath, and should be kept in the laundry or locker room pro- 
vided by the institution and handled only by designated attendants. 
Suits should not be kept in individual or student lockers in the 
general locker room. 
8. No stockings or undergarments should be worn with the excep- 
tion of a brassiere when needed. No unsterilized clothing of any 
kind should be worn. 
9. Girls should not use the pool during menstrual period—the 
reasons are obvious. 
10. Provide a scum gutter and emphasize its use for expectoration. 
11. Instruct all bathers regarding the necessity for emptying the 
bladder and the bowels before entering pool. Toilets should be 
easily accessible as the cold water often stimulates the action of 
the kidneys. 
12. Towels should be provided by the institution, handed out with 
the bathing suit and used only once, not kept in the locker for a 
second swim. 
These instructions may be “gotten over” in various ways, but 
their application requires eternal vigilance on the part of the 
instructors and an almost “fool-proof” organization. Some of them
-P-A-G-E-236
  238 SWIMMING AND SWIMMING MEETS 
should be printed as rules and regulations and posted in each 
dressing room and in conspicuous places in the pool room and locker 
rooms. They should be made a subject for discussion in each new 
swimming class, at the hygiene period and, where the same group 
of girls is concerned, at the gymnastic class hour. By giving reasons 
for the rulings and emphasizing the dangers from failure to observe, 
coéperation ought not to be hard to get. Instant withdrawal of 
the privilege of using the pool should be the penalty for failure to 
observe the rules. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE BATHER. 
1. Elimination because of physical disabilities which swimming, 
water or exposure might aggravate, such as: 
(a) Respiratory tract—chronic bronchitis, frequent colds, 
e. g., essential low resistance to respiratory infec- 
tions, chronic and acute sinus infection, repeated 
laryngitis, history of pulmonary tuberculosis or of 
wet pleurisy, unless there are absolute indications 
of quiescence. 
(b) Ear—perforated drums. 
(ce) Eye—high grade myopia, usually barred from diving. 
(d) Recent or active genito-urinary infections—metror- 
rhagia, menorrhagia or dysmenorrhea of great 
severity. 
(e) Heart—serious lesions especially mitral stenosis and 
aortic regurgitation. 
(f) Gastro-intestinal colitis which is usually aggravated 
by cold. 
(g) Skin—chronic condition irritated by water.! 
. Hair dryers—especially necessary in cold weather. 
. Enforcement of all rules and regulations pertaining to the 
care of pool. 
. Rubber strips on floor to prevent slipping. 
. An even temperature of the air and water maintained. In 
an indoor pool about 76° F. for the air and 72° F. for the 
pool is a good average. 
. Wearing of certain colored caps by swimmers of various 
abilities, that is: 
(a) Black cap—Novice. wre

(b) Red cap—Passed swimming test—able to take care of 
self in water. 
(c) Blue cap—Expert swimmer—passed ‘life-saving tests 
can assist in teaching. 
7. Allow no girl to use the pool who has not been examined and 
passed by the medical officer. 
ORGANIZATION OF SWIMMING. 
For purposes of instruction and in order to facilitate matters, 
girls should be placed, so far as possible, into groups of like ability — 
beginning, intermediate, advanced or life-saving groups. Where 
the organization of a school or group is such that a whole group or 
class must come to the pool at the same hour for instruction regard- 
less of ability, the problem is a difficult one—more difficult than 
that of other activities because of the added dangers of drowning 
involved. In that case it would be necessary to divide the class, 
utilize assistants and use both ends of the pool at once which causes 
confusion and makes instruction more difficult. As in other activi- 
ties, swimming events and strokes as well as methods of teaching 
are becoming more and more standardized, so that instruction is 
more uniform than it has ever been. Various devices can be used 
in order to interest the swimmer in her own advancement and to 
encourage her to work toward perfection. The most common is the 
group system of tests, with or without the use of points. These 
again vary with the organization and institution, although out 
of it all are evolving certain tests and groupings for colleges, for 
secondary schools, for Y. W. C. A.’s, for girls’ camps and for girl 
scouts and camp-fire girls. The general principles throughout 
are the same. Usually, there are several sets of tests, the passing 
of which decides the group in which a girl belongs. By passing 
additional tests she progresses from a lower to a higher group. 
This may be accompanied by the awarding of points, gold or colored 
stars or emblems of some sort.

Nore.—It is not necessary to use the points in giving the tests; 
they are simply suggested as a basis for grading in schools that do 
have point systems. 
The accomplishing and passing off of these tests furnishes quite 
a complete and satisfactory progressive program for swimming. 
II. Chart 52 is the Barnard College swimming card. No point 
system is used, but as the student “passes off” each requirement it 
is checked with the date on her card. This furnishes a complete file 
of all swimmers and is very valuable for reference. In order to 
further enlist the interest of the girl, a series of large charts are hung 
in the pool room containing the names of all those enrolled for 
swimming. These charts are ruled and all of the events listed across 
the top. As a girl passes her different tests, a star is pasted on the 
chart after her name and under the event. This appeals to the 
competitive instinct of the girl and acts as an incentive.

* Minimum points required to pass. Among the numerous ways of increasing interest in improvement the chart is of marked value. To make facts graphic, and if possible to add an arlieuo appeal, is important, Gome classifications are arranged 20 that only after passing all requirements of a given grade can advancement to the next be made, The above chart shows a good way to handle the latter method. 
Suggested Types of Competition: 
I. Informal group and individual competition within each 
swimming class. 
II. Informal group and individual contests between swimmers 
in same ability groups. 
III. Informal group and individual contests between swim- 
ming classes. 
IV. Informal group and individual contests between school 
classes. 
V. Informal “open” meets—(open to any girl in the institu- 
tion physically fit and in training for the event). 
VI. Informal interdormitory meets and all other types sug- 
gested in Chap. XII. 
VII. Formal intraclass meets. 
VIII. Formal interclass meets. 
TX. Formal “open” meets.

This type is especially valuable for a swimming class and serves 
as a demonstration of the ground covered. 
By “formal” meets in the above list, is meant meets in which 
the points count toward a championship of some sort, either group, 
individual or both. 
THE AQUATIC PROGRAM. 
The aquatic program can be just as varied as the field-day program, 
and need be limited only by space and equipment. It may include: 
1. Swimming meets.

boating. 
3. Water pageants which may include both of the above. 
4. Regattas which might include all of the above. 
The name for any specific water affair depends upon the char- 
acter of the events included. The following is a suggested list of 
events which might be used at some time in an aquatic program: 
1. Speed events in the water. 
(a) Races up to 75 yards out-of-doors, free style or speci- 
fied style. 
(b) Swimming on back, up to 40 yards.

No attempt will be made to suggest specific programs for various 
ages, as so much depends upon the equipment, the type of pool or 
swimming space and the character of the affair. 
PROGRAM FOR ADOLESCENT GIRL. 
A typical indoor program for the adolescent girl might include 
the following events: 
I. Speed: 
1. Races up to 40 yards, free style or designated. 
2. Swimming on back up to 20 yards. 
3. Relays for speed up’to 20 yards. Do not allow long 
distance swimming for speed.

The following official scoring of points for meets was adopted by 
the Women’s Swimming Committee and is therefore recommended: 
I. In all dual meets it is recommended that places in events shall 
be valued as follows: 
(a) In the relay race: 
1st place—5 points. 
2d place—0 points.
-P-A-G-E-251
  SWIMMING AND SWIMMING MEETS 253 
(b) In other events: 
1st place—5 points. 
2d place—3 points. 
3rd place—1 point. 
II. In championships where three or more teams are entered, 
scoring of place values shall be as follows: 
(a) In relay race: 
1st place—8 points. 
2d place—6 points. 
3rd place—4 points. 
4th place—2 points. 
(6) In all other events: 
1st place—5 points. 
2d place—3 points. 
3rd place—2 points. 
4th place—1 point. 
Method of scoring dives: 
Attempt — 1 point. 
Poor dive — 3 points. 
Fair dive — 6 points. 
Good dive — 8 points. 
Excellent dive—10 points. 
One-half points may be used. Points are awarded for execution 
alone and not for degree of difficulty. 
Devices which will interest the girl in learning how to swim and 
in improving her skill and endurance in the water are always wel- 
come. The following two were successfully used at Barnard College: 
I. The first was an adaptation of the six-day bicycle race and was 
called the “thirty-day swimming race.” It was conducted as inter- 
class competition, the girls signing up by classes. Each girl swam 
three weeks out of the possible four as follows: 
1st week, two times, five minutes each time without resting. 
2d_week, two times, seven minutes each time without resting. 
3rd week, two times, ten minutes each time without resting. 
Only those who were “O. K.” for swimming were allowed to enter. 
The girl came in and swam at any “open hour” period on any two 
days during the week. The instructor, or a class manager, counted 
the laps she swam during each time and entered the number on a 
large score sheet posted in the gymnasium. At the end of the month, 
the class score represented the total number of laps swam by all the 
girls in that class, divided by the number who swam. This gave 
   
-P-A-G-E-252
  254 SWIMMING AND SWIMMING MEETS 
the result in a class average. The class possessing the highest 
average won. This could be varied in many ways. 
II. The second was an adaptation of an idea gained from the 
playground association in a southern city and provoked a great 
deal of interest even among the faculty. A certain week was set 
aside as “swimming week.” During that week any girl “O. K” for 
swimming was allowed to demonstrate her ability to dive in head 
first and swim two lengths of the pool. All those who succeeded 
received white satin badges 4-inches long and 13 inches wide on 
which was printed in Barnard blue “I Can Swim.” They wore 
these badges all during the week and there was much interest as to 
which class would secure the largest per cent of badges. A large 
cardboard barometer was posted in the corridor of Students Hall 
and at the end of each day each class manager changed the reading 
on the barometer to correspond to the number of badges earned by 
her class to date. 
GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 
1. Do not allow any girl to participate in too many events, 
never more than two speed and one form event as a maximum. 
2. Encourage play in the water and the use of the more informal 
types of competition and impromptu programs. 
3. The number of times a day a girl goes into the water, the length 
of time she spends in the water, depends upon the temperature of 
the air, the water and her reaction to the water. 
4. Be sure that the swimming hour is well patrolled, especially 
when the swimming is done in a lake, river or outdoor pool where 
the water is not clear. 
5. Have on duty a sufficient number of instructors and guards. 
The more expert the swimmers are, the fewer are the guards needed. 
6. Train your girls to come out of the water at once in response 
to a certain signal. This facilitates the work of the guards in case 
of an emergency. Insist on strict obedience to all rules and regula- 
tions pertaining to the swimming hour, especially those made for 
the protection of the swimmer. 
The “ Buddy” system as advocated by the American Red Cross 
Society is a splendid plan to use where large numbers are in the 
water at the same time. Girls are placed in pairs according to ability 
and made responsible for each other while in the water. No girl 
ever leaves the water without her “buddy.’”’ Should one girl become 
suddenly ill, faint, or have a cramp, the buddy knows about it 
and instantly reports it to the instructor or life guard.

  CHAPTER XVI. 
TENNIS TOURNAMENTS. 
TrENnIs is essentially a game of speed, endurance and skill with 
emphasis upon the latter, and is one of the finest games there is for 
girls, especially when played out-of-doors. Skill comes only with 
practice and still more practice. Tennis is valuable because it can 
be indulged in until middle life with pleasure, and is one of the sports 
which does not require the presence of a great number of partici- 
pants. Skill in strokes and agility is best acquired by practice in 
hitting a tennis ball against a blank wall. Hand-ball and tenikoit 
are very good preliminary games for tennis. 
Games, matches and tournaments may be in singles, doubles or 
mixed doubles. Tournament matches for girls and women gene- 
rally consist of 2 out of 3 sets, for men 3 out of 5. In a long list of 
entries where time is a factor, the tournament may be shortened 
by hurrying the play in the preliminary rounds, in the following 
manner: 
1. Allow no deuce sets. When the score becomes 6-5, the 
player having the 6 games is the winner of the set. 
2. Allow no deuce games. 
3. Have a time limit, limiting each match to forty-five minutes 
or one hour, the winner being the one with the highest 
score at the end of that time. 
The general scheme for arranging tournaments has already been 
outlined in Chap. XII. Tournamentsmay be “open,” which anyone 
in that particular group may enter or they may be “‘closed,” and con- 
fined to members of a certain class or group. Classes or groups may 
also be represented by tennis teams. The teams should be chosen 
as a result of tournament play within the class or group. Competi- 
tion may then take place between the teams in singles and double 
and may take the form of elimination or.a round robin. 
Sometimes in making drawings for a tournament it is customary 
to “seed” the draw. This is done in an effort to prevent the best 
players meeting each other in the preliminary round and thus being 
eliminated early in the tournament. It is arranged by arbitrarily 
( 256 )
-P-A-G-E-255
  TENNIS TOURNAMENTS 257 
withdrawing the names of the best players from the draw and 
assigning them to definite numbers or positions at intervals in the 
list. This method insures the later matches being more interesting 
and more evenly balanced. 
Ladder Tournaments.—Another type of tournament which is 
especially adapted to tennis, hand-ball and golf is the “ladder 
tournament.” In this all of the players in a certain group are 
arranged in a list according to ability—the best player being No. 1. 
Any player in the group may at any time challenge any one of the 
three next above her in the list. If No. 11 challenges No. 9 and 
defeats her, No. 11 changes places with No. 9 in the list. In time, 
No. 11 may become No. 1, by successively challenging and defeat- 
ing those above her. There is no time limit to such a tournament 
and it may provide interest throughout the year. 
Progressive Tournaments.—A type of tournament which provides 
an interesting afternoon’s entertainment and which is especially 
valuable as a “mixer,” either in mixing up good and poor material 
among a group of the same age, or a group composed of half faculty 
and half students, is the “progressive tournament.”’ This is con- 
ducted just as a card party is conducted, The participants draw 
for partners and courts instead of for partners and tables. The 
courts are numbered with No. 1 the head court. Play starts at a 
signal and stops at intervals when a whistle blows or gong sounds. 
Immediately all winners advance to the next higher court and 
change partners, losers remaining at the same court and changing 
partners. Players may wear appropriate tally cards, and receive 
gold stars after winning each match. A simple prize (tennis ball), 
may be presented the winners. All of these are but devices for 
stimulating interest. 
All of the players in a school or group may be ranked at the 
beginning or at the end of a season. They may be ranked numeric- 
ally from 1 down, or they may be divided into classes: Class A, 
B, C, etc., and then ranked numerically within the class. It adds 
to the interest to post or announce these “rankings.” 
Instruction in tennis should be furnished as in other activities.

CHAPTER XVII. 
GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION) 
Wate basket-ball, indoor baseballs Hoskey and “the more highly 
organized sports and games will always occupy an important place in 
any scheme of physical education or recreation, and while it is right 
thatthey should do so, a large per cent of our girl and woman popula- 
tion is for various reasons unable to participate, and it is this large 
percentage for whom suitable forms of recreation must be found 
and who must be encouraged to indulge. To this class belongs: 
1. Those physically handicapped. 
Fatigue cases. 
Early‘adolescence. 
Early middle age. 
. Middle age. 
6. Those “out of training.” 
7. Those who have lacked opportunity. 
A girl may have a heart defect which makes it impossible for her 
to play tennis, but there is a long list of sports she may find enjoy- 
ment in playing if encouraged and given an opportunity. 
The business or professional woman who has gotten “ out of train- 
ing” through leading a sedentary life, may not be able to play 
basket-ball or hockey, but in volley ball, drive ball or cage volley 
ball she may find an outlet for her tired nerves and be truly recreated. 
The high school girl or the college girl who does not “make her 
team” should not be relegated to the side lines to get her recreation 
and competition by cheering for her team. She should have “her 
team”’ too, and every other girl in the school or organization should 
have “her team.” It may be a captain ball team, or an end ball 
team; it may be a quoits’ team, a hand-ball team or a relay team, 
bu¢ at any rate it is a team, and the girl belongs, and by means of it 
she can just as truly learn the rules of sportmanship and fair play, as 
though she were participating in more strenuous activities. It is 
merely a question of leadership, incentives and proper organiza- 
tion. Games of this type are called “Games of Low Organization.” 
They consist of: 
A. So-called “group” games. 
B. Novelty relays, and 
C. “Individual” sports and games of low organization. 
(259 ) oR eS 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
    260 GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 
They are just as valuable in any scheme of education or in any 
recreational program as those of high organization and for the fol- 
lowing reasons: 
1. They engage large numbers at once. 
2. They may be enjoyed without first having to master diffi- 
cult technique. 
3. There are not many rules to learn. 
4. Coérdinations are not difficult. 
5. They are high in recreational and hygienic values without 
requiring great endurance. 
6. Little or no equipment is needed. 
7. They prepare the way for more advanced and more difficult 
games.

GAMES. 
Captain Basket-ball.—Captain basket-ball is a splendid game for 
the adolescent girl, and a valuable game either as a preliminary game 
for basket-ball or in place of basket-ball. There are several ways 
of playing the game, some more complex than others. They vary 
according to:

IV. Captain Basket-ball.—quipment.—Regulation basket-ball, 
2 basket-ball goals and basket-ball court divided into two halves, 
each half containing 8 bases each 3 feet in diameter. The bases 
are arranged in a semicircle. 
Players.—Each team is composed of 13 players, 6 basemen, 2 
captains, 4 guards and a roving center guard. More guards may be 
added if this proves to be too strenuous. 
Object of game is to throw from baseman to baseman, from base- 
man to captain and from baseman into basket. 
Score: From baseman to nearer captain—1 point. 
From baseman to farther captain—2 points. 
Basket throw by nearest baseman—1 point. 
Complete circle from captain to captain without dropping 
ball—3 points. 
Play.—Ball is thrown up in the center as in basket-ball between 
the two center guards who jump and bat it. The opposing guards
-P-A-G-E-261
     
    
     
    
       
   GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 263 
try to intercept the ball and throw it to one of their own basemen 
so that she may choose the best chance to score. If ball goes out 
of bounds, touched last by a baseman, it is given to the opposing 
guard; if touched last by a guard it is given to the nearest baseman.

  264 GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 
Penalty.—Opposing center guard has free throw for goal from 
center of field. Whether made or not, the ball is dead after the throw 
and is thrown up in center. 
If guard steps on base, the ball is given to the nearest baseman. 
If guard steps on captain’s base, a point is awarded the opposing 
team. 
Drive Ball.—This is a variation of the game outlined in Miss 
Bancroft’s book and makes a more interesting game. Players are 
advised to wear a glove on the active hand. 
Equipment.—A volley ball or light practice basket-ball or soccer 
ball, must be light in weight. Any fairly smooth space divided into 
two halves, each half court should be broader than it is deep. The 
rear line in each court is the goal line, unless the rear of the court is 
bounded by a wall. In that case, the wall is the goal.

Where field is small, fewer players may be used, or only a forward 
and a guard line. Too many players makes it too difficult to score. 
Object.—To send the ball across the goal line not higher than the 
heads of the guards. 
Score.—Two points for goal. 
Game.—Ball is put in play by placing on center of middle line. 
Centers kneel on one knee and at whistle each hits the ball with the 
front of her fist. Ball continues to be sent back and forth across the 
center line (hit only by fist) until sent across the goal line or hits 
wall. Any player may hit the ball, but the forwards have best 
opportunity to try for goal. The ball should be passed back and 
forth between players on the same side by throwing or rolling to 
each other until a good opening presents itself, then struck with 
fist across the center line. Bouncing the ball and hitting it on the 
rebound adds to the effectiveness of it. If ball crosses goal line above
-P-A-G-E-263
  GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 265 
the head of the guard, it merely continues in play. When sent out 
of bounds on side, the nearest player throws it in. Ball is put in 
play in center, after each goal and at the beginning of each half. 
Fouls.—1. Throwing or kicking ball across center line. 
2. Kicking ball. 
3. Stepping across center line. 
4. Rough play. 
Penalty.—An unguarded throw by center on opposite side only 
the guards interfering, forward and half backs standing aside. 
Cage Volley Ball, or Giant Volley Ball.—This is a game which causes 
much merriment and laughter and at the same time affords some 
exercise without being very strenuous. It is highly recommended 
for a mass program as the number of players is limited only by the 
size of the field. The rules are very simple and little skill is neces- 
sary in order to enjoy it. 
Equipment.—A volley ball net and standards. A fairly smooth 
playing space about the size of the volley-ball court. A ball 20 inches 
to 36 inches in diameter. As the 36-inch giant ball is very expensive, 
and as it is also rather heavy for girls to handle, a smaller size is 
recommended, a 20 to 24-inch-rubber ball or, better still, one made 
of aéroplane cloth, tightly inflated, is very suitable. 
Players.—Thirty to sixty. 
Object.—To play the ball into the opponent’s territory in such a 
way that they are unable to return it. 
Score.—One point every time the opposing side fails to return ball, 
sends it out of court or into net. Only serving side can score. When 
serving side fails to return ball or sends it into net or out of court, 
no point is scored by the opposing side, but serving side loses serve. 
Play.—Players line up in rows as nearly as possible, although with 
large numbers, owing to the nature of the play, it is difficult to main- 
tain this formation. 
The rules are practically the same as those for volley ball, although 
for a very large group, using mass play, the fine points will need 
to be eliminated. For mass play, the ball is put in play by No. 15 
or the player in the right-hand corner, serving from the rear line, 
with both feet behind the line. She tosses the ball lightly into the 
air and bats it with the open palm. In case first ball goes into net 
or fails to reach the net, another ball may be served. 
1. The ball when served may be struck by one other player on the 
server’s side in order to assist it across. 
2. When once in play, the ball may be passed back and forth  
-P-A-G-E-264
  266 GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 
among players on the same side any number of times before sending 
it across net. 
3. Ball must always be struck with open hand, not thrown and 
not caught and held. 
4. A player continues serving until she serves a fault, or until her

Chart showing the field, line-up and way in which players rotate to the left 
of their positions after each server finishes. Each player moves left, the player 
on the extreme left becomes the right hand player of the row ahead. Number 1 
moves back to serve, and number 15 steps forward into the rear line. 
Scoring.—1. Each good service which the opponent fails to return 
scores 1 point for the serving side. 
2. The serving side also scores a point when the 
receiving side fails to return a ball in play. 
3. Only the serving side scores. 
4. Fifteen points constitutes a game. 
Fouls.—1. Serving out of turn. 
2. Catching or holding a ball. 
3. Throwing the ball. 
4. Touching the net while hitting the ball.

Penalty.—If committed by serving side, the serve is lost. If 
committed by the receiving side, the serving side scores a point. 
B. RELAYS. 
1. Walking—forward, backward, sidward. 
2. Hopping—forward, backward, sideward. 
3. Crawling—forward, backward, sideward. 
4. Running—forward, backward, sideward. 
5. Jumping—forward, backward, sideward. 
Many and varied combinations of the above may be made, 
including carrying objects from place to place, passing objects and 
throwing objects as well as climbing over and under obstacles. 
Relays are classified according to: 
(A) Team Formation and Line-up. 
(B) Team Activities. 
(A) Team Formation and Line-up.—There are three different 
types: 
I. File relays. 
Il. Shuttle relays. 
III. Circle or pursuit relays. 
I. File Relays.—Teams all line up in file formation behind a com- 
mon line. Each team has a common objective equi-distant from the 
starting line. The objective may be a line, a wall, or an object

around which the runner must go before returning to touch off the 
next in her file. She then proceeds to the rear of the file. The last 
runner should wear a distinguishing mark of some kind. In running 
   
-P-A-G-E-266
  268 GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 
to and from her goal, the runner may be required to go around or 
over obstacles (maze or obstacle relay). She may be required to 
carry an object and throw it (goal-shooting relay) or she may be 
required to transfer object from one spot to another (potato relay) 
before touching off her team mate who cannot cross the starting 
line until she has been touched. 
IL. Shuttle Relays.—Two parallel lines are drawn equi-distant 
from each other. Half of each team lines up in file formation on 
either side of these parallel lines directly opposite and facing each 
other. These two lines are the starting lines. One-half of each 
team receives even numbers, and the other half odd numbers. All 
even numbers stand behind the same line and all odd numbers 
behind the opposite line. At the word “Go” all numbers “1” run 
across and touch off their own numbers “2”, then go to the rear 
of the even file. Numbers “2” run across and touch off Numbers 
“3” then go to the rear of their odd file. This continues until all 
have run, the last runner touched merely crosses the opposite line 
without touching off any one.

Ill. Cirele or Pursuit Relays.—These are of three types, depending 
upon how the teams line up. The race is run around a circle, each 
runner makes a complete circle and touches off the next runner 
or runs a part of the distance and touches off her team mate at a 
certain spot. 
Scheme No. 1.—Each runner makes the complete circle—this 
scheme better adopted to small space. 
CHART 58.—DIAGRAM OF SCHEME NO. 1. 
* = Team “‘A” -- any number. 
O = Team “‘B”’ -- same number. 
— = Team ‘‘C’’ -- same number. 
0 = Team “‘D” -- same number. 
They draw for places—No. 1 in each team takes her place and the 
remaining number in each team stand back out of the way until 
Nos. “1” are off. Then immediately No. “2” step into place, each 
runner completes the circle and touches off No. 2, No. 2 does the 
same and so on until each has run. 
Scheme No. 2.—This may be used where the circle is larger. 
Runners from each team are stationed in groups as in Scheme No. 1. 
There should be as many runners in each group as there are teams 
and the number of groups and the distance apart of the groups 
depend upon the size of the track or circle and the number which 
compose the team. 
   
-P-A-G-E-268
  270 GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 
In this case there are four girls on each team stationed at intervals 
and each girl runs one-quarter the distance around the circle. No. 1 
in each team touches off No. 2, No. 2 touches off No. 3, ete. Where 
the distance is long enough, the outside runner may cross over to

the inside while running, provided she does so without interfering 
with the other runners. Eight girls may be used on a team by plac- 
ing eight groups at intervals or by doing as indicated in Chart 59 
for the first 4 runners and then repeating with 4 more. The relay 
may be made into a “medley relay” by placing the groups at unequal 
intervals.

Scheme No. 3.—This is similar to Scheme No. 2, except that each 
group is composed of members of the same team instead of members 
of each team. This is advisable for large number for a small space. 
Each runner runs the entire distance. This is probably the most 
thrilling as the faster runners will overtake and pass the runners 
of the team ahead.

Any number may be used on a team. Any number of teams may 
be used. Girls not actually running remain in the background until 
time torun. The baseball relay is a good example of this type. Each 
team is arranged back of a base. Runners in each team touch bases 
successively, carrying a baton or scarf. The last runner after touch- 
ing his own base finishes by handing scarf to instructor or judge who 
stands in center. This makes it easier to judge the winner.

General Rules and Suggestions.—1. Always allow runner to carry 
a baton, colored handkerchief, banner or something to pass on to 
the next runner. This should be passed, not thrown, and eliminates 
tendency to fouls which are apt to occur when using just a “touch 
off” system. It makes judging of fouls easier. 
2. In circle relay it is customary to draw a line 10 yards each 
side of starting line and parallel to it. The runner may receive the
-P-A-G-E-271
  GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 273 
baton anywhere within this space. This enables the runner who is 
waiting to go back toward the coming runner, start running forward 
and receive the baton any where within that 20 yards while moving. 
This is called “getting a flying start.” 
3. Never cross the foul line until touched off. 
4. (a) In shuttle relays, while waiting, stand with weight on 
forward foot, foot just touching starting line, bend body forward, 
and extend arm forward toward runner. (b) In circle relays, whether 
standing or running backward toward runner, weight is on the 
forward foot, but body is turned partially toward the rear and 
opposite arm is extended backward. 
5. Always remember to approach waiting runner on the side of the 
extended arm in order to avoid interference. If waiting runner has 
right arm extended, approach her on her right side carrying the 
baton in your right hand in case of shuttle relays. In case of circle 
relays, if waiting runner’s right arm is extended backward, the 
approaching runner advances on waiting runner’s right side with 
left hand extended. 
6. Circle relays are always run with left side of runner toward 
the “pole” or inside. 
B. Classification by Team Activities. 
I. In which runner carries no object. 
I. In which runner carries an object and passes it on. 
II. In which runner carries an object and performs some stunt 
before passing it on. 
IV. (a) In which player stands still and passes object. 
(b) Passes object and then changes position. 
V. In which whole team moves at same time. 
Examples of No. 1.—In file or shuttle formation. As these are too 
numerous to mention, only a few are suggested: 
1. Walking forward—ordinary walk. 
2. Walking forward, placing heel of advancing foot directly in 
front of and against toes of other foot—called “measuring 
stick.” 
. Walking backward. 
. Walking sideward. 
. Running forward. 
. Running backward. 
. Running sideward. 
. Hopping forward, sideward or backward on both feet. 
. Hopping forward, sideward or backward on one foot, holding 
the other foot and arms in various positions.

10. Crawling forward. 
11. Crawling backward—(Japanese crab race). 
12. Combinations of all of the above. 
13. Any of the above combined with jumping, climbing, getting 
over or under obstacles—example: 
(a) Run 20 feet, jump a hurdle 2-feet high, run 10 feet, crawl under 
a hurdle, run 10 feet, climb a ladder and return walking. 
(b) Running 30 feet, do forward roll, walk back. 
Examples of No. 1I.—Same as above but .carrying an object of 
some kind. 
(a) Carrying baton or scarf and passing it on. 
(b) Carrying basket-ball balanced on one hand. 
(ce) Carrying book on head. 
Examples of No. WWI.—In file or shuttle formation: 
(a) Each girl bounces a basket-ball ‘to a given point, rolls it back 
to next on team, then drops out (file formation). 
(b) Each girl bounces ball across space and passes it to the team 
mate on opposite side of room—then goes to rear of file—(shuttle 
formation). At end of relay each half of a team has exchanged 
places with the other half. : 
(ec) Each runner runs to basket, throws for goal and continues 
to throw until she makes a basket, carries ball back to next in file 
and retires to rear of file (file formation). 
(d) First runner on each team carries an umbrella and a suit case 
containing rubbers, skirt, coat, gloves and hat. At a certain spot 
each runner stops, opens suit case, dresses, raises umbrella and runs 
to certain point where she removes the articles and replaces in suit 
case, returns to starting point and next runner repeats—(file or 
shuttle formation). This is not suitable for large team because of 
time consumed, Always makes an amusing way to end a program. 
Examples of No. IV: 
(a) Players line up with a group of objects on floor or in container 
at head of line. Players pass objects one at a time down the line 
or file, deposit them in container at other end and then return them 
in same way. 
. Using right hand only. 
. Using left hand only. 
. Using both hand. 
. Passing objects between feet (file formations). 
. Passing objects overhead—(file formation). or

Nore.—In file formation players stand one behind the other; in 
line formation, players stand side by side. 
6. Passing objects behind—(line formation). 
7. Criss-cross Ball Throw.—Players are arranged as follows:

Nos. 1 each hold a ball of same kind. At a given signal No. 1 
throws to No. 2, No. 2 to No. 8, etc., until No. 8 has received it. No. 
8 then throws to No. 7, No. 7 to No. 6, etc. The team which returns 
ball to No. 1 first wins. If ball is dropped, girl who dropped it must 
pick it up and return to her original place before passing it. Various 
kinds of throws may be used, with right hand, left hand, both hands, 
from chest, from overhead, etc. This is very good practice for 
preliminary team work in basket-ball. 
(b) Standing in file formation with feet apart, a ball or other 
object is passed from one player to another starting with No. 1. 
The last player picks up object, runs to front of file and it is again 
passed back, the last player remaining in front each time. 
1. Straddle Ball Relay.—Ball is passed backward between feet. 
It is not necessary that each girl touch it. 
2. Overhead Relay.—Ball is passed backward—not thrown 
over the heads of the players. 
8. Over and Under Relay.—First girl passes ball between feet, 
second girl passes it overhead, third girl passes it between 
feet, ete. 
Examples of No. V: 
1. Skin Snake Relay—(File formation).—Each girl on team 
assumes straddle position with right hand extended backward 
between legs and left hand forward grasping the right hand of the 
girl in front. At a signal the last girl in each file lies down flat on 
her back and the rest of the team, keeping feet wide apart and still 
grasping hands start walking backward. Each player, as her turn 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  276 GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 
comes, lies down, still grasping hands. The last player lies down, 
touches her head to ground, then rises and walks forward, all still 
grasping hands. The team getting back first into original position 
wins. 
2. Angle-worm Relay—(File Formation).—Each girl assumes a 
“deep-knee bend” position with buttocks resting directly on heels. 
Each player reaches back and grasps the ankles of girls behind. 
at a given signal all players raise buttocks and move forward, 
retaining grasp on ankles. The team crossing completely the finish 
line first wins. Breaking the column disqualifies a team. 
3. Addition Relay—(Shuttle Formation).—All Nos. 1 run across 
and grasp one hand of Nos. 2, returning Nos. 2 still holding Nos. 1, 
grasp Nos. 3, this is repeated until every member of a team has been 
picked up. The team crossing finish line first with file unbroken 
wins. Breaking file disqualifies. 
ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS. 
Crawl] and Run Relay.'—Arrange the teams in parallel columns of 
files, 10 feet apart, abreast of a common line, players standing at 
normal intervals with feet spread. At signal, the last player in each 
column drops onto her hands and knees and crawls forward between 
the legs of the other players in the column. On arriving at the front 
of the column she rises and runs to the rear of the column, where she 
touches the next player. She then falls in her regular position. The 
player touched drops on her hands and feet and crawls forward 
between the legs of those in front, rises and runs around to the last 
player, drops down and crawls under her legs and rises and touches 
the next player, then falls into her regular position. The race con- 
tinues in this manner, each player in turn crawling through the legs 
of the players in front, running to the rear of the column and crawl- 
ing forward to her starting position until all have run. The team 
finishing first wins. 
Double Rope Skip Relay.!—Arrange the teams in parallel columns 
of two’s, 10 feet apart, abreast of a common line. Establish a turning 
point 60 feet in front of each column. Give the first pair of players 
in each column a rope 10 feet long. Each player holds one end of the 
rope in her outside hand and links her inside elbow with her partner. 
At signal, the first pair runs forward to or around the turning point 
1 §. C. Staley: Games, Contests and Relays,
-P-A-G-E-275
  
  GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 277 
and returns to the starting line, skipping the rope all of the way. 
At the starting line, they pass the rope to the second pair, who 
repeat the performance. In any case where skipping is halted the 
players must halt their forward progress without skipping. Each 
pair runs in turn until all have run. The team having its last pair 
recross the starting line first wins. 
Down and Up Relay.'—Arrange the teams in parallel columns of 
files 10 feet apart abreast of a common line. Place the players in 
each column 8 feet apart. Have all the players on each team spread 
their legs and lean forward. At signal, the first player in the column 
passes an object back between her legs to the next player, who 
passes it on in the same way. When the last player in the column 
gets the object she shouts “Down.” On this command the other 
players of the team crouch to the ground. The last player, with 
legs astraddle, runs forward over the other girls, who have huddled 
close to the ground. When she reaches the front of the column all 
rise and the object is passed back between the legs as before. The 
last player carries it forward as before. Upon arriving at the front 
of the column each player takes up position there. This continues 
until all have run forward. The team returning to its original posi- 
tion first wins. 
Dumb-bell Push Relay.'—Arrange the teams in parallel columns 
10 feet apart, abreast of common line. Place a dumb-bell on the 
ground before the first player of each column. Give the first player 
in each column a short stick. At signal, this player, using only the 
stick, pushes the dumb-bell forward to or around a given point and 
returns. As the bell recrosses the starting line the first player passes 
the stick to the second player, who makes the run and passes it to 
the third and so on, until all have run. The bell must be pushed 
and not flung; any player who fails to comply with this rule defaults 
his team. The team which has its last player recross the starting 
line first wins. 
Foot Dribble Relay.\—Arrange the teams in parallel columns of 
files 10 feet apart, abreast of a common line. Establish a turning 
point €0 feet in front of each team. Place a medicine ball on the 
ground before the first player of each team. At signal, the first 
player kicks the ball forward to or around the turning point and back 
to the starting point. When the ball crosses the starting line the 
1. C. Staley: Games, Contests and Relays. 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  278 GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 
second player stops the ball and repeats as the first player. Players 
must not start forward until the ball has crossed the line. The 
team which has its last player recross the starting line first wins. 
Forward Roll Relay.1—Arrange the teams in parallel columns 10 
feet apart, abreast of a common line. Place the players in each 
column 8 feet apart. Established a finishing line 30 feet in front of 
each column. At signal, the last player in each column does a 
forward roll and, coming to his feet, touches the player in front of 
him. This player repeats the roll and touches the player in front 
of him. This continues until all have rolled. The player at the head 
of the column after executing his roll, runs forward to the finishing 
line. The team which has its leading player cross the finishing line 
first wins. 
Line Hop Relay.— File formation. 
(a) Each girl bends right knee. Ankle of right foot is grasped 
in right hand of girl behind. In this position the whole 
line hops forward on left foot until whole team has 
crossed the finish line. Putting the foot down disquali- 
fies the team. 
(b) Same hopping backward across finish line. 
Potato Relay.'—Arrange the teams in parallel columns of files 10 
feet apart and abreast of a common line. Establish one circle 1 
foot in diameter immediately in front of each column. Establish 
one other circle 1 foot in diameter 30 feet in front of each column. 
Place three potatoes (blocks of wood, stones, etc.) in each circle on 
the line. At signal the first runner of each team, carrying the pota- 
toes one at a time, places them in the advanced circle. Completing 
the task he returns to the starting line where he touches the second 
player. The second player, carrying one at a time, carries them back 
to their original circle. The third player carries them forward again. 
This continues until all have run. Each potato must be placed in 
the circle before the next can be taken. The team which has its 
last player recross the starting line after finishing the task first wins. 
Potato Shuttle Relay.—See Girls’ Branch Public School Athletic 
League, New York City, page 41. 
Progressive Relay.—File Formation—Spots “A,” “B” and “C” 
are marked on floor at various distances in front of each team, all 
A’s being equi-distant from starting line, all B’s equi-distant, etc. A 
runner is stationed on each of these spots. At signal, No. 1 in each 
1§. C. Staley: Games, Contests and Relays.

GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION 279 
team runs to spot “A,” tags A, and stays there. A runs to B, tags 
B and stays there. B runs to C, tags C and stays there. C runs to 
head of team, who is No. 2, tags her and then goes to rear of team. 
No. 2 repeats No. 1’s performance and this continues until all in 
line have run.

Rope-climbing Relay.—One rope needed for each team. (File 
formation). No. 1 climbs to a specified height, slides or climbs 
down, runs back to touch off No. 2. No. 2 climbs and repeats and so 
on until whole file has finished. This may be combined with climb- 
ing ropes crossing over to ladders or poles at a certain height and 
returning by way of ladders or poles. 
Sack Relay.—File or Shuttle Formation—At signal, Nos. 1 
climb into potato sack which they either tie around their waists 
or hold closed at waist by use of hands. If shuttle formation is used 
they hop across to Nos. 2, jump out of bags and Nos. 2 climb in 
and continue. 
Stilt Walk Relay.—File or Shuttle Formation—Each No. 1 is 
provided with a pair of stilts. At signal she mounts and walks across 
to No. 2, dismounts and hands stilts to No. 2. This continues until 
all of one team has walked. Same may be done with skiis, or snow 
shoes in the winter. Bicycle relays may be run the same way. 
Three-legged Relay.—Teams are arranged with players in pairs 
in file or shuttle formation. First pair in each team are bound 
together with a strap just below the knees. The strap is fastened 
around the inside legs with the couple standing side by side. They 
place their inside arm around each other. At the signal, they hobble 
across to No. 2’s and unbuckle the straps. Couples No. 2 strap 
themselves together and continue.

C. INDIVIDUAL GAMES AND SPORTS OF LOW ORGANIZATION. 
These are especially invaluable because they represent a form 
of recreation which can be enjoyed and indulged in without the 
necessity of getting together a group. They are particularly recom- 
mended for those physically handicapped and for those who for 
various reasons have not the endurance required for the more active 
games and sports. While the following list does not exhaust the 
possibilities, it contains practically all of the most usable games: 
Archery. 
. Bean bag toss. 
. Bowling. 
. Clock golf. 
. Croquet. 
Deck shuffle board. 
. Darts. 
Hand-ball. 
9. Ping pong. 
10. Putting contests. 
11. Quoits. 
12. Riflery. 
13. Tenikoit. 
14. Tether ball. 
15. Paddle tennis. 
Hand-ball, tenikoit and paddle tennis are the most active on the 
list, and hand-ball especially can be made a very strenuous game. 
1. Archery: See Spalding’s Athletic Library, Group XI, No. 43-R. 
2. Bean Bag Toss.—Draw on the floor or ground three concentric 
circles, diameter of the smallest one should not be less than 1 foot, 
that of the largest one not more than 6 feet. The size depends upon 
the age of the players, the older and more skilled they are, the smaller 
should be the circles. From 10 to 30 feet from the outer circle a 
foul line is drawn, the distance again depending upon the age and 
skill. For large numbers, several sets of targets may be drawn. Each 
group has three bean bags. Each player throws in turn, throwing 
each of the three bags, standing toeing the foul line. If bag stops on 
inner circle, it scores 15 points, if between the center circle and the 
second circle, it scores 10 points and if between second circle and 
outer circle 5 points. In expert playing, a bag landing on a line does 
not count. The player who wins the most points in five rounds, 
wins. This arrangement can be varied. DN ASMP wNwre

3. Bowling.—See Spalding’s Athletic Library, Group XII, No.

4. Clock Golf.—This is a game of putting and requires a hard 
smooth turf or clay or sand surface. A large circle 30 feet or more in 
diameter is marked to represent a clock. A cup corresponding to a 
regular golf cup is sunk somewhere inside the circle, preferably 
not in the exact center, so as to vary the distances from each number 
to the hole. Putters and golf balls are needed. Two, three or four 
is an ideal number of contestants. The object of the game is to put 
the ball into the hole with the fewest number of strokes, beginning 
by placing the ball on the number “1” or beside it, and thereafter on 
each succeeding number until it has been played into the hole from 
all 12 numbers. Each player may have a ball and alternate hitting 
as in golf, or one ball may be used, one player beginning at “1” 
and putting until she has made the first hole, then the second begin- 
ning at “1” and putting until she has made the first hole, ete. 
scoring can be done in two ways: 
(a) By holes—the winner being the one who has won the great- 
est number of holes out of the 12. 
(b) By stroke—the winner being the one whose total number 
of strokes (adding together the total number of strokes 
required to make the 12 holes) is least. 
CHART 65 
  Equipment for clock golf may be obtained from Spalding Brothers. 
Clock golf can be made very interesting and is splendid practice for 
putting in golf. The game can be adapted to a floor space by 
drawing a circle for a cup and using rubber or wooden pucks in 
place of balls.

is rounded off 6 inches. The space 1 feet away from each end, is 
marked into nine 1-foot squares, each being numbered.

Zero Area.— An area 3 feet from the “off” end, marked by one 
line, the same width of the cort, 3 feet. 
Starting Line.—A line drawn 15 feet from the “off” end, or 12 
feet from the zero area, marked by a line the same width as the 
court, 3 feet. 
Equipment.—Wooden disks 6 inches in diameter, 12 inches thick. 
Cue 5 feet long, the one end of which is broadened, and cut into 
circular form that will fit disk and permit of a straight “pitch.” 
Object of Game.—The object is to put two of the disks, 2 shots 
allowed, for each disk, in the nwmbered areas in the court beyond 
the zero area where it becomes “dead.” 
Score.—The game may be anything decided upon before starting 
to play. It is generally not less than 50. Example, if one disk lands 
in “—10” the other in “6,” the score is “—4.”’ Score is counted 
after all disks are played. 
Terms.—A disk becomes “dead” when: 1. It lands in zero area; 
2. goes beyond court. 
This forfeits the second shot and is “cleared off” the “pitch.” 
“ Pitch.” —Smooth area between starting line and court. 
Game.—The disks are put on the starting line and shoved for- 
ward with the cue. One disk is “shot through’ (2 shots) before the 
opponent plays a disk. The player having highest score’ shoves 
first the next time. 
A partnership game for more than two may be made, each partner 
shoving one disk and the scores combined. 
Cue is held in one hand, foot on opposite side being forward.

Suggestions.—Handicap starting lines may be marked inside of 
starting line for weaker players. 
Sand, French chalk or face powder may be used to make the 
“pitch faster.” 
Two courts may be marked off best in this manner (Chart 67).

10. Putting Contests.—Similar to clock golf, except that there are 
a number of holes arranged at irregular intervals, close enough 
together so that only a putter is needed. By criss-crossing the course 
a 9-hole course can be accommodated in a small yard. In small 
spaces few holes may be used and each contestant required to play 
around 2 or3 times. The turf or ground should be smooth and hard. 
Scoring is done as clock golf. This makes an interesting contest 
and is splendid practice for golf.

tules are similar to tennis. Scoring is by point as in volley ball or

hand-ball, being different from tennis in that only the serving side, 
or “side in’ can score. A doughnut-shaped inflated rubber ring 
7 inches in diameter is used in place of a ball and this is tossed back 
and forth. A rope quoit and volley ball net may be used. Tenikoit 
is highly recommended for any age, is less strenuous than tennis or

  CHAPTER XVIII. 
PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS. 
/ Two factors have combined to precipitate and increase the present 
interest in physical efficiency tests. 
First, the astounding results of the army draft made the country 
at large realize as never before not only the prevalence of physical 
defects, but that these were for the most part not only remediable, 
but preventable. It realized also that there must be developed 
not only better ways and means for detecting defects and for improv- 
ing them, but also methods for interesting individuals in desiring 
to overcome and improve them. Hence, the interest in tests, which 
had been mostly local and sporadic and confined largely to tests 
for measuring motor efficiency, assumed a new and added signifi- 
cance. i 
Secondly, this is the age of standardizations, of tests and measure- 
ments in general education. The tendency is to measure everything 
by. arbitrary standards because personal judgment is too inaccurate. 
Hence physical education is but keeping pace with general educa- 
tion in its efforts to test and measure and classify individuals. 
Educators who have been experimenting have found that physical 
efficiency is just as difficult to measure as intelligence. Like intel- 
ligence, it is dependent upon no one quality or condition, and just 
as no single test will satisfactorily measure the one, so will no single 
test satisfactorily measure the other. 
There is some little danger at present of over-standardizing and 
over-testing, or at least of depending too much upon the results 
as expressed in figures. There is a tendency to take figures too 
literally and not to pay enough attention to that elusive something— 
that fourth dimension in a human being which turns failure into 
success. There is also a tendency to overlook the influence of the 
moral and social qualities which we are trying to develop which do 
not lend themselves so easily to measurement. 
There seems to have been, and still is on the part of many, a 
lack of agreement or understanding as to what physical efficiency 
is, and hence a confusion as to what a physical efficiency test should 
( 286 )
-P-A-G-E-285
  PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 287 
consist of. As a result, the country is at present flooded with 
so-called physical efficiency, motor ability, physical achievement 
and physical ability tests, all more or less claiming to measure the 
same thing. Some are tests of organic efficiency, some are tests 
of muscular strength and others are simply tests of agility or neuro- 
muscular control. 
The very earliest tests, those in use before the war, measured 
pure muscular strength. Intercollegiate strength tests and the 
dynamometer devised by Dr. D. A. Sargent, are well known. 
Strength and bulk of muscle was considered an evidence of physical 
efficiency. Later, heart-rate and blood-pressure were accepted as 
evidence of organic condition and various tests devised by Crampton, 
Foster, Schneider and others were used in an effort to measure 
physical efficiency. Probably the simplest test of this type is the 
pulse-rate test of physical condition. This test does not require 
the services of an expert since its only purpose is to eliminate sub- 
normal cases from strenuous athletic or gymnastic work, and should 
not be given to an individual who is known to be in a subnormal 
condition unless given by a trained expert. Quoting from Bowen 
and Mitchell ,! the test is as follows: 
The Pulse-rate Test of Physical Condition: 
1. Find the pupil’s normal pulse-rate. 
2. Have him run in place for fifteen seconds. 
3. Find how soon the pulse recovers normal rate. 
Degree of Physical habit 
Time to recover. Grade. fitness. or type. 
One-half minute A Fine Athletic 
One minute B Good Active 
Two minutes Cc Fair Moderate 
Three minutes D Poor Sedentary 
Pulse slower after run E Very poor 
If the pulse is irregular after the run, drop one grade down the 
scale. 
With the advent of a wider interest in and application of motor- 
ability tests has come the confusion, and since such confusion evi- 
dently exists, it might be well to attempt to define the word “ effi- 
ciency,” in an effort to arrive at an understanding of what is meant 
by “physical efficiency.” The dictionary defines it as “(1) The 
power of action, the act of producing effects. (2) From the point 
of view of mechanics, it is the ratio of energy or work that is gotten 
1 The Practice of Organized Play.
-P-A-G-E-286
  288 PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 
out of an engine, a storage battery or the like, to the energy put in. 
(3) Political economy defines it as productive activity, the power 
of producing wealth.” The dictionary further defines “efficient” 
the adjective, as “characterized by energetic and useful activity, 
effectual, competent, capable.” All of these definitions indicate 
that to be efficient is to be able to produce. Hence, an individual 
is efficient physically, then, only in so far as he is able to produce. 
We are living in an age when efficiency is spelled in capital letters. 
No individual can be 100 per cent mentally or socially efficient who 
is physically inefficient. No individual can be physically efficient 
whose body mechanics are poor or whose organs do not function 
properly. To be absolutely efficient, an individual should be in good 
health according to the accepted standards of good health, should 
be sound organically, have no physical defects, have good health 
habits, be possessed of endurance and strength, be well poised, 
endowed with the mental and moral qualities which make him a 
valuable social asset, and be capable of a certain definite high neuro- 
muscular control as exhibited by his reaction to certain motor- 
ability tests. 
Manifestly, no one test or type of tests can adequately meet all 
of the conditions, and conclusions based upon the posture test, 
height-weight-age tables, heart and blood-pressure reactions, or 
motor ability scores alone are not to be relied upon as comprehen- 
sive evidence of fitness or efficiency. 
Complete physical efficiency is dependent upon motor efficiency, 
adie efficiency is dependent upon organic efficiency, upon the con- 
dition of the neuro-muscular mechanisms and the general physical 
condition. So, any tests, to be true physical efficiency tests, must 
measure more than mere motor ability or proficiency, more than 
just vigor or pure muscle strength. They must measure all of these. 
They must measure an individual’s physical deficiencies. If there 
are motor deficiencies, there must be mental, “social” or physical 
reasons for them, and a real test would tend to show wherein the 
weakness lies. Failure to vault a buck at a certain height may be 
due to fear or timidity; it may be due to malnutrition or fatigue; 
or it may be due to lack of neuro-muscular control due to inactivity. 
Hence, a physical efficiency test should include a motor ability or 
proficiency test, but the latter alone is never a complete test of 
physical efficiency. It is this misunderstanding which has caused 
the confusion in terms. 
The use of tests undoubtedly points the way to a more intelligent
-P-A-G-E-287

PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 289 
organization and procedure. Results should be studied, not filed, 
and an attempt made to treat and remedy the primary cause of the 
poor showing. Too much attention is being paid at present to 
motor ability scores as such, and not enough to improving physical 
defects. Of course, this requires time, money, trained instructors 
and proper organization. But, unless intelligent procedure is 
adopted, the situation is no different from that of the physician 
who places a thermometer in the patient’s mouth, looks at the degree 
of temperature and walks away. To date, no’satisfactory tests have 
been evolved, although much progress has been made. 
After a number of years of research and experimenting, the author 
came to the conclusion that no one group of tests would suffice, 
but that the problem must be worked out on the basis of a series or 
team of tests.!. With this in mind, some little study was made of 
the intelligence tests and their methods of scoring with the idea of 
working out a scheme which would make it possible eventually 
‘to give a girl or woman a score or rating—a “P. Q.” or Physical 
“ Quotient, analogous to the “I. Q.” or Intelligence Quotient. The 
study was made among college freshmen only in coéperation with 
the Eastern Society of the Association of College Directors of 
Physical Education for Women and the averages obtained repre- 
sent what ought to be expected of a girl entering college as a fresh- 
man, as a result of a triple examination, a medical, a physical (an- 
thropometric), and a motor-ability test. In connection with each 
group of tests, an arbitrary point system was adopted, which was 
later corrected on the basis of the statistics returned by the various 
colleges. As a result of each group of tests, the student receives a 
score in each, and the sum total of these three scores represents her 
“P.Q.” The value to her of her scores lies in her knowledge of what 
normal should be, and of the follow-up system used in connection 
with poor scores. There are a number of weaknesses in connection 
with this scheme. 
First, the score does not represent a true “P. Q.” as that should 
be found by dividing the “physical age” by the “chronological age.” 
As these students were treated as freshmen, age was disregarded 
and so there was no means of comparison. In working out motor- 
ability tests for the adolescent or preadolescent girl, age, as well 
as height, weight, and grade (mental development) might be a 
factor. However, the value in any scoring system lies in establish-

Physical Education Review, November, 1923, 
19 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  290 PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 
ing a certain “norm” above which an individual is more efficient, 
below which she is less efficient and educating individuals to know 
the value of the “norm.” These tests tend to do that. Another 
criticism is that the sum total score, being very comprehensive, is 
too indefinite. It represents so many items that it loses special 
significance. For that reason the sum total score has been dis- 
regarded in using it at Barnard College, and the score from each 
individual group of tests and the norm for that special group 
emphasized. Although the author fully realizes the weaknesses of 
the scheme, she has such faith in the principle and its application 
that she presents her tests and score sheets with the hope that 
they will inspire others to experiment and eventually evolve tests 
which will be more accurate.

Instructions For Use wira Score Carps anp Keys. 
I. All measurements and records are in inches, feet, seconds, 
pounds, etc. Do not allow a girl to practise first. 
II. In case a girl exceeds the highest records, she will get only the 
maximum number of points provided for, but indicate this by a plus 
or double plus on the record. In case she does not reach the mini- 
mum test, she will receive a zero (0). Indicate that on record by a 
minus (—). 
Medical Test.—Height, weight, age test—Life Insurance Tables. 
“Plus—minus” (==) means the number of points variation above 
or below the normal given in the tables. (Insurance). 
Hemoglobin, the color test. 
Heart, the number of heart beats before and after exercise, and 
the length of time it takes to return to normal, and any other test 
which will enable you to judge the condition of the heart. 
Teeth, take into consideration whether or not the teeth are in 
need of attention, and whether they have needed it and received it. 
Same with eyes. 
General hygiene of body, condition of hair and scalp, nails, teeth, 
from point of view of cleanliness, care, etc. 
In taking medical tests rate each girl A, B, C, D, or E in each test 
except height, weight, and hemoglobin. The key sheet will give 
the value for each letter. 
Anthropometric Test.—Lung capacity, as indicated by wet spiro- 
meter in cubic inches. 
Strongest grip, as indicated by the manometer (in pounds), when 
held with hand close to thigh, but not touching it. 
Motor-ability Test.—Do not allow student to over-exert. 
High jump, below 1 foot, 6 inches receives no score. Allow two 
trials for each height. Use official equipment. 
Basket-ball throw, done in the usual manner with official ball. 
Buck, straddle vault for height. 
Ropes, count distance from where the lowest part of the feet 
grasps the rope to the floor. Less than 2 feet receives no points, as 
most girls jump 2 feet in getting into position for climbing. 
Boom —test for balarice—consists in walking length of boom and 
returning without touching anything, boom raised 3 feet from floor. 
Balance beam at same height may be substituted. The judgment 
of the instructor enters in here. Give credit for distance walked, if 
girl falls off.

Gymnastics.—This event is added to give some idea of the stu- 
dent’s time reaction, response to command, coérdination, control, 
etc.; entirely a matter of examiner’s judgment, and as such is more 
or less unsatisfactory, but will help in our estimate of the girl. 
Administration of the Tests at Barnard College.—Each freshman 
upon entering college is given the medical and physical examination 
which is more extensive than the items listed on the test sheets. 
During October and early November, she is given her motor-ability 
test. The results of these tests are made the basis for the type of 
work and recreation the student will take in physical education and 
may effect even her academic program. She may be assigned to 
the so-called classes in formal gymnastics, to remedial classes or to 
individual corrective work. If assigned to a class in formal gym- 
nastics, she is placed in an “A” or “B” group, depending upon her 
motor-ability score. Each group works under a different instruc- 
tor during the gymnastic period and is given exercises adapted to 
its degree of development. In this way, the more efficient girl is 
given work difficult enough to interest her, and the less efficient girl 
is not discouraged by being required to attempt exercise too diffi- 
cult. The most capable girls are appointed as squad leaders and 
on apparatus days, especially, assist the instructors. 
In connection with taking motor-ability tests, the following score 
sheet (Chart 74) will be found very useful as it contains spaces for 
the results of individual performance by squads and it is a simple 
matter to record in the lower half of each square during leisure time 
the point value of each performance using the key sheets. 
From these score sheets may be obtained the following statistics 
which are always interesting to the girls and help to put the sub- 
ject on a competitive basis. 
1. Average high jump of each squad in feet. Average high jump 
of each squad in points. 
2. Same for each event. 
3. Average performance in each event of the “Gym” class by 
averaging the squads. 
4. Average points in each event of the “Gym” class by averaging 
squads. 
5. Average performance of the grade or whole class or troop or 
club by averaging all results in that grade or class or troop or club. 
6. Total class score. 
7. Total class average. 
8. Highest individual score, ete.

If not over-emphasized and over-stimulated, this offers a whole- 
some form of competition in which every girl in the class or troop 
or school may compete in so far as she is physically able. A failure 
to score anything in an event should not be excused but marked 
“0” regardless of the reason, and an individual’s total score should 
be lowered to that extent, because she is less efficient to that degree. 
An efficient organization will make it possible to follow up the 
failure and ascertain the reason for it. 
A greater degree of interest may be maintained by posting at the 
beginning and end of the year the results of all the examinations, or 
at least the final score and final per cent or grade for each girl.

1 Using 100 per cent as normal. 
By making a game of physical fitness, by keeping alive the com- 
petitive instinct in an individual or a group, it is generally possible 
to maintain a keener interest and obtain better results than by 
making the appeal on the basis of health, efficiency, etc. After all, 
the girl is generally interested in how far she can throw, how fast 
she can run, and how high she can climb and she is further interested 
in comparing her prowess and that of her group with the prowess 
of her friend or a rival group. To the instructor, her records repre- 
sent control, balance, strength, speed, courage, endurance or the 
opposite, and every point gained represents a gain in efficiency. 
Time spent on statistics is well spent when constructive use is 
made of those statistics. The following or similar figures posted 
on the bulletin boards, announced to classes or printed in the school 
or college publication, with a short article explaining their signifi- 
cance, not only helps to maintain interest, but represents a real

Uses of Motor-ability Tests.—The use to which a group of tests 
may be put depends entirely upon the type of the test, and the type 
chosen should depend upon the purpose to be served. Psycholo- 
gists recognized the same thing in working out the various mental 
tests and so they devised a number of different kinds of tests. The 
two which are most related to our problems are the intelligence and 
the achievement tests. 
The intelligence tests ave designed to measure general intelligence. 
They aim to test.imnate mental ability or brain power and are not 
dependent for results upon education. They test the basic thing 
upon which education is dependent. The motor-ability test de- 
scribed above (Chart 72) is of that type. It is a simple standard 
of measurement of the girls’ ability at the time, regardless of train- 
ing, and simple enough so that with directions it can be taken with- 
out practice, care being taken that the girl does not overdo. It is 
a measuring stick designed to measure the girl’s skill, strength, 
neuro-muscular as evidenced by her reaction to certain simple 
exercises based upon the primary activities, running, jumping,

progress in the different subjects, furnish a definite goal to work 
toward, and act as a stimulus for improvement. In physical educa- 
tion too, there should be tests which not only furnish a means for 
classifying girls from time to time according to ability, but which 
furnish a well-balanced program, offer an incentive to the girl and 
make her anxious to achieve and progress and make it possible 
for her to earn points and awards only after she has achieved. 
These scores and awards should (as evidence of accomplishment) 
represent the result of education. Achievement tests are a means 
of measuring the girl’s education along definite lines. An achieve-

ment test may have a point and scoring system in connection with 
it, or it may contain progressive groups of tests, the passing of each 
group of tests entitling the participant to a certain award or honor. 
Such tests may contain track and field events, swimming, games or 
the elements of game depending upon the aims and purposes of the 
tests. The Athletic Badge Test for girls conducted by the Play- 
ground and Recreation Association of America represents the 
latter type.

Still broader in its program and aims is the new set of “physical 
achievement tests for girls and women” recently issued by the Women’s 
Division of the National Amateur Athletic Federation through its 
Committee on Tests for Physical and Organic Efficiency. The 
foreword issued with these tests explains their purpose.
-P-A-G-E-301
  PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 303 
ForEeworb. 
These tests are designed primarily to measure physical achieve- 
ment and motor ability. They are not intended to serve as tests 
for organic efficiency, except in so far as a heart and lung examina- 
tion before and following these tests, color of skin and indications 
of fatigue can be used as indices of organic efficiency. 
These tests have been planned so that they can be used not only 
as a standard of measurement at any given time, but also as a pro- 
gram of physical activity and as a goal to work toward. 
They do not constitute an ideal program—from many standpoints 
—largely because the Committee has been restricted in its task by 
the fact that it could include only such events as would be within 
the reach of any girl or woman, and required as little equipment 
as possible. At the same time, the Committee has hoped that, where 
adequate recreational facilities were lacking, these tests might 
create a demand which might influence communities, institutions, 
etc., to procure the necessary equipment. 
Until these tests have been used for a year at least, and the sta- 
tistics have been sent to the offices of the Women’s Division to be 
tabulated, it will be impossible to state what are fair, good or 
excellent scores. These must be worked out, and for this purpose 
the Committee will use as age groups twelve to fourteen years, 
fifteen to seventeen years and eighteen to twenty-five years. 
In order that reports from all groups using these tests may be 
available for study at a definite date, the Committee has set June 
30, 1925, as the time limit for its first year’s tabulation of results, 
and it will use yearly periods from that date thereafter. 
All reports should therefore be sent in before June 30 of each year, 
beginning with 1925. Score sheets for this purpose may be obtained 
at cost price upon application at any time at the offices of the 
Women’s Division of the National Amateur Athletic Federation, 
2 West 46th Street, New York City. Results should be mailed to 
the same address. 
For the interest of groups using these tests, the Committee sug- 
gests that those under Groups I and I, and the swimming in Group 
IV, be applied at the beginning of the year’s activities, and again 
at the close, so that it will be possible to note what improvement 
has taken place in the group, individually and collectively. The 
other tests cannot of course be applied and completed until the 
proper length of time has elapsed for carrying them out.
-P-A-G-E-302
  804 PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 
The Committee realizes that the tests are far from perfect; but 
it hopes that experience in their use and the codperation of interested 
groups will serve in time to bring them to a point where many of 
their present shortcomings may be eliminated. 
A careful study of these tests will show that they furnish quite 
a complete program of physical activity and recreation for a group 
and a very broad goal to work toward in addition to being a measur- 
ing stick at any given time.

Except in Group II, points are not cumulative within a group, 
a girl receiving only the number for her best performance. Thus, 
if 25 feet is a girl’s best mark for the basket-ball throw, her score 
for that event is 3, and not 8 plus also the points awarded for the 
lesser distances. 
Track and Field Events.—Helpful suggestions may be found in

115R. Price 25 cents. 
50-yard dash: Use any start. 
Basket-ball Throw for Distance.—Single arm throw from behind a 
line, with or without run, using official basket-ball. Measure from 
point where ball crosses line to spot where it first strikes. 
High Jump.—Do not use this event unless mats for landing are 
available for indoor work, or soft dirt pits for out-of-doors. Use wooden 
cross bar. Allow 2 trials at each height. 
Target Throw.—Use target 15 inches wide and 2 feet long, with 
lower edge 2 feet from floor or ground. Use outdoor baseball, any 
weight. Use any throw. Contestants stand behind line 35 feet from 
target. Score is number of hits out of 10 throws. 
Stunts (Group A, simple; Group B, more complex).—Mercury 
(half horizontal).—Stand on either left or right foot. Bend body 
forward until at right angles with supporting leg, free leg bent 
slightly upward from knee, head up and arms side horizontal. 
Half Squat Change.—Squat on one heel with the other foot 
extended forward. Draw the extended foot under the body and 
shoot the other foot out, arms extended sideways for balance. 
High Kicking Hop Toad.—From a standing position drop swiftly 
to the hands, leaving the ground with both feet scissoring vigorously

just as the hands strike the ground. As the feet come back to the 
ground, push the body erect with the hands—hands leaving the 
ground. Repeat several times. Try this stunt with a kick for 
height when learned. 
Turk Stand.—Sit on floor cross-legged, or Turk fashion. Regain 
standing position without touching hands to floor or moving feet. 
Backward Roll.—Sit down quickly. Throw knees violently over 
head, hands on floor at neck, fingers pointing toward feet. As 
feet go over head, push with hands on floor and regain standing 
position.

  310 PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 
From the foregoing pages, it can be seen that a physical efficiency 
test should take into consideration: 
1. The general health. 
2. Organic condition. 
3. Physical defects. 
4. Strength, lung capacity, expansions. 
5. Motor ability. 
A motor-ability test may be of several types, depending upon its 
purpose: 
1. Simple tests based upon primary activities, using a point 
system for the purpose of classifying the individual. 
2. A so-called “badge test’? which helps to classify individuals. 
3. An achivement test which may be used not only for classifying 
individuals, but as a program and a means of encouraging girls to 
participate in certain definite types of activity. No.3 is the broadest 
type. 
Barnard College makes a number of practical applications of its 
tests and by relating procedures and establishing in the students’ 
minds a sequence of cause and effect is able to obtain more intelli- 
gent codperation between the student body, especially the athletic 
Association, and the department of physical education. After a 
student has been in College one term, instead of continuing to take 
the required two hours per week of gymnastics and one elective, 
she may elect all of her work in physical education and it may all 
be recreational in type, provided she can qualify on the following 
basis: 
. Health grade “A.” 
. Posture grade “A.” 
. Term grade in physical education “A.” 
. Good health record during previous term. 
. Attitude “A.” 
6. Motor ability score of 50 points—with no failures in any event. 
She may elect “gymnastics” if she wishes to, but the majority 
of girls quite naturally choose sports and dancing. 
In none of the above tests is scholarship or sportsmanship given 
a rating—since these tests are more strictly physical efficiency 
tests. However, since there is a feeling that in schools and institu- 
tions there is a tendency, at least among boys and men, to secure 
athletic prestige at the expense of intellectual attainment, scholar- 
ship is being considered in connection with some of the newer tests 
and rating systems. Because there is a feeling that character train- 
a 
2. 
3. 
4 
5, 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 311 
ing and character building is being slighted and too much reward 
given for mere ability, good sportsmanship both individual and 
group is being rated even in connection with games and contests. 
Dr. Stecher has even gone so far as to work out a scheme for 
rating an individual’s “social efficiency” on a definite point basis. 
He has used in his scheme all of the facts which are at the disposal 
of the school and as a result classifies a pupil in one of three groups— “A? “BY or &C” 
Qualifications for Group “A.” 
1. Physical quotient of 120 or more. 
2. At the class median or above in scholarship. 
3. Must have corrected certain remediable physical defects, 
including eyes, ears, nose, throat and teeth. 
4. Must show satisfactory evidences of attention to personal 
hygiene, including cleanliness of body and clothes. 
5. Must exhibit sportsmanlike conduct. Elements considered are: 
fair play, honesty, reliability, self-control. 
To Qualify for Group “ B.” 
1. Physical quotient of 100 or more. 
2. Must have been promoted at end of term. 
3. Must have corrected at least one physical defect. 
4. Must display satisfactory evidence of proper attention to 
personal hygiene. 
5. Must qualify in sportsmanlike conduct. 
Group. “C” is made up of all pupils who do not get into “A” or “RB” 
Taking into consideration not only health, scholarship, sports- 
manship and athletic tests, but also boy and girl leadership, the 
State Department of Education of the State of Missouri, under the 
leadership of Dr. Henry S. Curtis, is working out a plan whereby 
the physical, mental, social and ethical factors in education may 
be related in a comprehensive scheme or point system. Under this 
plan there is a possible total score of 1600 points. Each student 
who secures 1000 points under certain specified conditions— which 
take into consideration health, sportsmanship, scholarship, athletic 
tests, boy or girl leadership—will be presented with the letter “M” 
by the State Department of Education. In addition to the “M” 
the winner will be awarded a diploma signed by the College Depart- 
   
-P-A-G-E-310
    312 PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 
ment of Physical Education and the State Superintendent of Schools. 
“Tn order to preserve proper relative values, the regulations require 
that at least 100 of these points must be for health, 100 for correct 
posture, 100 in scholarship, 100 in sportsmanship and 400 in ath- 
letics.” 
This scheme is a step in advance of all of the preceding ones and 
is broader in that it recognizes and rewards leadership, thereby 
tending to emphasize the importance of all-round development 
and participation in a scheme of education. 
The foregoing illustrations show that the development of tests, 
though recent, has been rapid, and progression has been as follows: 
Tests for: 
1. Strength. 
2. Organic efficiency. 
3. Motor ability. 
4. Physical efficiency. 
5. Social efficiency. 
The study of test results is a most fascinating one. Figures are 
much more convincing to girls than arguments and dissertations. 
The latter smacks of the class room, the former, when properly 
used, becomes a game. The use to which results may be put are 
many: 
1. To enable a girl to know her exact rating and her specific 
weaknesses. 
2. To enable a girl to know her exact amount of improvement. 
3. To assist an instructor in grading a girl. 
4. To assist an instructor in assigning the girl to the type of 
activity most needed. 
5. To enable an instructor to divide a group of students into 
“A,” “B” and “C” groups, or normal, subnormal and superior, 
according to their reactions to these tests. 
6. To furnish a practical means of comparing individuals. 
7. To furnish a means of comparing groups or classes. 
8. To furnish a means of comparing colleges or institutions, or 
groups in one institution with corresponding groups of another. 
9. To furnish an incentive for achievement or improvement. 
10. To furnish a means for testing for achievement or improve- 
ment. 
11. To furnish a method for sorting out those not in need of certain 
types of training and allowing them to elect their work.   
-P-A-G-E-311
   PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 313 
12. To furnish a basis for classifying pupils for special attention. 
13. To furnish practical means for classifying girls for competition. 
14. To furnish material for important studies and research, 
such as: 
(a) What is the correlation between the instructor’s judgment 
and the test score? 
(b) What is the correlation, if any, between the medical and the 
anthropometric, or the medical and the motor ability, or the anthro- 
pometric and the motor ability? 
(c) Is there a correlation between physical condition and physical 
efficiency? 
(d) What is the correlation between mental ability or intelli- 
gence and physical proficiency? Is there a correlation between 
intelligence and physical efficiency? 
(e) Do high P. Q.’s coincide with high I. Q’s? Do they correlate? 
Does the efficient mentality go with the efficient body in spite of a 
few exceptions? 
(f) Is there any correlation between posture and strength, 
between posture and lung capacity, between lung capacity and 
height? 
(g) Finally, what is the correlation between test results and prac- 
tical life results, for that is the final test. 
Undoubtedly we are emphasizing too much, especially with 
ability tests, the size of a girl’s score, and not placing enough empha- 
sis upon her improvement, the handicaps she has overcome in obtain- 
ing her score small or large as it may be. Some system of scoring 
should be devised which rewards improvement as much as actual 
attainment. 
A very interesting piece of work in connection with motor tests 
has recently been published by Mr. R. K. Atkinson of the Depart- 
ment of Recreation, Russell Sage Foundation.! Although the 
tests were made with boys, his findings are not only valuable in 
relation to the under-weight problem, but the work represents only 
one of many studies awaiting to be made. It is quoted in full with 
the hope that it will not only serve as an incentive, but also suggest 
forms of procedure to those with less experience.

Education Association in 1920, included the “four fundamental 
physical activities,” running, jumping, throwing, and climbing. 
The record cards were sorted according to age, height and weight 
by the Wood tables. Allowing a variation of 10 per cent, it was 
found that 71 per cent were in the “average weight group,” and 
14 per cent were underweight.
-P-A-G-E-315
PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 317 
A study of the performance records of these groups brings out 
very clearly the fact that underweight is a definite handicap in 
motor efficiency. When the groups of cards were divided into six- 
year groups the results were found to be in accordance with the 
accompanying charts and tables.

We have long recognized the fact that there is great value in inter- 
esting boys and girls in certain definite standards, and the nation- 
wide acceptance and use of the Wood tables has without doubt 
made a great contribution to the health and well-being of thousands 
of children. Pedagogically, however, we have faced the difficulty 
of dealing with an abstraction. Boys and girls are much more inter- 
   
-P-A-G-E-317
  PHYSICAL EFFICIENCY TESTS 319 
ested in doing things than they are in the mere question “How 
much should I weigh?” 
Here is a definite statistical study Based on a large number of 
individuals. The smallest units in this study, the underweight 
boys in the thirteen year and the eighteen year groups, were respec- 
tively 38 and 43 individuals; with these two exceptions there is no 
unit of less than a 100, while “average” units in the fourteen, 
fifteen, and sixteen-year groups run well over 1000 boys each. A 
study of the figures and the diagrams show that a boy who is under- 
weight is handicapped on an average of almost a full year in his 
ability. 
It is true that there are many underweight boys who still have 
sufficient stamina to compete successfully with those of their own 
age, but it is also perfectly legitimate to point out to the individual 
the folly of his imagining that what is true of a large group does not 
apply to himself. On the basis of this study we are not only justified 
in saying to the boy, “if you are 63 inches tall and fifteen years old 
you should weight 110 pounds,” but we can say with equal scientific 
accuracy, “if you are 63 inches tall and fifteen years old and weigh 
under 99 pounds you will find that for purposes of competition you 
belong with boys a year younger than yourself.” We can thus place 
before him the incentive to be found in the definite relation between 
athletic achievement and normal weight.

  CHAPTER XIX. 
ATHLETIC ASSOCIATIONS. 
An athletic association may be an educational force in a school 
or community or it may be an instrument for evil. It may be a virile, 
wholesome, positive, constructive influence, or it may be an anemic, 
colorless club, organized merely for social purposes. It may be a 
positive moral force, or it may be selfish and destructive, existing 
for the sole purpose of promoting and controlling competition. 
Its character depends largely upon the educational outlook of 
the administrative side of the school or institution; upon their inter- 
pretation of the use and meaning of sports, games and competition; 
upon whether they look upon physical education as an educational 
force or as the publicity department for the school; and upon 
whether they consider athletics a legitimate part of the physical 
education program, to be managed by students under the super- 
vision of the department, or whether they consider athletics to be 
purely student activities and no concern of the department of 
physical education. 
Its influence depends largely upon the character and ideals of the 
department of physical education, upon the ability of their members 
to make the students see and feel the larger aspects of the whole 
subject, to make them appreciate the value of constructive pro- 
grams and applications where competition and its organization 
and administration is concerned. Its influence depends upon the 
vision and bigness of the student leaders. 
On the one hand, is the association which is either a non-entity 
or which is absolutely autocratic, the final authority where athletics 
are concerned; and, on the other hand, is the association which has 
no authority, no prerogatives, which is but the tool of the depart- 
ment and whose work is done entirely by the department, although 
the usual offices and positions are held nominally by the student. 
Between these two extremes lies the ideal. The difficult thing is 
to strike such a nice balance between student and faculty control, 
between student and faculty initiative and responsibility, that the 
student is wisely guided but not deprived of responsibility and ini- 
tiative; that the student, while being able to exercise his initiative 
is at the same time being educated along constructive lines.

ATHLETIC ASSOCIATIONS 321 
Relationship of the Athletic Association to the Department of Physical 
Education.—In order to carry out this idea, the athletic association 
should not be a parallel organization to the department, each with 
its separate sets of ideals and standards and objectives; the athletic 
association should not be the shadow of the department or merely 
its echo, but the athletic association and the department should 
together form a team which is working toward a common goal. Just 
as on a team each separate position carries its own specific duties, 
and each player must submerge his individuality for the sake of. the 
team, so have the athletic association and the department each their 
their own separate tasks to perform and by mutual codperation, by 
a constant interchange of ideas and suggestions, by mutual toler- 
ance and goodwill, by absolute fair play and good sportsmanship 
together they should work toward their objectives. 
Purpose of the Athletic Association.—The purpose cannot be more 
admirably stated than in this paragraph from a sample constitution 
suggested by. the Bureau of Education?! 
“The object of this association shall be to administer athletics 
in such a way as to build rational and wholesome sentiments, 
habits and traditions among the pupils of the school; to establish 
educational leadership; to build up public opinion in support of 
athletics organized for the physical benefit of the participants and 
the social and moral welfare of the pupils, instead of primarily as a 
public spectacle. 
“Tt should be the aim of every school to inaugurate administra- 
tive policies on the practical conduct of athletics that will develop 
and conserve these aims.” 
The value of such an organization to its members, to the work 
of the department of physical education and to the institution and 
community cannot be over-estimated ; just as it is impossible to esti- 
mate the harm which can be done, mentally, morally and socially, 
as well as physically, to a group, the work of the department and the 
community in general, by an association with the wrong kind of 
standards. 
An athletic association should seek to accomplish this purpose 
in the following ways: 
1. By taking seriously its responsibility as an educational force. 
In order to build “rational, and wholesome sentiments, habits and 
tradition’ among the students, it must help to organize the athletic 
1 Physical Education, Series No. 3, Department of the Interior, Bureau of Edu- 
cation, 1923.

-P-A-G-E-320
822 ATHLETIC ASSOCIATIONS 
program in such a way that it will tend to make the sentiments, 
habits and traditions of the students rational and wholesome. It 
should not allow types of competition which are unwholesome in 
their tendencies. It must take an intelligent interest in all of the 
many problems connected with the organization and administration 
of sports and games; it must look farther than the star performer, 
gate receipts and championships and a few petty details; it must 
learn to think in terms of the mass and mass results. 
2. This means that it must stand for only such programs and 
systems of sports and games as will include participation and com- 
petition on the part of the whole student body in types of play and 
recreation adapted to their individual conditions and training. In 
other words it should put the emphasis upon “intracompetition” 
as opposed to “intercompetition” and upon good playing rather than 
upon winning. 
3. Although not the tool of the department, it should be the means 
through which the department expresses itself to the institution 
or community; it should help the department in every way possible 
in carrying out its program provided that program is a constructive 
one. If the attitude of the department toward sports and games is 
not an educational one, then the athletic association should stand 
on its own feet in developing for the student body, one that is. 
4. It should realize the value of health and health habits, and 
refuse to tolerate practices which might injure health; it should 
endeavor in every way to establish a public opinion and a student 
opinion favoring the upholding of positive health standards. 
5. Realizing the inherent possibilities in games and sports for 
developing character, it should place the emphasis upon good 
sportsmanship and all that goes with it. It should make good 
sportsmanship a constant condition in the winning of any emblem 
or award. It should endeavor to develop in the student body, 
players and audience a tradition of good sportsmanship by always 
acting in accordance with the rules of good sportsmanship and never 
tolerating any other attitude. 
6. Its membership should be open to the whole student body on 
easy terms. It should be democratic and should seek in all of its 
relationships to establish a spirit of democracy. For this reason 
any dues should be merely nominal and the association should 
depend for its budget upon donations and entertainments, but not 
upon gate receipts. Its games and sports should be kept free from 
commercialism. Therefore, athletic equipment and_ instruction 
should be provided by the institution or organization.

7. By taking seriously its various responsibilities as officers, 
officials, managers, chairmen, members of committees, etc., it should 
be able to develop qualities of leadership in many students. Every 
team should have its captain, every sport its student head and every 
class its class manager in that sport. Every athletic association 
should have an “outing” head, in charge of hikes, week-end parties, 
skating parties, picnics, etc. She should be assisted by class com- 
mittees. A “social” chairman is indispensable in looking after 
teas, spreads, circuses, dances, banquets, and anything in the nature 
of a purely social affair. A community looks to the college for its 
leaders. The athletic association can do more through its various 
activities:to develop leadership than any organization, activity or 
influence in college. 
In all of this, it should be the privilege and duty of the various 
members of the department to advise, to instruct and to assist. 
They should stand behind the athletic association and by their 
teachings, their relationships with the student body and their atti- 
tude toward education and physical education, should act as an 
inspiration for the students. 
The following suggested list of activities with which the asso- 
ciation should in some way concern itself, will show how very broad 
its activities and fields of endeavor can be, in how many directions 
it can exert its influence. These quite naturally fall into six main 
divisions: 
Administrative problems. 
Sports and games. 
Miscellaneous activities. 
Outing activities. 
Health activities. 
Social activities. 
A, Administrative problems: 
1. Organization. 
2. Constitution. 
3. Committees’ work. 
4, Point system. 
5. Scoring systems. 
(a) Group. 
(b) Individual. 
(c) Intraclass. 
(d) Interclass. 
6. Awards.

on ATHLETIC ASSOCIATIONS 32 
B. Sports and games: 
1. Management of games. 
2. Management of meets. 
3. Management of tournaments. 
4. Management of contents. 
1, 2, 3 and 4 for games and sports of both high and 
low organization. 
C. Miscellaneous activities. 
The ideal athletic association will not combine its 
interests to just sports and games and allied 
activities, but will concern itself with all physical 
activities including gymnastic contests, dance 
demonstrations, ete., with the purpose of appeal- 
ing to every type of girl and interest. 
D. Outing activities: 
This is a very large field of activity and includes 
generally the type of recreation which is not a 
part of the regular program of physical education 
as such, and which with a little encouragement 
and advice can be organized and conducted almost 
entirely by the girls. 
1. Tramping, hiking, climbing. 
2. Treasure hunts and paper chases. 
3. Bicycling. 
4. Horse-back riding, riding clubs with an instructor 
or attendant. 
. Roller skating. 
6. Shooting (under supervision). 
7. Picnics. 
8. Week-end parties and camping. 
More and more civilized people are realizing the value of getting 
away from conventionalized living for brief periods of time, and it 
is becoming customary for clubs, institutions and cities to build 
camps or cabins within easy traveling distance. To girls especially 
this has made a strong appeal, and thousands of them have come to 
know the joys, if only for a week-end, of the winding trail, meals 
cooked over a camp fire and quiet nights under open sky. There is 
no better recreation than this, and it has opened up a whole new 
field of activities for girls and for athletic associations including 
fishing, hunting, chopping, bed-making, cooking, Nature study, 
canoeing, boating, ete.

At first this was confined to warm weather, but the past couple 
of years has seen winter camping made possible and easy, and now, 
all over the United States the people journey out to cabins or inns 
or camps with their skis and skates and snow shoes for winter 
sports. Thus another activity has been added to the list of possible 
ones for the athletic association and in the city and in the country 
there is skating, skiing, snow shoeing, tobogganing and sleighing 
with ice carnivals, skating contents, ice games, snow shoe and ski 
races, etc. 
E. Health activities: 
These might include: 
. Training rules and regulations. 
. Posture contests. 
. Posture drives. 
. Health demonstrations. 
. Health weeks. 
6. Good feet contests. 
F. Social activities: 
1. Teas, receptions. 
. Spreads. 
. Entertainments. 
. Dances. 
. Circuses, country fairs. 
. Assemblies. 
7. Banquets. 
The social activities tend to develop the purely social side of the 
organization and to interest girls in the athletic association. They 
furnish outlets for talent and ability which are not necessarily 
athletic and provide active interests for the less athletically inclined, 
as well as a community of interest. 
The athletic association should have on its program at least one 
serious meeting during the year at which time trophies, emblems 
and awards are presented. This might be an assembly, or it might 
combine the social and the serious in a banquet. Whatever the 
nature of the affair is, the program should consist of singing, short 
speeches and toasts given by the president of the athletic association, 
a representative of the department, a representative of the institu- 
tion, student, and possibly a well known man or woman from the 
outside world. Although the talks or the toasts may be a combina- 
tion of the serious and the frivolous, emphasis should be put at this 
time upon the ideals of the athletic association, the qualities for PRwNe ou 
tHe OO DO a>

ATHLETIC ASSOCIATIONS 327 
which the awards stand and the value which the girl should attach 
to them. Thus can be driven home, under unusual circumstances, 
before an interested group, the ideals and objectives of the athletic 
association in a way which the girl will never forget, and she cannot 
help having a deeper feeling of sentiment regarding her award, 
which lifts it above the plane of the material, and a higher regard 
for what it symbolizes, than if it was presented in just an ordinary 
way. She will never look at her emblem or her pin without picturing 
hours of work and hours of play, happy hours spent with classmates 
and comrades under the direction of a beloved instructor, and her 
emblem will recall singing and cheering and laughter and tears, 
praise and criticism, defeats and victories. But, she will not 
remember the scores or the defeats; she probably will not remember 
the victories or the happiness. What she will remember are the 
specific things which that emblem stands for—work well done, 
clear thinking, obstacles overcome, faithfulness and patience, 
loyalty, honesty, unselfishness and courage; and quick as a flash 
will come the one word which pretty nearly symbolizes it all— 
Good sportsmanship.

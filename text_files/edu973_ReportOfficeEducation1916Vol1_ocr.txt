REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
DepartMent or THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epucartion, 
Washington, October 15, 1916. 
Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith the manuscript of 
Volume I of the report of the Commissioner of Education for the 
fiscal year ended June 30, 1916. In the introduction to Volume I of 
my report for the year ended June 30, 1915, I called attention to 
the fact that it was impossible to have the material for Volume II of 
that report ready for the printer by October 15, the latest date on 
which it could be submitted in compliance with the new law (38 
Stat. L., 886), and gave in some detail the reasons why this statis- 
tical volume can not be ready by that date. In view of this fact 
I recommended that Congress be requested to pass a special act 
authorizing the printing of that volume of the report at such time 
as it could be ready, not later than February 15, 1916. I also rec- 
ommended that the act referred to above be so amended as to extend 
to December 31 the time within which the manuscript of both vol- 
umes of the annual report of the Commissioner of Education may be 
submitted. No action having been taken upon these recommenda- 
tions, it becomes necessary to submit the manuscript of what should 
have been Volume II of the report for 1915, for use as Volume II 
of the report for 1916, nine months later than the time when it 
might have been issued if the law permitted it to be printed when 
ready. Since the statistical part of the present report can not be 
ready, for the reasons already referred to, before December 31, I 
recommend that Congress be requested to pass a special act authoriz- 
ing it to be printed as soon as ready, so that the information which 
it contains may be available for the use of the public before it is 
out of date. 
The manuscript submitted herewith contains a fairly comprehen- 
sive interpretive survey of the progress of education in the United 
States for the school year of 1915-16, and a similar survey of educa- 
tional progress in all those foreign countries from which sufficient 
information could be obtained. 
The section pertaining to foreign countries contains this year a 
statistical survey of education in all foreign countries from which 
XIIT
-P-A-G-E-14
  
xIV EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
reports have recently been received. This statistical material is 
arranged in three sections: Elementary, secondary, and higher. 
This is the first time in the history of this bureau that such a presen- 
tation has been made. It is believed that it will meet, in some de- 
gree at least, the demand arising from the new interest which edu- 
cators and statesmen in this country are taking in all forms of edu- 
cation in other countries, which interest will be greatly increased 
when European countries now at war undertake their reconstruction 
after the war is over. This greater interest in education in foreign 
countries is due not only to a recognition of the fact that all prob- 
lems of education are now international to such an extent that those 
who would work most effectively for the improvement of our own 
systems and methods of education must be informed as to what other 
countries are doing, but also to the closer trade relations which this 
country is now or soon will be establishing with all the commercial 
countries of the world, and a recognition of the fact that productive 
industries and commercial activities of all countries must depend 
directly upon the character, extent, and efficiency of their systems of 
education. 
Theoretically the chapters of this volume pertaining to our own 
country should give a complete summary and an accurate interpre- 
tation of all important movements in all departments and phases of 
education in the United States and its Territories and possessions 
for the school year 1915-16. But this is not practicable. For some 
departments movements are so slow that little progress, if any, can 
be observed in so short a period as a year. For that reason some 
topics treated in recent reports are omitted in this, and some that 
have not been treated in those reports for two or three years are now 
included, and the survey of them covers the years intervening since 
they last received attention. In other departments the movements 
are so rapid and fundamental that it is very difficult, if not impos- 
sible, to gather all the significant facts relating to them and to 
interpret correctly all their phases. In many instances only after 
the lapse of years may one distinguish with certainty the main trend 
of the stream from its cross currents and eddies. Yet it is believed 
that in every case the survey is sufficiently comprehensive and the 
interpretation accurate enough to serve the purposes of students of 
education and those who are actively engaged in educational work 
as officers and teachers. If they do not find herein full answers to 
all their questions, they will find at least some assistance toward 
making out answers for themselves. Most of the chapters might be 
made more satisfactory if they could be written or revised after the 
educational statistics for the year have been compiled. But this is 
not possible under the present requirement as to the time of sub- 
mitting the manuscript for the report, as has already been explained.
-P-A-G-E-15
  
  COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XV 
Some topics not previously treated in any report are included in 
this. These refer to phases of education of very recent develop- 
ment. The treatment of these must, of course, be more or less his- 
torical, and must contain some account of their origin and develop- 
ment up to the time when they are felt to have become sufficiently 
important to merit separate consideration. Many of the newer 
phases of educational progress, although they may have great in- 
terest for those directly connected with them and to professional stu- 
dents of education, can receive only incidental treatment in a survey 
of this kind. : 
In a new and progressive country like ours, with its widely vary- 
ing conditions from one section to another, with its cosmopolitan 
population, with its rich and complex social, civic, and industrial 
life, with its democratic State, local, and individual initiative, and 
its consequent weakness in, or total lack of, central direction and ad- 
ministrative authority, there can never be a complete and harmonious 
system of education. There will always be found divergent and con- 
flicting tendencies and influences. Strength and weakness, great 
efficiency, and wasteful failure will be found side by side in the same 
State, county, city, or school. Some localities will excel in one 
respect, others in other respects. Some counties will give much at- 
tention and care to their schools, libraries, and other agencies of 
education ; others will give all too little. It is democracy’s way with 
all its interests. Herein is found its weakness as well as its strength 
and never-failing possibilities of unlimited achievement. It may 
be the despair of those who would count and measure and systema- 
tize, unify, bind, and mechanically control all public interests; but it 
is the hope of those who have attained to some degree of under- 
standing of the abounding and ‘irresistible forces of life, and have 
faith in the inherent ability of the masses of mankind to solve their 
own problems, direct their own forces, produce and train their own 
leaders, and, given time, to adjust themselves to constantly changing 
conditions. 
For these reasons, opinions as to the character and value of our 
system (or systems or. lack of system) of education differ widely. 
Some can see in our public schools (all our schools are public in aim 
and purpose, whatever the source of their support or the form of 
_ their control) only inefficiency and failure, while others see in them 
the mightiest of all forces making for the material welfare, civic . 
righteousness, political wisdom, social purity, intellectual and 
spiritual culture, and freedom, strength, and safety of State and 
Nation. But all must recognize that schools, school systems, and 
all other agencies of education in such a country as this are forever 
in the making. If it were possible to perfect them to-day to such an 
extent that they would be adapted in every particular to all our 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  XVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
needs, by that same token they would be imperfect and in need of 
readjustment to-morrow, for in democratic freedom life flows on 
unfettered and is never still. Our institutions of education, like 
all others, must constantly differentiate, transform, and readjust 
themselves to meet the new conditions and new needs or be cast aside 
as an outgrown shell or an outworn implement. They who would 
criticize justly must see clearly and understand both the institutions 
and the life which they serve. They must remember that all im- 
portant changes are made in actual or supposed recognition of needs 
created by new conditions, and will therefore follow rather than pre- 
cede them or accompany them with equal step. Before present needs 
are fully met, new conditions arise and bring with them new needs 
to be met only by new changes. 
The stronger the flow of life and the quicker its pulse, the more ~ 
impossible that the provisions for education can ever be adequate 
to the needs of any moment, and this is true also in proportion to 
the extent in which the support and control of education depend upon 
the intelligence and good will of all the people rather than on the 
wisdom and benevolence of a central autocratic power. But just to 
this extent also is it true that they will never be wholly inadequate 
or totally neglected. There is, too, education of a very high type 
for the people in the very acts of observing changing conditions and 
needs, and in trying to adjust their institutions to them, even though 
success in adjustment may be only partial. “ Weakness in freedom 
shall grow stronger than strength with a chain.” “’Tis stress and 
strain in moth and men” that develop their strength and intelli- 
gence. Again, it must be remembered that in our individual, civic, 
governmental, and educational life we have passed the bounds of 
precedent and the possibility of action by mere imitation or by guid- 
ance through irresponsible authority. Every change must be, to 
some extent at least, a new experiment guided only by prescient in- 
stinct and an understanding of fundamental interests and principles; 
and, unfortunately, of fundamental principles of education we have 
comparatively little definite scientific knowledge. These considera- 
tions should tend to give patience to the rash critics of our schools 
and other means of education. If they do not, then an honest effort 
to improve them in a large and thoroughgoing way will bring both 
patience and moderation in their condemnation of them. 
Because of the magnitude, complexity, looseness, and unevenness 
of our educational systems and the absence of any central adminis- 
trative agency, it is very difficult to say just what the sum total and 
average of tendencies for the year have-been, but careful reading 
of this volume of this report can not fail to leave the impression that 
the tendency is toward democracy, efficiency, and practical utility. 
A smaller per cent of the children than ever before fail to receive
-P-A-G-E-17
  COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XVII 
some education in the schools. A larger per cent go through the 
grades of the elementary schools and enter and graduate from the 
high schools. The number of students in colleges, universities, and 
technical and professional schools increases. Standards in schools of 
all kinds are being raised gradually, and more effort is made to adjust 
the content of courses of study, methods of teaching, and school 
regimen to the needs of different classes of children and different 
individuals. More attention is given to the preparation of teachers. 
Education in its various phases is studied more in colleges and uni- 
versities, and there is more intelligent original educational research. 
Responsible authorities of many State, county, and city school sys- 
tems and individual schools have careful studies or surveys made of 
the systems and schools for which they are responsible, solely for the 
purpose of discovering their deficiencies and of working out construc- 
tive programs for their improvement. Some of these surveys are 
made at considerable expense, yet with the belief that it is wise to 
use this money in finding ways to make the larger amounts more 
effective for good. Sometimes boards of education are moved to have 
these surveys made by their own feeling of lack of definite and ex- 
pert knowledge about the schools for which they are responsible. 
Sometimes they are moved by the adverse criticism of the people. 
Frequently the people themselves turn from unintelligent destructive 
criticism to constructive efforts and provide for the survey through 
chambers of commerce or other organizations. While it can not be 
claimed that these surveys are intelligent in all respects or that the 
surveyors are always wise in their conclusions, yet it can not be 
denied that they are becoming more and more helpful to the systems 
and schools surveyed, and that through them a valuable body of knowl- 
edge, more definite than we have ever had before about our schools, 
is being gradually accumulated, and that certain principles of admin- 
istration and school practice are being lifted to the surface in such 
a way as to serve as a nucleus for a national educational policy. 
For many years this bureau has been appealed to to make or direct 
surveys of this kind, and in 1910-11 it did make, with some outside 
help, a survey of the schools of the City of Baltimore, and the report 
of the survey was published in the form of a bulletin of the bureau. 
In the following years it made more or less formal surveys of several 
colleges, universities, technical and normal schools, and more or less 
thorough studies of the schools of Gary, Ind., and of several other 
cities and towns and also of many country schools, but because of 
_ the lack of means (money and men) it refused to undertake any 
complete survey of school systems. However, the appeals for sur- 
veys of this kind became so numerous and so urgent, and it became 
so plainly the duty of the bureau to respond to this appeal to the 
61855°—16——2

extent of its ability, that it finally yielded, and, despite its lack of 
preparation for this kind of work, it has within the year made and 
directed a number of important surveys on an extensive scale, and 
now has promised for the immediate future several more, as shown 
by the following extract from the Commissioner’s Statement to the 
Secretary of the Interior for the year ended June 30, 1916. It should 
be stated that however willing the bureau may be to render this serv- 
ice to the States and the people, and thereby enable them to establish 
and maintain better systems of education as is required of the bureau 
by the act creating it, it has to deny many requests for important 
surveys. 
In September the specialist in higher education made a careful internal sur- 
vey of the University of Oregon. This survey was made at the request of the 
president and the board of regents of the university, and a report with conclu- 
sions and recommendations was submitted to them. 
In October, November, and December the bureau conducted a survey of the 
State University of Iowa, the Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic 
Arts, and the Iowa State Teachers’ College. This survey was made at the 
request of the Iowa State Board of Education, and a report with conclusions 
and recommendations was submitted to this board early in March. 
In November the specialist in higher education and one of the specialists in 
home economics made an internal survey of the College of St. Teresa. This 
survey was made at the request of the president and faculty of the college, and 
a report with conclusions and recommendations was submitted to them in 
December. 
In March and April the bureau made a survey of the University of Washing- 
ton, State College of Washington, and the Washington State normal schools at 
Ellensburg, Cheney, and Bellingham, and such a general survey of the public- 
school system of the State as was thought necessary to an understanding of the 
relation of the institutions of higher education to the public-school system. 
This survey was made at the request of the State Commission of Educational 
Survey created by an act of the legislature, and a report with conclusions and 
recommendations was submitted to this commission in April. 
Through the winter and spring the bureau conducted a survey of the Uni- 
versity of North Dakota; the State College of Agriculture of North Dakota; 
the normal schools at Mayville, Minot, and Valley City; the Normal and Indus- 
trial School at Ellendale ; the North Dakota School of Science and Technology at 
Wahpeton; the School of Forestry at Bottineau; and the State library commis- 
sion, and made such a general survey of the public-school system as was 
thought necessary for an understanding of the relation of the public schools 
to the institutions of higher education. The survey was made at the request 
of the State board of regents, who were required by law to have the survey 
made, and a report with conclusions and recommendations was submitted to 
this board in July. 
In the fall and winter a partial survey was made of the public schools of 
Jamestown, N. Dak., for the purpose of advising the board of education of that 
city as to the possible reorganization of its school system, and a report recom- 
mending a reorganization of the 12 years of elementary and high schools on the 
basis of 6 years elementary and 6 years high school, with a division of the 
high school into junior and senior periods was submitted to the board early in 
the spring.

COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XIX 
In February the bureau began a comprehensive survey of the public-school 
system of the city of San Francisco. A good part of the work necessary to be 
done on the grounds was done in February and March; the remainder had to 
be postponed until the opening of the schools in August and has now been 
about completed. This survey was undertaken at the request of the board of 
education and of the chamber of commerce of the city of San Francisco, and 
a report with conclusions and recommendations will be made to them. 
In February and March the bureau conducted a survey of the schools of 
Webster Groves, Mo., at the request of the superintendent and.board of educa-— 
tion of that city, and a report with conclusions and recommendations is being 
submitted to them. 
By agreement with the secretary of the Nassau County Association and a 
representative of the New York State department of education, the bureau 
assisted in February, March, and April in a survey of the public schools of 
Nassau County, N. Y., made for the purpose of recommending improvements 
in the schools of the county, and a report of the portion of this survey made 
by this bureau has been submitted to the State department of education of 
New York. 
In April and May one of the specialists in school and home gardening made 
a school and home garden survey of the city of Richmond, Ind., as a part of 
a general industrial education survey of that city. A report of the part of the 
work done by the bureau, with conclusions and recommendations, has been sub- 
mitted to the Richmond Vocational Education Survey Committee. 
During the winter and spring the bureau made a survey of the system of 
public education of the State of Wyoming. This survey included a study of the 
the administration of the public schools, an inspection of the schools of several 
counties, and a consideration of certain phases of the work of the State uni- 
versity. The survey was undertaken at the request of the Wyoming State 
School Code Committee, and a report, with conclusions and recommendations, 
was submitted to this committee in July. 
The survey of private and higher schools for Negroes in the United States, 
which has been in progress for three years, has been completed and the results 
are being prepared for publication as bulletins of this bureau. 
The educational survey of the southern Appalachian Mountain counties in 
the States of Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Caro- 
lina, Georgia, and Alabama, begun a year ago by Mr. C. G. Burkitt, employed 
especially for this purpose, has been continued. It is expected that this work 
will be completed and a report of it prepared within the current fiscal year. 
Progress has been made on the educational survey of the State of Delaware. 
During the year investigations were made of opportunities of education for 
adult immigrants in the city of Wilmington, of opportunities for home gardens 
under the direction of the schools in Wilmington and several of the smaller 
towns, of industrial education in Wilmington, of the teaching of civics in the 
schools of Wilmington and certain other rural towns and communities as set 
forth elsewhere in this statement, and of the teaching of home economics and 
domestic science in certain parts of the State. The Children’s Bureau and the 
United States Public Health Service cooperate with the Bureau of Education 
in this survey. Plans have been made for the completion of a large part of the 
survey of the State during the current fiscal year. The survey of the rural 
schools will be finished within the first half of the year. In connection with 
the survey is going constructive work. This survey is being made at the 
request of the governor of the State, the State commissioner of education, the 
president and faculty of Delaware College, the superintendent of schools at 
Wilmington, and representatives of various organizations interested in the
-P-A-G-E-20
  xx EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
welfare of the State. The results of the survey will be published in sections 
from time to time as they are completed and will be submitted to the State 
board of education. 
The work of the educational survey of the State of Tennessee to be made 
at the request of the State board of education of that State has been begun. 
One of the special collaborators attached to the substation of the bureau at 
the George Peabody College for Teachers has made a partial study of the high 
schools of the State. The work of the survey will be continued throughout 
the year. 
In all these surveys of cities, counties, States, and institutions the bureau 
has had the hearty cooperation of school officials and teachers. In most in- 
stances the expenses of the members of the bureau and the expenses and 
honorariums of persons employed in the survey but not connected directly with 
the bureau have been paid by the city, county, State, or institution for which 
the survey has been made. The reports of all the surveys (except that of 
Nassau County, N. Y., which will be published by the State department of edu- 
cation of New York, that of the University of Oregon which has been pub- 
lished by that university, and the reports of the surveys of the College of 
St. Teresa, and the schools of Jamestown, N. Dak., which are not of such a 
nature as to justify their publication as bulletins of this bureau), with con- 
clusions and recommendations based on them, will be published as bulletins 
of this bureau. In this way the bureau will be able gradually to establish 
policies and standards of education throughout the whole country more effec- 
tively than could be done in any other way. 
Other surveys promised for the current fiscal year include a survey of the 
administration of the public-school system of the State of Colorado, which is 
now being made at the request of the Colorado survey committee of State 
affairs; a survey of the entire educational system of the State of Arizona, 
which is now being made at the request of the State superintendent of public 
instruction, the president of the State university, and the State Teachers’ As- 
sociation; a survey of the entire educational system of the State of New 
Mexico (promised conditionally) ; surveys of the public-school systems of the 
cities of Canton and Elyria, Ohio; surveys of the public schools of Falls and 
Walker Counties, Tex.; an internal survey of the University of Nevada, now 
being made at the request of the governor of Nevada, the board of regents, 
and the president of the university; an internal survey of the University of 
South Carolina; a survey of the Bradley Polytechnic Institute of.Peoria, IIL, 
which is now being made at the request of the trustees, president, and faculty 
of the institute. 
Attention is called to a few phases of educational interest and 
progress deserving special consideration: (1) The continued increase 
of interest in vocational education indicated partly by the passing 
of the Federal vocational education bill through the Senate without 
opposition and the apparent disappearance of opposition to it in 
the House of Representatives; (2) the inauguration of extension 
education in agriculture and home economics under the provisions 
of the Smith-Lever Act, appropriating Federal funds for this pur- 
pose; (3) the progress in the reorganization of secondary education 
and the division of the 12 years of elementary and secondary school- 
ing into two equal parts of 6 years each instead of the present divi- 
sion of 8 and 4 years; (4) the increase of interest in the improve-
-P-A-G-E-21
‘ 
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XxI 
ment of rural schools through longer terms, better teachers, better 
administration and supervision, consolidation, the erection of teach- 
ers’ homes, and the better adjustment of courses of study to the needs 
of rural life; (5) the widespread interest in offering to immigrants 
from foreign countries opportunity to learn to understand and speak 
the English language, and for such other education as will prepare 
them for modern industrial, social, and civic life, and for possible 
citizenship; (6) the increase of interest in teaching adult natives to 
read and write, and in offering to those of very meager education ; 
opportunities to extend their education, in night schools and else- 
where; (7) the increase of interest in the schools as community 2 
forums and social centers; (8) the extension of interest in home 
gardening for children under the direction of the schools as outlined 
by this bureau, a form of occupation and industrial education which 
is made still more important by the passage of State and Federal 
child-labor laws; (9) the increased interest in military training and 
in the health and physical development of children due to the 
awakened consciousness of the need of national preparedness for 
peace and for possible defense against an invading foe. 
These and many other items that might be mentioned show the 
tendency to make our education all inclusive and to make it serve the 
needs of all the people. 
In my introduction to the report of the Commissioner of Education 
for the year ended June 30, 1914, I included recommendations which 
had been submitted in the Commissioner’s Statement to the Secre- 
tary of the Interior for that year. Some of these recommendations 
have been complied with, but most of the needs on which they were 
based still exist and the two years intervening have brought to the 
surface new needs on which additional recommendations have been 
based. All the operations of this bureau are of such interest to stu- 
dents of education, school officers, teachers, and the public generally 
that I beg leave to include in this introduction the recommendations 
contained in the Commissioner’s Statement to the Secretary of the 
Interior for the year ended June 380, 1916.   (1) An increase in the salaries of chief clerk, editor, statistician, specialist 
in land-grant college statistics, specialist in higher education, and other special- 
ists, and the removal of the limit on amount of salaries which may be paid 
from the lump-sum appropriation for rural-school education and industrial edu- 
cation. The duties of these positions require the services of men and women 
of such kind and degree of ability as demand salaries considerably higher than 
are now paid in this bureau. I can only repeat what I said in my statements 
for 1913, for 1914, and for 1915, that work of this kind had better not be at- 
tempted than not done well. 
(2) An assistant commissioner, who should also be a specialist in secondary 
education and should serve as chief of a high-school division of the bureau. 
The duties of the office make it necessary for the commissioner to visit distant
-P-A-G-E-22
    XXII EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
parts. of the country and to be absent from the office frequently many days at a 
time. There should be an assistant commissioner to carry on the work in 
the office during his absence and to relieve him of much of the routine work of 
the office, so that he may be able to give more time and attention to the larger 
problems of education and to direct more effectively the more important work 
of the bureau. Probably the most important phase in public education in the 
United States at present is that of the secondary schools. The high school is, 
or should be, the heart and center of our school system. The problems of the 
high school are more difficult and their solution more urgent than those of any 
other part of the school system. The head of the high-school division of the 
bureau should therefore be a man of great ability. By combining the offices of 
assistant commissioner and of specialist in secondary education it should be 
possible to pay a salary sufficiently large to obtain the services of such a man. 
(3) Additional specialists in higher education, including education in uni- 
versities, colleges, schools of technology, schools of professional education, and 
normal schools. The constant and increasing demands from these schools for 
the help of the bureau in making surveys and for advice as to their reconstruc- 
tion and better coordination are larger and far more numerous than it can meet 
with its present force. There is special need of an able man, familiar with 
agricultural education and the problems of Negro education in the South, to 
devote his entire time and attention to the colleges of agriculture for Negroes 
in the Southern States, 
(4) Additional specialists in school and home gardening. The proper educa- 
tion of many millions of children, and even the possibility of their attending 
school at all during the years in which attendance at school is most valuable, 
depend to a very large extent upon the general adoption of the work which the 
bureau is promoting through this division. It is very important that there 
should be in the bureau a sufficient number of specialists in this subject to 
visit all cities, towns, and manufacturing villages in the country, advise with 
their school officials and teachers, and assist in directing the work of teachers 
until the plan is well enough understood and there are enough trained teachers 
that work in any city or town who may go on without outside direction, or 
until the several States have made provision for the direction of the work 
from their offices of education. The enactment of the national child-labor law 
prohibiting the employment of children under 14 years of age in mills, mines, 
and quarries must result in enforced idleness of hundreds of thousands of boys 
and girls and in unnecessary hardships to them and their parents unless there 
is found for them some form or forms of suitable employment economically 
profitable and at the same time educational. Results obtained through home 
and school gardening confirm the belief that both economically and educa- 
tionally this is one of the very best forms of employment for children between 
the ages of 8 and 14 years. 
(5) An increase in the number of specialists and assistants in rural educa- 
tion and industrial education. The few specialists now employed in these 
subjects are wholly unable to do more than a small part of the work needed. 
States are asking for expert advice in regard to school legislation and the 
improvement of their school systems.’ States, counties, and local communities 
want comprehensive and detailed school surveys. There is need and demand 
for such general and authoritative studies of school administration, courses of 
study, methods of teaching, and adaptation of the work of the schools to the 
life and needs of the communities which they serve as can be made effectively 
only by a large group of men and women of the best ability working under the 
direction of the Federal Government.
-P-A-G-E-23
  
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. Xxur 
(6) The formation of a division of commercial education, with specialists 
and assistants, for the investigation of problems of commercial education and 
to assist in making plans and finding means for the preparation of our young 
people for participation in the larger commercial life upon which the country 
is now entering. The rapid expansion of the foreign commerce of the United 
States because of the war in Europe, and for other reasons more permanent, 
makes the need for this division more pressing than when it was first recom- 
mended some years ago. 
(7) More adequate provision for the investigation and promotion of school 
sanitation and hygiene and the physical culture and development of pupils. 
Nearly 20,000,000 children spend a good part of their time each year in public 
and private schools in the United States. They come to these schools that they 
may gain preparation and strength for life. In many of the schools the heating, 
lighting, ventilation, and other means of sanitation are so poor that instead of 
gaining strength for life they have the seeds of disease and death sown in their 
systems. In many other schools the daily regimen is such as to cause the 
children to lose a very large per cent of that which they might gain with a 
better regimen. From State, county, and city school officers, in all parts of 
the country, thousands of requests come to the bureau for information and ad- 
vice in regard to these matters. The bureau should be able to give accurate 
information and sound advice regarding various phases of this subject. The 
establishment of health and right health habits must be considered a most 
important and vital principle in any education that is to fit for life. Provision 
for such games, plays, drills, and other exercises as will develop physical 
strength, bodily control, and endurance is essential to the schools of any nation 
that would maintain for all its citizens a high degree of preparedness for the 
duties both of peace and of war. eo 
(8) The formation of a division, with a group of able specialists and assist- 
ants, for the investigation of problems of education and school administration 
in cities and towns. The drift of population to the cities and towns continues, 
and the proportion of urban population to rural population is increasing rapidly. 
Almost one-half of the children in the United States now live in cities, towns, 
and densely populated suburban communities. In some sections of the country 
a very large proportion of these children are the children of foreign-born 
parents, All this adds to the complexity and difficulty of the problems of city- 
school administration, especially in the larger cities. Many hundreds of re- 
quests for advice and information in regard to these problems come to the 
bureau every year. At present there is no one in the bureau whose special 
duty it is to respond to them. Within the last year requests have come to 
the bureau for comprehensive educational surveys in 18 cities, and many other 
cities have appealed to other agencies for work of this kind because their 
superintendents and boards of education knew that this bureau was not 
equipped as it should be to do this work. If the right education of the 
12,000,000 children who live in cities is a matter of interest to the Nation as 
a whole, then this bureau should be enabled to do effectively those things which 
no other agency can do to assist the school officers and teachers of these cities 
in making the work of their schools more effective. 
(9) The establishment of a division, with specialists and assistants, for the 
investigation of the education of exceptional children. There are in the United 
States more than 2,000,000 children whose education requires means varyjng 
widely from those in common use for the education of normal children. These 
children are to be found in cities, towns, and rural communities alike, and all 
school officers and teachers have to deal with them. The Bureau of Education 
can not be considered as performing its duties to all the population with impar- 
 
-P-A-G-E-24

XXIV EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
tiality until it has in its service men and women who can give accurate infor- 
mation and helpful advice in regard to the education of these children. 
(10) Provision for the investigation of the education of adult illiterates and 
the dissemination of information as to the best methods of teaching illiterate 
men and women to read and write, and of extending the meager education of 
those who were denied the advantages of the schools in their childhood and 
youth. According to the census of 1910, there were in the United States more 
than 5,500,000 illiterate men and women and children over the age when they 
may be expected to make a beginning in the public schools, and there were many 
millions more barely able to read and write. This illiteracy is a burden to 
society and a menace to State and Nation. Within the past few years much 
interest in the removal of this burden has developed. The response to the little 
attention which this bureau has been able to give to this subject indicates that 
States, local communities, individuals, and benevolent societies are ready to 
cooperate heartily with the Federal Government in any reasonable plans which 
may be devised and presented by this bureau for this purpose. Within the 
last two years the people of the country have become conscious of the special 
need for more adequate provision for preparing for American life and possible 
citizenship the large number of persons who come to this country from southern 
and eastern European countries. It is especially important that they be given 
opportunity for learning the language of the country and that they be induced 
to take advantage of this opportunity. States and cities must provide the 
means for this, but the task of working out effective plans and of assisting 
States and cities in putting them into operation belongs to the Nation as a 
whole, and this bureau is the Nation’s logical agent for this work. 
(11) A careful and thorough investigation as to the means of better education 
of children in their homes, and,the dissemination of information as to the best 
methods for the early physical, mental, and moral education of children in the 
home and for the better cooperation of home and school in the education of 
children of school age. Children of the United States are in school less than 
4 per cent of their time from birth to 21. The home is the primary and funda- 
mental educational institution. Schools and other agencies are only secondary. 
If education in the home fails, no other agency can make good the failure. 
With our changing civilization and social and industrial life, there is need for 
more careful study of education in the home. The bureau has already made a 
beginning in this work, but there is need of far more than it can hope to do 
without much larger equipment for it. 
(12) A specialist in educational theory and practice, to serve as a director of 
investigations in education, assisting National, State, and local committees and 
commissions and making available for them the large collections of material in 
the library of the bureau and elsewhere in Washington. National, State, and 
local associations appoint many committees, and States and cities appoint many 
commissions to investigate and report on various problems of education. Many 
of these committees and commissions fail more or less completely for want of 
material and intelligent assistance and direction. The library of this bureau, 
one of the most complete of its kind in the world, contains a large collection of 
material for most of these investigations. The specialist here recommended 
could put this collection at the service of these committees and commissions 
and at the same time give much-needed assistance and direction. His services 
wguld also be valuable to other specialists in the bureau and to hundreds of 
individual students of education upon whose investigations the country depends 
for most of its knowledge of education. This recommendation has been re- 
peated each year for five years. The need of such a person in the bureau be-   
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXV 
comes greater and more pressing each year. Most of the work of the bureau 
suffers from want of the assistance such a person could give. 
(18) An assistant editor. The editorial work of the office has increased more 
than sixfold within the past five years, and it must increase still more within 
the next few years. It is now impossible for one editor to perform satisfac- 
torily all the required editorial work. The more careful editing of the reports 
and bulletins of the bureau which this addition to the editorial staff would 
make possible would save each year in the cost of printing more than the 
salary of an assistant editor. 
(14) A specialist in foreign and domestic systems of education and an assist- 
ant in foreign systems of education. This bureau is undertaking to keep the 
people of the United States informed as to all important progress in education 
and in methods of teaching in all countries of the world. It must have, in 
order to accomplish this work with any degree of satisfaction, the additional 
assistance here indicated. 
(15) Two ‘additional collectors and compilers of statistics. Material for 
prompt and reliable statistical reports can not be had by this bureau without 
occasional visits to State and city education offices and the first-hand study of 
their returns. This is not possible with the force the bureau now has for this 
work. 
(16) A comparatively large increase in the number of clerks, stenographers, 
copyists, laborers, and messengers to do the work of the bureau as it is now 
organized, and a still larger increase to do such additional work of this nature 
as may be made necessary by any enlargement that may be made in the staff 
of specialists. 
(17) An increase of appropriation for traveling expenses for the commis- 
sioner and employees acting under his direction. This is necessary to enable 
them to make original investigations in education in different parts of the 
country and to disseminate information by meeting with educational associations 
and other societies interested in education in different parts of the country. 
Without funds sufficient to pay necessary traveling expenses, the bureau can 
not do its work effectively, and must constantly be open to the charge of giving 
help where expenses can be paid rather than where help is most needed. 
(18) Means to enable the bureau to cooperate with schools of education in 
colleges and universities, with normal schools, and with city and county school 
systems in making important investigations and definite experiments jin ele- 
mentary and secondary school education under scientific control. There is as 
much need for scientific experiments in education as there is for such experi- 
ments in agriculture or engineering. Although we are spending annually many 
hundreds of millions of dollars on public education, we have little accurate and 
definite knowledge about the value of various forms of education and methods of 
teaching, and we can have little more until provision is made for such scientific 
experiments as are here indicated. With a comparatively small amount of 
money the bureau might obtain the cooperation of individuals, institutions, and 
boards of education in making important investigations and experiments in 
education not otherwise possible without much larger expenditures. 
(19) A larger appropriation to enable the Secretary of the Interior, in his dis- 
cretion and under his direction, and with the advice and cooperation of the 
Public Health Service, to provide for the medical and sanitary relief of the 
Eskimos, Aleuts, Indians, and other natives of Alaska. Careful investigations 
made with the cooperation of the Public Health Service have shown the neces- 
sity of immediate provision for the care of the health of the natives of this 
Territory and for the eradication of communicable diseases now prevalent in
-P-A-G-E-26
    XXVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
different sections of the Territory which, if not put under immediate control, 
will soon destroy the lives of many of these people and spread among the 
white settlers. The addition of $25,000 to the appropriation for this purpose 
for the current fiscal year, making the total of $50,000 for this purpose, has 
enabled the bureau to do more for the health of these people than ever before, 
but much still remains to be done. To do what is needed will require an annual 
appropriation of at least $100,000. An appropriation of $62,500 will be asked 
for the next fiscal year. 
(20) The bureau should be authorized to sell some of the 4,000 reindeer 
belonging to the Government and use the proceeds in distributing the remainder 
to those sections of northwest Alaska where they can be herded profitably, but 
where there are none now. The Alaska reindeer service, which was begun in 
a small way a little more than 20 years ago, has now reached large propor- 
tions, and has accomplished much for the support and for the education and 
civilization of the natives in the northwestern part of the Territory. The 
bureau wishes to extend at once the distribution of reindeer in the sections 
in which reindeer may be herded profitably, to give all the natives of this 
section the advantage which has already come to those living in settlements 
to which reindeer have been sent, and to complete this work so there may 
not be need for a continuation of the appropriation for this purpose. The an- 
nual appropriation of $5,000, much of which must be used for other purposes 
than distribution of reindeer, is not sufficient to enable the bureau to proceed 
with this distribution as rapidly as it should. Authority to sell male deer and 
use the proceeds for this purpose would hasten the distribution without addi- 
tional cost to the Government. 
(21) The time has come when the natives in all parts of Alaska should be 
assisted and directed in the establishment and development of industries of 
their own, which will give them remunerative employment. through much of 
the time in which they are now more or less idle and by which they may make 
for themselves a better support and gradually take over the larger part of 
the cost of their own schools and medical attendance. The success of the rein- 
deer industry in the northwestern part of the Territory and of experiments in 
other industries, on a smaller scale, in other parts of the Territory would 
seem to justify the use of a few thousand dollars a year for this purpose for 
the next 10 or 15 years. The sooner these people are made wholly self-support- 
ing, the less will be the final cost of their support and education to the Gov- 
ernment. A few thousand dollars judiciously expended for this purpose now 
will save hundreds of thousands of dollars later. 
(22) The annual estimates for appropriations for “ education of natives in 
Alaska,” for “reindeer in Alaska,” and for “ medical attendance of natives in 
Alaska” are usually put in the sundry civil bill, which on alternate years, in 
which the long session of Congress meets, is not considered until near the end 
of the fiscal year and sometimes until after the beginning of the next, but sup- 
plies for certain parts of Alaska must be shipped from Seattle in June or early 
in July in order to reach their destination. Buildings for schools or hospitals 
ean be erected much better and at less cost in the summer than in the winter, 
and materials for such buildings should be shipped as early in the year as 
possible. Contracts with teachers should be made when possible in May and 
June. It is, therefore, recommended that these estimates be considered sepa- 
rately or in some other bill which is likely to receive final consideration earlier 
in the year. 
(23) For the printing of the annual report of the-commissioner and the 
bulletins and circulars which should issue from the bureau each year there 
should be available not less than $100,000. The growing importance of educa-
-P-A-G-E-27
  
SS Te eee eR ee ee eee 
COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXVIL 
tion in ‘our national life, the large expenditures for schools and other agencies 
of education, the increasing extension and differentiation of education to meet 
the new and increasing needs of industrial and civic life have created a demand 
for such information as is contained in these bulletins in many and widely 
varied fields of education. From no other source can this demand be supplied 
than from this bureau, and from this bureau it should be met as fully as 
possible. This will require the printing of a large number of bulletins each 
year, and many of these should be printed in much larger editions. The limit 
of 12,500 copies for any edition of a bulletin should be removed, so that it may 
be printed in such numbers as in the judgment of the Secretary of the Interior 
may be necessary. Fifty thousand school officers can not be supplied from an 
edition of 12,500 copies of a bulletin on a subject in which they are all equally 
interested. 
(24) Congress should again be requested to except the Annual Report of the 
Commissioner of Education from the law in regard to the time of submitting 
copy of annual reports and accompanying documents, so as to permit the copy 
for the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Education to be submitted for 
printing not later than January 15, The nature of this report is such that it 
can not under any circumstances be completed as early as the middle of October. 
Under present conditions it can hardly be completed earlier than January 15. 
(25) When the vocational education bill which passed the Senate at the last 
session of Congress becomes a law, the vocational education commission pro- 
vided for in the bill and of which the Commissioner of Education will, accord- 
ing to the terms of the bill, be the adviser and executive agent, and the em- 
ployees of the commission should be housed in the same building with the 
Bureau of Education and have easy access to its library, its mailing lists, and 
other conveniences. For the effective work of the commission it must bring 
together at its office courses of study, plans of buildings and equipment for trade 
schools, schools of agriculture, and commercial schools, and other schools in 
which the commission is interested, and samples of school work in trades and 
industries. For the work of the bureau, which it now does, more room is needed 
and still more will be needed as its staff of experts and clerks is increased. 
There is now need for more and better arranged space for the bureau’s library, 
which is increasing from year to year. The Nation needs an educational mu- 
seum, a kind of perpetual educational exhibit in which there may be found at 
any time, properly arranged and catalogued, typical courses of study, samples 
of school furniture and equipment of alll kinds, specimens of school work, plans 
and photographs of buildings, grounds, and whatever else will be helpful in 
enabling students of education and school officers and teachers to gain an accu- 
rate and comprehensive knowledge of purposes, methods, and results of educa- 
tion in this and other countries, and assist them in forming ideas for the 
improvement of their own schools and school work. This museum should, of 
course, be under the direction of the Bureau of Education and constitute an 
essential part of its equipment. I therefore renew the recommendation con- 
tained in the commissioner’s statement for 1915 that plans be considered at 
once for the erection of a building that will afford ample room for the work of 
the bureau and allied ‘activities of the Government, house the bureau’s library, 
and furnish ample room for such collections of materials as those mentioned 
above.

GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION.

Editor, Bureau of Education. 
STATISTICAL GROWTH.* 
The number of persons enrolled in educational institutions in the 
United States is increasing at an average rate of half a million 
annually, on the basis of statistics compiled by the Bureau of Edu- 
cation. In 1910 the enrollment was 20,616,888; in 1913 it was 
21,632,518; in 1914, 22,462,342; and in 1915 (partly estimated), 
22,929,677. It would therefore be safe to say that during the past 
year there were 23,500,000 persons attending schools of some kind, 
and that for the year 1916-17 the figure will go well above 24,000,000. 
This would mean that approximately 24 per cent of the inhabitants 
of the United States are attending school, as compared with 19 per 
cent in Great Britain, 17 per cent in France, 20 per cent in Germany, 
and a little over 4 per cent in Russia. Obviously it is not intended 
that such a comparison shall be strictly interpreted. It should also 
be noted that the result would be much less favorable to the United 
States if daily attendance, rather than enrollment, formed the basis 
of the comparison, since some of the other nations have better atten- 
dance and a longer school term than the United States. 
The following table shows the enrollment for four periods—1910, 
1918, 1914, 1915.

2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Of immediate public concern is the increase in elementary and 
secondary public enrollment. The number of pupils in public kinder- 
gartens and elementary schools rose from 16,898,791 in 1910 to 
17,934,982 in 1914, or an increase of more than a million in four 
years. In the same period public high-school students increased 
from 915,061 to 1,218,804, and for 1915 the corresponding figure was 
1,328,984. The total secondary enrollment, public and private, for - 
1915 was 1,484,028 students, an increase of 110,367 over the previous 
year. For several years the proportion of public-school pupils in 
the total enrollment, elementary and secondary, has remained about 
the same; elementary pupils in public schools constitute 92 per cent 
of the total elementary enrollment, and public high-school students 
are approximately 89 per cent of the total secondary enrollment. 
There were 13,929 public and private high schools in 1915. Of the 
11,674 public high schools reported, 8,440 had full four-year courses, 
as compared with 8,275 in 1914, and an enrollment of 1,236,099 stu- 
dents (1,126,456 in 1914). Ninety-three per cent of all public high- 
school students are now in four-year high schools.   HIGHER INSTITUTIONS. 
The number of students in some types of higher institutions has 
increased steadily; in a few fields, especially professional education, 
there has been a decrease due to, the insistence upon higher standards. 
Colleges.—There were 237,168 students in the collegiate and resi- 
dent graduate departments of universities, colleges, and technological 
schools for 1915, as against 216,493 in 1914 and 184,712 in 1910. The 
bureau’s statistical list for 1915 includes 563 colleges, a reduction of 
4 as compared with 1914 and of 33 as compared with 1913. States 
and municipalities controlled 95 of these institutions and private 
denominations or corporations 468; the 1914 figures were 93 and 474, 
respectively. 
Professional schools.—Students in the 123 law schools reported by 
the bureau in 1916 numbered 22,876, as compared with 21,923 in 
1915, 20,958 in 1914, and 12,516 in 1891. There were 14,022 medical 
students in the 96 schools, a decrease of 2,898 from 1915. The num- 
ber of medical graduates was 3,518, a decrease of 18. Theological 
schools had 10,588 students in 1915, as against 11,269 in 1914; there 
were 164 schools in 1915. Dentistry students increased from 9,315 
in 1914 to 9,647 in 1915, the number of schools remaining unchanged. 
Teacher training —The number of students in public and private 
normal schools passed the hundred thousand mark in 1915. Besides 
the 100,325 students in normal schools, 25,721 students were reported 
in public. high-school training courses for teachers and 5,952 in simi-
-P-A-G-E-31
  
GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 3 
lar courses in private secondary schools, while 35,831 students in 
professional courses in education were reported by universities and 
colleges. The latter figure had not been called for in the previous 
years, so that a complete comparison for 1914 and 1915 is impos- 
sible. The increase, exclusive of the college and university figures, 
was 9,552, or less than 8 per cent. 
TEACHERS. 
Men and women teachers.—The number of teachers in the United 
States in 1914 was 706,152, of whom 169,029 were men and 537,123 
women. In 1900 there were 163,999 men and 339,599 women; in 
1910, 158,574 men and 471,633 women. The total number of teachers 
for 1913 was 683,415. In public elementary schools the number of 
men teachers decreased from 116,416 in 1900 to 89,615 in 1914; in 
the same period the number of women teachers in public elementary 
schools increased from 402,690 to 432,534. In 1900 teaching posi- 
tions in public high schools were evenly divided between men and 
women; in 1914 there were 25,047 men, an increase of 14,875, and 
82,862 women, an increase of 22,662. 
Teachers’ salaries —The average annual salary of all teachers for 
1914 was $525, as compared with $512 in 1913. The average salary 
is highest in the Western and North Atlantic States, with $699 and 
$696, respectively, and lowest in the South Atlantic States ($329). 
It varies from $234 in Mississippi to $871 in California and $941 
in New York. a 
COST OF EDUCATION. 
Expenditures for education in 1914, partly estimated, totaled close 
to $800,000,000. An estimate, making due allowances for the inter- 
vening two years and for items necessarily omitted, would easily 
bring the nation’s current educational expenditure to a billion dol- 
lars. Public elementary schools cost approximately $500,000,000; 
public high schools, $70,000,000; private elementary schools, $52,- 
000,000; private secondary schools, $15,000,000; universities, colleges, 
_ and professional schools, $100,000,000; normal schools, $15,000,000. 
Of the $555,077,146 expended for public elementary and high 
schools in 1914, $398,511,104 was by the North Atlantic and North 
Central States. The amount expended by the State of New York 
($66,000,000) was nearly twice that spent’ by the entire group of 9 
States in the South Atlantic division, one-fourth more than the entire 
South Central division, and slightly less than the 11 States in the 
Western division. Pennsylvania is the only other State that ex- 
pended more than $50,000,000 annually for schools. Illinois spent 
$39,007,314, Ohio $35,172,950, California $26,579,804, Massachusetts
-P-A-G-E-32
    
  4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
$25,492,292, and New Jersey $23,284,096. Six States, New Hamp- 
shire, Vermont, Delaware, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Nevada, 
expended less than $2,000,000. On a per capita basis Utah ranked 
highest, with an expenditure for education of $10.07; Idaho ex- 
pended $9.66 per capita of population; North Dakota, $9.62; Mon- 
tana, $9.50; Arizona, $8.93; and Washington, $8.89; while Missis- 
sippi spent $1.48, South Carolina $1.83, Alabama $1.97, and Georgia 
$1.98. 
Gifts and bequests to education amounted to $31,357,398 in 1914, 
of which $26,670,017 was for universities and colleges, $1,558,281 
for theological schools, and $1,495,773 for law schools. Since 1896 
sums aggregating $407,000,000 have been given to educational 
institutions by private donors. 
EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS OF THE YEAR. 
There have been few new developments during the year. The 
significant contributions of educational theory that have been made 
in the past quarter of a century appear at length to be working 
themselves out in practice. There seems to be a clearer vision as to 
the essential aims of education. Educational surveys have multi- 
plied to a remarkable extent; almost no field has now been left un- 
touched, and the latest findings in scientific measurement are being 
utilized in survey work. The health movement in education has 
experienced a notable stimulus from the preparedness situation and 
the demand for military training. Rural education has more and 
more enlisted the interest of the general public outside of profes- 
sional circles and has clearly become a problem of administration 
and financing, rather than promotion. Vocational education is ad- 
vancing slowly, but steadily, in a way that seems to afford the best 
possible guaranty of permanence. 
SURVEYS AND INVESTIGATIONS, 
So numerous and so varied have educational surveys and inquiries 
become that it is impossible to keep accurate account of them. Pub- 
lished reports from at least 30 such surveys were received by the 
Bureau of Education during the year. These include comprehensive 
studies such as the series of 25 volumes on Cleveland, Ohio, ana- 
lyzing and describing every possible phase of the city’s educational 
activity; the Denver survey, in five separate pamphlets and a sup- 
plementary section; the Minneapolis vocational survey, wherein the 
city’s occupational needs and opportunities are set forth in detail; 
the Bureau of Education’s survey of higher educational institutions 
in Iowa, which signalizes the re-entry of the Federal Government

into the educational survey field; the rural school sanitation sur- 
veys of the United States Public Health Service; the study of public 
education in Maryland, made by the General Education Board, 
conspicuous for the epoch-making legislation that followed it; sev- 
eral school garden surveys, representing an attempt to show the 
possibilities of gardening as a type of practical work in cities; a 
half dozen special city surveys, treating topics of school adminis- 
tration in Boston, Los Angeles, Salt Lake, Buffalo, and other cities; 
and an increasing number of “ autosurveys” and surveys made by 
the local school authorities with the assistance of the instructional 
staff and students of departments of education in universities and 
colleges. : 
An impressive list of surveys and special investigations was under 
way at the close of the year. The Gary school system has been under 
scrutiny by the General Education Board on the one hand and the 
American Federation of Labor on the other. The division of educa- 
tional inquiry of the Carnegie Foundation has continued its investi- 
gation of law schools, engineering, and normal schools. Indiana has 
inaugurated a State vocational survey. The Bureau of Education had 
under way or planned at the close of the year 12 State, city, or county 
surveys. In addition to the report on higher educational institutions 
in Iowa, already mentioned, bulletins containing reports of surveys 
in three other States have been issued by the bureau: A study of Edu- 
cational Institutions in the State of Washington (including some re- 
view of the elementary-school situation) ; a report on Education in 
Wyoming, prepared for the use of the legislature in revising the 
school code of the State; and a report of a survey of the higher edu- 
cational institutions of North Dakota. In the case of the Iowa and 
Washington surveys it is believed that certain fundamental prin- 
ciples have been laid down that will prove of inestimable value to 
many other States. The two-volume report by the Bureau of Edu- 
cation on colored schools, just issuing from the press, is the result of 
a three-years’ study at first hand of private and higher educational 
facilities for Negroes, made in cooperation with the Phelps-Stokes 
Fund. The Bureau of Education has also completed all or part of 
the field work on the following surveys, reports of which are soon 
to be printed as bulletins of the bureau or as special reports: Nassau 
County, N. Y.; University of Nevada; Arizona (entire State) ; Dela- 
ware (entire State) ; Colorado (school administration and finance) ; 
San Francisco; and a few smaller cities, such as Webster Groves, 
Mo., and Elyria, Ohio. More surveys have been promised, but 
many requests have had to be refused.*

EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
MILITARY TRAINING, 
  The demand for military training has been heeded to a greater or 
less degree by a number of States. New York was the first to enact 
important military physical training legislation. There are two 
laws; one is an amendment to the military law providing for the 
creation of a “military training commission” and for instituting 
compulsory “military and disciplinary training”; the other is an 
amendment to the educational law providing for compulsory “ physi- 
cal training and discipline” for all children 8 years and over in all 
schools of the State, public and private. The important feature of 
the military amendment, aside from the creation of the military 
training commission, is the requirement that “all boys above the age 
of 16 years and not over the age of 19 years * * * shall be given 
such military training as the commission may prescribe for periods 
aggregating not more than three hours in each week during the 
school or college year.” The military training commission as ap- 
pointed consists of three members, the major general of the National 
Guard, the commissioner of education for New York State, and a 
specialist in physical training. The commission has appointed Dr. 
Thomas A. Story, professor of physical education in the College 
of the City of New York, as State inspector of physical training. 
A comprehensive program has been formulated for carrying out the 
provisions of the two laws. 
The question of military training has been discussed from numer- 
ous angles during the year. Especially significant is the change in 
the attitude of the National. Education Association, which replaced 
its previous resolutions on the evils of military training with a 
resolution adopted at New York City that clearly recognizes “that 
the community or the State may introduce such elements of military 
training into the school as may seem wise and prudent,” yet asserts 
that “such training should be strictly educational in its aim and 
organization and military ends should not be permitted to pervert 
the educational purposes and practices of the school.” One plan of 
military training now under discussion is the so-called Wyoming 
plan as developed by Lieut. E. Z. Steever in the high schools of 
Wyoming. Briefly, it provides “for the division of the school year 
for separate intensive school periods, boys to be taken into camp 
each week end in order that they may be hardened to the rigors of 
camp life and learn useful facts as regards sanitation, cooking, 
woodcraft, simple field engineering, plains craft, castrametation, 
sketching, scouting, patrolling, the service of security and informa- 
tion.” 
Current opinion seems to hold that “military training in the 
schools conceived as military drilling is undesirable and unavail-
-P-A-G-E-35
  GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. i 
ing;” but that military training conceived as a “comprehensive 
program for physical, moral, and civic education” is desirable and 
even necessary. There is a disposition on the part of school men, 
especially advocates of physical education and hygiene, to realize 
that the public’s willingness to pay for certain things under the 
name of military training may well mean strides forward in health 
education that would not otherwise have been taken for many years. 
EFFECTS OF THE WAR UPON AMERICAN EDUCATION. 
The effect of the European war and the preparedness agitation in 
the United States shows to some extent in the figures for military 
drill in high schools. The 75 public high schools reporting military 
drill in 1914 increased to 119 in 1915, and the number of students in 
military drill from 8,702 to 14,481. There were 86 private secondary 
schools in 1914 with military drill and 113 in 1915, the number of 
students in drill increasing from 6,835 to 8,836. In 1915, therefore, 
232 secondary schools had military drill, and there were 23,317 stu- 
dents taking military drill in these schools. The number of schools 
with military drill was less than 2 per cent of the total number of 
secondary schools, and the number of students in military drill was 
8 per cent of the total number of boys enrolled in all secondary 
schools. 
Officers’ Reserve Corps.—A direct result of the preparedness agita- 
tion was the act of June 3, 1916, providing for a Reserve Officers’ 
Training Corps— 
which shall consist of a senior division organized at universities and colleges 
requiring four years of collegiate study for a degree, including State universi- 
ties and those State institutions that are required to provide instruction in 
military tactics under the provisions of the act of Congress of July 2, 1862, 
donating lands for the establishment of colleges where the leading object shall 
be practical instruction in agriculture and the mechanic arts, including mili- 
tary tactics, and a junior division organized at all other public or private edu- 
cational institutions, except that units of the senior division may be organized 
at those essentially military schools which do not confer an academic degree, 
but which, as a result of the annual inspection of such institutions by the War 
Department, are specially designated by the Secretary of War as qualified for 
units of the senior division, and each division shall consist of units of the 
several arms or corps in such number and of such strength as the President 
may prescribe.’ 
The primary object of establishing units of the Reserve Officers’ 
Training Corps is to qualify by systematic and standard methods of 
training students at civil educational institutions for reserve officers. 
Americanization movement.—More marked is the direct effect of 
the war in stimulating what has come to be called the Americaniza- 
tion movement. When the Bureau of Education in 1914 began a

  8 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
national investigation of facilities of the education of aliens, few 
standards existed, practically all methods were in the experimental 
stage, there was lack of cooperation between existing public agencies 
and numerous private agencies were exploiting the field of immigrant 
education extensively. Progress since 1914 has been rapid and defi- 
nite. Governmental authorities everywhere—city, State, and Fed- 
eral—have begun to provide adequate facilities. The Federal Gov- 
ernment, especially the Bureau of Education, has come to take the 
stand that “inasmuch as admission of an immigrant to the United 
States, together with his admission to citizenship, are both Federal 
matters, then, equally, is interest in his training for life and citizen- 
ship in this country a Federal matter.” Legislative provisions mak- 
ing the establishment of evening schools optional on the part of local 
boards of education have been passed in the principal immigrant 
States, such as California, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Wis- 
consin. The California law of last year provides for the appoint- 
ment of “domestic educators” by local boards of education. These 
educators are to go from house to house, especially in foreign sections, 
for the purpose of training the mothers and children in the rules of 
health, sanitation, and hygiene, the principles of buying food and 
clothing, the English language, civics, and other appropriate sub- 
jects. One city, Rochester, N. Y., has a director of immigrant edu- 
cation and has made remarkable progress in its Americanization 
work, 
Education and industrial efficiency.—Not the least of the effects 
of the European war in the United States has been the resulting 
realization on the part of business men, political leaders, and the 
public generally of the essential interrelation between education and 
industrial organization. Germany’s example has impressed neutrals 
the world over. This realization has undoubtedly done more for 
vocational education at State and Federal expense than years of 
academic discussion and experimentation could have done. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
The Smith-Hughes bill providing Federal aid for vocational edu- 
cation passed the Senate without a dissenting vote in July, 1916. 
Vocational training for soldiers in service had already been provided 
in the Army bill passed by Congress in May, 1916. The passage 
of the Federal child-labor law also represents an essential step in the 
establishment of a national system of vocational education. 
There has been no change since the last report in the number of 
State systems of vocational education; in the States that have organ- 
ized departments of vocational training on a State-wide basis the 
greatest progress seems to have been in the development of the day- 
continuation school for young employed workers. Other significant
-P-A-G-E-37
      
GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 9 
features of progress in vocational education are: Recognition of the 
importance of proper machinery for insuring a supply of adequately 
trained and certificated teachers; renewed emphasis on the cultural 
possibilities of vocational education and the necessity of thorough 
grounding in the fundamentals of education; discussion and actual 
development in “ prevocational” education; a decreased interest in - 
the “ unit versus dual control ” controversy, the preponderance of opin- 
ion appearing to be against the organization of special independent 
boards for the control of vocational education; and a further devel- 
epment of interest in vocational guidance by the public school and 
the resulting beginnings of modification of school methods and 
courses of study. Schools are more and more examining critically 
the aims of vocational instruction-in all fields. A recent investiga- 
tion by the bureau shows that 2,175 high schools report the teaching 
of agriculture. Of these, 1,521 declared they are teaching agriculture 
primarily as an informational subject and 566 primarily as a voca- 
tional subject. Approximately 1,000 of the 2,254 teachers of agri- 
culture in public high schools have had special training in agriculture. 
RURAL SCHOOLS. 
Definite advance is reported in rural school supervision and con- 
solidation. 
Supervision.—Louisiana and Maryland are two States with large 
rural population that have raised the qualifications for superin- 
tendents of schools who have charge of schools in rural districts. 
Maryland now has a State supervisor of rural schools, and the new 
law requires the employment of primary-grade supervisors for every 
county at a minimum salary of $1,200, the State paying one-half 
of the salary up to $2,000. Wisconsin has provided for the employ- 
ment of “supervising teachers in each county”; counties with more 
than 125 schools may have two supervising teachers. In New 
Jersey the State commissioner of education is authorized to appoint 
in each county a “helping teacher” to assist teachers in the smaller 
schools. West Virginia increased its number of district supervisors 
from 62 to 82, and Mississippi and Alabama now require county 
superintendents to devote their entire time to the work. These are 
real advances in the long-neglected field of rural school supervision. 
Consolidation—Apparently more consolidated schools have been 
established in the past year than in any two previous years. In 
West Virginia 375 one-teacher country schools were replaced by 
larger schools. In Wisconsin the movement. has resulted in the 
establishment of joint and union high schools which form, for prac- 
tical purposes, consolidation centers, elementary education being 
taken care of in the local one-room district schools of the neighbor-
-P-A-G-E-38
10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
  hood. New York State reports 100 new consolidated schools; Texas, 
200; and Louisiana, 48, not including several schools established 
without State aid; Indiana reports 48 rural high schools commis- 
sioned during the year, all connected with rural consolidated schools; 
while 61 of the 110 consolidated schools reported in Missouri main- 
tained high-school departments in 1915-16. 
Better teachers.—Considerable progress has been made in solving 
the problem of better prepared teachers for the rural schools. Eight 
years ago fewer than 20 normal schools had specially organized 
departments for the preparation of rural school teachers; now 64 
normal schools have such departments. Twelve States reporting 
teacher-training courses in secondary schools in 1913 have grown 
to 21 in 1916; this type of professional preparation is for the present 
of special importance for the rural schools. Especially significant 
for the problem of better teachers is the rapid growth of the “ teach- 
erage” movement. Texas, Washington, and Oklahoma are States 
that report unusual progress in the building of teachers’ cottages; 
Texas reports 191, Washington 144, and Oklahoma 70. In Missis- 
sippi a new law authorizes consolidated districts to levy taxes for 
teachers’ homes. a 
Rural course of study—Considerable attention has been given by 
Federal and State officials and by normal schools and university de- 
partments of education to the formulation of a course of study for 
rural schools based on what rural people ought to know. In 1918 the 
Bureau of Education began a study of what people who live in the 
country ought to know in order to be able to live wholesome, con- 
tented, and profitable lives “on the land or away from it, if they 
should become attracted by the call and move to city places.” The 
agricultural leaders and rural-life experts who were asked to give 
their views were agreed that the school devotes too much time to 
acquiring the working tools of an education, that the subject-matter 
for the traditional school is still “ cumbered with all kinds of unnec- 
essary timber,” and the methods of presentation inadequate, and that 
the schools do not devote time enough to the things which serve a 
real purpose. It was felt that every activity of the community should 
be reflected in the curriculum; that the farm, the fields, and the for- 
est should be made laboratories for working material for the new 
schools. In the past three years the reconstruction of the rural school 
course of study to accord with these standards has gone forward to 
the extent that a number of important formulations by State teachers’ 
associations, particularly of Minnesota and Iowa, have been made, 
and it should soon be possible to report the adoption of a newer 
course of study and newer methods in a definitely larger proportion 
of rural communities.

EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE, 
The stimulus given to the educational hygiene movement by pre- 
paredness and the demand for military training has already been 
referred to, Health education has made other advances than in the 
field of activities due directly to the war. Among important recent 
aspects are “the broader and more philosophic conception of the 
scope and problems of physical education,” and the demand for 
standards in this as in all other fields of educational endeavor. 
The practice of expanding the functions of the director of physical 
training or establishing a new office to cover most of the phases 
of educational hygiene is rapidly growing. Boston, New York, 
Kansas City, and Cincinnati are cities that have consolidated pre- 
viously scattered activities. The integration of athletics and the 
teaching of hygiene with physical training is now complete in many 
school systems. 
In the establishing of standards the attempt to formulate minimum 
essentials of physical education, which is to be the subject of the 
sixteenth report of the National Society for the Study of Education, 
is significant as representative of the views of a number of national 
organizations. More attention has been given to eye hygiene and 
ventilation than in previous years. The ventilation problem has 
come nearer solution as the result of a considerable amount of scien- 
tific experimentation. 
In the rural school field a number of important tasks of investi- 
gation and promotion have been completed. Particularly noteworthy 
are the distribution of hundreds of thousands of pamphlets contain- 
ing the essentials of rural school hygiene and sanitation; health 
surveys in rural schools, under the direction of the United States 
Public Health Service; and the increasing control of rural school- 
house architecture by the State school authorities. 
Health inspection of rural school children is becoming a reality. 
In Pennsylvania, where medical examinations have become State 
wide, 2,184 rural school districts out of a possible 2,236 were in- 
spected during 1914-15. Of the total number of children in the 
State, 335,427, or 71.48 per cent, were classed as physical defectives; 
83,749 were found to have defective vision; 15,600 had defective 
hearing; 22,837 defective breathing; 12,322 defective tonsils; and 
212,708 defective teeth. 
OTHER MOVEMENTS. 
Of other educational movements the junior high school and the 
Gary plan still appear to have affected educational discussion most 
notably.  
-P-A-G-E-40
    12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
The junior high school—The junior high school movement has 
reached such proportions that careful investigation seems to be 
necessary to establish the claims made. Thus a survey by an Iowa 
superintendent of schools shows something like 209 junior high 
schools in the smaller cities alone. It seems probable, however, that 
many of the school principals who report the adoption of the “six 
and six” plan, or junior high school, really have only a more or 
less elaborated organization of departmental teaching. The problem 
is so important that the General Education Board has authorized 
a careful field study of institutions reporting themselves as junior 
high schools. In any event the six-six idea of school organization 
seems to be so firmly established that it will inevitably affect the 
school system of all the States in the near future. 
The Gary plan—The municipal authorities of the city of New 
York, where the Gary plan has been spectacularly on trial, have 
evidently decided in its favor, despite the more or less unfavorable 
attitude of the school officials. A large increase in the number of 
schools and the expenditure of millions of dollars in the furtherance 
of the Gary experiment were authorized for the school year 1916-17. 
Considerable educational pamphleteering has featured the New 
York situation. An attempt by the school authorities to establish 
a scientific evaluation of the Gary schools, in comparison with the 
traditional schools and the so-called Ettinger schools, was met by 
the issue of documents by the Public Education Association and 
others interested in the Gary plan, in which not only were the 
conclusions of the Buckingham report rejected but the scientific 
method was attacked.t| In New York the promise held out by the 
Gary advocates that the plant will solve the part-time problem has 
had great weight, and similar considerations have operated in other 
localities with rapidly growing population. 
Teachers’ unions—The organization of teachers’ unions, affiliated 
with union labor, attempted on several occasions in the past, has 
become a reality. The Cleveland situation has remained more or 
less tense. In Chicago the teachers’ federation incurred the hos- 
tility of the board of education to such an extent as to result in the 
removal of a number of teachers. The formation of the American 
Federation of Teachers has given stability to the movement for 
teachers’ unions. The affiliation of this and other organizations of 
Government and professional workers with the American Federation 
of Labor is a movement that has gone on so quietly as to attract 
quite insufficient attention from the public. 
LEGISLATION. 
Eleven States held regular legislative sessions in 1916. The most 
extensive changes in school law were made by Maryland, following   
1 For a discussion of this situation, see Ch. III.
-P-A-G-E-41
  
GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 13 
a State-wide survey. The new Maryland law tends to eliminate 
partisan politics from State and county school administrations, 
raises the qualifications and salaries of teachers, superintendents, 
and other school officers, and exacts attendance for the entire period 
during which schools are in session for every child between 7 and 13 
years of age, attendance at least 100 days for children 13 and 14 
years of age, and attendance at least 100 days for all children 15 and 
16 years of age who have not completed the work of the elementary 
grades. 
In 1914 six States were without compulsory education laws of any 
kind, and six had laws that applied only partially. In 1915, it will 
be recalled, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, and Texas passed 
compulsory laws, thus reducing the States without laws to two. In 
1916 Georgia passed a compulsory attendance law, leaving but one 
State—Mississippi—without such a law. Louisiana made her par- 
tial compulsory law State-wide, and Maryland provided for a system 
of county attendance officers that should mean a notable improvement 
in the enforcement of the law. 
Louisiana made a number of general changes in its school law in 
1916. The State board of education was reorganized, the powers of 
the parish (county) board of education were more clearly defined, 
and provision was made for increased salaries for parish superin- 
tendents. The Legislature of Mississippi created a commission to pre- 
pare a complete code of school laws and report to the legislature of 
1918, An illiteracy commission, similar to those in Kentucky, Ala- 
bama, and North Carolina, was also authorized. Maryland, Massa- 
chusetts, and New Jersey provided for the investigation of military 
training in the public schools, 
The Federal child-labor law has been mentioned in another con- 
nection. Massachusetts extended the provision of its law relating to 
the employment of minors by the passage of three acts in 1916, one 
permitting the employment of women and minors for a limited time 
in certain seasonal occupations, another making possible the employ- 
ment of minors between 14 and 16 years of age in vacation time, and 
a third authorizing part-time employment for children of this age 
who are pursuing cooperative industrial courses. South Carolina 
raised from 12 to 14 years the minimum age at which children may 
be employed in factories, mines, and textile establishments. Mary- 
land’s State child-labor law was changed in a number of particulars. 
The law now prohibits the employment of children under 14 years of 
age in any factory, mechanical establishment, office building, garage, 
boarding house, or in messenger service. In the more hazardous oc- 
cupations minors employed must be over 16 years of age. An elabo- 
rate system of employment certificates is provided for.

  14 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE OF THE YEAR. 
Some conception of the volume of educational literature for the 
year may be obtained from the number of entries in the Monthly 
Record of Current Educational Publications issued by the Bureau 
of Education. From February, 1915, to January, 1916, there were 
1,790 entries, as compared with 2,094 entries for the corresponding 
period previously. Between February and December, 1916, 1,618 
entries were reported, so that from five to six thousand books and 
articles on education have been issued during the past three years. 
Publishers’ statistics credit education during 1915 with 237 books, 
as distinguished from unbound pamphlets, reports, articles, etc., 
a slight falling off from the year before. 
It was noted in the last previous report on the subject: that 
much of the significant contribution to current educational liter- 
ature is in the form of reports of surveys and investigations. Some 
of the surveys have already been indicated. Especially important 
as contributions to educational literature are the volumes of the 
Cleveland survey. Well written and attractively printed, these 
books may well serve as an example to other makers of educational 
reports. “Public Education in Maryland,” by the General Edu- 
cation Board, and “ Higher Educational Institutions of Iowa,” by 
the Bureau of Education, are among other reports issued during 
the year that appear to have elements of permanence as educational 
documents. A large part of the material compiled in the survey 
work is later being issued in book form: This procedure, begun 
in the case of the New York school inquiry, has become fairly well 
established; witness Prof. Cubberly’s recent books on school admin- 
istration. The educational survey, after all, represents largely the 
application of accumulated theory and practice; it should therefore 
be a valuable medium for the formulation of educational doctrine. 
In addition to the report of the Maryland survey, the General 
Education Board published during the year two pamphlets in its 
“ occasional papers” series that have already caused widespread dis- 
cussion—Flexner’s “A Modern School” and Eliot’s “Needed 
Changes in Secondary Education.” A controversial literature of no 
mean dimensions threatens to develop from Dr. Flexner’s concrete 
statement of certain advanced demands. The annual reports and 
bulletins of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teach- 
ing have a deserved reputation for scholarly handling of important 
problems in education. Teachers’ pensions and law schools are the 
two subjects on which material has recently been published. Bulle- 
tin 8, “The Case Method in American Law Schools,” has had pro- 
found consideration from leaders in legal education, and Bulletin 9,   
1Hduc. Rep. 1914, Vol. I, Ch. I, p. 15.
-P-A-G-E-43
  GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. 15 
“A Comprehensive Plan of Insurance and Annuities for College 
Teachers,” seems destined to have a very decided effect on legislation 
establishing State pension systems for public-school teachers. 
Among general educational writings should be mentioned John 
Dewey’s “ Democracy and Education,” the author’s most complete 
formulation of “ the ideas implied in a democratic society” and the 
means of applying these ideas to the enterprise of education; and E. 
C. Moore’s “ What is Education.” In the field of educational psy- 
chology, Judd’s “The Psychology of the High School Subjects,” 
Miss C. M. Meredith’s “The Educational Bearings of Modern Psy- 
chology,” and Freeman’s “ Experimental Education,” may be noted. 
Publications relating to secondary education have been compara- 
tively rare in the year under review; the lack will soon be remedied, 
however, with the appearance of the reports of the Commission on 
the Reorganization of Secondary Education, to be issued as bulletins 
of the Bureau of Education. 
The literature of standards and tests has to its credit for the year 
the important papers in the Fifteenth Yearbook of the Society for 
the Study of Education; Starch, “ Educational Measurements”; and 
Terman, “The Measure of Intelligence,” besides numerous articles 
on tests for the various school subjects in educational periodicals and 
_ survey reports. Rapeer’s “Educational Hygiene from the Public 
School Period to the University” contains chapters by leading spe- 
cialists and is therefore a convenient summary of this important 
phase of education. Two books of widely differing scope in the gen- 
eral subject of play are to be recorded—Henry §S. Curtis, “The 
Practical Conduct of Play,” and Joseph Lee, “ Play in Education.” 
The kindergarten is treated from opposite angles in Nora Atwood’s 
“Kindergarten Theory and Practice” and Kilpatrick’s “ Froebel’s 
Kindergarten Theories Critically Examined.” The Gary experi- 
ment, besides calling forth a large amount of pamphlet and peri- 
odical material, has produced at least one new book—Randolph S. 
Bourne’s “The a Schools.” Of special interest is Hall-Quest’s 
“ Supervised Study.” 
In vocational training and related fields publication has been 
mainly in the form of reports and pamphlets. The Minneapolis 
survey, like the Richmond survey, by the National Society for the 
Promotion of Industrial Education, exemplifies the survey type of 
vocational literature. Lapp and Mote, “Learning to Earn,” sum- 
marizes the needs and possibilities of vocational education; Leavitt 
and Brown, “ Prevocational Education in the Public Schools,” is a 
practical book in an important new field; Smith, “Establishing 
Industrial Schools,” in the Riverside Educational Monographs, is 
intended to help in the actual organizing of such schools. Particu- 
larly noteworthy in the manual arts field is the increasing number of
-P-A-G-E-44
    16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
high-grade textbooks; this is especially important in a domain where 
textbook aids have hitherto been so inadequate. Content material 
has been emphasized in recent books in home economics; such books 
as Baldt, “Clothing for Women”; Mathewson and Newlands, “A 
Laboratory Manual of Foods and Cooking”; Greer, “ Textbook of 
Cooking”; Sherman, “Food Products”; Locke, “Food Values”; 
and F. C. Gephart, “Analysis and Cost of Ready-to-Serve Foods,” 
have made available much material that is needed for school and 
college courses in household arts. Important additions have been 
made to the list of books on vocational guidance: Bloomfield, “ Youth 
School and Vocation,” and “Readings in Vocational Guidance”; 
Davis, “ Vocational and Moral Guidance”; Gowin and Wheatley, 
“ Occupations” ; and Hollingworth, “ Vocational Psychology,” should 
be mentioned. 
Rural education continues to be discussed in numerous books and 
articles. Among the books that emerge for one reason or another 
are: Carver, “ Organization of a Rural Community”; Bailey, “ York 
State Rural Problems”; Pickard, “Rural Education”; Gillette, 
“Constructive Rural Sociology”; Kennedy, “Rural Life and the 
Rural Schools”; Foght, “The Rural Teacher and His Work.” Prof. 
Carver’s “ Selected Readings in Rural Economics” is a type of edu- 
cational compilation that might well be imitated in other fields. The 
rural school campaign has reached the state where a successful novel 
has been written about it and for it; it is worth while to note that 
Herbert Quick’s “The Brown Mouse” will reach a far wider public 
than most writings on the rural school and will therefore render 
service where service is most needed. 
Educational journalism has been enriched in the past two years 
by several new periodicals of high type, notably “ Educational Ad- 
ministration and Supervision”; “School and Society,” and “The 
American School.” Changes in title are often significant: “ The Kin- 
dergarten Review” has become “ Kindergarten and First Grade,” 
and “Manual Training and Vocational Education” becomes “The 
Manual Training Magazine.” 
Publications of the Bureaw of Education—During the year the 
Bureau of Education published, besides the 1915 report, 48 new issues 
of the bulletin and 9 reprint editions; 122 miscellaneous printed docu- 
ments, including circulars and reprints of chapters from the annual 
report; and 478 multigraphed and mimeographed letters and circu- 
lars. The bureau’s edition of the annual report was 20,000, of the 
bulletins 355,420, of the printed leaflets and circulars 337,700, and of 
the duplicated letters 1,127,000. These figures do not take into ac- 
count the editions printed for congressional distribution and the large 
sales editions of bureau documents printed for the Superintendent of

document containing lists of Federal, State, city, and county school 
officers, names of executive officers of universities and colleges, nor- 
mal schools, and professional schools, and lists of institutions and 
organizations affecting education. The Monthly Record, which 
began in 1912 as a brief circular of references to books and articles 
on education, has developed into a more or less complete guide to edu- 
cational literature.

CHAPTER IT. 
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION. 
By Witt1am R. Hoop, 
Division of School Administration. 
By far the larger number of State legislatures meet biennially, 
and in odd-numbered years. In 1915 there were 48 States which held 
meetings of their legislative bodies. In 1916 only 11 States held 
regular sessions. Of these, 6—Georgia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, 
New York, Rhode Island, and South Carolina—hold annual sessions. 
The remaining 5 States whose legislatures met this year—Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and Virginia—hold biennial ‘ses- 
sions in even-numbered years. California held a special session. The 
volume of legislation enacted in 1916 was therefore much smaller 
than that of the previous year. 
GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL AND SUPERVISION. 
The most extensive changes made in the school law of any State 
in 1916 were those made by the Legislature of Maryland, following 
a State-wide survey. In enacting its new law, Maryland followed 
the present tendency to eliminate partisan politics and ex-officio 
membership from the composition of administrative school boards. 
The State board of education formerly consisted of the governor 
and State superintendent of education, ex officio, and six members 
appointed by the governor for terms of six years. The law pro- 
vided that at least two members should be appointed from the mi- 
nority political party. Under the provisions of the new law the 
State board of education will, after the expiration of the terms of 
the present incumbents, be composed of seven members appointed 
by the governor “from the citizens of the State,” and the governor 
and State superintendent will cease to be members after the first 
Monday in May, 1918. In making his selection of members the gov- 
ernor must be guided solely by the character and fitness of persons 
appointed, but no person may be appointed to the board who is in 
any way “subject to its authority.” The term of each member is to 
be seven years, one member’s term to expire each year. Additional 
19 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
powers and duties conferred upon the board are the regulation of | 
schoolhouse construction; the standardization of schools; the regu- 
lation of the issuance of teachers’ certificates and the conferring of 
degrees by educational institutions; the prescription of a course of 
study for elementary, high, and normal schools; and the direction 
of the biennial school census. In short, the general care and super- 
vision of public education are intrusted to the State board. It is 
empowered to prescribe rules and regulations which, when enacted 
and published, have the force of law, if not inconsistent with the 
statutes. The board now appoints the State superintendent of 
schools for a term of four years and fixes his compensation. This 
officer was formerly appointed by the governor. He is the executive 
officer of the State board of education and is directed to execute its 
educational policies. An assistant State superintendent of schools, a 
supervisor of high schools, a supervisor of rural schools, a white 
supervisor of colored schools, and such other clerical and profes- 
sional assistants as may be authorized by the State board are pro- 
vided for in the law. A county board of education, composed of six 
members in a few counties and of three members in other counties, 
displaces the older board of county school commissioners and is given 
larger powers. The functions of the county superintendent are more 
clearly defined. 
Louisiana is another State which made changes of a general 
nature in its school law in 1916. The most important change made 
was the reorganization of the State board of education. This board 
now consists of five members appointed by the governor for “ over- 
lapping terms,” and the State superintendent of public instruction, 
ex officio. This body displaces a board composed of the governor, 
State superintendent, attorney general, and one citizen appointed by 
the governor from each of the congressional districts. It will be 
observed that Maryland, in reorganizing its State board, departed 
entirely from the policy of constituting it in part of members who 
were made such by virtue of the offices which they held. The Legis- 
lature of Louisiana removed the governor and attorney general from 
the board of that State, but the State superintendent was permitted 
to remain. School administrators differ in opinion as to the advisa- 
bility of making the State superintendent, or chief executive officer, 
a member of the State school administrative body, but the difference 
would appear to be of small consequence, if the board’s powers and 
functions are properly articulated with those of its chief executive 
officer. Of the 44 States having centralized administrative bodies in 
control of common schools or of State educational institutions, 28 
have their State superintendents as members of such bodies and the 
remaining 16 are otherwise constituted. In laws enacted in recent 
years, however, the tendency has been to eliminate ex-officio member- 
 
-P-A-G-E-49

ship from the composition of State boards. The State board of 
education of Louisiana has general control and supervision of the 
public schools. In addition, it now controls schools for the blind and 
the deaf. The State superintendent is allowed such inspectors and 
supervisors as may be needed. 
Noteworthy acts affecting local administration and supervision 
were passed in Virginia, Louisiana, New Jersey, and New York. 
The new law of Virginia relates to the office of division superin- 
tendent of schools, which for rural districts corresponds to the county 
superintendent in other States. The act fixes the minimum qualifi- 
cations of such superintendents, of whom no educational qualifica- 
tions have hitherto been required by law. A division superintendent 
must now hold a State teacher’s license, the equivalent of a first- 
grade certificate, or must have already held the office of superin- 
tendent or been a teacher for such number of years as the State board 
of education may designate. In taking this step, Virginia falls into 
line with other States which for a number of years have been steadily 
raising the qualifications of county superintendents and like super- 
visory officers. Louisiana’s law of 1916 leaves the composition of 
the “parish” (county) board of education as it was, but defines 
more clearly its powers and duties. The parish superintendent is 
chosen by the parish board as formerly, and the qualifications 
required of him remain the same, but provision is made for increas- 
ing his salary. The minimum salary allowed is now $900 and the 
maximum is $4,000, to be determined by the parish board. An act 
of the New Jersey Legislature authorizes the State commissioner of 
education to appoint, with the approval of the State board of edu- 
cation, a “helping teacher” to aid and direct the teachers of two or 
more school districts. The 1916 act of the New York Legislature 
provides for the change of the boundary lines of supervisory dis- 
tricts by resolution of the board of supervisors of the county. No 
provision was made in the older law for the alteration of the 
boundaries of-such districts. 
COMMISSIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS. 
In Mississippi a commission created by the legislature of 1916 is 
empowered and directed to prepare a complete code of school laws ( 
and report to the legislature of 1918. A second commission in this 
State is the “illiteracy commission,” whose purpose is to investi- 
gate and seek to remove illiteracy, particularly among adults. In 
Maryland the educational survey commission created in 1914 to 
investigate the educational needs of the State was continued by an 
act of 1916, and the scope of its work was enlarged to include the 
investigation of the higher educational institutions of the State. 
61355°—16—4. 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
    22 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
Maryland also provided for the investigation of the subject of mili- 
tary training in the public schools, and Massachusetts and New 
Jersey made similar provision. <A resolution of the Massachusetts 
Legislature is designed to effect the investigation by a special com- 
mission of agricultural education at the State agricultural college 
and the development of the agricultural resources of the State. An 
echo of the contention heard in some quarters that textbooks cost 
too much and should be printed by the State was heard in the Vir- 
ginia Legislature. There a committee of five members was appointed 
to investigate and report on State printing, including the printing 
of books to be used in the public schools. The committee is directed 
to prepare a report and the State superintendent is required to have 
it printed. Kentucky, which was the first of the States to create an 
“illiteracy commission,” but which failed to provide any appropria- 
tion for its expenses in the original act, now allows $5,000 a year for 
the next two years. A 1916 act of Louisiana provides for an inves- . 
tigation into the education of blind and deaf Negroes. 
PUBLIC SCHOOL SUPPORT. 
The Legislature of Virginia passed several acts looking toward an 
increase of the school revenues. One measure gives the schools the 
benefit of an inheritance tax, while another gives them the benefit 
of delinquent-capitation taxes. A third provides that certain delin- 
quent property taxes shall go to the schools. Still further support 
is allowed in “An act to authorize and empower the board of super- 
visors of any county to appropriate out of the general funds of said 
county to the public schools thereof a sum not to exceed 25 per cent 
of the amotnt collected for county purposes during the next pre- 
ceding year.” Senate bill No. 307, passed by the Legislature of 
Kentucky, enables any graded school district to levy, in addition to 
the 50 cents on each $100 worth of taxable property and $1.50 on 
each poll, a tax not to exceed “25 cents on each $100 worth of tax- 
able property in the district and an additional poll tax of $1 for 
the purpose of maintaining the school and erecting and repairing 
buildings.” A 1916 act of the Legislature of Mississippi (ch. 195) 
permits any rural school district to levy a tax for the purpose of sup- 
plementing the salary of the teacher or extending the school term. 
Under the old law, only districts containing at least 12 square miles 
could make such a levy. Act No. 482 of the Legislature of South 
Carolina provides that one-half of the proceeds of fees derived from 
hunters’ licenses shall be appropriated to schools, except in three 
counties named in the act. A Maryland act of 1916 (ch. 377) repeals 
numerous joint resolutions and acts of previous legislatures, “the 
same being designed to repeal all continuing appropriations to col-
-P-A-G-E-51

leges, academies, and schools included in what is commonly known 
as the ‘academic fund.’ ” 
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATIVE UNITS. 
Mention has already been made of changes in county administra- 
tion in Maryland and Louisiana. Other than these, enactments rela- 
tive to the smaller administrative units were not very significant, 
but a few acts of other legislatures are of sufficient importance to 
warrant notice here. In Kentucky, House bill No. 92, as passed, 
provides that any graded common school may cease to operate as 
such by a vote of a majority of the legal voters of the graded school 
district; it is required that this vote be taken in the same manner 
as when the school was established. An act of New Jersey (ch. 230) 
provides that when two or more municipalities are consolidated into 
a single city the boards of education of such municipalities shall hold 
office until the following February, at which time the board ap- 
pointed by the mayor shall take charge of the schools, and the school 
districts. shall be merged into one. The Legislature of Mississippi 
(ch. 186) amended generally the law of that State relating to sepa- 
rate school districts. The new law provides for two kinds of separate 
districts, municipal and rural, and for tax levies, bond issues, the 
election and duties of trustees therein, and the transportation of 
pupils into separate districts. Any municipality or any unincor- 
porated territory of not less than 16 square miles may, on petition of 
a majority of the qualified electors thereof, be organized into a sepa- 
rate school district. Petition is made to the mayor and board of 
aldermen in the case of a municipality, and to the county school board 
in the case of unincorporated territory. Provision is made for the 
annexation of rural territory to a municipality for school purposes, 
also for the consolidation of two or more municipal separate districts. 
A separate district is to be under the control of a board of five trus- 
tees chosen by the mayor and aldermen in a municipality and by the 
county superintendent in a rural community, but such superintendent 
must be governed by the wishes of a majority of the qualified electors 
of the district. 
The consolidation of rural school districts for the purpose of estab- 
lishing graded or other more efficient schools is a subject which is 
constantly before legislatures. Chapter 180 of the acts of Mississippi 
provides that when the county school board consolidates two or more 
districts transportation for pupils may be provided at public expense. 
On petition of a majority of the qualified voters of a consolidated 
district containing not less than 25 square miles, a tax may be levied 
in such district for the support of schools. A significant feature of 
this act is the provision for teachers’ cottages, consolidated districts 
being authorized to levy taxes for this purpose. The new “ general
-P-A-G-E-52
  
  24 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
education bill” which passed the Legislature of Louisiana authorizes 
the parish (county) school board to divide the parish into districts, 
to consolidate districts, and to provide transportation for children 
residing more than two miles from school. The new school code of 
Maryland (ch. 506) confers similar powers upon county boards of 
-education in that State. 
COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
-It was pointed out in Chapter I of the Annual Report of the 
Commissioner of Education for 1915 that compulsory attendance 
laws were at that time found on the statute books of every State 
except two—Georgia and Mississippi. Efforts were made to secure 
the enactment of attendance laws in both of these States in 1916, 
and in the former the effort was successful. The new law of Georgia, 
in brief, requires the attendance of every child between 8 and 14 
years of age for four months each year. Exemptions from this 
requirement apply to those who have completed the fourth grade of 
school work; those upon whom needy members of the family are 
dependent for support; those whose parents or guardians are unable 
to provide the necessary books and clothing, unless the same are 
otherwise provided; those whose services are needed for farm emer- 
gencies; those who are mentally or physically incapable; and those 
who reside more than 3 miles from school. Boards of education of 
counties and of cities and towns are intrusted with the enforcement 
of the law in their respective jurisdictions. 
Louisiana, which already had attendance laws applying to New 
Orleans and to other cities of 25,000 population or more, made re- 
quired attendance State-wide in extent by its act of 1916. Now 
every child between the ages of 7 and 14 who has not completed the 
work of the seventh grade must attend school 140 days each year, 
unless the school session is for a shorter period. The following are 
exempted from the operation of the act: Children who are mentally 
or physically deficient; those who have completed the elementary 
grades; those who reside more than 24 miles from a school of suit- 
able grade, unless transportation is furnished; those for whom 
adequate school facilities have not been provided; those whose 
services are needed to support widowed mothers. The enforcement 
of the act is intrusted to parish boards and superintendents. An 
effort was likewise made in Virginia to make State-wide the appli- 
cation of attendance requirements, but the bill was defeated in the 
upper house of the legislature after having passed the lower house. 
In Maryland the school board of the city of Baltimore is re- 
quired under the new school code to appoint one chief attendance 
officer and not exceeding 18 assistants; in the counties, the county
-P-A-G-E-53
  = EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1916, 25 
board of education must appoint at least one such officer. Every 
child between 7 and 13 years of age must attend some public school 
for the entire period during which the schools are in session. The 
following exemptions are made: (1) Children receiving instruction 
elsewhere in studies usually taught in the public schools; (2) chil- 
dren excused by the superintendent or principal for “necessary and 
legal absence;” (8) children whose mental or physical condition is 
such as to render instruction inexpedient or impracticable. Every 
child of 13 or 14 years of age must attend school for at least 100 
days in the year, and must attend for the entire term, if not lawfully 
employed. Every child 15 or 16 years of age must attend 100 days, 
unless he or she has completed the work of the elementary grades. 
In order to facilitate the enforcement of its attendance law, Massa- 
chusetts provided in 1916 for the registration of minors. City and 
town school committees are required under the new law (ch. 102) 
to ascertain the name, age, and other essential facts respecting every 
child between 5 and 7, between 7 and 14, and between 14 and 16 years 
of age, and respecting minors over 16 years of age who can not read 
and write. A card giving these data must be kept for every child 
or minor.- The attendance officer is required to examine these cards 
and see that children attend school as required by law. Supervisory 
officers of private schools must within 30 days report the enrollment 
of children of compulsory attendance age, and when any child with- 
draws from school must report the same within 10 days. 
TEACHERS’ CERTIFICATES. - 
The tendency constantly to demand higher qualifications of those 
who aspire to teach shows no abatement. About one-half of the. 
States whose legislatures met in 1916 amended their laws relating to 
teachers’ certificates. The Legislature of New Jersey added to the 
State board of examiners one assistant State commissioner of edu- 
cation. In addition to that officer, the board is now composed of the 
State commissioner, the principals of State normal schools, one 
county superintendent, and one city superintendent of schools. The 
board is authorized to examine teachers, grant State certificates, and 
revoke the same under rules prescribed by the State board of educa- 
tion. 
The 1916 act of Kentucky amended its law relating to State normal 
schools so that the elementary certificate shall hereafter be granted 
upon not less than one year’s normal-school work. For the inter- 
mediate certificate two years’ work is required and for the advanced 
certificate three years’ work. 
Mississippi in 1916 followed the example of several other States 
in accrediting the work of normal schools and standard colleges and 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
    26 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
universities which offer prescribed or approved courses in teacher 
training. Chapter 181 of the acts of the legislature of that State 
contains the following provisions: (1) That graduates of the State 
institutions: of standard grade and of other colleges approved by 
the State board of examiners may obtain professional licenses with- 
out examination if such graduates have completed at least “nine hours 
of college work” in professional training for teachers; (2) that the 
State board of examiners may accept a teacher’s credentials issued in 
another State and issue thereon a first-grade license if the quali- 
fications of the applicant are shown to be at least equal to those re- 
quired for the first-grade license in Mississippi; (3) that first and 
second grade licenses may be renewed for one year upon the holder’s 
taking an approved course of study for six weeks. Another act of 
the Legislature of Mississippi raises the requirements of holders of 
teachers’ licenses. Beginning September, 1917, the theory and prac- 
tice of teaching and elementary algebra will be added to the subjects 
in which applicants for first-grade licenses must be examined; after 
September, 1918, advanced English, modern history, and general 
science will be added. 
Maryland, in its new school code, amended generally its law relat- 
ing to the certification of teachers. The law now provides for the 
following certificates and fixes the qualifications of their respective 
holders: (1) A certificate in administration and supervision, (2) a 
certificate in elementary school supervision, (3) a certificate in super- 
vision of special subjects, (4) a high-school principal’s certificate, (5) 
a high-school teacher’s certificate, (6) a high-school teacher’s cer- 
tificate in special subjects, (7) an elementary-school principal’s cer- 
tificate, (8) an elementary-school teacher’s certificate (first grade), 
(9) the same (second grade), (10) the same (third grade), and_(11) 
an emergency certificate issued by the county superintendent of 
schools. Less radical changes were made in the new law of Louisiana. 
There the most important new provision was embodied in the “ gen- 
eral education bill” and provided for the certification without ex- 
amination of graduates of approved normal schools and colleges. 
TEXTBOOKS, 
The chief emphasis in textbook legislation in 1916 was on the 
furnishing of books free to public-school pupils. Maryland, Virginia, 
Georgia, and Mississippi enacted laws providing for free textbooks. 
In Maryland books were already furnished free, but the new law 
added “supplementary readers, materials of instruction, stationery, 
and school supplies” to the materials that are to be supplied free of 
cost to pupils. The new law of Virginia authorizes district school 
boards to provide free textbooks for all pupils in the public schools.
-P-A-G-E-55
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1916, 27 
On petition of 25 per cent of the qualified electors of a school district, 
the question of furnishing books free must be submitted to an elec- 
tion, and if a majority of the votes cast are “for free textbooks,” it 
becomes the duty of the county board of supervisors to levy a tax in 
the district to pay for the necessary books. The Legislature of 
Georgia passed— 
An act to authorize boards of education of counties, cities, local school sys- 
tems, separate school districts, and district agricultural schools to adopt school 
books, other than the regular basal elementary school books provided for by 
the uniform textbook law, from an approved list issued by the State board of 
education, and to purchase all school books and sell, rent, or furnish them free 
to pupils; to require publishers to file sample copies of all school books to be | 
sold in the State with the State superintendent of schools; to require publishers 
to sell school books to public school authorities in this State at the lowest net 
wholesale prices given anywhere in the United States; to require publishers 
to give bond to the State; to provide punishment and penalties for the violation 
of this act, and for other purposes. 
Chapter 179 of the acts of the Legislature of Mississippi extends 
the provisions of the uniform textbook law to books used in all pub- 
lic schools, including agricultural high schools, separate school dis- 
tricts, and county public schools, and authorizes local school officials 
to provide free textbooks. Adoptions are to be made by local authori- 
ties from approved lists furnished by the State department of 
education. 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Only a few acts relating to secondary education were passed in 
1916, but some of these were of considerable importance. The new 
school code of Maryland made no substantial change in that State’s 
high-school law. Maryland high schools are divided into two 
groups, according to length of course, number of teachers em- 
ployed, enrollment, industrial courses offered, and the like, and 
teacher training may be given in approved schools of the first group. 
A new Kentucky act requires graded-school districts either to main- 
tain a high school equal in rank to those required by law of county 
boards of education or to pay the tuition fees of qualified pupils in 
a standard high school. Another act of the same State provides for 
the maintenance of county high schools jointly by two or more adja- 
cent counties. 
The most noteworthy act relating to secondary education passed 
in 1916 was that of South Carolina. This act authorizes the trustees 
of any common-school district, or of an aggregation of adjoining 
districts, to establish and maintain a high school under regulations 
prescribed by the State board of education, which may provide for 
the inspection and classification of high schools. State aid is granted 
as follows: For two teachers, not exceeding $500 per annum; for  
-P-A-G-E-56
    28 ‘ EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
three teachers, not exceeding $600; for four teachers or more, not 
exceeding $700. Additional appropriations may be made for pupils 
attending from outside the district and for meritorious work in 
agriculture, manual training, and household arts. A new feature in 
the State’s high-school law is the provision for the establishment by 
the State board of education of teacher-training courses in not ex- 
ceeding five high schools. It is provided that not more than one 
such course may be established in any one county, and State aid of 
not exceeding $1,000 is granted for each approved course. Under 
the new law of Louisiana high schools must have the approval of 
the State board of education and practical industrial and agricul- 
tural training must be fostered. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Two States in 1916 enacted laws regulating the conferring of 
academic degrees by educational institutions. An act of the Legis- 
lature of New Jersey (ch. 152) prohibits— 
the conferring, by any school corporation, association, or institution of learn- 
ing conducted within the State or by any officer or member thereof, of degrees, 
based upon proficiency or learning, without the approval of the State board of 
education, except in certain cases. 
The act applies to all institutions except those which have con- 
ferred degrees within the State for 25 years or longer and those 
which are conducted under the public-school system of the State. 
In Maryland no public or private educational institution is now 
permitted to issue “ any certificate, diploma, or academic, collegiate, 
professional, or university degree without having first obtained the 
assent of the State board of education.” : 
Act No. 505 of the 1916 laws of South Carolina directs the State 
board of charities and corrections to investigate and report upon 
the— : 
financial condition of all persons, their parents, guardians, or other persons 
liable in law for the support and maintenance of such persons, who hold or 
apply for beneficiary scholarships or obtain or apply for free tuition in any of 
the State institutions for higher learning in this State. 
Legislation affecting normal schools was enacted in New Jersey 
and California. In the former provision was made for the estab- 
lishment of a State normal school at Elizabeth and for its control 
by the State board of education. The California act empowers the 
board of trustees of the San Francisco State normal school to dis- 
pose of the lands and building of that institution, to acquire a por- 
tion of the site of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, and 
to locate the normal school on the new site so acquired.

  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1916, 29 
AGRICULTURE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Reference has already been made in this chapter to the appoint- 
ment of a special commission to investigate agricultural education at 
the Massachusetts Agricultural College and to provisions for indus- 
trial and agricultural training in one or two other States. There 
remain two enactments which deserve notice here. A Massachusetts 
act (ch. 185) authorizes any city to establish and maintain schools 
for instructing families and individuals, by means of day, part-time, 
or evening classes, in gardening, fruit growing, floriculture, poultry 
keeping, animal husbandry, and other branches of agriculture and 
horticulture. These schools must have the approval of the State 
board of education. The question of establishing such a school is 
to be determined by vote of the people of the city. 
The act of South Carolina is unique in some respects. It makes 
an annual appropriation of $5,000 to be expended in consolidated 
schools doing practical classroom and field work in agriculture. It 
provides that whenever the trustees of three or more approved school 
districts raise $750 to be expended by the county board of.education 
for agricultural instruction within their limits the districts thus co- 
operating shall be entitled to $750 from the State. This fund must 
be used to pay the salary of a qualified teacher of agriculture, who 
is required to reside within the territory which he serves for 12 
months in the year. He is to be employed jointly by the several dis- 
trict boards, the county board of education, and the State superin- 
tendent of schools, and his term is to be not less than three years. 
Each cooperating school must have an enrollment of at least 75 
pupils, with an attendance of at least 40, employ three regular teach- 
ers, maintain a term of seven months, levy a local tax of at least 8 
mills on the dollar, and provide a suitable building and equipment. 
PHYSICAL TRAINING AND MILITARY DRILL. 
Here, as in the preceding section, there are two enactments other 
than those already noted which deserve mention. An act of some im- 
portance was enacted by the Legislature of Louisiana. It provides 
for instruction in military science for boys in high schools, when 
practicable, for at least one hour a week. The adjutant general of the 
State is directed to prepare a pamphlet of information on the subject, 
which is to be placed in the hands of high-school teachers who are 
competent to give such instruction. 
The most noteworthy laws enacted on the subject of military and 
physical training in the public schools were the two acts of the New 
York Legislature. The following summary of the provisions of these
-P-A-G-E-58
  80 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
  acts was prepared by the law division of the State department of edu- 
cation at Albany.* 
There are two interrelated acts: One provides for physical training and dis- 
cipline in the schools, and the other provides for military training outside of the 
schools. The first is chapter 567 of the Laws of 1916, which provides in sub- 
stance that after the first day of September, i916, all pupils above the age of 
8 years in all elementary and secondary schools shall receive as part of the pre- 
scribed courses of instruction such physical training as the regents, after con- 
ference with the military training commission, may determine during periods 
which shall average at least 20 minutes in each school day. Boards of education 
and trustees of cities and school districts are directed to provide the prescribed 
instruction in the public schools thereof under the direction of the commissioner 
of education and in accordance with the rules of the regents of the university. 
Provision is made for the employment of a teacher of physical training by two 
or more contiguous school districts and the apportionment of the salary of such 
teacher among such districts. Where competent teachers are employed by cities 
and school districts for the purpose of furnishing physical instruction as pro- 
vided in said chapter, the commissioner of education is required to apportion 
from the public moneys a sum equal to one-half the salary paid to each such 
teacher on account of instruction given in such courses but not exceeding $600 
on account of a single teacher during a school year. 
The second, chapter 566 of the Laws of 1916, which relates to military and dis- 
eiplinary training, provides for the appointment of a military training commis- 
sion which shall advise and confer with the board of regents as directed in the 
above-described act in matters relating to physical training and discipline in the 
schools. After the first day of September, 1916, all boys above the age of 16 
years and not over 19 years (except boys exempted by the commission) shall 
be given such military training as the commission may prescribe for periods ag- 
gregating not more than three hours in each week during the school or college 
year. A system of field training for boys is also provided.” 
CHILD LABOR. 
The State of Massachusetts extended the provisions of its law relat- 
ing to the employment of minors by the passage of three acts in 
1916. One of these permits the employment of women and of minors 
under 18 years of age for more than 54, but not exceeding 58, hours 
a week in establishments where the employment is by seasons, and 
empowers the State board of labor and industries to determine what 
employments are seasonal. Another act permits the employment of 
minors between 14 and 16 years of age in vacation time. A third 
permits minors between 14 and 16 years of age who are pursuing 
cooperative industrial courses to be employed for part-time by co- 
operating agencies. The 1916 amendment to the child-labor law of 
Rhode Island relates to the issuance of age and employment certifi- 
cates of minors between 14 and 16 years of age who are employed 
according to law. It has the effect of requiring that the employment

certificate be delivered to the prospective employer instead of the 
child, and of requiring the employer, when the child’s employment 
ceases, to return the certificate to the officer who issued it. As did 
Massachusetts, New Jersey enacted a law which authorized the 
issuance of employment certificates to minors over 14 years of age 
who are employed and attending part-time schools. South Carolina 
raised from 12 to 14 the minimum age at which children may be em- 
ployed in factories, mines, and textile establishments. 
The Legislature of Maryland amended that State’s child-labor law 
throughout. The law now prohibits the employment of children 
under 14 years of age in any factory, mechanical establishment, tene- 
ment house, office building, restaurant, bakery, barber shop, hotel, 
bootblack stand, public stable, garage, laundry, brick or lumber 
yard, in the construction of buildings, or as a messenger, or in 
any mercantile establishment, store, office, boarding house, place of 
amusement, or club. Children under 12 may not be employed in any 
canning or packing establishment. In the more hazardous occupa- 
tions minors employed must be over 16 years of age. Any person em- 
ployed under 16 must be provided with an employment certificate, 
which, on the termination of the child’s service, must be returned by 
the employer to the person who issued it. These certificates are of 
two kinds: A general certificate and a vacation certificate. The 
officer issuing the general certificate must have the child’s school 
record, a physician’s certificate showing child’s physical fitness, evi- 
dence that child is over 14 years of age, and a statement from the 
prospective employer showing the character of the employment con- 
templated. The minor applying for this certificate must appear in 
person before the issuing officer and show ability to read and write 
simple English sentences. The vacation certificate is to be issued 
only for the period when the schools are not in session and upon 
evidence that the child is over 14 years of age and is physically 
fit. The act also regulates “street occupations” in cities of 20,000 
population, or more. 
WIDER USE OF THE SCHOOL PLANT, 
Since the social and recreation centers in Rochester, N. Y., first 
attracted wide attention in 1907, the movement for the “wider use of 
the school plant” has spread well over the country. A number of 
States now have laws permitting schoolhouses to be used for com- 
munity purposes, and in other States school boards have the power 
to permit such use without specific authorization of the law. Three 
States enacted laws on the subject in 1916. The Legislature of Rhode 
Island authorized the school committee of the city of Providence to 
permit the use of public-school property for community purposes at 
times when such use will not interfere with the work of the schools.  
-P-A-G-E-60
32 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
  Chapter 227 of the Acts of the Legislature of New Jersey authorizes 
boards of education to permit the use of school property for athletic, 
social, civic, and recreational meetings and entertainments and for 
such other purposes as may be approved by said boards. 
Maryland in 1916 made two provisions relating to this subject. 
One of these applies to the city of Baltimore. It authorizes the 
mayor and council of the city to use public school buildings and other 
public property belonging to the city for any public purpose which 
will not materially interfere with the use of such property for its 
primary purpose. The other provision applies to the remainder of 
the State. The principal section of this provision follows: 
No schoolhouse shall be used for any other purpose than public-school pur- 
poses and school district meetings unless by consent of the county board of 
education: Provided, however, Whenever an application is made to the district 
board of school trustees, signed by 25 citizens in the school district where the 
said school is situated, requesting the use of the school building for a non- 
partisan gathering of citizens for the presentation and discussion of public ques- 
tions or for other civic, social, or recreational activities, the said school authori- 
ties shall allow the free use of such school building or grounds of same for the 
purposes enumerated above: Provided, however, Said meetings shall be held dur- 
ing those hours when the school buildings are not being used for their principal 
purpose. 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND EDUCATION. 
The most important law affecting education or child welfare which 
was enacted by the first session of the Sixty-fourth Congress was the 
Federal child-labor bill, “An act to prevent interstate commerce in 
the products of child labor, and for other purposes.” Section 1, 
which contains the main provisions of this act, reads as follows: 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That no producer, manufacturer, or 
dealer shall ship or deliver for shipment in interstate or foreign commerce any 
article or commodity the product of any mine or quarry, situated in the United 
States, in which within 30 days prior to the time of the removal of such product 
therefrom children under the age of 16 years have been employed or permitted 
to work, or any article or commodity the product of any mill, cannery, work- 
shop, factory, or manufacturing establishment, situated in the United States, 
in which within 80 days prior to the removal of such product therefrom children 
under the age of 14 years have been employed or permitted to work, or 
children between the ages of 14 years and 16 years have been employed or per- 
mitted to work more than eight hours in any day, or more than six days in 
any week, or after the hour of 7 o’clock p. m., or before the hour of 6 o’clock 
“a. m.: Provided, That a prosecution and conviction of a defendant for the ship- 
ment or delivery for shipment of any article or commodity under the conditions 
herein prohibited shall be a bar to any further prosecution against the same 
defendant for shipments or deliveries for shipment of any such article or com- 
modity before the beginning of said prosecution. 
The Attorney General, Secretary of Labor, and Secretary of Com- 
merce are constituted a board to make and publish rules and regula- 
tions for carrying out the provisions of the act. The more immediate 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  
’ 
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1916, 33 
enforcement of the act is intrusted to the Secretary of Labor, and ap- 
propriate penalties are attached. 
A few other acts of minor importance were enacted. A new law 
worthy of note is the “Act providing that Indian schools may be 
maintained without restriction as to annual rate of expenditure per 
pupil,” but the proviso that such expenditure shall not exceed $200 
is added. 
APPROPRIATIONS. 
As will be seen from the statistics given below, the specific allow- 
ances provided by the Federal Government for the advancement of 
education in 1916-17 aggregate $21,920,219.44, but the amount 
actually made available for the dissemination of knowledge is con- 
siderably in excess of this. Numerous appropriations made for 
sundry purposes contemplate the expenditure of a part for instruc- 
tion of one sort or another, and these parts, owing to the wording of 
appropriation bills, can not be segregated. For example, the cost of 
expert and scientific investigations conducted by offices of the Gov- 
ernment can not easily be separated from the expenses of adminis- 
tration. Army and Navy officers detailed to do instructional service 
of various kinds are paid from the appropriations for the pay of 
the Army andthe Navy. A more specific example is found in the Army 
appropriation bill for the current year, wherein the item “for the 
necessary furniture, textbooks, paper, and equipment for the post 
schools and libraries” is included in an allowance of $11,000,000 for 
“regular supplies, Quartermaster Corps.” It is clear that Congress 
intended to leave to the discretion of the administrative authorities 
of the War Department the determination of the amount to be ex- 
pended for “post schools,” and the sum eventually to be expended 
can not now be foretold. 
Within the limitations indicated above, the following figures will 
show for ordinary purposes what the Federal Government is doing 
for education.

CHAPTER III. 
EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 
By James H. Van SIcKLE, 
Superintendent of Schools, Springfield, Mass. 
Under the influence of the European war old problems in Ameri- 
can education are being reformulated and revitalized and new prob- 
lems are being created. Three problems that affect particularly the 
larger communities have felt its stimulus. They are— 
I. The problem of the relation of education to industrial 
efficiency. 
II. The problem of the Americanization of the immigrant. 
III. The problem of military education in the schools. 
The relation of these problems to some of the broader aspects of 
education and the attempts that have been made at their solution, 
particularly during the past year, will be the subject of some pages 
of this report. 
I, THE PROBLEM OF THE RELATION OF EDUCATION TO INDUSTRIAL EFFI- 
CIENCY. 
EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY. 
The close relation between education and industrial efficiency and 
the resultant relation between industrial efficiency and prepared- 
ness, both economic and military, have been clearly established by 
the experience of the warring powers of Europe. Hence the agitation 
for “ educational preparedness.” in America has taken on new pro- 
portions, not only among educators, but among all thoughtful people. 
Admiration for the industrial efficiency shown by some of the bel- 
ligerents has made for the keenest analyses of American industrial 
efficiency—analyses not only of industrial efficiency for the solution 
of the Nation’s problems when its economic rivals are at war, but 
analyses of potential industrial efficiency in the eventuality of war 
itself, and finally, analyses of potential industrial efficiency for com- 
petition with an industrialized Europe after the war.

  40 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION AND DEMOCRACY, 
The need for greater industrial efficiency in America is apparent 
and educators generally recognize it. But the problem involved in 
providing an education that shall make for greater industrial effi- 
ciency seems, in the opinion of many educators, to touch the political 
principles on which American society rests. American educators 
realize, though not always sufliciently, that the industrial efficiency 
of Europe has, to some extent at least, been the outgrowth of an 
educational policy of an aristocratic character, and that through this 
policy the manual and industrial pursuits have been consigned to a 
laboring class which is fived, or almost so. To superimpose on 
American education a European educational system thus conceived, 
with its differentiation of the common schools and its caste distinc- 
tions, would do violence to the tenets of a democracy. 
THE PROBLEM OF READJUSTMENT. 
The readjustment of education to meet the industrial needs of 
the time must insure the conservation of democratic principles. The 
resultant education must not foster and strengthen class distinction, 
and must not close the door of equal educational opportunity. The 
problem involved in this readjustment is firmly and inevitably linked 
up with the larger problem of the relation of education to all the 
needs of America. Its discussion has been animated, and educators 
are far from being of one mind as to its best solution. The problem 
to be solved may be stated thus: 
How may a unified, public-school education be maintained that 
shall be for all, without distinction of classes; that shall provide for 
the needs of the great majority from which the industrial workers 
are drawn, as well as for the small minority who prepare for higher 
academic work; and that shall do all this, at the same time conserving 
equal opportunity for all and predestining the social class of none? 
THE RELATION OF THE TRADITIONAL AND THE PREVOCATIONAL SCHOOLS TO THIS 
PROBLEM. 
The traditional school, its critics argue, has failed lamentably to 
meet the requirements of an industrial age. It is, to be sure, main- 
taining a unified education, but only by refusing to recognize the 
wants and needs of that 90 per cent and more who do not finish the 
high school and continue to more advanced work. It has thus, con- 
sciously or unconsciously, made for class distinction by legislating a 
curriculum for one class. The defender of the traditional school 
admits that industrial education per se plays no part in his curricu- 
lum, but he is convinced that a curriculum composed of what he 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 41 
terms “fundamental subjects” is the best background for American 
society, even as at present constituted. He holds that formal dis- 
cipline still exists, in spite of the researches of many psychologists, 
and he protests against the supplanting of a fundamental course 
by this or that prevocational or vocational course. He argues, fur- 
ther, that, although his curriculum does not include prevocational 
or vocational courses in the narrower sense, it ought not to be con- 
demned as undemocratic, for by establishing a common background 
for all students it must surely make for democracy, and, besides, it 
offers the freest opportunity for the highest intellectual development 
of any child, regardless of the social class from which it springs. 
. The proponents of the Gary system claim for their schools the 
solution of the problem. Their educational system is unified in 
character, yet it ministers to the wants of the whole cummunity. 
The industrial class, so long neglected educationally, is now given 
the share in education that belongs to it by virtue of its numerical 
strength and economic importance in the community, while the one- 
tenth that continues through the high schools in the more academic 
work is not neglected. It breaks down class distinction and en- 
genders social sympathy. The critics of the Gary plan are loathe 
to concede all these claims. They fear that the Gary plan fails to 
some extent in its purpose of democratizing education. They assert 
that surrounding the children of the laboring class with industrial 
laboratories will but inevitably commit them to industrial pursuits 
and shut them off from high attainment in the professions and 
other intellectual pursuits, even though they possess the talent and 
mentality for such careers. Then, too, the critics of this system are 
jealously concerned with the preparation of the small minority that 
goes to high school and college. They question whether the time 
spent in prevocational work of an industrial character is not spent 
at the sacrifice of the subjects that they consider fundamental to 
advanced academic work. They profess allegiance to democratic 
principles, but they contend that the civilization of a democracy will 
be measured not only by the general intelligence and material hap- 
piness of its mass, but also by the outstanding achievements of its 
intellectual leaders. They ask, therefore, that before a plan such as 
the Gary plan—which demands the supplanting of the current sys- 
tem of education—be put in general adoption it be thoroughly tested 
on such mooted points. 
A prevocational plan that provides for a junior high school, or 
differentiation in the last two grammar grades, is advanced by many 
as best meeting the objections of the critics of the traditional system 
and the Gary system. It provides for six years of work of a funda- 
mental character for all students, and two or three years of either’
-P-A-G-E-70
  
  42 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
prevocational training of a rather intensive character, or two or three 
years of additional work in the “academic” fundamentals. It has 
been violently attacked, not the less violently because it is the middle- 
of-the-road course. Six years, the conservative educator argues, is 
not enough for the fundamentals or for a common, and hence demo- 
cratizing, educational background. The advocate of the Gary plan 
argues that by segregating pupils after six years into two distinct 
divisions the junior high school makes for class distinction, and that 
democratic principles demand that its rapid spread be curbed. 
Such are some of the problems involved in the question of the 
relation of industrial education to a democracy. When the advocates 
of the three types of schools criticize the other two for a failure to 
adhere to democratic principles, it is certain that every attempt will 
be made to preserve democratic ideals; but it is none the less certain 
that there must be a scientific evaluation of the systems with respect 
to their relation to a democracy, as well as with respect to the more 
concrete and tangible phenomena that they present. 
EVALUATION OF THE PREVOCATIONAL SCHOOLS (GARY AND ETTINGER) IN NEW 
YORK CITY. 
The first attempt at an evaluation of the prevocational schools in 
New York City is contained in a report of the Gary and Ettinger 
schools made by Mr. B. R. Buckingham, chief statistician of the 
board of education, in the year 1915 and published in 1916. The in- 
terest that it aroused both in New York and throughout the country. 
has made it apparently one of the outstanding educational events of 
the year. The publicity given to it has stimulated anew agitated dis- 
cussion as to the merits of the newer systems. 
The report gives the results of examinations conducted in March 
and in June, 1915, in two Gary, six Ettinger schools (schools with 
differentiation in last two grammar grades as described on p. 41 
above), and eight traditional schools in certain fundamental sub- 
jects—arithmetic, spelling, geography, history, English grammar. 
The object of the test and its results may be quoted from the letter 
of transmittal of Mr. Maxwell to the board of education, accompany- 
ing the Buckingham survey: 
The design of these tests was to determine how results in those studies which 
all thinking people agree should form the chief field of elementary education 
compare in the three types of elementary schools—the traditional type, the 
Ettinger type, and the Gary type. The schools of the traditional type were 
selected each because it has a pupil population as nearly as possible similar to 
that in one of the two other classes of schools. 
Two examinations, separated by an interval of three months and with ques- 
tions as nearly equivalent as possible, were given, in order that the test should 
be not only one of acquired knowledge but also one of progress.
-P-A-G-E-71
  
EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 43 
The results show that, of the three types, the traditional schools made the 
best showing, the “ prevocational” schools stood second, and the Gary schools 
stood third. 
While I would be the last to claim that this test is final or that it renders 
an effective decision against the Gary system for this city, it is fair to say 
that it raises a strong presumption against the general introduction of the 
Gary system into this city. The conclusion obviously is that neither the Gary 
system nor the “ prevocational” system should be further extended until the 
schools in which they are being tried make a better exhibition of efficiency. 
(Seventeenth An. Rep. of City Supt. of Schools, New York City; Survey of 
the Gary and Prevocational Schools. ) 
In his Seventeenth Annual Report Mr. Maxwell declares: 
One pupil out of every four or. five pupils in our elementary schools is al- 
ready in a class which uses a room with another class. That is, two classes 
occupy one room at different times on the same day. As the use of each class- 
room at different hours on the same day is the central principle of the Gary 
plan, it follows that the relief afforded in the accommodation of pupils by the 
generai introduction of the Gary plan would be much less than has been 
acsenied, 7.2%) -* 
The claim made before the board of estimate and apportionment that the 
general introduction of the Gary plan of school administration would greatly 
reduce the cost of operating schools is a mere figment of the imagination. This 
claim, which is the basis of the defense of that board’s action in cutting down 
the budget of the board of education for 1916, thereby causing the cessation of 
many of our most beneficent activities and depriving several hundred teachers 
of inereases in salary to which théy are entitled by law and justice, should 
not be heard again. The Gary system undoubtedly contains features which 
should be adopted as proof of their validity is forthcoming and as the neces- 
sary funds are provided. The presentation of claims on its behalf that this 
survey shows to be utterly baseless, however, has wrought great injury to our 
schools and to our people, because these claims have made it possible for the 
board of estimate and apportionment to reduce the educational budget below 
the amount at which many useful and necessary activities can be maintained. 
THE REPLY OF THE ADVOCATES OF THE PREVOCATIONAL SCHOOLS TO THE BUCKING- 
HAM REPORT. 
The Buckingham report immediately evoked lively interest and 
keen opposition. The proponents of the Gary school were quick to 
discover the vulnerable spots in it, and after examination they ar- 
rived at the conclusion that the Buckingham tests failed in the three 
essentials of scientific inquiry: (1) “An accufate conception of 
exactly what is being examined; (2) a thorough appreciation of the 
conditions under which such an inquiry can be fairly conducted; and 
(3) a careful and just appraisal of the data collected.” 
This conclusion is based on criticisms of the report such as the 
following: 
To assume that, after six or more years of educational experience, progress 
in general ability during a period of three months results solely from the train- 
ing received during that period would seem, on its face, fallacious. Yet that
-P-A-G-E-72
  44 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
  is exactly what Dr. Buckingham has done. Public School 45, The Bronx, was a 
traditional school up to within three weeks of the first test in March, and was 
still in process of readjustment during that period immediately following, in 
which the growth in ability due to the Gary plan was supposed miraculously 
to take place. Public School 89, Brooklyn, was also a traditional school up to 
within four months of the March test and was likewise undergoing readjust- 
ment. Both schools, also, had suffered far more acutely from part time before 
reorganization than any of the other 14 schools tested. It would therefore 
seem that what Dr. Buckingham was really testing was not the Gary plan at 
all, but simply two schools which had been operating for six or seven years 
under the traditional New York program and under extremely congested 
conditions. 
Furthermore, it is contended that the Gary schools were handi- 
capped by a lack of physical equipment regarded as essential to their 
favorable operation, that the organization was necessarily imperfect, 
that the stream of visitors in the classroom and about the building 
was distracting, and that “it would, therefore, seem that these tests 
were not only extremely inopportune, but, as an evidence of undue 
haste in attempting to ‘evaluate’ the Gary schools, were scientifically 
indefensible.” 
Not the least serious count in the indictment of the Buckingham 
report is the calling into question of the statistical method employed. 
[Dr. Buckingham] compared the average results of only two Gary schools 
with the average results of six Ettinger and eight traditional schools. It is 
obvious that in this way the difficulties of a particular Gary school would exert 
a far greater weight than would similar difficulties in a school in either of 
the other groups, where there were enough instances to counterbalance poor 
results in any particular case. This made it possible for Public School 45, 
the larger of the two Gary schools, which showed poorer results in the tests, 
to more than offset the excellent results of Public School 89, the smaller of the 
two, and thus lessen materially the average for the Gary schools. 
The interpretations of the statistics contained in the report by the 
advocates of the Gary schools are— 
that the Gary schools, in spite of tremendous odds, make an exceptional show- 
ing; that Public School 45 excels its companion school in all subjects and all 
grades except one; that Public School 89 excels all other Brooklyn schools 
tested, and that the Buckingham tests are gratifying to the supporters of the 
Gary plan. 
A review of the’evidence in the case will modify radically the in- 
terpretation of some of the findings of the Buckingham report; it 
will emphasize the inconclusiveness of much of the data found, and 
will hold the whole matter in abeyance pending other evaluations 
scientifically undertaken and corrected by just criticism 2, 4, 10, 20, 
and 30 years after the introduction of the new schools. It will give 
careful consideration to the administrative and financial difficulties 
involved in the introduction and adaptation of such schools to New
-P-A-G-E-73

Yor as published from time to time by the superintendent of schools 
of New York City, and it will not confuse the issue by identifying 
for all purposes the question of the Gary schools in Gary with that 
of the Gary schools in New York. 
In the meantime one can only deplore the fact that the ‘whole pre- 
vocational question in New York City has become a matter not alone 
of educational, but of political propaganda. The further increase 
of the Gary schools by the city administration over the recommen- 
dation of the city superintendent, the heated controversies of the 
advocates of the Ettinger schools and the Gary schools, and the 
injudicious attacks of the proponents of the Gary schools on the 
traditional schools can only serve to aggravate the difficulties inherent 
in a great educational problem, a problem that calls as never before 
for scientific investigation and deliberate prog-ession. 
Il. THE PROBLEM OF THE AMERICANIZATION OF THE IMMIGRANT. 
Under the influence of considerations arising from the European 
war the attention of educators has been directed with insistence to 
the problem of Americanizing the immigrant. For years this prob- 
lem has constituted one of the major problems of American life, and 
in its solution the public schools have always been regarded as the 
most effective agency. The welding together of foreign elements of 
the population has gone on in the schools, and little or no special at- 
tention has been given to the formation of modes of procedure that 
would tend to accelerate the process. Wherever attempts have been 
made through local political legislation to deal with particular as- 
pects of the problem (Bennett law in Wisconsin) the process, in- 
stead of being accelerated, has only been retarded. Measures to 
Americanize of a coercive character, real or imagined, are fraught 
with difficulty. In the opinion of American educators, the most ef- 
fective agency in the process will continue to be the public day- 
school system, with the quiet, effective means at its disposal. 
The problem, however, is one that the public school system can 
not solve with its day schools alone. What of the thousands of immi- 
grants who have passed the school age? The ever-increasing num- 
ber of immigrants from countries with both language and customs 
different from our own urges the serious study of the problem of 
Americanizing them. With a realization of the necessity of calling 
the attention of educators to this problem, the Bureau of Educa- 
tion has prepared a report on the evening school expenditures of the 
leading American cities. *

-P-A-G-E-75

consideration has been given the problem of Americanizing the for- 
eigner in the formation of evening-school budgets?” 
TI. MILITARY TRAINING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.* 
The proposal to introduce military training into the public schools 
of America is the most startling of the effects of the European war 
on American educational problems. But three years ago the mere 
mention of a plan so revolutionary would have evoked general ridi- 
cule. To-day it forms part of the program of preparedness of many 
men in public life and of not a few educators. Its advocates urge 
its general adoption on the ground that it is essential to an adequate 
military preparedness. They contend that the physical education 
in the schools is ill-adapted to that purpose. They are convinced 
that the physical and moral effect of military training on the pupils 
sufficiently justifies its introduction, apart from the question of a 
trained citizen soldiery. Finally, they see as its results a stimulus 
for patriotism and democracy and a deeper realization on the part 
of the pupil of the responsibilities of citizenship, which include as 
a civic duty the responsibility of the defense of his country. 
The agitation has resulted in State legislation providing for mili- 
tary education in New York; it has resulted in reshaping the 
1915 attitude of the National Education Association—so unalterably 
opposed to every suggestion—in a resolution of 1916 that is commonly 
interpreted as a compromise, and there can be no doubt that the 
whole question will be up for discussion in educational circles for 
the next few years. 
It is essential that a matter so revolutionary in American educa- 
tion be dealt with without emction, in so far as that is possible. It is 
a problem fraught with dangers to vital interests of American life, 
and it needs to be detached from narrow political considerations and 
the shibboleths of a day. 
Touching, as it does, all the school population of a certain age, 
its relation to the question of preparedness is wholly different from 
that, for example, of the size of a standing army. Since this school 
military training is to be compulsory for all, its relation to war 
_ emphasizes particularly its relation to the problem of peace. What, 
the opponents of the proposal ask, is to be said of such a plan as 
a preparation for peace, when it is too militaristic to be included in 
the military schemes of militaristic Europe? What guarantee of 
peace resides in introducing military drill as a curricular necessity 
for the youth of the land and thus developing military habits of 
mind? Thus the pacifists argue.   
1 See also Ch. XIX, Hducational Hygiene. Table 24, in Vol. II, Ch. VIII of this report, 
gives statistics of military training in high schools, 1915. 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-76
    48 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
Others, who do not call themselves pacifists, oppose its introduc- 
tion on many grounds. They point to the fact that it is not in vogue 
in militaristic Europe, and that its military value must be negligible 
or very questionable. At any rate, they say, it should be the last, not 
the first, resort in a policy of preparedness. They point to the 
experience of high schools in support of their contention that such 
training does not adequately prepare. They are convinced that im- 
posing anything as revolutionary as compulsory military education 
on schools and communities that are opposed to it might be sub- 
versive of the very end of the education proposed, and work untold 
harm to the general cause of education. They prophesy a speedy 
revelation of the futility of the Slater-Welsh laws in New York 
State. 
They find themselves in accord with the demand for greater physi- 
cal training proposed by the advocates of military training, and they 
see in the more general recognition of that need one of the tangible 
and splendid results aroused by the discussion of the problem. They 
ask for a reform of athletics, a raising of the standards, and a digni- 
fying of the status and functions of directors of physical education. 
They are willing, too, to introduce some of the commendable fea- 
tures of the Boy Scout movement, and they agree with Dr. Dudley 
Sargent when he closes his opposition to military drill in public 
schools with the words: “ What America most needs is some way of 
giving those physical advantages to the masses which she now lavishes 
on the favored few.” 
FUNCTIONS OF SCHOOLS BOARDS. 
President Dwight’s “Travels in New England” informs us that 
in the year 1800 the Boston schools were visited and regulated by a 
committee of 21 gentlemen, annually chosen, and invested with ample 
powers for the purpose of their commission. It was the duty of 
these gentlemen— 
to visit these schools once in three months; to examine the scholars in the 
various branches in which they are taught; to devise the best methods for the in- 
struction and government of the schools; to give such advice to the masters as 
they shall judge expedient ; and by all proper means to excite in the children a 
laudable ambition to excel in virtuous, amiable deportment, and in every branch 
of useful knowledge. = 
Such were the duties of the board of education of that day. It isa 
far cry from this early procedure to present-day theory and even 
present-day practice. 
A good statement of present-day theory of the functions of a school 
board was given in July at the meeting of the department of school 
administration of the National Education Association in New York 
City. A member of the Newark (N. J.) Board of Education stated 
the function of a board thus:
-P-A-G-E-77
    EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 49 
Members of a board of education are directors of a large corporation and 
should apply the principles of good corporation management to educational 
affairs. Their executive officers should have authority and be held accountable 
for results. 
A board should supply funds, supervise expenditures, and determine the 
general policy and the extension of the system. 
Its duty is to see that the schools are properly managed, and not to manage 
them itself. 
It is not appointed to build buildings, but to see that they are built. 
It is not appointed to supervise teachers, but to see that they are supervised. 
In short, it is appointed, not to do the work itself, but to get it done. 
As running a school system is an expert business, directed to one end, the 
education of children, it should be managed in all its aspects by an expert 
manager, and that manager «ould be an educator. 
The following diagram represents these relationships:

  50 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
Few cities have their schools administered strictly upon this plane, 
yet the tendency is definitely in that direction. The plan recently 
put in operation in Minneapolis, if diagrammed, would be seen to 
bear a close resemblance to the standard here shown. 
When it is considered how frequently the personnel of city school 
boards changes, it is easy to understand why a steady policy need not 
be expected. In his report on the schools of Brockton, Mass., Supt. 
Farley calls attention to the fact that of the 9 members of the board 
whom he met as a candidate five years before, only 2 are still serv- 
ing, and that within this short periol 18 different members have 
served. This is by no means an unusual example. 
Changes among superintendents, too, are frequent. Under such 
unstable conditions, both in board membership and in supervisory 
officers, it is not difficult to see why cities have their “ ups and downs” 
in school administration. 
The abundant literature on the subject of school administration 
available for the information of board members, through the depart- 
ment of school administration of the National Education Association 
and the numerous school surveys of recent years, is doing much to 
enlighten new board members as to their duties and responsibilities. 
Standards are gradually getting established in the public mind which 
soon suggest to the board member who displays a tendency toward 
taking over that direct personal management of professional details, 
appropriate enough in President Dwight’s day, that he is not ex- 
pected to assume the réle of an expert in dealing with the highly 
intricate problems presented by the schools of a modern city. The 
fact that practically all the school surveys have found cause to deal 
with this phase of the school situation shows that American cities 
have yet a long way to go before they get the management of their 
schools fixed securely and permanently upon a professional basis. 
For example, the study of the administration and costs of the Bos- 
ton schools made this year under the auspices of the finance commis- 
sion contains this paragraph: 
The school committee may properly be considered as exercising the responsi- 
bility of a board of directors responsible to their constituency, the citizens of 
Boston. They must pass upon all matters which have to do with the main- 
tenance and development of the public school system. As laymen they can not 
to advantage, and should not therefore, attempt to administer the school sys- 
tem. Efficiency in administration demands that they choose a superintendent 
of schools as their chief executive officer, who should, by rule of the school 
committee, and the exercise of his own judgment, delegate to other executive 
officers those duties which could best be performed by them. All other execu- 
tives should report to the board of education through him, except in cases of 
an appeal from the decision of the superintendent, when the subordinate execu- 
tive, or any other employee, should carry his case before the school committee. 
Under this arrangement, all questions of policy for the schools not determined  
-P-A-G-E-79
  
EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 51 
by rule or regulation of the school committee, and not of sufficient significance 
to be brought before them for decision, should be decided by the superintendent 
and reported to the committee. 
THE SELECTION OF TEXTBOOKS, 
In no department of school work is expert judgment more impor- 
tant than in the selection of textbooks, yet in this field cities here and 
there are often hindered from securing the best books that the market 
affords by the failure of boards of education to recognize their own 
lack of the qualifications for the task of selection. The State super- 
intendents of the five New England States have sent a joint com- 
munication to the leading publishing houses protesting against the 
unprofessional activity which the agents of a few of them indulge 
in to get school boards to adopt and purchase books and apparatus 
which the superintendent does not need or which he considers not 
the best for carrying out his plans. The topics covered by the memo- 
randum include intimidation of superintendents, principals, and 
teachers, corruption and interference with properly constituted local 
school officers. 
The memorandum assumes that in most cases the responsible heads 
of the various houses are unaware of these practices, and that the 
objectionable practices are limited to the representatives of compar- 
tively few houses. 
A city which is the home of a single publishing house is likely in 
purchasing textbooks for its schools to encounter the plea that it -is 
the duty of the school board to encourage home industry by exclusive 
use of the books of the local concern. In December last in the public 
press of Cincinnati, Ohio, such a situation was portrayed. The end 
of a five-year period was approaching and a new adoption was to be 
made. It was a question whether the books of the local concern 
should, as heretofore, be adopted, largely to the exclusion from con- 
sideration of books published by houses located elsewhere, or whether 
the best books should be selected without regard to the claims of 
“home industry.” Supt. Condon adopted the motto “ children first,” 
and announced the following policy for the adoption of textbooks 
for the city: 
I believe this should be the established order for the adoption of all books: 
First, that the books to be used in any department or subject should have the 
careful consideration of the teachers directly concerned with such use; that 
this examination should be deliberately made, taking into account all desirable 
books which may be available; that the conclusions reached should be trans- 
mitted to the superintendent in the form of a written report, either as the 
unanimous or as a majority and minority report of the teachers who have con- 
sidered the matter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  52 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
Second, That the superintendent should carefully consider these recommenda- 
tions, transmitting the same to the board of education, and stating in writing 
whether he agrees or disagrees, and if the latter, why. : 
Third, That, as required by statute, the board should make the formal adop- 
tion. No book should be adopted, however, that has not been considered by both 
teachers and the superintendent; the board may not agree with the recommen- 
dation by the superintendent that has not had the consideration of the teachers. 
In the selection of textbooks, as in the appointment of teachers, the question 
to be answered is the question of merit. I believe the method of selection which 
I have proposed is well calculated to determine the question. It recognizes 
the right of teachers to say what books they would like to have with which to 
do their work; it corrects the individual point of view by having a representa- 
tive committee pass upon the subject; it gives the superintendent the right to 
review and the opportunity for approval or disapproval; it gives the board of 
edueation the right to'review the recommendations of both teachers and the 
superintendent. The superintendent may not agree with the recommendations 
of the teachers; the board may disagree with the recommendations of both; 
but neither the superintendent nor the board should act until the subject has 
first been considered by the teachers. 
The board having approved Supt. Condon’s plan, committees of 
teachers were formed and several months were spent by these com- 
mittees in examining all available texts. Teachers, principals, super- 
intendents, and all were cordially disposed to recommend the books 
of the local company, whenever other things were equal as between 
these books and the books of other publishers. Written reports were 
sent to the superintendent, and late in June, on the basis of these 
reports, but on his own responsibility, the superintendent made his 
recommendations to the board. In spite of active and even bitter 
outside opposition, his report was adopted without modification. 
Thus a definite policy, based wholly on the interests of the children 
of the schools, backed by the superintendent with courage and with- 
out shifting of responsibility, won decisively in a situation about as 
difficult as can be imagined. 
THE BAYONNE CASE, 
Early last fall Dr. John W. Carr, superintendent of schools in 
Bayonne, N. J., made public information in his possession to the 
effect that certain members of the board of education of his city, a 
majority, including the president of the board, had entered into 
collusion to carry through certain measures involving an improper 
use of public funds. The board preferred charges against the 
superintendent and removed him. The superintendent appealed 
to the State commissioner of education, on the ground that he was 
dismissed without cause before the termination of his contract. The 
assistant commissioner of education, by whom Supt. Carr’s appeal 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 53 
was heard, conceded that no cause had been shown, but upheld the 
board’s action on the ground that it was not necessary to show cause. 
A final appeal to the State board of education, and then to the 
supreme court of New Jersey, resulted in the restoration of the salary 
of which the superintendent had been deprived pending the final 
_ settlement of the case. Meanwhile, February 7, 1916, Supt. Carr had 
been elected to another position and had accepted. The report of the 
reviewing tribunal, which wag the advisory committee of the State 
board of education, declared :+ 
Was the discharge of Mr. Carr without cause? The reasons for his discharge 
are fully set forth in the record—in fact, a trial was held. The commissioner 
has found that there was no just reason for the discharge. We agree with such 
conclusion. We have read all the testimony, and its reading leads us irresisti- 
bly to the conclusions that the action of the board of education of the city of 
Bayonne was the result of prejudice and not of disinterested judgment. 
‘We recommend, therefore, that it be adjudged that the removal of Mr. Carr 
as superintendent of schools was in violation of the terms of his contract and 
therefore unlawful, and that the decision of the commissioner of education, in 
so far as it declares such dismissal legal, be reversed. 
SPECIAL BUREAUS AND DEPARTMENTS, 
Several cities maintaining special bureaus are making notable 
contributions to educational progress by furnishing in their annual 
reports detailed descriptions of the investigations which have been 
conducted by their experts in charge. The conclusions reached 
through these investigations can not fail to have significance wherever 
the reports are studied. They seem likely to be far-reaching in their 
influence. Among the reports available, those of Boston, Detroit, 
Des Moines, Kansas City, New York City, and New Orleans are espe- 
cially suggestive in this respect. Either because of the methods used 
in investigations or the conclusions reached, each of these reports is 
worthy of a place among the reference books accessible to superin- 
tendents and other supervising officers. 
The Kansas City report for 1915 devotes pages 57 to 86, inclusive, 
to the work of the “Bureau of Research and Efficiency.” The work 
of this bureau, as reported by its director, Mr. George Melcher, has 
been chiefly as follows: 
First. Cooperating with the superintendent’s office in collecting and analyz- 
ing the statistics of our school system and making such comparisons with other 
systems as might lead to a better understanding of our own educational status, 
and assist in the solution of our problems. 
Second. Cooperating with the superintendent’s office and the various com- 
mittees on the revision of the course of study.

-P-A-G-E-82
54 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
Third. Assisting in the revision of the records and report blanks of the 
schools so as to make the reports and records reveal more fully educational 
progress and results. 
Fourth. Handling for the superintendent’s office many of the questionnaires 
that came from other school systems, asking for statistical and related informa- 
tion. These often require no little time to answer fully and accurately. 
Fifth. Assisting in drafting and presenting to the legislature bills needed for 
the improvement of our schools. A report of this work is made at another 
place. 
Sixth. Cooperating and advising with theeteachers of the Teacher Training 
School. The director met the students of this school for lecture and confer- 
ence one hour each week last year, in order that these students might enter 
our school system with a better grasp of the meaning and usefulness of educa- 
tional standards. 
Seventh. During the past year objective scales have been used in measuring 
the results in arithmetic, handwriting, spelling, and language work. The facts 
discovered by these measurements have been organized for the use of the 
superintendents, principals, supervisors, and teachers, as a basis for securing 
better results. 
Highth. Studying, only very superficially this year, the cost of maintaining” 
the schools. This investigation has been carried far enough to make it evi- 
dent that cost standards for the various items of expense are needed. Cost 
standards are needed for heating, for lighting, for janitor service, for water, 
for supplies, etc., and for teaching, supervision, and administration. 
Ninth. Some superficial studies have also been made of the causes of non- 
promotion, overageness, and school mortality. 
Tenth. Under the direction of the bureau, a study of the grading of high- 
school pupils was made by Mr. J. W. Richardson, a graduate student of the 
University of Iowa. 
The Detroit report for 1915 devotes pages 96 to 113, inclusive, to 
the report of the “Supervisor of Educational Research” under 
four heads: (1) Research; (2) standardization; (8) statitstics; (4) 
library. Testing was done in arithmetic, handwriting, spelling, 
English composition, reading, and algebra. The procedure in each 
subject is set forth under the caption “Work done.” This is followed 
by a statement of “results,” and this by “recommendations.” 
In closing his report the director, S. A. Courtis, urges the need in 
the school system for experimental schools or classes where new 
methods can be given trial in the hands of teachers of unusual ability 
and under conditions that would permit of measurement under fav- 
orable conditions. 
In Des Moines the work of meausurement and investigation is re- 
ported by Asst. Supt. J. W. Studebaker under three sections: 
Section I. The pupil’s achievements. (a) Spelling. (b) Arithmetic. (¢) Pen- 
manship. 
Section II. Distribution of time among the various elementary school subjects. 
Section III. The children and their progress.
-P-A-G-E-83
  EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 55 
The theory underlying Mr. Studebaker’s work is contained in the 
following paragraphs: 
Underlying all of the investigations is the one sound principle that processes 
or methods are good only proportionately as they produce desired results. 
This being true, it is possible to measure the value of a process only by deter- 
mining the quality and quantity of its products. We must, therefore, at 
intervals, apply scientific tests of results in order to reveal the value of 
methods. Such a procedure will discover to us certain unsatisfactory elements ; 
will cause us to revise our methods and try once more to increase the value of 
the products. 
Good teaching and efficient school administration, then, imply the use of 
the best-known methods, always followed by a properly applied test of their 
value to the end that weaknesses be rejected and effective methods retained. 
It is only in this way that we can ever hope to emerge from a position of 
blind attack upon serious problems and place our profession on a level with 
the sciences where work is done in the lights of facts, not personal opinion 
and traditional pedanticism. 
The Boston report for 1915 devotes pages 84 to 118, inclusive, 
Appendix A, to a summary of the work of the “ Department of Edu- 
cational Investigation and Measurement,” Frank W. Ballou, director. 
In addition to the summary, pamphlets have been issued from time 
to time during the year in limited quantity, giving in full detail the 
methods and results of the various studies undertaken. Samples of 
these pamphlets are bound with the summary as follows: Spelling, 50 
pages; geography, 40 pages; first-grade syllabus, 44 pages; second- 
grade syllabus, 93 pages; third-grade syllabus, 125 pages. The work 
of the department has embraced : 
I. Supervision of the revision of the elementary course of study: (a) Teacher 
participation in the revision. (0) Purpose of the teacher conferences. (c) 
Work of committees on standards. (d) Participation of others. 
Hach resulting grade syllabus is divided into two parts. Part I consists of 
a statement of aims, minimum requirements, and objective standards in each 
subject. Part II of the syllabus is suggestive and not required. It consists 
of suggestions on subject matter, methods, and minimum requirements. 
II. A plan for the promotion of teachers on merit. 
III. Measurement of educational results. 
IV. How the department carries on its work. 
VY. Improvements in methods of carrying on work. 
VI. Educational problems which should be studied from data in the office of 
the department. 
The New Orleans report for 1914-15 devotes pages 49 to 255, 
inclusive, to the report of the “Division of Educational Research,” 
David S. Hill, director. : 
Part I. Comparative measurements of the progress in school of 36,000 children 
in New Orleans. 
Part II. A practical study of elimination of pupils from the New Orleans 
public schools.
-P-A-G-E-84
    56 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
Part Ill. The ideals of children and the occupational preferences of 7,000 
pupils 13 years of age and older in New Orleans. 
Part IV. Further studies of individual variation. 
Part V. The Delgado survey of industries and mechanical occupations of boys 
and men. 
Tables and figures dealing with enrollment, elimination, causes of withdrawal, 
status of parents as to wages, occupation, ete. 
The semiannual report of the “Division of Reference and Re- 
search,” of New York City, Albert Shiels, director, is a pamphlet of 
166 pages, devoted to a description of special studies undertaken in 
New York in kindergarten, elementary and secondary departments, 
summaries of reports and legal decisions; and compilations and ref- 
erences to reports from various cities covering quite a range of topics 
indicating educational progress. These compilations include topics 
relating to all grades of schools below the college, to vocational in- 
struction and guidance. They describe surveys and tests and dis- 
cuss school textbooks. The report closes with a list of publications 
of interest to teachers. 
In New York “The Statistical Division” deals with a portion of 
the business which in smaller cities is included in the departments 
enumerated above. In this division the first principle is to obtain all 
material once and once only; the second principle is to obtain all 
information as nearly at first hand as possible; and the third, to do 
as much of the work at the central office as possible. The remark- 
able usefulness of the Hollerith tabulating outfit in handling school 
figures is set forth at length. 
The policy of doing as much of the work at the central office as 
possible is said to have had the following effect in the elementary 
schools: 
1. It has done away with promotion reports. 
2. It has reduced the annual report to five simple questions. 
8. It has done away with a school report on ages of pupils. 
4, It has reduced the number of operations required of teachers in reporting 
the register and attendance of pupils. 
5. It has reduced the number of processes whereby the same facts are handled 
in the principals’ offices. 
Rochester, N. Y., maintains an active bureau of reference under 
the direction of Asst. Supt. O’Hern, but no report of its work for 
1915 is at hand. Baltimore discontinued its bureau after one year’s 
service, but has recently reinstated it with its former director, Mr. 
Edwin Hebden, in charge. 
TEACHERS AND UNIONS. 
The proposal to “unionize” the teachers has in the past year 
assumed such proportions that it bids fair to become an important 
problem of American education. The proposal dates back to the
-P-A-G-E-85
EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 57 
efforts of the American Federation of Labor to organize teachers 
in the year 1902, but nation-wide attention has been drawn to it 
only through the experiences of Chicago and Cleveland in the last 
few years. 
Chicago has been the main battle ground of the struggle for the 
organization of a teachers’ labor union, and is at the writing of this 
report plunged into a state of chaotic excitement. Rulings of the 
board of education, investigations by the common council, court 
decrees, and injunctions have followed one another in rapid 
succession. 
The attitude of the board of education in Chicago to the teachers’ 
unions was brought to the attention of the National Education 
Association in New York City in 1916 by the president of the 
board, Mr. J. Loeb. Mr. Loeb contends that teaching is not a trade, 
but a profession; that teacher unions make for divided allegiance, 
breed suspicion and discontent, destroy harmony, and create strife, 
and hence are a menace to American education. In response to 
Mr. Loeb, Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, formerly of Chicago, showed 
her approval of the movement in that city. She confessed that 
perhaps she was not in favor of it in principle, but she said that— 
the teachers found that in order to get anything done they had to have vot- 
ing power behind them. They found that the men in their own station in life 
would not help them, and they had to go in with those who had felt the oppres- 
sion, the grinding power of riches. 
At a mass meeting called by the American Federation of Teachers, 
July 6, 1916, in New York, the following resolutions were adopted: 
It is the sense of this meeting— 
That the social and technical efficiency of the public schools depends upon 
the establishment of high personal and professional standards for the teaching 
staff ; 
That persons of independence can be obtained for the teaching and supervis- 
ing staff only with the establishment of secure tenure based on quality of 
service ; 
That adequate professional standards can be maintained only through the 
control of personnel by educational officers engaged in continuous and profes- 
sional service ; 
That the attempt to control the personnel of teaching and supervising staff 
by changing lay boards is a serious menace to the efficiency of the public schools, 
as well as an affront to American ideals of independence and fair dealing; 
That we protest against the appointment or dismissal of teachers and super- 
visors by lay boards, as tending to place the professional staff at the mercy of 
sinister and unscrupulous interests. 
That we call upon public-spirited citizens and school patrons to resist the 
encroachments of partisan, sectarian, or commercial interests in the control of 
the public schools; 
That we condemn the efforts of special interests to wrest from the educational 
authorities the control of the public schools; 
   
-P-A-G-E-86
  
  58 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
That we protest most emphatically against the arbitrary and discriminatory 
dismissal of efficient and superior teachers by the board of education of Chi- 
cago, by methods and for motives contrary to sound public policy ; 
That we send to the Chicage Teachers’ Federation fraternal greetings and 
expression of good will, with the sincere wish that the stand taken by that 
organization for professional interests will meet with abundant success; 
That these resolutions be published and that copies thereof be sent to the 
chief educational authorities of the several States and to the United States 
Commissioner of Education. 
The experience in Cleveland is also illuminating. It shows again 
that whatever be the merits in the contending viewpoints, the clash 
of these viewpoints is not without its serious effects on the work- 
ing efliciency of the school system involved in the controversy. 
Following is a brief summary of the Cleveland experience: In 
the early part of the year 1914 some members of the teaching force 
began an agitation looking to the formation of a teachers’ union, 
to be affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. The board 
of education expressed its disapproval of that effort. Nevertheless 
the Grade Teachers’ Club authorized its executive officers to take 
steps for the formation of a union. Thereupon the board of educa- 
tion, on the 18th of May, 1914, resolved: 
(1) That this board reiterates and reaffirms its judgment and opinion that 
an organization of teachers within the system in affiliation with an organiza- 
tion outside of the system is detrimental to the public welfare and harmful to 
the best interests of the public-school system. 
(2) That it is the rule of this board, and to be and become a part of the 
contract of employment with any teacher hereafter appointed or reappointed, 
that membership in an organization as is above described shall be regarded 
as a breach of the contract of employment and the equivalent of a resignation 
of such employment, and the acceptance hereafter of an appointment as a 
teacher will be regarded as an acceptance of this rule. 
No union was then formed, but shortly afterwards an action was 
instituted in the court of common pleas of Cuyahoga County to 
have this resolution declared null and void and to enjoin the enforce- 
ment thereof. What followed is described in the report of the city 
superintendent of Cleveland for the year 1914-15: 
On June 9, 1914, a decree was made by W. B. Neff, one of the judges of said 
court, declaring this resolution to be in excess of the power of the board of 
education, and enjoining the board of education, superintendent of schools, 
and other officers of the school system from enforcing the same, and also en- 
joining the superintendent from failing or refusing to appoint or reappoint 
any teacher because of her membership in a union or her efforts to form such 
a union. 
This injunction, notwithstanding its obvious invalidity, was faithfully ob- 
served by the superintendent and his assistants and all others having to do 
with the appointment or reappointment of teachers. A number of teachers, 
however, were guilty of such misconduct and insubordination as, in the opinion 
of the superintendent, made their further continuance in the service injurious
-P-A-G-E-87
  
  
EDUCATION IN THE LARGER CITIES. 59 
to the best interests of the schools. They were not reappointed for that rea- 
son, and for none other. 
Some of these persons, in cooperation with outside interests, deeming them- 
Selves aggrieved, and asserting without warrant in fact that their failure of 
reappointment was due to their previous efforts to form a union, made appli- 
cation to W. B. Neff, the judge of the court of common pleas who had issued 
the injunction, for a citation against the superintendent for contempt. It was 
charged that he willfully and intentionally refused to obey the injunction 
order, and that he had failed and refused to reappoint the applicants because 
of their union activities. A long trial was had, and on October 80, 1914, this 
judge found the superintendent guilty of said contempt, and urged the super- 
intendent to reappoint these teachers in order that the superintendent might 
thereby escape punishment. The superintendent refused, for the reason that 
such power of appointment ‘was vested exclusively in him and not in the 
courts, and that to comply with this demand would destroy discipline and 
order in the school system. A sentence of 10 days in jail and a fine of $500 
‘and costs was imposed upon the superintendent. 
Execution of this judgment was immediately suspended by the court of 
appeals, which later reviewed the case and reversed the sentence. The court 
of appeals, in its opinion, vindicated the power and authority, both of the 
board of education and of the superintendent in all respects. It held that the 
original resolution forbidding the organization of a union and membership 
therein was within the power of the board of education; that the order of 
injunction was in excess of the power of the court, and was null and void, 
that W. B. Neff was biased and prejudiced, and should not have proceeded 
to hear the contempt proceedings; and that as a matter of fact there was no 
evidence to support a finding that the superintendent had disobeyed the in- 
junction order, or was guilty of contempt. 
An application to the Supreme Court of Ohio to take jurisdiction of this 
contempt proceedings was denied. 
Thus ended an episode having many unpleasant aspects. I am of the opinion, 
however, that much good has resulted from it. The agitation originally for the 
organization of a union was confined to a very small group of teachers. These 
did not at any time represent the teaching force in whose behalf they assumed 
to act. At all times the spirit and loyalty to duty of the teaching force has 
in the main been above reproach. As a result of the proceedings above related, 
the disturbing elements have been removed or disciplined, and the professional 
spirit and loyalty to duty of the teaching force are of the highest order. 
However, the whole problem is far from being closed in Cleveland, 
for later reports show that teachers have secured a ruling of the 
higher court which grants them the right to organize and affiliate 
with labor.

CHAPTER IV. 
EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 
By W. S. DEFFENBAUGH, 
Chief of Division of School Administration, Bureau of Education. 
A chapter treating of progress in education for a period of only 
one year, and even for a longer period, must deal principally with 
the change in the machinery of education. It is not the purpose of 
this chapter to show how much better children in the smaller cities 
are being educated now than a year ago. The aim is to summarize 
changes in administrative machinery from about 700 letters received 
from superintendents in the smaller cities, stating the significant 
steps taken in their respective cities looking toward the improve- 
ment of schools. It will be impossible, on account of the brief 
space allotted, to quote from many of the letters received. Where 
quotations or descriptions of changes are given they may be con- 
sidered as typical or as out of the ordinary. 
Practically every superintendent reporting has taken some step 
or steps looking toward the improvement of his schools. Some cities 
are adopting the newer and less tried plans, while others are only 
beginning to adopt some of the methods and plans ‘that have long 
since been in use in the most progressive schools. For example, 
some of the smaller cities, especially those of less than 5,000 popu- 
lation, have for the first time introduced shopwork for boys and 
home economics for girls; some are for the first time offering elective 
subjects and elective courses in the high school. 
One reason why some cities have been slow to adopt modern ideas 
and methods is the conservatism of the people and of school board 
members. In one city the superintendent made a vigorous effort 
to introduce home economics, agriculture, and commercial subjects, 
but the board of education replied: “Go on in the same way that 
we have been; that is good enough for us.” Lack of progress, how- 
ever, is not always due to conservatism on the part of the people, 
but to a failure of the superintendent and teachers to keep the people 
informed on current educational thought and practice. 
61 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  62 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
Another reason is that the finances of many of the smaller cities 
are not adequate to maintain a modern system of schools. Some 
of these cities are struggling along with a high tax rate and ex- 
pending a large amount in proportion to their wealth, yet the schools 
are inferior. It would, no doubt, be of advantage to the schools of 
some of these cities if they were included in a large taxing unit, 
as the township or county. 
BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS. 
The item of progress most often mentioned in the special reports 
sent this bureau is the erection of new buildings, especially new high- 
school buildings, and the purchase of playgrounds. 
The housing of school children has become a problem in the small 
as well as in the large city, due sometimes to a rapidly increasing 
population, but often to the rapid increase in high-school enroll- 
ment and the increased holding power of the elementary grades. It 
is not unusual, as is shown in Chapter III, volume 1, of the 1915 
Report of the Commissioner of Education, for high-school enrollment 
to increase three times as rapidly as grade enrollment. This rapid 
increase has made it imperative that new high-school buildings be 
erected. 
The high-school buildings that are now under construction are 
usually of the most modern type. No expense is spared to make them 
answer the purpose of a modern school. It is not unusual for a city 
with a population of from 10,000 to 30,000 to erect a high-school 
building at a cost of $150,000 or $200,000. Some cities of this size 
are erecting buildings at even greater cost. Hammond, Ind., for in- 
stance, is erecting an industrial high school at a cost of $300,000. 
Among other cities that are erecting high-school buildings at a cost 
in excess of $200,000 are Parkersburg, W. Va.. and Lebanon and 
Butler, Pa. 
At Redondo Beach, Cal., a high-school building costing $150,000 
has been erected on the group plan, consisting of four buildings. 
There is an auditorium equipped with a moving-picture booth and a 
large pipe organ. This auditorium is used as a civic center. It is 
planned to have pipe-organ recitals on Sunday afternoons free to the 
public. 
At Ludlow, Ky., a four-room modern cottage for the ianitor has 
been erected on the school grounds. 
At Hiawatha, Kans., the school board has secured the property 
and grounds of an academy, consisting of a 10-room school building, 
20-room dormitory, a modern 8-room dwelling, and 10 acres of land. 
A new high-school building is being erected on these grounds. The 
dwelling will be used as a residence of the superintendent of schools.

    EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 63 
The school board at Port Arthur, Tex., is solving the building 
problem for a rapidly growing city by introducing the Gary plan 
of accommodating two schools in the same building. 
In September, 1914, Port Arthur had three elementary schools, 
a high school, and several outlying schools. The elementary schools 
were pure study schools, with accomodations for classroom work 
only. These buildings, with one exception, were congested, even 
using insanitary basement rooms. With the school enrollment in- 
creasing about 25 per cent a year, it was found that annexes to 
the old buildings or a new building every year would be imperative. 
This solution of the building problem made possible only a school 
seat for every child. This plan did not provide special facilities, 
as laboratories, playgrounds, etc., which every progressive school 
system should have as part of the school plant. 
Since the congested condition of the Port Arthur schools called 
for immediate relief, a temporary rearrangement was brought about 
as follows: A complete reorganization of the elementary schools 
into work-study-and-play schools, making use of the available 
grounds all day for playground purposes, appropriating all base- 
ment and waste space possible for special work, adding portable 
buildings for special work where occasion demanded it, making a 
reassignment of teachers for special and regular subjects, employing 
playground teachers and one general supervisor of instruction. 
Before the plan was adopted the building cost, with only classroom 
facilities, was over $100 per pupil. The rearrangement reduced 
the cost to approximately $70 per pupil, and relieved building con- 
gestion until permanent plans could be made. Miss Marie Anderson, 
supervisor of instruction in the Port Arthur schools, summarizes the 
reorganization of the schools of the city as follows: 
The school authorities have changed their whole school building policy from 
the traditional elementary classroom type to modern centralized plants with 
vocational, playground, library, and special facilities in addition to study 
facilities ; and from the traditional grade-school organization to the work- 
study-and-play plan without increasing the cost of education to the tax- 
payers, : 
A few years ago, when school boards were planning the erection 
of new buildings, little thought was given to the necessity of large 
playgrounds. Now progressive communities are demanding that 
ample playgrounds around the school buildings be provided. 
Recently the people of Webster Groves, Mo., voted 7 to 1 to issue 
bonds to purchase an athletic field of 10 acres adjoining the present 
high-school grounds. The school board at Parkersburg, W. Va., 
has recently purchased a site containing 28 acres on which will be 
erected a high-school building. Part of the grounds will be used
-P-A-G-E-92
64 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
as an athletic field, part for a campus, and about 6 acres for the 
use cf the department of agriculture in the high school. In making 
plans for the use of the grounds, provision is made for future 
buildings. 
The school board of Kenosha, Wis., has purchased 35 acres near 
the city to serve as a site for a new high school at some future time. 
Ten acres of this are platted for school gardens. 
School boards in other cities, before purchasing: at an exorbitant 
price a tract of land just large enough for a school buildmg, are 
learning to think twice when a large tract of land at a less price 
may be had at no very great distance from the business and resi- 
dential sections of the city. 
Though large buildings have peen erected, it is doubtful whether 
many cities have erected buildings large encugh to accommodate 
the high school for more than a few years or have had vision enough 
to see conditions 10 or 15 years hence. 
With all the building activity it has been necessary for most cities 
erecting new buildings to issue bonds. Fear has been expressed in 
some places that there is too much of a tendency to draw on the 
future, that a city should not burden the next generation with a 
large bonded indebtedness. As a rule, a city should not require the 
next generation to pay for what the present generation uses. If, 
for instance, bonds are issued for paving a street, the paving is 
worn out before the bonds are due, and those who received little 
or no benefit from the paved street will have to pay for it. The 
same principle does not apply in issuing bonds for school purposes. 
The persons who pay the bonds are the ones who received the benefit 
of them. A 20-year bond of $10,000 is issued, for example, to pur- 
chase and equip a playground, the children who 20 years hence 
pay the bonds are the ones who used the playground. The city 
simply borrows on the child’s future to pay for his present needs. 
COURSE OF STUDY AND ORGANIZATION. 
During the year many superintendents have been giving careful 
consideration to the course of study. They have realized that the 
course of study with eight years in the elementary schools and four 
years in the high school has grown up largely by accident and not 
by any planning on the part of the educators; that the United States 
is practically the only country having such an arrangement; and 
that an American child has lost two years by the time he is 18 years 
of age as compared with a child in France or Germany. 
In order to economize time, school superintendents have set them- 
selves the task of reorganizing the schools with six years in the ele- 
mentary grades and six years in the high school. Already many of 
the smaller cities have abandoned the eight-four plan and have
-P-A-G-E-93
  
_EDUOATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 65 
adopted the six-six plan. In an investigation made by Mr. C. C. 
Bingaman, superintendent of schools at Goldfield, Iowa, 209 of the 
smaller cities claim to have junior high schools. If the definition, 
“a junior high school is an organization of grades 7 and 8, or 7, 8, and 
9, whether housed with the senior high school or separately, to pro- 
vide means for individual differences, especially by an earlier intro- 
duction of prevocational work or of subjects usually taught in the 
high school,” were applied, the number, no doubt, would be consider- 
ably diminished. Some superintendents who have introduced de- 
partmental teaching in the grammar grades mistakenly designate the 
grammar schools as junior high schools. : 
The question is frequently asked by opponents to the junior high 
school with the differentiated courses whether such an arrangement 
will not produce a caste system in America. The reply is that it will 
not so much as the present system of the eight-year course. It is well 
known that pupils who drop out of school at the end of the eighth 
grade must to a very great extent take their places with the unskilled. 
A junior high school in which prevocational courses are offered and 
emphasized would tend to raise the standard of those leaving school 
at the end of the eighth or ninth grades. A six-year differentiated 
high-school course, it is claimed, is more democratic than an eight- 
year elementary course and a four-year high-school course, because 
a pupil is given more opportunity to study those subjects best suited 
to his ability and needs. It is not democratic to require everyone 
to do the same thing; neither is it democratic to require children 
after they have “the tools” to study the same subjects. It is claimed 
that a child at the beginning of the seventh grade should not be per- 
mitted to elect courses and subjects. Which, the supporter of the 
junior high school asks, is nearer the correct method—a cast-iron 
course in which every child must be fettered, or a course that permits 
a pupil to choose subjects or courses under the guidance and counsel 
of those who know his ability and who have carefully studied his 
needs? Fewer mistakes are, no doubt, made under a carefully super- 
vised elective system than under a rigid iron-bound system. Throw- 
ing the same course of study at children is like shooting at a mark in 
the dark. The mark may be hit, but only by accident. A wise phy- 
sician does not administer the same medicine to two persons who 
have the same disease without first studying the nature of each 
patient. The school world is just beginning to attempt through the 
junior high school to put into practice the theory that no two chil- 
dren are alike, and that they should not be compelled to study the 
‘same subjects except so far as need be to get the tools necessary to 
take up subjects that have content and that are of practical value. 
The three R’s are not the fundamental subjects, as commonly stated ; 
they are but the tools with which to get at the fundamental subjects;  
-P-A-G-E-94
  66 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
learning to write, to cipher, to spell of themselves never gave a child 
an idea worth while and never will. Only as one uses the tools does 
one become educated. 
The opponents of the six-year elementary course say that a child 
can not get the “tools” in less than eight years, and scarcely in that 
time. If getting the “tools” means such a mastery of them that no 
mistakes will ever be made in spelling and ciphering, and that a 
handwriting will be copper plate, it is not easy to say where the 
limit should be placed for learning the three R’s; but to continue 
drill upon reading, writing, and arithmetic for eight years is con- 
sidered by the supporters of the six-year elementary course to be 
a waste of time. The pupil repeats in the seventh and eighth grades 
the same work he had in the fifth and sixth, in the same drill fashion. 
For the same reason pupils in the seventh and eighth grades often 
tire of the work of these two grades. They are longing for some- 
thing new, something with a meaning. About 10 years ago a super- 
intendent took charge of a system of schools that had nine grades in 
the elementary schools, the ninth being given up to a “thorough 
review of all the common-school branches.” Very few pupils re- 
mained through the nine grades and entered high school. There 
was an enrollment of only 100 in the high school in a city of 10,000 
population. The few who entered high school were weak and de- 
pendent. They did not have the “tools” and did not know how 
to use what they did have, largely because the mechanics of the three 
R’s had been insisted upon rather than their use. The superin- 
tendent, after making an investigation, decided to reduce the num- 
ber of grades to eight, and to promote the eighth grade to high 
school along with the ninth. To the wonder and surprise of teachers 
and parents the eighth-grade pupils that had not made a “thorough 
review of the common school subjects” did much better work in the 
high school than the ninth-grade pupils promoted at the same time. 
In those cities where there are only seven grades in the elementary 
schools the seventh grade, when promoted to high school, to all 
appearances takes up high-school work just as easily as eighth-grade 
pupils in other cities. 
Whether or not a six-year elementary course and a six-year high- 
school course proves to be a better arrangement than an eight-year 
elementary course and a four-year high-school course, the movement 
to reorganize on a six-six plan is in full swing, and the momentum 
is so great that it can not be stopped by the arguments of con- 
servatives. 
Educational meetings are beginning to place emphasis on the ad- 
justment of the elementary course of study to the reorganization of 
the seventh and eighth grades. It is clear that there should be
-P-A-G-E-95
      
EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 67 
- reorganization along the entire line from the kindergarten through 
the junior high school. Simply to make a separate administrative 
unit of the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades means little. The 
aim of the first six grades must be more definitely fixed, and read- 
justments made so that the pupil’s time will be economized and the 
school arts well enough mastered to attach the high-school subjects 
offered in the seventh grade. 
The results of the reorganized school are uniformly pronounced 
successful. In reply to a questionnaire submitted by Mr. Bingaman, 
of Goldfield, Iowa, 91 superintendents say that students are held 
longer in school because of the advantage of the junior high school, 
4 replied in the negative, and 7 said that it was too early to express 
an opinion. 
The question is sometimes asked whether a junior high school in 
a small city is practicable. Of 96 superintendents, 90 say it is. They 
give the following as their reasons for advocating junior high 
schools: “ Better and more enriched courses of study ”; “keep pupils 
in school longer”; “greater interest shown both by pupils and 
teachers”; “better opportunities for vocational guidance”; “ course 
can be better adapted to pupils”; “lifts seventh and eighth grades 
to a higher level of endeavor”; “promotion by subjects”; “no 
other plan welds grade and high school together like this”; “ pro- 
vides for individual differences.” 
GRADING. 
Experiments in different schemes of grading are reported from 
several cities. At Beverly, Mass., a new system of grading was in- 
_ troduced in September, 1915. It is designed to aid in so adapting the 
' work of the schools to the needs of the children that each pupil may 
have an opportunity to do the best work of which he is capable. 
The course of study is being revised so that the work to be accom- 
plished in each fourth of a school year is carefully outlined. In 
those schools where conditions warrant it the pupiis of a grade will 
be grouped in three divisions in essential school subjects, as reading, 
arithmetic, language. Between September and June one of the 
divisions will do three-quarters of the work outlined in the course of 
study, another will do four-quarters—a normal amount—and the 
other division will do five-quarters of the work and will thereby 
gain one-fourth of a year’s work every’10 months. Pupils may 
be in one division one year and in another division the next, these 
groups being formed at the close of each year in June, and each 
pupil being placed where he can do the best work. The superin- 
tendent of the Beverly schools claims that when the system is in full 
working order, at the end of about three years, there should be    
-P-A-G-E-96
  68 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
necessity for very few nonpromotions. Nearly every pupil will be . 
able to continue his work without repetition, but some pupils will 
take a longer time to cover the work of the course than will others, 
and the plan will enable some pupils to save time without omitting 
any part of the elementary course, while it gives others a better 
opportunity to acquire the essentials than is possible under the ordi- 
nary grading plan. 
VACATION SCHOOLS. 
From indications it will be only a few years until every small city 
will have a vacation school for children who have failed in one or 
two subjects and for those who have the ability and strength to gain 
a half grade. At Warren, Pa., all children who fail to make 75 per 
cent in any of their subjects from the second to the eighth grade, 
inclusive, and all children who make an average standing of 90 
per cent or above from the fourth to the seventh, inclusive, may enter 
the school. Last year 95 per cent of those who had failed in some of 
the subjects and 100 per cent of the strong pupils who attempted to 
make up a half year passed. Many other examples of like nature 
could be given. 
Other schools, as East Chicago, Ill., and Independence, Iowa, have 
manual training in the summer schools. In Independence, Iowa, the 
summer course in manual training continues for eight weeks. 
The vacation school of from four to eight weeks has made a place 
for itself and is no doubt a step toward the all-year school. 
As yet Ardmore, Okla., and Eveleth, Minn., are the only small 
cities to report all-year schools.1 The superintendent of schools at 
Ardmore reports that the plan is in successful operation and that 
the people are highly pleased with this form of organization. 
The all-year school at Eveleth, Minn., has grown out of a summer 
school that has been aaccoashully conduéted for the past six years. 
A year ago, when special efforts were made to increase the enrollment 
of the summer school to over 600, it was decided to go over definitely 
to an all-year organization. Contracts with teachers were modified, 
reducing the regular school year from 10 months to 9 months, the 
following paragraph being inserted in the contract: 
It is understood that the school year shall consist of four terms, spring, sum- 
mer, fall, and winter. Each term shall consist of three school months of four 
weeks each. One-third of the work of the year [of nine months] may be done 
in any one term. Children are required to attend at least three terms of the 
calendar year. 
The summer term this year opened with nearly 1,000 pupils and 
45 teachers, the school day remaining the same, from 8 to 12 o’clock 
  
1 Results of an inquiry late in 1916, now being tabulated, will doubtless make additions 
to the list.
-P-A-G-E-97
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 69 
a. m., and from 1 to 3 o’clock p.m. The work is the same as in other 
terms except that more recreation is provided. The superintendent 
of schools at Eveleth pronounces the plan a success. 
A movement for an all-year school at Newport News, Va., was 
started and was received with approval by a number of persons. 
The superintendent reports that when satisfactory details can be 
worked out the schools of Newport News will be run for 11 months 
in the year. 
At Winston-Salem, N. C., the manual-training shops are kept open 
10 hours a day every day in the week, except Sunday, and every week 
in the year. Anyone is permitted to go into the shops at any time - 
and work on any project he may be interested in and take away 
the completed article at cost of material. 
Tf all-year schools could be organized, they would be much better 
than the summer vacation school, since the summer session would 
then be an organic part of the school system. The vacation school 
has as its aim the making up of a half year’s work or gaining an ex- 
tra promotion in six weeks. Only very bright children can make an 
extra grade in six weeks, and only pupils who have failed in a sub- 
ject or two can make up a half year’s work. With an all-year school 
organized so as to promote children every 12 weeks, the child who 
has failed need repeat only one-fourth of a year and he would repeat 
it under normal and not under forced conditions, as is often the case 
in a six weeks’ course. The bright child would also work under nor- 
mal conditions and not cram a half year’s work into a six weeks’ 
course. 
ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHER WITH THE CLASS. 
Several superintendents report that they are making trial of the 
plan of advancing the teacher with the class through a few grades. 
In only a few cases has the plan been in operation long enough for 
the superintendents to draw any conclusions as to its value. In a 
recent report the superintendent of schools at Asheville, N. C., pre- 
sents some testimonials of teachers in that city who have advanced 
with their classes through several successive grades. Miss A., who 
has taught the same pupils through 4A, 4B, 5A, and 5B, says: 
I have noted several benefits from this method: (1) I have obtained a con- 
tinuous view of the work in the above-mentioned grades, which has proved very 
beneficial to me; (2) I have had opportunity to learn every child perfectly 
and have been able to develop several weak children remarkably; (3) my 
children have grown accustomed to my methods, so that there is little waste of 
time over misunderstanding or discipline. I have found this a most satisfactory 
way of teaching. It brings results. 
Miss B. declares: 
I consider the results obtained very beneficial both to myself and children. I 
was familiar with the work already done by the children and was better able 
61355°—16——_7
-P-A-G-E-98
  70 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
to go on with the new. I knew all my children, their weak points and their 
strong points. Taking them on through the grades, I had time to work up 
weak ones, who would otherwise have been left behind, and to take strong 
ones on in their work, passing them through the grades faster than otherwise. 
The children also became familiar with the teacher. They understand her 
directions and are more interested. My work has been a great deal more inter- 
esting in going up with my class than ever before, and I hope next term it 
will be possible for me to continue with my class. 
Fourteen other teachers in the Asheville schools present similar 
testimony as to the value of advancing the teacher with her class. 
SPECIAL CLASSES. 
There has within the year been a decided movement in the smaller 
cities to provide classes for exceptional children, especially for those 
over age for the grade. Several cities have adopted the plan of giv- 
ing these children half-time manual training and half-time academic 
work. At Virginia, Minn., for example, a class was formed of boys 
from the fifth to the eighth grades, inclusive, who were retarded two 
or more years, and given half time in the manual-training shops. 
The results were: (1) Reduction of the number of cases of truancy ; 
(2) greater interest in academic work; (8) relief to the regular grade 
teachers from the care of backward boys, so that the entire room 
made more progress; (4) better satisfied parents. The superintend- 
ent of schools at Virginia reports that the plan has been such a suc- 
cess that a similar class will be formed this coming year for girls, 
who will spend one-half their time in cooking and sewing. The 
stigma usually attached to such classes has been removed by calling 
them “opportunity classes.” Many schools have made the mistake 
of calling these classes “ defective classes.” Parents naturally ob- 
ject to having their children placed in a special class for backward 
children. The term “opportunity class” is more euphemistic and is 
in reality the proper term. Among other of the smaller cities having 
such classes are Elyria, Ohio; Homestead, Pa.; Beverly, Mass.; and 
Kenosha, Wis. 
SURVEYS AND SCHOOL REPORTS. 
Though the survey movement has been largely confined to the 
schools of the larger cities, some of the schools in the smaller cities 
have braved the probe of a survey commission comprised of men and 
women not connected with the school system. All the surveys of the 
smaller cities that have thus far been reported have been constructive 
and helpful. A school board and school superintendent doing their 
duty and making progress as rapidly as means will admit need have 
no fear of a survey made by a committee composed of men and   
1¥or a fuller account of this subject, see U. S. Bu. of Educ. Bul., 1915, No. 42.
-P-A-G-E-99
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. val 
women who have had experience as superintendents or as teachers, 
and who have had training in investigation and in the weighing of 
facts. 
Probably one reason why so few surveys have been made in the 
smaller cities is due to the fact that funds are not available to pay 
for the services of a committee of experts. But this fact need not 
prevent a superintendent in a small city from making a survey of 
his school system. Every superintendent should himself be direct- 
ing a continuous survey of his school system, to discover its weak- 
ness and its strength, and to invent means to strengthen the weak 
points. Possibly superintendents in several cities could form a 
group, and by so cooperating render one another valuable assistance 
without much expense. If, for instance, 10 superintendents should 
agree to cooperate to make a study of classroom achievements, unit 
costs, etc., norms could be established for these 10 cities. It would 
be an excellent plan for a group of superintendents to make a survey 
of their schools with the advice and cooperation of the school of 
education of the State university or of some other. university main- 
taining a school of education. The facts collected would make ex- 
cellent material for students in the school of education studying 
statistical methods to tabulate. The University of Kansas is setting 
an excellent example for other State universities by surveying the 
schools of 35 cities in that State. When the survey is completed it 
will be possible for each superintendent to see how his school varies 
from the norm in unit costs, achievement of pupils, etc. The de- 
partment of education at the University of Iowa rendered excellent 
service to the city schools, also to the rural schools, by making a sur- 
vey of the handwriting of the children of the State. 
State departments of public instruction could, no doubt, render 
valuable service to superintendents who are surveying their schools. 
Heretofore State departments of education have exercised but little 
oversight of city schools or made any inspection of them. It would 
without doubt be to the advantage of city schools if they were in- 
spected by competent State officials, and if the data could be col- 
lected, analyzed, and reported upon to the city superintendents, es- 
pecially to superintendents in the smaller cities. 
Superintendents who are contemplating a self-survey are referred 
to the Thirteenth Year Book of the National Society for the Study 
of Education for an outline of a plan for organizing a school survey, 
and also to City School Circular, 1915-16, No. 2, United States Bu- 
reau of Education. 
_ Judging from the annual reports of superintendents thus far re- 
ceived for the year 1915-16, not a few superintendents are beginning 
to study their problems more scientifically than before. Some of
-P-A-G-E-100
    72 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
these reports may be considered the equal of some of the reports sub- 
mitted by survey commissions. When all superintendents begin to 
understand how to collect and use data there will no doubt be less 
need for surveys by outside parties. At least it will not be necessary 
for an outside survey committee to do more than help interpret the 
data the superintendent has collected. 
In a previous chapter mention was made of the self-survey con- 
ducted at Solvay, N.Y. The latest report, 1915-16, shows that the 
superintendent of schools in that city is continuing the survey be- 
gun several years ago. 
The report of the superintendent of schools at Curwensville, Pa., 
may be taken as an example of what is possible for a superintendent 
in a city of 3,000 population to do to present to the public evidence 
of what the schools are doing and of their needs. The superintend- 
ent, in his report, explains as follows why he made a survey of his 
schools: 
Due to the severe criticisms thrust into the ears of school officials, both as 
to our own as well as schools generally, we were very much interested to learn 
the true conditions in Curwensville. We firmly believe in surveys, but in a 
small-city school system it is almost beyond the financial grasp to hire an ex- 
pert. So we determined to conduct an investigation and deal with problems as 
best we could. 
Among the points investigated and reported upon were age dis- 
tribution of pupils, promotions, medical inspection, achievements 
of pupils as determined by standard tests, junior and senior high 
schools, and costs. 
The report of the superintendent of schools at Globe, Ariz., for 
1915-16 may be given as another example of a self-survey. Among 
the topics treated are character of student and adult population, 
age and grade distribution, causes of nonpromotion, experience and 
training of teaching’ staff, achievement of pupils as measured by 
standard tests, costs of instruction in each elementary and high 
school subject. Diagrams are freely used to express statistical com- 
parisons with other cities in Arizona. 
During the year the following surveys in the smaller cities made 
by an outside survey staff have been reported to this bureau :* Ash- 
land, Oreg.; Leavenworth, Kans.; Webster Groves, Mo.;'and James- 
town, N. Dak. Several county surveys have been made in which 
the city schools were included in the survey, as San Mateo County, 
Cal., and Nassau County, N. Y. All of the surveys, while disclosing 
weaknesses in the school systems, have uniformly been constructive in 
character and the recommendations have been made to fit local condi- 
tions, as shown by the following summary of the recommendation

made in the reports of the survey commissions at Ashland, Oreg., 
and in Leavenworth, Kans. : 
Ashland, Oreg—a1. That an outside room be provided for the manual train- 
ing classes, to be built largely by the work of the boys themselves, and that a 
larger room be provided for the sewing work in order that the girls may work 
at tables. 
2. That efforts be made to secure by loan or gift a larger collection of good 
pictures, mural decorations, and pieces of sculpture. 
8. That doors or screens be placed in front of the toilets in the grade schools. 
4, That 68° be established as the standard temperature of the schoolrooms 
instead of 70°, and that the halls of the East School be warmed. 
5. That vigorous physical exercises be required in each grade room for at 
least five minutes during each session, or a run in the open air for an equal 
length of time. 
6. That the main effort of the Ashland School authorities be directed toward 
courses in the standard academic branches, with knowledge of fundamentals, 
formation of character, development of disciplined mind, and acquisition of 
general culture as the chief educational aims, but that physical and industrial 
education be considered sufficiently fundamental and important as to demand 
thoroughly substantial support. 
7. That the aim of the manual-training work be made more vocational, and 
that home gardens and poultry-raising clubs be organized under school super- 
vision. 
8. That prospective rural school teachers take the high-school teachers’ train- 
ing course, but that prospective city elementary and high-school teachers be 
advised to take their professional training later in higher educational institu- 
tions. 
9. That more attention be given to the fundamentals of punctuation and 
capitalization. 
10. That classes in penmanship be reorganized on the basis of ability, and

the upper elementary grades be devoted to the poorest one-fourth. 
11. That good writing be made a prerequisite for admission to bookkeeping 
courses.

A full report of the committee on the Webster Groves (Mo.) school 
survey has not yet been made. The report when completed will treat 
of instruction, achievements of pupils, promotion and retardation, 
course of study, life of the community, buildings and grounds, etc. 
A partial report has been made recommending that— 
The domestic-science teacher be placed in charge of the high-school lunch- 
room, and that she correlate the work of her department as much as possible 
with the lunchroom. 
The secretary of the superintendent of schools be made the secretary of the 
school board. 
Two manual training and home economic centers be established for pupils 
in the elementary schools.
-P-A-G-E-103
  EDUCATION IN THE SMALLER CITIES. 15 
The seventh and eighth grade pupils be centralized in a junior high-school 
building as soon as possible. 
The superintendent be sent, at the expense of the school board, to visit the 
classrooms of applicants for teaching positions, and normal schools and col- 
leges to select the best graduates. 
A record be kept to discover why so many teachers leave the Webster Groves 
schools. (No such record had been kept.) 
The board no longer employ an architect, on a salary of $600 a year, merely 
to inspect buildings and to recommend to the board what repairs should be 
made, but that a competent mechanic be employed to make repairs and to have 
general oversight of the buildings, and that an architect be employed only as 
alterations are to be made or new buildings erected. 
The survey at Jamestown, N. Dak., was for the purpose of locating 
buildings and reorganizing the course of study. The United States 
Commissioner of Education spent several days in Jamestown and 
made recommendations as to the location of buildings, which the 
board adopted. He also recommended the introduction of the six-six 
plan and offered suggestions as to the arrangement of the course of 
study. 
Many of the recommendations made in these surveys have been 
adopted. If a survey has been thorough, all the recommendations 
can not be adopted at once; to do so would invite disaster to a school 
system. The aim of a properly organized survey is to collect the 
facts and to interpret them and to outline a plan of action not to be 
accomplished at once, but within a reasonable time, as five or ten 
years. It is felt that a survey, to be helpful, should look to the future 
rather than to the present. 
KINDERGARTENS. 
The kindergarten has received a gratifying share of interest and 
attention in the smaller cities during the school year 1915-16, an 
appreciative stride in kindergarten extension being apparent. In 
the North Central States 161 cities have established 258 new kinder- 
gartens, 172 of which were established in 106 cities and towns where 
kindergartens had never existed as a part of the public-school system. 
Michigan leads this group with 30 cities and 45 new kindergartens, 
28 being established in 16 cities and towns never having had public- 
school kindergartens; Iowa and Wisconsin follow close in line. Cali- 
fornia leads the country, having established 53 new kindergartens in 
28 cities, 38 being in 19 cities and towns never having had public- 
school kindergartens. Montana, while it does not take the lead in 
the number of kindergartens established, may be especially men- 
tioned, nevertheless, for having, in one year, changed its record of 
no kindergartens to 19 in 4 cities. Another noteworthy fact is that a 
number of kindergartens previously supported by women’s associa-  
-P-A-G-E-104
  76 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
tions or other private organizations have, during the past year, been 
taken over by public-school boards, thus proving the potential inter- 
est in this work on the part of public-school authorities, frequently 
called forth through this means. A typical example is Mendon, 
Mich., where a kindergarten was conducted for about three years, six 
or seven years ago. The work was under the management of the 
Women’s Club, but funds were hard to raise, and it was therefore 
discontinued. Public sentiment in favor of kindergarten work con- 
tinued, however, and as a direct result, the public-school board in- 
corporated the kindergarten in its public-school system this year.

  CHAPTER V. 
RURAL EDUCATION. 
By H. W. Foeur, Specialist in Rural School Practice, in collaboration with A, C. MONAHAN, 
Specialist in Rural School Administration, and J. C. MurRMan, Specialist in Rurat 
Education, Bureau of Hducation. 
The year 1915-16 has brought forth nothing of a revolutionary 
character in rural education; progress has been in the direction of, 
educational policies now generally accepted by educators whose 
interests are in the rural field. Few State legislatures have been in 
session during the year, which explains the comparatively small 
number of changes in educational policy for the schools in rural 
communities. 
PROGRESS IN RURAL SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION. 
Maryland—The most notable action during the year looking 
toward an improved State rural school system was that of Maryland. 
The 1916 legislature made several important changes in the school 
laws of the State, largely as a result of the educational survey of the 
State made by the General Education Board for the Maryland State 
school committee. 
Hitherto the State and county boards of education in Maryland 
have been appointed by the governor with the approval of the State 
senate. In practice the senators from the various counties have 
named the boards. The law has been changed so that now the boards 
are appointed by the governor. The State superintendent of public 
instruction in the past has been appointed by the governor; in the 
future he will be appointed by the State board of education. He will 
be the executive officer of the board, but will have no vote. Definite 
educational qualifications for the State superintendent have been 
fixed by law. He must be a graduate of a standard college; and he 
must have had, in addition, two years of postgraduate work, princi- 
pally in education, together with seven years of experience in teach- 
ing, supervising, or school administration. 
The State department in the past has employed, in addition to the 
State superintendent, a deputy State superintendent and one clerk; 
the new law makes provision for an assistant State superintendent, a 
supervisor of high schools, a supervisor of rural schools, a white 
supervisor of Negro schools, and several clerks. 
17  
-P-A-G-E-106
  78 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
The county boards have increased powers under the new law. 
They now appoint all teachers, instead of only the assistant teachers. 
They fix the county tax within limits of 34 and 40 cents on every 
$100 worth of taxable property, the county commissioners being 
obliged to levy and collect the tax fixed by the county board of educa- 
tion, within the limits assigned. 
Provision has been made for employing as county superintendents 
persons thoroughly qualified for the office who will be required to 
give their entire time to educational work. They are to be appointed 
by the county board, but all candidates to be eligible for appoint- 
ment must hold certificates issued by the State superintendent. 
They must be graduates of standard colleges and have had the equiva- 
lent of at least one year of graduate training in education, with work 
in certain special courses, and two years’ successful experience in 
teaching or supervision. The term of service has been increased to 
four years and a minimum salary of $1,800 a year has been fixed. 
The State will pay one half of the salary up to $3,000. 
The State superintendent is given power to remove any county 
superintendent for inefliciency or malfeasance in office. The ap- 
pointment of a successor is left to the county board. The law makes 
clear that the county superintendent shall be the actual head of the 
school system, being required by legislation to take the initiative in 
making out the annual budget, locating school buildings, etc., and 
he “shall nominate all assistants and all teachers for appointment 
by the board.” The county superintendent is given the power to 
assign the teachers to the particular schools. 
Increased supervision has been provided by requiring all counties 
with 100 teachers or more to employ a primary grade supervisor at 
a minimum salary of $1,200. The State pays one-half of the salary, 
up to $2,000. Counties with less than 100 teachers may employ such 
supervisors, or two counties with less than 100 teachers may appoint 
a joint supervisor. Every county must appoint an attendance officer 
approved by the State superintendent, and every county must employ 
at least one clerk for the county superintendent’s office. One-half 
of the salary of the attendance officer, up to $1,200, is to be paid 
by the State. 
Certification of public school teachers has been made a State 
function. All details connected with the examinations for teachers’ 
certificates, renewal of certificates, granting of certificates or diplo- 
mas, and the conditions under which certificates, diplomas, and 
degrees of institutions of the State of Maryland, or of other States, 
will be recognized, are determined by the State superintendent of 
schools. The certificates granted are as follows: 
1. A certificate in administration and supervision, valid three years, issued 
to persons who are graduates of a standard college or university with one
-P-A-G-E-107
  RURAL EDUCATION. 79 
year of graduate work in education, including public schvol administration, 
supervision, and methods of teaching (or who have had the equivalent), and 
who have had two years’ experience as a teacher, 
2. A certificate in elementary school supervision, valid three years, issued 
to persons who are graduates of a two-year standard normal school who have 
completed in addition two full years of academic work at a standard college, 
at least one-half of the time being devoted to education, and who have had 
four years of teaching experience in elementary schools. 
3. A high-school principal’s certificate, valid for three years, issued to grad- 
uates of a standard college who have had a full year of graduate work, approxi- 
mately one-third of which was in subjects related to high-school branches and 
two-thirds in education, and who have had two years’ teaching experience. 
4. A high-school teacher’s certificate granted to persons who are graduates 
of a standard college who have had at least two high-school subjects con- 
tinuously for two years and not less than 200 recitation hours of instruction 
in education, particularly in secondary school work. 
5. An elementary school principal’s certificate, valid three years, required 
in all elementary schools having three or more teachers, granted to persons 
who have had a four-year high-school course, or an equivalent, and two years’ 
standard normal school work, and in addition not less than a full half-year’s 
work at a college in elementary school methods, supervision, administratio 
and three years of teaching experience. 
6. An elementary school teacher’s certificate of the first grade, valid three 
years, to persons who are graduates of a four-year high-school and a two-year 
course in a standard normal. 
7. An elementary school teacher’s certificate of the second grade, valid for 
two years, issued to graduates of four-year high schools on examination in 
elementary-school subjects, but open only to those who have had at least six 
weeks of professional preparation in a standard institution. 
8. An elementary-school teacher’s certificate of the third grade, valid two 
years, issued to persons having less than a standard high-school course on 
examination in elementary-school subjects. The candidate must have had at 
least six weeks of professional preparation in a standard institution. This 
may be renewed only upon presentation of evidence of successful experience 
and completion of not less than six weeks’ additional academic and profes- 
sional preparation in a standard institution. 
In addition, several special certificates are issued to teachers of 
drawing, music, domestic economy, etc. 
The compulsory education law has been revised and made State 
wide. All children from 7 to 13 years of age are required to attend 
school for the entire period that the schools are open. Children of 
13 and 14 years of age are required to attend at least 100 days, and, 
unless engaged in regular employment, for the entire time that the 
schools are open. Children of 15 and 16 years of age who have not 
completed the elementary schools are required to attend at least 100 
days each year as nearly consecutively as possible, or their entire time 
if they are not in regular employment. 
Texas—The State reports that the so-called “ million-dollar ap- 
propriation ” for country schools is accomplishing excellent results. 
This appropriation was the result of an act of the 1915 legislature 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
80 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
appropriating $1,000,000, one-half of which was available in the 
school year just closed and one-half in the present school year, to 
assist in providing adequate school facilities in the poorer rural 
school districts. The State board of education has charge of the 
fund. It is authorized and directed to supplement the regular State 
apportionment with an amount not exceeding $500 in any one year, 
the amount to be determined on the merits and needs of the schools. 
Districts requesting aid make application on a form prescribed by 
the State board of education. The State superintendent is required 
to make investigation and approve the application before it is 
granted. As far as possible the State superintendent or one of his 
representatives visits each school requesting aid. 
Before any school is entitled to receive aid, it must meet certain 
standard conditions. It must be located on a plat of ground not 
less than 1 acre in extent near the center of population of the dis- 
trict; it must be provided with a schoolhouse meeting the require- 
ments of the State department in all particulars; it must be equipped 
with satisfactory furniture, books, maps, etc.; the teachers employed 
must have had professional training as well as adequate academic 
training and have given satisfactory service. The district receiving 
aid must have fewer than 200 pupils in the scholastic enrollment, the 
attendance record for the previous year not being less than 50 per 
cent of the entire time the school was in session, and the school must 
maintain during each year that it receives State aid an attendance 
record of at least 75 per cent. The school district must levy and col- 
lect a local school tax of not less than 50 cents on $100 valuation, and 
the school must teach all the subjects required by the State depart- 
ment of education. 
The State department reports in regard to the operation of the 
act as follows: 
At this time (June, 1916) the entire amount of the $500,000 for the current 
scholastic year has been distributed among the country schools of the State 
on the above conditions. As a direct tangible result, more than 1,300 schools 
have been granted aid, distributed over 175 counties, which number embraces 
practically all of the counties except those lying in the extreme western and 
northwestern portions of the State where the school districts are large and 
the schools small, and the usual State and local school funds are adequate for 
the maintenance of terms of eight and nine months schools. Many new build- 
ings have been erected ; many more old ones have been remodeled. 
The average amount granted to the schools is better than $350, and the 
average on the basis of counties is approximately $2,900. 
IMPROVED RURAL SCHOOL SUPERVISION. 
Probably no phase of rural school work is receiving more atten- 
tion than that of supervision. Wisconsin in 1915 passed a law pro- 
viding for the employment of “ supervising teachers ” in each county.
-P-A-G-E-109
    
RURAL EDUCATION. 81 
They are nominated by the county superintendent and elected by 
the county committee on common schools. Only women are’em- 
ployed. The minimum salary is $60 per month, the maximum $80; 
traveling expenses are allowed. Counties with more than 125 schools 
may have two supervising teachers. The salaries and expenses are 
paid by the county, but the county is at the close of the year reim- 
bursed by the State. The supervising teachers work under the direc- 
tion of the county superintendent; they give their attention to the 
new -teachers and others in need of special help. In the year the 
plan has been in operation much good work has been done. There 
are 80 supervising teachers employed. 
New Jersey has provided a somewhat similar plan. The State 
commissioner of education may appoint’ in each county a “helping 
teacher ” who shall devote all of his time, under the direction of the 
county superintendent, to assisting the teachers in the one and two 
teacher buildings, particularly those who are new in service. 
West Virginia has increased the number of district supervisors 
during the year from 62 to 82. Virginia now has 10 county super- 
visors of schools for whites and 35 for Negroes. Mississippi now 
requires its county superintendents to devote their entire time to 
the work. The law has fixed the minimum salary at $1,000 a year 
and the maximum at $1,800. 
: CONSOLIDATION OF RURAL SCHOOLS. 
More consolidated schools have probably been established in the 
past year than in any two previous years. This has come about 
through the distribution of information concerning consolidation 
and through special State aid to stimulate the movement provided in 
several States. West Virginia reports that in the 1915-16 school year 
875 one-teacher country schools were replaced by larger schools with, 
as a rule, three or more teachers and without public transportation. 
Wisconsin reports a considerable number of new consolidated schools. 
The State superintendent says: é 
The interest in the subject is continually increasing, and the sentiment is 
growing more and more favorable. 
One phase of the consolidation question that is frequently overlooked is the 
rather marvelous growth of State graded schools. We have now in Wisconsin 
almost 600 of these institutions, employing 1,450 teachers, scattered over the 
State. About one-half of them are doing some work beyond the eighth grade. 
Each of these schools really becomes an educational center which in many cases 
is equivalent to a consolidation center. Another phase of the consolidation 
work is quite prominent in the State, namely, the establishment of joint and 
union high schools. This is essentially a phase of consolidation for high-school 
purposes. In these places the elementary education is taken care of in the local 
one-room district schools, while the secondary education is taken care of by the 
large high-school district. 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
82 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
New York State reports that about 100 consolidated schools have 
been established during the past year. In one instance 11 districts 
have been consolidated at West Chazy, Clinton County, in the Cham- 
plain Valley; and a philanthropic citizen of that vicinity is erecting 
an endowed building which will be one of the most completely 
equipped school buildings in the State. 
Deputy Commissioner of Education Thomas E. Finegan points out 
that as a result of this movement in the consolidation of one-room 
schools several schools have been organized which will do the usual 
work of the eight grades in the elementary course and two years of 
high-school work. He says: 
These schools are generally known as intermediate agricultural schools. ‘The 
courses of study are along the lines of agriculture for boys and domestic 
science and home making for girls. Teachers of agriculture have been em- 
ployed in these schools on the understanding that they do continuation work 
during the summer. The boys who are taking the agricultural course are under 
the direction of this teacher, but employed in regular farm work during the 
summer vacation. The whole general trend in the courses for elementary 
schools is to include some work along agricultural lines so that the work of 
the school is brought into closer relation and has a direct bearing on the life 
on the farm. Special effort has been made to organize new schools. 
Missouri reports 110 consolidated schools, 30 of which were estab- 
lished during the past six months. Sixty-one of the consolidated 
schools maintained high-school departments in 1915-16; 3 have 
first-class approved high schools, 8 second-class, and 50 third-class 
high schools. High-school courses are being introduced into the 
consolidated schools very rapidly; 20 or more already have an- 
nounced their intention of creating such departments at the opening 
of the next school year. 
Louisiana reports that 43 of the new consolidated schools estab- 
lished during the year received special State aid for erecting build- 
ings. For each dollar expended by the State in this manner $4.34 
was expended from local funds. Other consolidated schools were 
established during the year which for various reasons did not receive 
any portion of the special State funds. 
New Jersey reports much progress in consolidation; Indiana re- 
ports that 48 rural high schools were commissioned during the year, 
all of which are connected with rural consolidated schools. Texas 
reports that probably 200 consolidated schools have been established 
during the year. 
HIGHER STANDARDS FOR THE PREPARATION OF RURAL SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
The problem of securing well-prepared teachers, with correct vision 
of rural life, continues to be a concern to the educators of the country. 
The outlook for an early realization of plans to provide a sufficient
-P-A-G-E-111
RURAL EDUCATION. 83 
number of capable rural teachers is, however, decidedly encouraging. 
Fight years ago less than a half score of normal schools had specifi- 
cally organized departments for preparing rural school teachers. 
Now 64 normal schools have such departments. In 1918, secondary 
schools in 12 States offered courses in preparing teachers for 
rural and other elementary schools. In 1916 this kind of pro- 
fessional preparation embraces 21 different States. Probably noth- 
ing that has been accomplished in the movement for better rural 
teachers recently is more encouraging than the share taken in 
the work by schools of education in colleges and universities and 
the agricultural colleges. ven the more conservative schools are 
now beginning to display a marked interest in helping to provide the 
right kind of rural teachers. 
At the same time, it is well to reemphasize that the movement is 
still in its beginnings. It requires approximately 365,000 teachers 
to supply the rural schools of the country. Of these, about 92,000 
leave the profession annually; meanwhile, to fill the places vacated, 
the colleges and normal schools supply approximately 1,000 gradu- 
ates and 11,000 teachers with a little professional preparation; and 
the training departments in secondary schools furnish another 12,000 
teachers. This leaves 68,000 rural teachers to be procured in other 
ways. Many of these enter upon professional work immediately 
from the high schools, or even from the elementary schools, with no 
professional preparation and little or no vision of rural school needs. 
Reasonable professional standards.—Professional and academic re- 
quirements for teacher certification are being raised at an encourag- 
. ing rate in a number of States, and the locally certificated amateur 
teacher will probably soon be a memory only in most States, Grad- 
uation from a standard four-year high school has been adopted as the 
minimum requirement in many sections of the country recently, and 
at least one semester of professional preparation in a standard nor: 
mal school or its equivalent has been set in several States as the 
minimum professional requirement. 
The Bureau of Education has recently proposed certain reasonable 
standards for a satisfactory State system of teacher preparation 
which might serve to determine the future policy of almost any 
State in the Union. This has resulted from educational surveys 
directed by the bureau in Iowa, Washington, North Dakota, and 
Wyoming.. The proposed standards would require that ultimately 
all teachers of the given State should be graduates from an accredited 
high school and should have had at least two years of professional 
preparation. These standards would apply to rural teachers as well 
as to village and city teachers. 
Proposed further training of teachers in service-—The process of 
eliminating the unprepared should be gradual, to permit teachers in
-P-A-G-E-112
    84 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
service to meet the new requirements without undue hardships. The 
conviction is growing that State departments, normal schools, and 
schools of education in colleges and universities can be of special 
assistance by organizing an effective extension service for further 
training of teachers in the field. In Connecticut this work is pro- 
moted successfully by the State board of education, and in Iowa on a 
large scale by the State Teachers College at Cedar Falls. The sur- 
vey committee of the Bureau of Education for the State of Washing- 
ton has proposed that the State be divided into extension service 
districts, one for each normal school, and that each normal school 
organize an extension service for its district on such lines as may 
appear best suited to the needs of the district and of the State. The 
committee favored the type of extension service utilized by the 
Iowa State Teachers College, but it believes that the determination 
of the exact plan of extension to be adopted in Washington should 
be made by the heads of the normal schools acting in conference. 
Opportunity of the schools of education.—The most serious handi- 
cap in the movement to prepare the right type of rural teachers is 
the lack of thoroughly prepared experts to take charge of this train- 
ing. Urgent demands come for instructors from every section of 
the country, although the supply is, unfortunately, too small to meet 
the demands. Here is the great opportunity of the schools of educa- 
tion. The normal schools will have all they can do to prepare the 
immediate teaching staff for rural communities; the majority of 
rural supervisors, heads of normal-school rural-teacher training de- 
partments and directors of high-school training classes must have a 
more thoroughgoing preparation, such as schools of education should 
bést be prepared to give. 
Teachers College of Columbia University, the University of Chi- 
cago, Johns Hopkins University, Peabody College for Teachers, 
Nashville, Tenn., the school of education in the University of 
Georgia, and many other schools have begun an effective work in 
the new field. In the 1916 summer session at Teachers College, 
Columbia University, by way of illustration, several hundred ma- 
ture teachers and rural leaders pursued courses in rural sociology 
and farm economics, rural school organization and administration, 
rural school management and special methods of teaching, and 
gardening and agriculture, together with practicums in the specific 
problems of rural life. 
Continued improvement in normal school rural teacher-training 
departments——The past year has shown further improvement in 
rural teacher-training work in the normal schools. The number of ~ 
specifically organized departments has increased from 43 to 64, while 
1 Described in detail in the chapter on Rural Education in the Annual Report of the 
Commissioner of Education for 1915.
-P-A-G-E-113
    
RURAL EDUCATION. 85 
about 30 other normal schools offer general courses. In addition to 
this, at least 60 normal schools offer instruction to teachers of agri- 
culture. 
In the Nebraska State Normal Schools the course of study used for 
the preparation of rural teachers in normal school teacher-training 
departments may be illustrated by the following course used in the 
normal schools of Nebraska. This course, which was given in a 
modified form in the commissioner’s report of a year ago, has now 
been further modified to meet the needs of rural teachers.

HIGHER STANDARDS OF TEACHER-TRAINING IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Teacher training in secondary schools has made steady progress 
during the year. It is now promoted in 21 States under the names 
of county training schools, teacher-training departments in connec- 
tion with high schools, and teacher training as part of regular high- 
school courses. Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Florida have organ- 
ized courses during the year. 
Oklahoma has organized teacher-training departments in 42 high 
schools, with 500 graduates the first year. The State has begun 
wisely by planning the departments as a fifth or graduate year, since 
only graduates from accredited four-year high schools are accepted 
as matriculants in the new departments. 
Florida grants State aid in the sum of $500 annually to any high 
school in the State offering training courses, provided that the di- 
rector in charge of the course receives at least $1,000 per annum in 
salary. Only seven departments have so far been organized under 
the new act. 
Under section 88 of its school laws, West Virginia has organized 
new “short courses” in its 6 normal schools, in a number of denomi- 
61355°—16——8
-P-A-G-E-114
    86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
national schools, and in 12 high schools. This places the study 
courses in secondary institutions on an equality with the short courses 
in the normal schools. This is accounted for in the urgent need 
for more trained teachers in the State. 
The standards set for entrance to the training classes are being 
raised gradually in a number of States. Oklahoma began by accept- 
ing four-year graduates only. Ohio has two courses, one of them 
being for graduates only, and this course enrolls the great majority 
of the teachers now in training. By 1917 all teachers in the State 
of New York are required to have completed at least four years’ work 
in a standard high school and to have had one year of professional 
training, which is the equivalent of making the New York training 
departments a graduate course. In Minnesota students entering 
these departments must possess 12 high-school credits for the year 
1916-17, and, beginning September, 1917, all students taking the 
work must complete the full four-year high-school course. After 
September, 1917, the rural training course will be on a postgraduate 
basis. Nevada also selects its training school material from grad- 
uates of standard high schools exclusively. 
In Oregon no person is now allowed to teach in rural schools who 
has not completed an elementary training school course. In Ver- 
mont, according to the State commissioner of education “there will 
be available for the coming year a trained teacher, of at least one 
year of training, for every vacancy that may occur in the rural 
schools.” 
Many of the training departments devote considerable time to the 
underlying problems of country life. They are able to imbue their 
students with the new rural life point of view and outlook on agri- 
cultural life. Success or failure in accomplishing these desirable 
ends lies almost wholly in the kind of training for their work that 
’ the directors of the departments themselves have pursued before tak- 
ing up their important tasks. Specialists are required for this work, 
and if these have not always been found it is the business of the 
State department to see that they are improved while in service. 
How this is done in the State of Minnesota may be seen in the follow- 
ing suggestions issued to training-department directors by the State 
supervisor of teacher-training : 
1. One of the chief needs for the improvement of this work is better facilities 
for practice in actual rural schools. To provide this, we are now developing 
special rural demonstration schools in connection with other departments. 
Last year 35 such rural schools were in operation, and about 70 will probably 
be established next year. 
2. The most important improvement of this work will come through improyv- 
ing the teachers. Special summer courses at the University of Minnesota are 
now offered for training teachers. Seventy of the 180 teachers in the State 
are enrolled in these courses this summer. Others are in attendance at Colum- 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  RURAL EDUCATION. 87 
bia, Chicago, and elsewhere. These courses, the annual conference for training 
teachers, and the increasing requirements for indorsements of teachers in this 
field, all tend rapidly toward the improvement of our teaching corps. 
3. Another significant development for the improvement for rural teacher- 
training is our system of “ follow up work.” Under this plan all training teach- 
ers now Visit, supervise, and assist their young graduates during their first year 
of.teaching in the country. This assistance of the training teacher is realized 
through personal visits in the rural schools taught by graduates, through alumni 
associations, teachers’ meetings, monthly letters, circulars, etc., and is proving 
most effective. 
4. The increased requirements for admission of students of this course, par- 
ticularly the new rules, making the course a graduate year and requiring certain 
prerequisite courses in the junior and senior years of the high school, are also a 
significant step toward the improvement of the work. 
5. The increased State aid ($1,200) now available for this work also makes 
possible the employment of better teachers and the purchase of better and fuller 
: equipment. 
6. Last, but not least, the employment of a special State supervisor for this 
work has guarded and assisted the development of the work, encouraged the 
teachers, and been the means of bringing about several improvements which 
would be impossible in States employing no.special supervisor. 
IMPROVEMENT IN THE RURAL SCHOOL COURSE OF STUDY. 
All educators must be aware that readjustments are taking place 
in the material and methods used in the rural schools, but such a hold 
has tradition on what is taught and learned that many schools con- 
tinue to cling to much of the subject matter and methods of teaching 
pursued by teachers of long ago. It is dawning upon teachers every- 
where that there is too much of the abstract, too much of empty 
phrases, taught in rural schools, mainly because these things were in 
the course of study handed down from the past. In justice to the 
individual teachers it must be said that, if they had been at liberty 
to do so, many would have cast aside much of the traditional accumu- 
lation for which they can see no justification. 
School officials, especially in rural communities, still dictate to the 
teachers too often what they shall and shall not teach. Likewise, 
the reorganization of school work is hampered by established State 
courses of study which were originally drawn up for the elementary 
schools. A few States, notably Louisiana, have undertaken to pro- 
vide separate courses for their rural schools. In some State and 
local courses of study unavailing efforts have been made to satisfy 
modern demands by patching a little here and there, as with patches 
on an old garment, thereby overcrowding an already overloaded 
course. It is a mistake to think that such patchwork will satisfy 
the demand of the Nation’s agricultural population, which is striv- 
ing at this time to set its house in order in the midst of an epoch- 
making national transition. Before the readjustments can be real- 
ized, the course of study for rural schools must be fundamentally 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  
  88 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
recast, new textbooks must be written specifically for rural children, 
State and local study outlines and syllabi must be modified to suit 
these needs, and educators instead of laymen must decide what shall 
be taught and what shall be left out. 
A course of study based on what rural people ought to know.— 
Serious questions arise as to just how far the rural schools of the 
Nation teach what a modern agricultural population ought to know 
in order to get the greatest good out of life. It is asked, Do the 
schools provide the kind of instruction required to keep the people 
in enjoyment of good health and sanitary surroundings? Do the 
schools prepare them to earn remunerative livings out of the land? 
Do they direct them to become useful, responsible members of the 
larger social group? And do the schools so direct the people that 
they will devote a well-earned leisure to ethical and esthetical pur- 
suits in the country for the improvement of self and the upbuilding 
of the community? 
In 1918 the Bureau of Education began a study of what the rural 
population ought to know in order to live wholesome, contented, 
and profitable lives on the land or away from it, if they should be- 
come attracted by the call and move to city places. Rural people in — 
every section of the country were requested to give their views. Ag- 
ricultural leaders and rural-life experts in large number were com- 
municated with on the subject. The keynote sounding through all 
the responses was that the school devotes too much time to acquiring 
the working tools of an education, because the subject matter is 
cumbered with all kinds of unnecessary timber and the methods of 
presentation of the subject matter are inadequate. Upon the whole, 
it was held that the schools do not devote enough time to the things 
which serve a real purpose. It seemed the consensus of opinion that 
the school should no longer limit its activities by the four walls of 
the schoolhouse or the two covers of the textbook. Every activity 
of the community should be reflected in the curriculum; the farm 
place, the fields, and the forest should be made laboratoniad for 
working material for the new school. 
The reconstruction of the rural-school course of study is going for- 
ward in some sections of the country as a gradual evolution. Certain 
State teachers’ associations, as those of Minnesota and Iowa, have 
made studies of the elementary school course of study, which recom- 
mend the elimination of a great deal of useless teaching material, 
and in its place suggest the introduction of new subject materials 
adapted to help rural people attain happy, healthful, and remunera- 
tive living conditions. To this may be added the necessity of re- 
directing whatever has been retained in the old curriculum after 
the first elimination to give a more direct application and utility.
-P-A-G-E-117
    
RURAL EDUCATION. 89 
It is encouraging to note that several national textbook publishing 
houses have undertaken to provide textbooks particularly adapted 
to rural needs. Already a number of textbooks in arithmetic, rural- 
community civics, and home economics have appeared, while many 
others are in course of preparation. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION IN RURAL SCHOOLS.* 
The question of health and sanitation is receiving considerable 
attention in many States at this time. People are beginning to 
realize that too much has been left to the natural healthfulness of 
the rural environment and that, accordingly, the country has failed 
to make the most of its advantages over the city. 
Health inspection in Pennsylvania rural schools—Pennsylvania 
has probably done more than any other State to disclose the true 
facts of hygienic conditions in its rural communities. The work of 
inspection is in charge of the State commissioner of health and is 
done by successful practitioners under his direction. 
It is of interest to note how at first the majority of the directors 
of the 2,236 school districts “clung tenaciously to the idea that 
country boys and girls must of necessity be sound and healthy.” 
Many directors went so far as to write the State health commissioner 
declining to have their schools examined, for the reason that “as 
the majority of children in our district are native born, medical 
inspection of schools would be a waste of time and money.” These 
school officers have had occasion recently to change their minds on 
this subject, since the examination shows that 94.95 per cent of 
the native-born children are defective physically in one way or 
another. The medical examinations have now become State wide. 
During the 1914-15 school year 469,199 children in 17,823 school- 
rooms were examined. This covered examinations in 2,184 rural 
districts of a possible total of 2,236. Of this number 335,427, or 
71.48 per cent, were classed as physically defective; 318,484, or 
94.95 per cent, were native born and 16,943, or 5.05 per cent, were 
foreign born; 83,749 children were found to have defective vision; 
15,600 had defective hearing; 22,837 defective breathing; 12,322 de- 
fective tonsils; and 212,708, defective teeth. Some of the children 
were afflicted with many of these ailments, others with only one. 
IMPROVEMENTS IN RURAL SCHOOLHOUSE PLANS AND ARCHITECTURE. 
State and county reports for the past year have materially in- 
creased the space usually allotted to rural schoolhouse plans and 
architecture. This increased interest is general and not confined to 
any particular locality. A strong tendency is noted to make the   
1See Ch. XIX, “ Educational Hygiene,” of this report.  
-P-A-G-E-118
  90 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
one-teacher school more than a one-room school. Plans for rural 
schoolhouses frequently provide, besides the classroom, special rooms 
in the second story or adjoining the classroom, with movable parti- 
tions, for an assembly hall to be used for community gathering, 
another small room for a library and reading room, also a room to 
serve as special classroom or general utility room, where instruction 
may be given in manual training, domestic science, and for serving 
the noon-day lunch. These improvements demonstrate the possi- 
bilities for a much wider use of the one-teacher school. 
Through a recent act of the State legislature, every public school- 
house in Oregon has been made a civic center, under the control of 
the school board, where the citizens may engage in supervised recrea- 
tional activities, and where they may discuss subjects pertaining to 
educational, political, economic, artistic, and moral interests of the 
public. 
The newer rural school buildings do not follow the old traditional 
types. Indeed, they might easily be mistaken for attractive homes. 
The one-story plan is growing in favor in rural consolidated districts 
where sufficient ground can be purchased at reasonable prices. The 
advantages of this plan are, first, it protects against loss of life by 
fire; second, it helps conserve the health of pupils; and, third, it 
permits the adoption of a unit plan to which additions may easily 
be made without destroying the beauty of the architectural designs. 
RURAL SCHOOL GROUNDS AND SANITATION, 
The bulletins issued by the State departments of education giving 
plans of school buildings also contain model school grounds, espe- 
cially for consolidated schools where large grounds and a teacher’s 
home are essential. A plan whereby school grounds may be used to 
the best advantage for the purpose of gardening and play should be 
considered before any building is constructed. Too many school 
buildings in rural districts are placed upon the school lot in such 
a way that much of the ground can not be utilized for play activities 
or gardens because of the location of the school building, and the 
expense of moving the building is considered too great for the ad- 
vantage to be gained. 
The State board of health of California has issued a special bulle- 
tin, No. 10, distributed free by the school authorities of the State, in 
which rural sanitation is fully discussed, with special reference to 
conditions in the mountain regions. An earnest and effective cam- 
paign has been conducted in the mountain districts of California 
during the past year. Complete reports are not at this time avail- 
able, but in one county 90 per cent of the 43 one-teacher rural schools 
were improved to conform with the State regulations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  RURAL EDUCATION. 91 
During the annual meeting of the county superintendents of the 
State of Texas, held at Austin in July, the question of schoolhouse 
sanitation was presented. Excellent charts were exhibited showing 
improved plans for sanitary rural school buildings. These charts 
were explained by an expert from the State university. 
That good janitor service is an important factor in rural school 
sanitation is realized by State boards of health in some States. 
In Salt Lake County, Utah, a janitors’ institute is held annually. 
Every person engaged in cleaning and caring for schoolhouses is 
expected to attend the institute and to receive instructions from 
members of the board of health or others capable of giving it. In the 
same State an annual “round-up” is held in the Jordan District 
rural high school. A special feature of the program is rural sanita- 
tion, both as it applies to the rural schoolhouse and the home. 
In Illinois a law was passed by the last legislature authorizing 
the State superintendent of public instruction to specify and publish 
the minimum requirements for heating, lighting, ventilating, seating, 
water supply, toilet facilities, and safety against fire. The county 
superintendent was empowered to inspect all plans for new school 
buildings and for remodeling old ones. The law requires old school 
buildings to be remodeled to conform with the regulations of the 
State superintendent. The penalty for noncompliance is the with- 
drawal of the district’s share of the State distributive fund. 
Alabama has issued during the year Bulletin No. 52 on “ Rural 
Schoolhouses and Grounds,” with suggestions for the erection, re- 
pair, and equipment of school buildings. This bulletin was issued 
as a guide to standardize the schools of the State. 
Oklahoma has issued “A Guide to Better Schools,” replete with 
suggestions for teachers, especially in regard to sanitation. The 
State superintendent is planning to use this bulletin as a supplement 
to the adopted course of study. 
Texas has issued a bulletin explaining the law for constructing 
schoolhouses, passed by the thirty-third legislature. This law re- 
quires State approval of all school plans where the cost of the build- 
ing is $400 or over. The State superintendent remarks that— 
Adequate lighting, heating, and ventilation cost but little more than inade- 
quate and infinitely less when the cost borne by the individual of curing some 
disease is taken into consideration, to say nothing of the suffering and perhaps 
permanent injury that may result. 
RURAL HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The early American high schools did not operate in rural districts. 
They were planned for an urban population and offered studies such 
as urban children were supposed to need. In rural districts the
-P-A-G-E-120
92 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
one-teacher school continued for a long time as the only school 
for all the children; or the children might go to town to high 
school, with generally disastrous results for their future as agricul- 
tural people. Some people—farmers among them—have the false 
notion that to differentiate between urban and rural folk in educa- 
tional matters is to discriminate in favor of city children and that 
the whole matter is an attempt to set up an agricultural caste and 
to cut off rural children from the supposedly greater opportunities 
of city life. The whole is based on the assumption that urban life 
is superior to rural life, which, to thinking people at least, seems 
utterly without foundation. 
The rural high-school course of study must be as broadly cultural 
as any planned for the urban population, a culture related to pres- 
ent and future problems rather than old traditions. But most 
important of all, the course of study must be rooted to the agricul- 
tural community, to the earth as source and background. The rural 
high-school course of study must have its basis in the new agricul- 
tural sciences and not in the old traditional studies. Ancient lan- 
guage will probably have no place in the new course; the mother 
tongue, on the other hand, will hold an important place. Pure 
science is largely minimized, and the applied forms will take its 
place. The new interpretation is well made in the four-year courses 
of the average North Carolina farm-life schools and in county and 
agricultural high schools, particularly in the Southern States, in 
the high schools and the consolidated schools in several of the 
Middle Western States, and in the associated schools of Minnesota. 
Rural high schools in the Southt—The South has many problems 
bequeathed it by a social and economic régime fast passing away. 
The people of the South are convinced that school education alone 
can solve these difficulties. To establish good schools—elementary, 
secondary, and higher—within reach of all the people, has become 
a patriotic motive in many Southern States. Public taxation and 
private benevolence are invoked to the cause. The old private sec- 
ondary schools with their conventional studies are rapidly being 
supplanted by high schools of a practical sort within reach of all 
the people. 
Perhaps the General Education Board should have credit for 
much of what has been accomplished the last few years for sec- 
ondary education in the South, through its liberality in paying the 
salaries and expenses of the professors of secondary education estab- 
lished in connection with 11 Southern States and in appropriating 
funds for establishing high schools. On the other hand, this work   
1See chapter on Rural Education, Rep. of Commiss. of Educa. for 1915.

would have been futile except for the stimulating propaganda long 
carried on by the Conference for Education in the South,' the South- 
ern Education Board, and the Peabody Board. 
Agricultural life holds important place in the southern educational 
reorganization. Virginia appropriates anually large sums for agri- 
cultural and manual training departments in rural and town high 
schools; Tennessee duplicates out of the State fund all local appro- 
priations for the teaching of industrial subjects to the amount of 
$1,500 annually; Georgia has created congressional district agricul- 
tural high schools, each with an annual State appropriation of 
$10,000; Mississippi and several other States have county high 
schools; and North Carolina, finally, has its county farm-life schools, 
ELIMINATION OF RURAL ILLITERACY. 
The campaign to blot out adult illiteracy in rural communities is 
going forward at a very satisfactory rate. “Moonlight schools” 
have now been in operation since 1912, when Mrs. Cora Wilson 
Stewart, of Rowan County, Ky., initiated the movement. At first 
the schools were limited to a few remote regions of the southern 
mountains. Similar schools are now found in other sections of the 
United States. Adult aliens have brought considerable illiteracy into 
New England and the North Atlantic States; the States bordering on 
Mexico have a similar problem; the Pacific Coast States have illiter- 
ates of oriental origin. Seventeen States in all are conducting moon- 
light schools. North Carolina, the first State to follow Kentucky’s 
Jead, reports 10,000 illiterate adults in school in 1916. Alabama is 
struggling to eliminate Negro illiteracy. Oklahoma, meanwhile, is 
doing a similar work among its Indians, and in New Mexco an earnest 
campaign is on to educate a large population of Spanish American 
origin, the county superintendent of Santa Fe County alone report- 
ing 1,500 grown men and women in school eager for the rudiments of 
an education, most of these in rural moonlight schools. 
RURAL CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
Another important problem is how best to assist the many thou- 
sand farm youth who for economic reasons can not attend school 
regularly or who have been obliged to leave school before attaining 
the degree of learning necessary for most successful living. Pennsyl- 
vania, Massachusetts, and several other States have recently estab- 
lished State-aided systems of continuation schools for the people, 
urban and rural. Several others have done this service for the city 
population, without including rural districts. Occasionally the peo- 
ple in rural districts have taken the matter into their own hands and   
1 Now the Southern Conference for Education and Industry.
-P-A-G-E-122
  
  94 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
have formed volunteer organizations to provide what the State has 
_ heglected to give. 
Unique rural continuation schools have been in operation in Cher- 
okee County, Iowa, for several years. They were organized by 
County Supt. Katherine Ross Logan, who determined to help in a 
practical way the “ grown-ups” of the community who could not take 
advantage of the regular district schools. The “township special 
schools,” as they are called, have done much to satisfy these de- 
mands. The schools are, briefly, volunteer organizations which can 
be adjusted to the needs of the people. They are usually in opera- 
tion during the winter months, when farm folk are most at leisure. 
An inexpensive building is secured, either by lease or construction, 
with two or three rooms. A simple equipment for handwork and 
domestic science and a small agricultural laboratory are provided. 
Two well-prepared teachers usually have charge of the school, which 
is small—from 20 to 30 students in all. The students are people eager 
for instruction. The instruction is individual in nature, each one 
continuing study where he left off in the district school. The plan 
reminds one much of the Danish schools for small holders, which 
require no entrance examinations and give no graduation diplomas. 
The small-hold schools, like the Iowa system, aim to fit the studies to 
the exact needs of the people; to impart as large a store of culture as 
possible without giving the people a contempt for farm life and work 
with the hands. 
No other State probably has been quite so successful as Massa- 
chusetts in organizing vocational education for all its people, whether 
living in town or in the country. The vocational schools comprise 
not only day schools for boys and girls, but part-time schools for 
young people between 14 and 16 years, and evening schools for 
grown men and women. The aim is to reach all the people of the 
Commonwealth in need of help. The schools appeal especially to 
young people who have left the public schools at too early an age 
to be effectively prepared for life’s responsibilities.+ 
Pennsylvania has recently inaugurated a system of State-aided 
vocational schools which embraces practical work in agriculture and 
other industrial subjects similar to the Massachusetts system. 
PUBLICATIONS ON RURAL EDUCATION OF THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
A large number of publications on rural and agricultural educa- 
tion have been compiled or distributed by the Bureau of Education 
during the year. These include occasional bulletins and rural school 
letters published by the bureau, together with pamphlets and bro- 
chures published by other organizations but distributed by the bureau.

CHAPTER VI. 
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
By Frorence C. Fox, 
Specialist in Educational Systems, Bureau of Education. 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
One of the most definite recent steps toward the improvement of 
the elementary school is the organization of the National Council of 
Primary Education. The object of the council is the betterment of 
the primary school in administration, curriculum, and quality of in- 
struction. Its membership includes men and women in various fields 
of work who are interested in primary education. Meetings have 
been held in conjunction with the last three or four national edu- 
cational meetings, and informal programs have been given. The 
question of freedom for the child and for the teacher has been the 
leading topic of discussion in these gatherings. 
Through the cooperation of the Bureau of Education the reports of 
the meetings have been distributed to 36,000 primary teachers, and 
a questionnaire regarding the activities in vogue in the first three 
grades has been sent out with each report. The returns from these 
inquiries have come back in large numbers. They report on the 
amount of time spent, with what subjects correlated, and to what 
extent handwork, including modeling, drawing, painting, cutting, 
building on the sand table, weaving, sewing, and stenciling, have 
been used in each school; and to what extent games and dramatiza- 
tion, music, and nature study have entered into the daily program of 
each teacher. Later these data will be tabulated and sent out to the 
educational public as an exposition of the work of the primary school 
in the social arts and the plastic arts and crafts, as shown by the 
personal testimony of many teachers in the United States. 
Tt is expected that questions of method, the best and most economi- 
cal way of teaching, and many other problems pertinent to the pri- 
mary school will occupy the attention of this organization from time 
to time, and that valuable contributions will be made to the work of 
investigation being carried on in the field of education.

STANDARD TESTS. 
Scientific measurement in the elementary school is gradually mak- 
ing its way. As grade teachers become familiar with the contri- 
butions in this field, they are realizing the practical value of these 
contributions for the work of teaching. At the National Education 
Association meeting in New York in July, 1916, a Baltimore County 
teacher testified to the systematic use made of standard scales and 
tests in the schools of Baltimore County. She showed that with one 
group of teachers, at least, there was no longer question of the use- 
fulness of the efficiency tests. There is evidence that grade teachers 
are becoming familiar by use with Thorndike’s work in establishing 
a norm of achievement in visual vocabulary; with Gray’s efforts to 
establish a norm for oral and silent reading which shall be a just and 
reasonable scale for use in any grade in any school; with Ayres’s 
spelling scale, Courtis’s norms of achievement in arithmetic, and the 
other beginnings of scientific measurement. Many progressive 
teachers are ready to believe that almost every branch of learning in 
the grades will eventually be standardized, and an equitable basis of 
comparison fixed for pupils of the same grade, for pupils of different 
grades, and for one school system in comparison with another. It is 
felt that the standard test will eventually serve a three-fold purpose— 
to check up the ability of the pupils in a system of schools, to furnish 
other schools a basis of comparison, and to furnish a basis of transfer 
from one school system to another. 
EXPERIMENTATION, 
Never before has private enterprise been so interested in promoting 
movements of elementary education as now. Great fortunes are 
placed at the disposal of educational experts to finance these move- 
ments. In normal schools, and in public and private university 
schools of education, new ideas are being tried. An important session 
of the kindergarten section of the National Education Association 
at New York in July was given over to a discussion of experiments 
going on in the field of elementary education throughout the country. 
Sometimes it was a matter of method—teaching biology by field 
excursion and contact with real living things; sometimes it was an 
activity—building a city with blocks on the schoolroom floor; or it 
might be a question of curriculum, each child working through the 
course of study by himself as his inclination might lead him. The 
desire to free the child and to help him use his own initiative seemed 
to be the aim of these methods. In this respect the stimulating in- 
fluence of Montessori is everywhere evident. The observer is im- 
pressed with the tendency of progressive teachers to try out in an im- 
partial way the conclusions of psychology and the scientific study of
-P-A-G-E-127

education to ascertain the element of workable truth that may be in 
them. 
Typical of the new interest in elementary education is the entrance 
of the General Education Board into this field with an important 
program. Through the rural school supervisors of the South and 
in other ways the board had already considered the elementary prob- 
lem from a practical viewpoint, but only recently did it definitely 
enter the general field of elementary educational theory. The paper ~ 
by Abraham Flexner on “The Modern School” attacks radically 
much of the current practice in education, with special reference to 
elementary education. The changes advocated, while not new to the 
reader of Dewey’s “Schools of To-morrow,” Bobbitt’s “ What the 
Schools Teach and Might Teach,” and other books of the kind, are 
sufficiently sensational to have caused real commotion in the ranks 
of school men. Dr. Flexner compares the “ traditional school” with 
the “modern school” and enumerates the defects of the former in 
contradistinction to the advantages of the latter. The discussion is 
presented, first, by a consideration of “ Current Education”; second, 
“A Modern Conception of Education”; third, “A Modern Curricu- 
lum”; fourth, “ What the Curriculum Omits”; fifth, “Extra Cur- 
ricular Activities”; sixth, “Organization of the Modern School”; 
and seventh, “ Possible Results.” Another paper of the board’s, Dr. 
Eliot’s “ Changes Needed in American Secondary Education,” has 
an important bearing on the type of elementary schooling that shall 
precede the high school advocated. 
The primary teacher interested in the practical aspects of her art 
will find much of real value in the sections on instruction in the sur- . 
vey which the board made in Maryland. Even more fruitful a test 
of the investigating process applied to the elementary education 
field should come in the board’s study of the Gary schools, since the 
Gary experiment involves the whole problem of changes in educa- 
tional viewpoint. When the Gary investigation is completed it is 
proposed. to issue “a full and authoritative account of this interest- 
ing experiment in public education.” 
Recent announcements of the General Education Board also carry 
a statement of what is more or less of a new departure in the field of 
investigation, that of studying the school possibilities of the unusu- 
ally gifted child. The board says: “Up to this time much special 
study has been devoted to improving the education of defective chil- 
dren, but comparatively little attention has been devoted to a sys- 
tematic and thorough study of the talented child.” Prof. Guy M. 
Whipple, who has the work in charge, will endeavor to find out “ How 
early in their school life gifted children can be spotted, how much 
school time and energy they can economize, as well as how much 
additional training and mental equipment they can obtain during
-P-A-G-E-128
  100 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
their school years.” In this connection it is worth noting that a 
large private school in New York City has for the past three or four 
years been segregating the bright pupils and grouping the slower 
ones in small classes under special instruction, with the result that 
a gain of one or two years is made in the elementary school course 
by the pupils of the higher ability. 
That the movement in experimentation is spasmodic and inter- 
mittent, that there is a certain element of danger to the children 
experimented upon, and more of loss than advantage unless children 
are carefully guarded against certain types of experimenters, is be- 
yond question. General supervision by a board of experts of all ex- 
periments that deal with little children, and the establishment of ex- 
periment stations throughout the country where investigations and 
experiments could be carried on under this supervision for a term of 
years, would give to the movement what it now lacks—balance, co- 
herence, and continuity. 
CITY RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS.* 
The movement in the larger city school systems to establish depart- 
ments of educational research has special meaning for elementary 
education. The work of these departments and bureaus has con- 
tributed materially to the literature of elementary education during 
the year. The Boston school department’s sixth circular deals with 
“Determining a Standard in Accurate Copying.” A test was given 
to first-year high-school pupils in Boston to find to what extent ele- 
mentary school graduates were able to meet a theoretical standard in 
copying. The bulletin sets forth the value of ability to copy accu- 
rately in many fields of work outside the school as well as in, and by 
means of scores and graphs decides that “only a very small percent- 
age of the children tested reached the ideal of accuracy set up in the 
theoretically established standard.” Other circulars in the series dis- 
cuss “ Determining the degree of difficulty of spelling words”; “ Pro- 
visional courses of study for the grades”; “Supplementary lists of - 
authorized texts”; “A syllabus for the elementary. schools.” 
The Oakland (Cal.) bureau of research has issued several bulletins 
on conducting research work in the schools. How to guard the 
teachers’ and the pupils’ time against intrusion in this work and how 
to conduct investigations in an economical way are the main problems 
considered. The New Orleans bureau has published some significant 
data concerning the progress of children in the city schools. Meas- 
urements in elementary education, a study of delinquent and destitute 
boys in the city, and a vocational survey for the Central Trades 
School, are some of the problems that have been under consideration.

UNIVERSITY CONFERENCES IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
Dr. Charles H. Judd notes in a recent issue of the Elementary 
School Journal that— 
One of the most impressive manifestations of the growing unity of the Ameri- 
can educational system is the fact that a number of leading universities have 
organized conferences with the superintendents and teachers of the elementary 
schools. These conferences are due in part to the initiative of the department 
of education, but more fundamentally they are due to the universities that are 
beginning to recognize the general principle that a development of the science 
of education is a part of the business of our higher institutions. 
The University of Pennsylvania has organized a schoolmen’s week. 
At Indiana University a conference on scientific measurement has 
been organized, continuing the work begun the year before. The 
Universities of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa have brought school 
superintendents or supervisors together for a week of discussion of 
problems in supervision. The effect of these gatherings of superin- 
tendents, supervisors, and teachers for free and full discussion of 
practical teaching problems, against the background of modern 
theory, must sooner or later have an immeasurable effect upon cur- 
rent practice in elementary education. 
CURRICULA AND METHODS. 
Everywhere to-day the social aspect of education is being empha- 
sized. Dewey tells us, in his “Schools of To-morrow,” that the ac- 
quiring of information “apart from its social bearings is worse 
than futile”; that to train the child in modes of skill “apart from 
the realization of the social uses to which they are to be put is fairly 
criminal,” and that information must always be connected up with 
the activities of life. 
The aim is not to prepare breadwinners. But, since men and women are 
normally engaged in breadwinning vocations, they need to be intelligent in the 
conduct of their households, the care of their children, the management of 
farms and shops, and the political conduct of a democracy where industry is 
the prime factor. 
Bobbitt urges that those studies which are included in the ele- 
mentary school program be selected with the greatest caré, for, he 
declares, “in view of its function, elementary education must be in- 
tensely practical, touching life at its greatest need.” He would give 
three tests to the matter to be included in elementary instruction: 
‘1. Is this knowledge essential to prepare the child to make a living under 
present economical conditions? 
2. Is this knowledge essential to prepare the child to fulfill the obligations of 
a parent and to perform the duties of a citizen? 
8. Is this knowledge essential to prepare the child for a rich and personal 
life and a life of rectitude in the social order? 
61355°—16——9  
-P-A-G-E-130
    102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
More and more the expert in educational theory and practice in- 
sists that the curriculum shall be made practical, and not only prac- 
tical but adjustable, capable of adaptation to different environments 
and localities. Dr. Frank McMurry has called this type of course of 
study “the neighborhood curriculum.” 
Dr. Flexner, in the paper already cited, is convinced that “ our 
more or less monastic course of study has survived, in part, at least, 
because it has become a fetich, because successive generations have 
gone on teaching it without looking for specific results.” In his 
modern school, children are to be taught “with an eye to the reali- 
ties of life and existence,” and the neighborhood in which the child 
lives is to be used as a laboratory for this teaching. 
Let us imagine a “ modern school ” located in the City of New York. Consider 
for a moment its assets for educational purposes: The harbor, the Metropolitan 
Museum, the Public Library, the Natural History Museum, the Zoological Gar- 
dens, the city government, the Weather Bureau, the transportation system, 
lectures, concerts, plays, and so on. Other communities have less, but all have 
much, As things now are, children living in this rich, tingling environment get 
for the most part precisely the same education that they would be getting in, 
let us say, Oshkosh or Keokuk. 
Correlation -of one subject with another, and the power which one 
subject possesses to enhance and enrich another, ‘are receiving more 
attention in elementary education than heretofore. A disposition to 
cut down and lop off all extraneous matter from the curriculum and 
then to form a close union between the subjects left, teaching them 
in the schoolroom as the child would find them in the world outside, 
marks a decided step in later school methods. Says Dr. Flexner: 
The traditional school teaches composition in the English classics; quanti- 
tive work in the mathematics classes; history, literature, and so on in their 
appropriate divisions. Efforts are indeed making to overcome this separate- 
ness, but they have gone only a little way. The modern school would from the 
first undertake the cultivation of contacts and cross-connections, Every exer- 
cise would be a spelling lesson; science, industry, history, civics, literature, 
and geography would to some extent utilize the same material. 
In the special subjects of study, the elimination of waste in arith- 
metic has received first attention. A revised program in elementary 
arithmetic is suggested in the fourteenth yearbook of the National 
Society for the Study of Education. The following eliminations 
are recommended : 
Apothecaries’ weight, alligation, aliquot parts, annual interest, cube root, 
cases in percentage, compound and complex fractions of more than two digits, 
compound proportion, dram, foreign money, folding paper, the long method of 
greatest common divisor, longitude and time, least common multiple, metric 
system, progression, quarter in avordupois table, reduction of more than two 
steps, troy weight, true discount, unreal fractions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
   
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 103 
On the other hand, the committee recommends that increased 
emphasis be placed upon the fundamentals in arithmetic, viz, addi- 
tion, subtraction, multiplication, division of whole numbers and 
fractions, and that the applications of arithmetic to the social and 
“economic conditions of the day be given especial attention. 
That “literature” in the elementary grades shall come under this 
pruning process and be made to serve the purpose of ethical training 
is another demand with considerable backing. The teachers of 
Chicago follow a course which was compiled some years ago by a 
committee of principals and teachers in the city schools, listed under 
the title of “ Home and community,” “Ideals of life and conduct,” 
“Heroism and romance,” and many others of like significance. Miss 
Mary McSkimmon, of Brookline, Mass., has outlined a similar course 
for that city. The literature for each grade is grouped about an 
ethical center as follows: 
Grade I. The love of home and the duties of children therein. 
Grade II. The love of animals and the responsibility for the care and 
happiness of pets. 
Grade III. Love of one another; the child as an individual member of the 
human brotherhood. 
Grade IV. The duty of self-control. 
Grade V. Courage; the duty of purposeful, heroic effort. 
Grade VI. Obedience, and service rendered through obedience. 
Grade VII. Wisdom; service through knowledge and goodness. 
Grade VIII. Patriotism; the character of a good citizen. 
Grade IX. Service through character. 
The national committee on minimum essentials approves this classi- 
fication and the accompanying lists of selections most highly, but 
adds a caution against a didactic treatment of the material in the 
classroom. ; 
In the study of English, the elimination of formal grammar has 
in some communities reached the stage advocated by Dr. Flexner: 
The modern school would not hesitate to take the risk to mental discipline 
involved in dropping the study of formal grammar. It would, tentatively at 
least, also risk the consequences to correct speech involved in the same step. 
For such evidence as we possess points to the futility of formal grammar as 
an aid to correct speaking and writing. 
In the teaching of beginning reading, the tendency for the last 
two years has seemed to be back toward the mechanical preparation 
on a phonic basis. While an occasional method has appeared that 
was based upon the technique of reading rather than on the “ thought- 
getting” process, the general trend has been for a combination of 
the thought and phonic method. Recently several of the book com- 
panies have issued systems of teaching reading which are wholly 
mechanical for the first few weeks of school, merging gradually into 
the content reading after the phonic drills have been given.
-P-A-G-E-132
  104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
The problem of reading is one of the most important in primary 
education at the present time. Elimination of waste is undoubtedly 
needed in this subject. Reports received by the Bureau of Educa- 
tion indicate the urgent need for investigation of the many types of 
methods of teaching reading. The need of experiment stations where 
the subject can be scientifically studied is sadly felt; to carry on a 
satisfactory investigation otherwise is well-nigh impossible. 
THE MONTESSORI MOVEMENT IN AMERICA. 
The Montessori movement continues to be of importance. New 
York City has been selected by those behind the movement as the 
starting point for a national campaign. In Greater New York there 
were 20 Montessori schools well established in the spring of 1916, 
and 10 new schools were to start in the fall. Six of these are 
nurseries, one being in a settlement school. The attendance numbers 
from 25 to 40 in each class. According to the National Montessori 
Association, there are now 189 “authorized” Montessori schools in 
the United States (i. e., schools taught by graduates or students of 
Dr. Montessori). Those not “authorized” in this sense, but called 
Montessori schools, are roughly estimated at 2,000. It is now pro- 
posed to organize Montessori elementary schools, with material and 
instruction adapted to elementary grade children. Madam Montes- 
sori has been working on this problem for many years, and her sets 
of material, together with the texts for instruction of teachers, have 
recently been released. The material for the nurseries, with which 
the United States is already familiar, is designed for children from 
2% to 6 years of age. The new material is declared to be graded and 
adapted to the child’s further development through the elementary 
school. It is a continuation of the occupations given to the children 
in the lower school, and includes activities for all the subjects of 
study, from phonetic alphabets in sand paper to complicated insets 
for a study of fractions and higher mathematics. 
Definite work in all the subjects of study will be carried on inten- 
sively through the following divisions of instruction: 
I. Simple number, to geometry. 
II. Natural science, into biology. 
III. Sounds and phonics, to literature. 
IV. Home geography, to advanced geography. 
V. History. 
VI. A scientific study of language—English. 
VII. Dramatization, to dramatic art. 
VIII. Sound appreciation, to technicalities in music and transposition of keys. 
IX. Writing. 
X. Design, to free-hand drawing and painting. 
The text includes for Part I, “The theory of elementary instruc- 
tion”; for Part IT, “The practical work with the materials.”

NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The programs for the elementary school teachers at the recent 
meeting of the National Education Association were remarkably 
attractive. Questions for the upper elementary grades were dis- 
cussed concerning transfer to the junior high school, changes in 
curricula, and the necessity of giving greater social, moral, and 
appreciative values to children of these grades. 
In the joint meeting of the kindergarten and the elementary school 
the question of equal hours and of equal pay for teachers of both 
schools was discussed. Practical means of unifying the two schools 
were considered. It was felt that, although kindergartens and pri- 
mary teachers have been debating this question for more than 25 
years, only in rare instances has something really been accomplished 
in readjusting the programs of the two schools and bringing them 
into closer harmony. Modern theory asserts that much of the kinder- 
garten material should be used in the grades. It was pointed out 
more than once at the New York meeting that Froebel’s classes were 
composed of children from the elementary school, and that Froebel 
designed much of his system of education, especially the occupations, 
for older children. Dr. Merriam’s practical experiment at the Uni- 
versity of Missouri in combining and overlapping the work of the 
kindergarten and the primary school received consideration, and it 
was agreed that his program deserved to be used as a guide by those 
who desire to bring the work of the two schools into closer accord. 
At one of the New York meetings the United States Commissioner 
of Education addressed a group of 90 leaders in primary education 
on the need of investigation and experimentation in the field of pri- 
mary instruction. He emphasized the need of the primary teacher 
to know why she teaches, what she teaches, and how she teaches. 
A plea was made for means by which investigations could be carried 
on under the supervision of the Bureau of Education, and the sug- 
gestion that. experiment stations shall be established where experi- 
mentation could be made under scientific conditions met with cordial 
response from the teachers present.

SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
By Tuomas H. Briggs. 
Associate Professor of Education, Teachers College, Columbia University. 
GROWTH OF HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The marvelous growth in secondary enrollment still continues, 
partly because of the increased number of high schools, partly 
because of provision for tuition without cost to boys and girls who 
live in districts without such schools, and partly because of the 
offering of courses to meet the needs of those who have previously left 
school on the completion of grade work. In almost every town a 
visitor is shown # new high-school building or told of plans that are 
under way in response to a popular demand. In this connection note 
must be made of occasional gifts by public-spirited citizens of high- 
school buildings and equipment to towns; Greenfield, Ohio, and 
Newport, N. H., are two places that have been thus favored recently. 
Under the new law in Illinois 180 township high schools have 
been organized, one of them with a district including as many as 
110 sections. The larger districts make possible at a moderate tax 
rate buildings completely equipped and an adequate corps of trained 
teachers. In Oregon, under the Lane law, any community or part- 
nership of communities may establish a high school, to be main- 
tained out of a fund raised by taxes levied on the property of the 
entire county. An annual sum of $40 a pupil is paid for the first 
20 pupils in regular attendance, $30 a pupil for the next 20 pupils 
in regular attendance, and $12.50 a pupil for all additional pupils 
in regular attendance. The Nebraska program for bringing high- 
school facilities to all the youth of the State, partly by a rearrange- 
ment of districts, has resulted in the establishment of 191 rural 
high schools during the past year, besides the addition of one year 
to the courses of a larger number of schools that formerly ended   
1There were 13,922 public and private high schools in 1915, with an aggregate enroll- 
ment of 1,484,028 students, an increase of 110,367 over the preceding year. This is an 
increase of more than 100 per cent in enrollment since 1902.

with the ninth, tenth, or eleventh grades. South Carolina and a 
few other States are advocating that each county levy a tax for 
secondary education, the schools being located ‘according to need by 
a central board. Maryland has for a long time used this plan. 
CRITICISM OF EXISTING CONDITIONS. 
With the rapid growth of high schools and the necessary tax 
levies for buildings; equipment, and maintenance, there has inevi- 
tably come criticism. Some of it is from those who merely object 
to paying for what they term “educational luxuries;” some is more 
intelligent, coming from those who, educated themselves, look on 
the school system as a whole and demand that each element justify 
itself relatively. As the number of high-school alumni increases, 
this latter type of intelligent criticism is likely to be heard more 
often. So far it concerns chiefly the cost of the high school as com- 
pared with the cost for the grades and the lack of provision in 
the program of studies for the needs of all the children. In his 
recent biennial report State Supt. Deyoe, of Iowa, expresses the 
caution that “no school should attempt high-school work at the 
expense of the work in the grades, which many districts in the State 
have been doing.” W. H. Hand, State high-school inspector for 
South Carolina, declares that “little, ambitious, so-called high 
schools are not only hurting their few high-school pupils, but they 
are robbing the elementary pupils of their due.” As no high school 
can have substantial growth unless the pupils in the grades are well 
trained, he recommends that 29 of the 177 high schools of the State 
be abolished. “My contention,” he writes in his annual report, “is 
strong that the State’s attention for the next few years should be 
centered upon making better high schools of those we have, and 
not upon establishing new ones.” Supt. J. T. Giles, of Richmond, 
Ind., presents without comment in “A statistical study of school 
reports from the 25 largest cities of Indiana ”+ the ratio in per cent 
of the total expenditure for high schools to the total expenditure for 
the grades. It ranges from 58 to 13, with a median of 35. State 
Supt. Keeler, of Michigan, points cut that it is necessary for small 
towns to furnish such education applying directly to the local situa- 
tion as will retain young people in the business and industry of the 
community.

this report are the ratio of the total average daily attendance in high school to that in 
the grades, the ratio of the number of high-school graduates to the average daily attend- 
ance, the ratio of the amount paid for teaching to the total cost in high school, the 
average annual cost per pupil enrolled in high school, the ratio of the number of high- 
school teachers to the number of grade teachers, and the ratio of the average daily 
attendance in high school to the number of high-school teachers.

THE SMALL HIGH SCHOOL. © 
There is evidence from many sources that more and more the 
small high school is coming to be adjusted directly and surely 
to its community. The practical arts high school in the village of 
Amherst, N. H.,1 is an interesting case in point. In the 90 or more 
high schools of New Hampshire, there are 55 domestic arts cur- 
ricula, 8 mechanic arts, and 37 commercial; about 70 per cent of the 
high schools have at least one form of the practical arts. This does 
not mean that these schools give scattered elective or optional courses 
in domestic arts, agriculture, etc. It means that each school has a 
definite four-year curriculum with a practical arts subject as its 
basal subject. For example, in the agricultural course there will 
be a year of farm carpentry, a year of forge work, and four years 
devoted to agronomy, horticulture, animal husbandry, farm manage- 
ment, etc. Publications by the State department of education show 
that New Hampshire is also doing much to improve the courses of 
study in academic subjects. In Michigan a pupil may get 17 hours 
of agriculture in one six-year course or 24 hours cf household arts 
in another.? 
Statements of principles in several reports show the tendency re- 
garding small high schools. Supt. Deyoe, of Iowa, writes:* 
The prosperity of every nation has depended in all time on two fundamental 
things: The development of agricultural resources and the development of edu- 
cational opportunities. The rural high school is admirably located for serving 
to strengthen both of these important factors in our national life. A critical 
choice of subjects is especially important in these small schools. At present 
these institutions are compelled to neglect the college entrance preparation of 
a few, or to disregard the needs of a large majority whose education is com- 
pleted with the local school, or to attempt too much work for the limited teach- 
ing force by trying to do both. The advice given to these schools is that they 
serve the community first. * * * The broader we can make the course 
of study the greater we can make the number of graduates, the greater the 
number inspired to take advanced training, the greater the community is 
strengthened, and the greater the service to the Nation. 
After showing that in the 64 two-teacher high schools of Maine 
most of the work is still formal and of questionable value to the 
small community, former State Supt. Payson Smith writes in his 
report for 1915: 
In arranging a program of studies for these [small] schools two things may 
be done: The subject matter and aims may be modified while the subjects them- 
selves are retained, or special subjects may be introduced. In either case in 
attempting such a program some traditions may have to be sacrificed and a 
few pupils denied the privilege of studying certain subjects.

  110 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
There are at least three factors in such a program which may be made use 
of at once in any of the schools. First, every opportunity for relating the 
work of the school to the home interests of the children should be utilized. 
Second, each subject of the curriculum should have a direct, immediate, and 
tangible influence in the development of the pupil; that is, if geometry is taught 
it must be for its effect on the growth of the pupil rather than for its value 
as a preparation for advanced mathematics in college. Third, the interests 
of the many who will not go to college should not be sacrificed because of 
demands which the colleges make upon the few who may enter. When the 
community attaches as much importance to the service the school has rendered 
those who remain at home as those who go to college, the last condition will 
be speedily adjusted. Thus the first move in a more rational program is 
largely a teaching problem dealing with the subject matter and aims of in- 
struction. 
The program will need to be adjusted further by introducing subjects or 
courses which will touch more directly community interests and by giving to 
them prominence and dignity. A careful study of the careers of the pupils after 
leaving school, not overlooking those who left school before completing the 
course, and of the major community interests will suggest the kind of work 
to be developed. As a result of such a study it may be found desirable to in- 
troduce a course in agriculture, household arts, commercial work, and the like, 
replacing one or more of those now offered. 
MEASURED RESULTS, 
In the larger high schools there is an unquestionable improvement 
in details of administration and instruction. Not only from the 
published reports, but also from observation, it is found that nearly 
every school is “ trying out.” some plan to increase its effectiveness to 
the community as a whole and to the individual pupil. The differ- 
ence between the general practice a decade ago and the tendency 
to-day is manifest in the type of articles appearing in educational 
magazines. Formerly it was stated that such and such results 
“should follow” from a proposed plan, now that such and such 
measured results have followed from a procedure, the details of 
which are given. The Fifteenth Annual Report of the Board of 
Education of Decatur, Ill., presents some interesting results of a 
study of the high school by its teachers. Besides the statistics of 
enrollment, distribution of scholarship marks, withdrawals with 
causes, and tardiness, there are data concerning subjects desired by 
the pupils, home study, occupations of fathers, occupations chosen 
by pupils with reasons, outside work done by pupils, voluntary read- 
ing of newspapers, magazines, and books, number of motion-picture 
shows attended, expectation of entering college, and other subjects— 
all useful to an intelligent principal in adapting the offerings of 
his school to the needs of its pupils. For careful cooperative ex- 
perimentation and a wider publicity of results there has been formed 
the National Association of Principals of Secondary Schools. 
Some use has been made in high schools of the existing scales for 
measuring ability in reading, language, composition, penmanship,
-P-A-G-E-139

and drawing, and there is a marked need for standard measures in 
other secondary school subjects. Already, it should be noted, 
Monroe, of Kansas, Rugg, of Chicago, and Childs, of Indiana have 
done much to standardize tests in algebra; Hanus, of Harvard, has 
published a preliminary study of ability in Latin; and Starch, of 
Wisconsin, has made an effort to find the effects of the study of mod- 
ern foreign languages. One study now under way attempts to ascer- 
tain what standards of English composition are considered “ pass- 
ing ” in each of the four years of representative high schools throught 
out the United States. At Topeka the high-school teachers have 
made their own standards for what should constitute a passing 
achievement in English composition, in Latin, and in German. 
SUPERVISED STUDY. 
Among innovations nothing is more widespread than supervised 
study. A large number of schools from all parts of the country, 
particularly in the Middle West, are reported to have adopted a 
longer period, usually of 60 minutes, which is divided more or less 
freely for recitation and for supervised study. This plan, which 
is especially popular in junior high schools, almost of necessity 
results in a longer school day. The results seem to be generally satis- 
factory. A number of principals, however, report that they have 
found among their teachers marked uncertainty as to what factors 
go to make up good study, and a further difficulty in persuading 
even those teachers who profess enthusiasm for the divided period 
plan to exchange “teaching” at the middle of the period for the 
opportunity to supervise study. In one school, in which the exact 
division of time was left to the teachers’ discretion, the pupils were 
forced to petition the principal to indicate by a gong when they 
should be permitted to study. It is evident that one good feature of 
the plan is that it forces upon teachers a consideration of the whole 
problem of study. Prof. Hall-Quest’s new volume on “ Supervised 
Study ”* conveniently summarizes almost all recent investigation 
of the subject. Other helpful publications during the past year 
are Miss Busch’s “ The Use of Study Halls” (Educational Admin- 
istration and Supervision, 2:235 f.), “Study Helps for Students 
at the University of Chicago High School” (School Review, 24: 
358 f.), and Prof. Whipple’s precepts in School and Home Educa- 
tion (January to June, 1916). 
SCHOOL RECORDS. 
_As may be seen from the published surveys, annual reports, and 
magazine articles, there are now generally being made comprehen-   
1 Macmillan, 1916.  
-P-A-G-E-140
    112 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
sive and intelligent studies of school records, attendance, elimination 
and its causes, distribution of pupils by curricula and by subjects 
of study, distribution of pupils’ grades by subject and by teacher, 
failures and their causes, and the distribution of graduates. As 
typical of the studies of the causes of withdrawal the reports at 
Minneapolis, Topeka, Des Moines, and Lincoln, Nebr., may be cited. 
At Lincoln a “committee for recovering the lost” personally looked 
up 479 pupils who dropped out of school during 1914-15 and in- 
duced 336 of them to return. Much attention seems to be given to 
systems of marking pupils on work done. Missouri and New Hamp- 
shire give in their publications special consideration of the matter, 
so that marks given shall be generally meaningful, while Topeka 
and other cities publish the distribution of marks by subject and 
by teacher so as to insure more uniformity of practice. Principal 
F. W. Johnson and his colleagues at the University of Chicago 
High School are chiefly to be credited with transferring from the 
colleges to high schools a system of giving weighted credits, ranging 
from eight-tenths of a credit for barely passing work to one and 
two-tenths for highly superior achievements. The most important 
study of the year concerning the distribution of high-school graduates 
is that by Prof. Pittenger.t. He shows that of 2,426 graduates of 118 
high schools in five North Central States for whom the necessary data 
were obtained, about four-fifths of the whole number in the grad- 
uating classes, 50.4 per cent entered higher institutions of learning. 
He also presents tables showing the employment distribution, the 
training distribution, and the relation of high-school scholarship 
to future employment and training. 
STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES. 
Mention was made last year in this report of standards set up 
by several State departments of education for improving secondary 
schools. The number of States presenting such standards has 
markedly increased, and there is evidence, especially. where the 
State makes a direct financial contribution to schools qualifying 
under the standards, that improvement of various kinds has resulted. 
A reading of the several sets of standards makes it evident that those 
first published have had a marked influence on the later ones, that 
for entire clarity the educational principles on which the standards 
rest should be presented, and that the indefiniteness of many items 
needs to be remedied. A statement that “the laboratory equipment 
must be adequate” or that “teachers must be satisfactorily trained ” 
leaves the decision in each case precisely where it was before stand- 
ards were published, with the inspector. Fortunately most of the 
items are so definite as to make decisions largely objective.

  SECONDARY EDUCATION. 113 
Many of the standards apply to the qualifications of teachers and 
principals. Occasionally an inspector, lacking the power that comes 
from administering a State fund for secondary schools, attempts 
to improve standards by exposing “graduates of reputable col- 
leges (who) go into high schools to teach subjects they have never 
studied outside an inferior high school before attending college” 
or who of necessity use translations in the preparation of their 
lessons. New Hampshire publishes the rating by superintendents 
of 147 young teachers distributed according to the colleges from 
which they graduated in 1914 and 1915. Missouri insists that “in 
securing properly qualified teachers the first problem is to know 
definitely what subject or subjects each teacher is to teach. So 
far as possible the work of each teacher should be limited to one or 
not more than two subjects.” The evidence is that the standards 
are improving and that an increasing proportion of candidates are 
meeting the higher requirements. West Virginia reports that 85 per 
cent of all its teachers in standard four-year high schools are now 
college graduates. 
A matter almost as important as the securing of good teachers and 
principals is that of retaining them in a school and of improving 
their effectiveness in service. Louisiana reports a slight improve- 
ment in the matter of tenure, the number of principals serving their 
first year in a school decreasing 3.5 per cent. In Massachusetts, 
where about two-fifths of the high-school principals have occupied 
their positions for less than two years, it is proposed that the State 
pay a direct bonus for continuous service. The State agent for 
secondary education has outlined the following program for the im- 
provement of instruction in high schools: 
1. Extended and thorough preliminary training of high-school teachers, either 
in existing institutions or in a school maintained by the States especially for 
this purpose. 
2. A systematic training of high-school teachers in service. 
3. An annual institute for high-school teachers, lasting several days. 
4, The preparation of manuals on the teaching of high-school subjects. Each 
manual should contain— 
(a) A statement of aims in the teaching of that subject. Because wide dif- 
ferences of opinion exist regarding the objectives in nearly every high-school 
subject, the majority of teachers are disposed to follow the traditional concep- 
tions. Therefore State authorities should examine new statements of purposes, 
and when these are found valid indorse them. When traditional aims are still 
tenable their restatement in precise terms will give teachers greater confidence 
in their work. 
(b) A description of methods. Since methods effective for a subject taught 
with one end in view may be futile and harmful when the aims are changed, 
new methods should be presented and illustrated by numerous specific exam- 
ples. In subjects and topics in which the traditional aims still hold good a 
description of approved methods would be helpful to many teachers.
-P-A-G-E-142
114 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
(c) A statement of the content of the subject under consideration, with de- 
tailed suggestions as to specific values and special methods for various topics. 
This statement should indicate which topics are of greatest value. In such 
subjects as civics, general science, and literature it is especially important that 
the specific value of various topics, experiments, and selections should be 
explained. 
(d@) Methods of measuring results in teaching. A redefinition of aims in- 
volves new methods of measuring results. Each manual should show both the 
values and the limitations of traditional methods of measurement and suggest 
new methods. 
Beyond all the problems of administration and instruction lies that 
of the real purposes of secondary school education. These purposes 
need to be determined and stated so clearly and so cogently as to 
influence directly all the details of the programs. So much is ob- 
vious, and yet it must be admitted that a serious examination of re- 
ports, of declarations of standards, and of practices reveals no defi- 
nite principles commonly accepted. John Dewey, in his “ Democracy 
and Education,” has made a serious attempt to formulate a directing 
philosophy. It can hardly be questioned that any philosophy of edu- 
cation, especially that concerning secondary schools, will be mate- 
rially affected by the European war. The most serious continuous 
effort to meet this problem has been found in the conferences directed 
during the past year at Teachers College, Columbia University, by 
Dean James E. Russell.t_ The influence of the war has already be- 
come manifest in the legislation of various States to provide mili- 
tary training * and in the increased efforts to use effectively secondary 
schools in the teaching of American ideals. 
COMMISSION ON THE REORGANIZATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
No single agency is doing more to make definite the aims of sec- 
ondary schools and to outline a program that will improve their prac- 
tice than the National Education Association commission on the re- 
organization of secondary education. This commission is constituted 
as follows: 
The reviewing committee consists of 26 members, 15 of whom are chairmen 
of committees, and 10 are members at large.

proved for publication the reports on social studies, English, ancient 
foreign languages, modern foreign languages, manual arts, music, 
and vocational guidance. The commission hopes to complete during 
1916-17 reports on all the subjects of study. These reports are later 
to be published by the United States Bureau of Education. 
THE JUNIOR HIGH-SCHOOL MOVEMENT. 
Interest in the junior high school or intermediate school move- 
ment continues without apparent abatement, as evidenced by pro- 
grams of educational meetings and the contents of magazines; and 
from all quarters of the country it is reported that schools of the new 
type have been organized. Both public and private reports of the
-P-A-G-E-144
    116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
details of many ot these schools raise the question as to whether or 
not the movement is spreading more rapidly than is warranted by 
the programs proposed. The arguments for the junior high school 
have apparently led many schoolmen to think that the adoption of 
the new organization is in itself sufficient, whereas it is chiefly an op- 
portunity for more easily effecting desired reforms in courses 
of study, methods of teaching, and social administration. Unless 
there are sound ideas of reform in these details, there seems to be 
little, if any, justification for a reorganization of the grades. So 
far it is not obvious that the junior high school has contributed to 
educational progress anything that does not already exist some- 
where in elementary or secondary schools, nor is it likely to do so; but 
if it enables foresighted administrators more easily and effectively 
to assemble existing advantages in practice, it will more than justify 
itself. If the.junior high school means opportunity, it also means 
hard work and much of it. 
The problem clearly concerns two different types of organization: 
The urban junior high school, whether in a separate building or 
incorporated with an elementary school or a senior high school, and 
the rural or village junior high school extending through the ninth 
or tenth grades. The latter type of school, which has been discussed 
somewhat in an earlier section of this report, is promoted “to 
extend secondary education to all the children of all the people”; 
but there is a difference in the conception of what secondary educa- 
tion is. Some State administrators are content to extend the tradi- 
tional subjects and methods, while others are eager to adapt the work 
primarily to the immediate needs of all the boys and girls of sec- 
ondary school age. In the urban type of junior high school almost: 
everything imaginable may be found. Interesting developments 
are found at Lewiston, Idaho; Montclair, N. J.; Richmond, Va.; and 
Solvay and Rochester, N. Y. The program followed in the last- 
named city is admirably presented by Supt. Herbert Weet in recent 
issues of the School Review and Educational Administration and 
Supervision. The unsavory fact must be noted that several of the 
largest American cities are proposing to establish junior high schools 
primarily because of an apparent financial economy, it being cheaper 
to accommodate ninth-grade pupils in elementary school buildings 
and to teach them with elementary-school teachers than to duplicate 
facilities now provided. It is hoped that the authorities have better 
reasons for the proposed change of organization than they publish. 
Because of conditions that seem to many dangerously chaotic, the 
General Education Board has provided for an extensive study to 
ascertain what is actually done in existing junior high schools and to 
make public what is proved to be most successful.

THE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE SURVEYS. 
Despite the fact that it is much more difficult to measure the dif- 
ferentiated work of the high school than the relatively uniform work 
of the elementary grades, school surveys are concerned more and 
more with secondary education. Of necessity in the present state 
of the development of standard measures, the surveys have for the 
most part studied the relations of high schools to the elementary 
schools and to the colleges, the physical equipment, salaries and 
tenure of teachers, costs, and the retention and grading of pupils. 
Reports of five of the more important surveys—of Boston, San Fran- 
cisco, Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Nassau County, N. Y.—have not 
yet been published. It is interesting to record that two of the best 
known private schools, St. Paul’s, at Concord, N. H., and St. Mark’s, 
at Southborough, Mass., have been studied by professors of education. 
The Maryland educational survey commission gives on pages 84-87 
of its report information concerning the retention and distribution of 
children 14 to 15 years of age. The Wyoming commission criti- 
cizes the inadequate provision made for vocational guidance and in- 
dustrial education and recommends the establishment of “more high 
schools located in such a way as to serve the largest number of 
children,” and also the revision of courses of study, particularly with 
respect to more and better vocational training. After presenting 
facts concerning the growth of secondary education in the State, the 
committee investigating education in Washington points out that 
although “State higher education in Washington * * * rests 
almost entirely upon facilities for secondary education within the 
State the standards and equipment of more than two-thirds of the 
high schools of Washington do not yet justify their approval by the 
State board of education.” The report on higher education in 
Towa also traces the healthy growth in secondary school enrollment 
and states that— 
Towa’s secondary school system, viewed as a whole, offers a channel between 
elementary and higher institutions remarkably free from obstruction. It has 
undoubtedly been one of the most effective agencies in the popularizing of 
higher education. Indeed, a mere statistical summary shows that the State 
has gone far toward the creation of a thoroughly coordinated State system of 
public education. 
It criticizes sharply, however, the relative neglect of the small 
rural high school, and, further, the fact that these small high schools 
and the larger urban high schools are judged by two different sets 
of officials using two different standards. It concludes that “the 
stage is set for lack of harmony, misunderstanding, and eventual 
conflict.” 
“A Practical Study of Elimination of Pupils from the New Orleans 
Schools” presents the extent and causes of high-school elimination

-P-A-G-E-146
  118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
at different school ages, months in which elimination was greatest, 
the vocational preferences of those eliminated, and the pupils’ opin- 
ions as to why they and others entered high school; as to the popu- 
larity of courses taken, as to the value of secondary school education, 
and as to the causes of elimination. The bureau of educational meas- 
ures and standards of the Kansas State Normal School shows that the 
power of retention of the Leavenworth High School is considerably 
greater than that of the average high school in Kansas or in the 
whole of the United States. It examines the practice in teaching 
nine groups of subjects and makes recommendations for the reorgani- 
zation of the work within the subjects and for the correlation of the 
work in two or more departments. It further urges the addition to 
the curriculum for all pupils of fine arts and music. 
The most extended study of high schools is presented in “ Measur- 
ing the Work of the Public Schools,” one of the volumes issued by 
the Cleveland educational survey. Following are the summaries of 
the two chapters particularly concerning the secondary schools: 
This [eighth] chapter deals briefly with the relation between elementary 
schools and high schools, chiefly with that aspect of the matter which has to 
do with the lower school. 
(1) It is shown that the relation is growing more intimate, in view of the 
increasing attendance on the high schools. c 
(2) It is pointed out that special types of organization, such as departmental 
courses and the junior high school, are arising to bridge over the gap. 
(8) It is shown that the better pupils from the elementary schools are the 
ones who most commonly go on. 
(4) A device for rating the elementary schools in terms of the success of 
their pupils in the high school is described, and a full table of elementary 
schools is presented. 
The chapter closes with very urgent recommendations looking toward the more 
intimate cementing of elementary schools and high schools. 
The ninth chapter sets forth facts showing: 
(1) That the students entering the different types of high schools are very 
different in the ranks which they received in the elementary schools, in their 
ages, and in their ability to hold their places in school. 
(2) That the marking systems in the various schools are in a measure 
affected by the quality of students entering, but in a larger measure by special 
policies in the individual schools. 
(83) The failures and cases of repeaters in the various schools contribute 
further evidence that there is the widest divergence in standards. , 
(4) The reports on enrollment show that the system has not had a sym- 
metrical and wholesome development. : 
(5) The reasons for favoring the enlargement of the course of study in all 
schools rather than the further divorcement of technical and commercial courses 
from academic courses are reviewed. 
(6) Comments on the problems of the junior high school are added. 
_ The recommendations which are suggested by these findings are all directed 
toward the establishment of standards and the development of riéher courses. 
It is pointed out that these ends can not be attained without more highly central- 
ized control.

CHAPTER VIII. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
By SamMvuet P. Capen, 
Specialist in Higher Education, Bureau of Hducation. 
SUMMARY. 
There have been few new movements in the field of higher educa- 
tion during the year under review, and few new important estab- 
lishments or foundations. Nevertheless, progress has been visible, 
even if not registered in any spectacular manner. There have ap- 
peared numerous studies and investigations relating to various 
phases of institutional management. The field of higher education 
has until very recently been seldom invaded by the educational in- 
vestigator. Efficiency tests and statistical measurements have been 
applied with increasing frequency to the work of the lower schools, 
and a voluminous literature in which the results are recorded has 
already grown up. The literature of higher education is still pre- 
ponderatingly of the naively philosophical order. The majority of 
those who have written (and who still write) about the college and 
university are apparently committed to the method in vogue before 
the “ Novum Organon” burst through the thickets of scholasticism. 
There are many works which tell us what the authors think a college 
ought to be; many which give the writer’s interpretations of the 
spiritual aspects of college education; not a few which, based on 
dogmatic postulates, discuss the values of various elements in the 
college curriculum. The records of the actual facts conditioning 
collegiate education have thus far been disappointingly rare. The 
present year has, however, seen the publication of a larger number 
of such intensive studies than any previous anntal period. The 
review of some of this new literature is essential to a record of higher 
education in 1915-16, not only because of the important facts which 
it reveals, but because of the tendency it represents. 
A double movement appears to be going on with respect to en- 
trance requirements. Although the major part of the institutions of 
the Northeast seem to be dedicated to the proposition that the chief 
emphasis in requirements for admission must be placed upon quali- 
tative tests, there appears even in this section a sudden if not alto-

istration.” 
119  
-P-A-G-E-148
  120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
gether unexpected reversion to the type of relation with secondary 
schools that has prevailed in the West. In other parts of the country 
the movement for increased quantitative requirements for admission 
goes forward. 
Perhaps few persons, even among those engaged in educational 
work, are aware of the large number of voluntary associations, na- 
tional or sectional in their membership, which deal wholly or in 
part with college and university problems. From time to time the 
establishment of new organizations has been noted in these reports. 
Although the foundation of but one such body is recorded this year 
(the Society for the Promotion of Training for Public Service), 
meetings of the following organizations have been held at which 
topics of importance to higher education were discussed : 
American Association of Collegiate Registrars, 
American Association of University Professors, 
Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations. 
Association of American Colleges, 
Association of American Universities. 
Association of Business Officers of the State Universities and Colleges of the 
Middle West. 
Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and 
Maryland. 
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern States. 
Association of Urban Universities. 
College Entrance’ Examination Board. 
National Association of State Universities in the United States of America. 
National Conference Committee on Standards of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools. 
New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. 
New England College Entrance Certificate Board. 
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. 
Society for the Promotion of Training for Public Service. 
Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education. 
Land Grant College Engineering Association. 
Possibly of the greatest significance were various discussions, which 
in some cases led to action, relating to questions of classification and 
standardization. These questions were taken up especially by the 
National Conference Committee on Standards, the Association of 
Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern States, the Asso- 
‘ciation of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, the North 
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, and the Asso- 
ciation of American Colleges. At the meeting of the last-named asso- 
ciation a very remarkable report entitled, “ The Efficient College” was 
presented. The report describes (1) a hypothetical institution called 
“The Minimum College”; (2) another imaginary organization which 
is theoretically efficient ; aa (3) for purposes of comparison the 
actual status of five existing institutions.

HIGHER EDUCATION. 121 
Few State legislatures were in session in 1916. Consequently the 
grist of bills relating to higher education has been small. The reor- 
ganization of administrative machinery in Maryland * and the move- 
ment for-the establishment of a State university in Massachusetts 
deserve special mention, however, in a review of higher education. 
The question of academic freedom remains one of the vital issues 
in university and college education. Its remoter implications involve 
the whole question of institutional control and touch upon the obscure 
relationships of institutions and large accumulations of property. 
The final adjustment of the issues does not appear to be in sight. As 
has already been reported, the question has been the subject of several 
investigations by the American Association of University Profes- 
sors. Four new reports by committees of this body during the past 
academic year constituté valuable additions to the discussion of the 
subject. 
UNIVERSITY SURVEYS. 
University surveys have undoubtedly occupied the forefront of 
attention in the field of higher education during the academic year 
just completed. 
The most important of these surveys are those which have been 
made under the direction of the Bureau of Education or in which 
the bureau has participated. These have involved the State higher 
institutions of Iowa, the State higher institutions of North Dakota, 
the University of Oregon, and the State higher institutions of 
of Washington. A brief account of the survey of the University of 
Oregon was included in the Report of the Commissioner of Education 
for 1915. 
SURVEY OF STATE-SUPPORTED HIGHER INSTITUTIONS OF IOWA. 
In May, 1915, the Iowa State Board of Education requested the 
Commissioner of Education to undertake the direction of a survey 
of the higher institutions of the State. 
The board presented to the commissioner a bill of particulars ask- 
ing that inquiry be made into a number of matters, of which the fol- 
' lowing were perhaps the most important: 
Duplication in courses in education and psychology between the State uni- 
versity and the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. 
The extent to which liberal arts courses are offered at the College of Agricul- 
ture and Mechanic Arts. 
The status of graduate work at each of the three institutions. 
The feasibility of consolidating extension work. 
The adequacy of the educational plants and the economy exercised in their use. 
The Commissioner of Education appointed to conduct the survey. 
a commission composed of the following persons: Dr. James R.   
1See Ch. II, p. 19. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
    122 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
Angell, dean of the faculties of arts, literature, and science of the 
University of Chicago; Dr. Kendric C. Babcock, dean of the college 
of arts and sciences of the University of Illinois; Dr. Liberty H. 
Bailey, formerly director of the New York State College of Agricul- 
ture; Mrs. Henrietta W. Calvin, specialist in home economics, Bureau 
of Education; Dr. Hollis Godfrey, president of Drexel Institute, 
Philadelphia (consulting member) ; Dr. Raymond M. Hughes, presi- 
dent of Miami University; Dr. Samuel P. Capen, specialist in higher 
education, Bureau of Education (chairman). 
The completed report was placed in the hands of the State board 
of education on February 15, 1916, and has since been published as 
Bulletin, 1916, No. 19, of the Bureau of Education. 
The report is especially noteworthy, among other things, for its 
enunciation of the principle of “major and service lines.” It de- 
clares: 
In dealing with the problems of duplication as manifested in the practice of 
the Iowa State institutions, the commission has been guided by what may be 
described as the principle of “ major and service lines” of work. In accord- 
ance with this principle, each State institution should have assigned to it cer- 
tain major fields which it may be expected to develop to their fullest extent. 
Agriculture at the State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts is such a 
major line. Latin, German, French, political science, and psychology at the 
Iowa State University are such major lines. Service lines are such subordinate 
subjects as are essential to the proper cultivation of a major line. The amount 
required is generally not large. English is such a service line for engineering 
and agriculture at the State college. Institutions may well overlap as regards 
the relation of their service lines to one another, and more particularly as re- 
gards the relation of their major to their service lines. English is a major 
line at the State university and a service line at the State college, but there 
should be no material overlapping of major lines. 
The report of the commission recommends reorganizations which 
are strikingly similar to those contemplated in the order of the State 
board of education issued in 1912, but afterward rescinded in re- 
sponse to legislative action and public protest. The report makes 
clear that the commission approached the study of the situation with- 
out preconceptions and with no intention of proposing radical 
changes in the functions of the institutions. It was led to its con- 
clusions by the force of the facts. 
The portions of the Iowa report involving general administra- 
tive matters and broader questions of State policy will no doubt be 
more widely read and discussed by students of education than any 
others. University administrators, however, are likely to be quite 
as much interested in.several devices for presenting educational and 
financial data bearing upon efficiency of institutional management. 
Notable among these is the method utilized for presenting the ex- 
penditures of the three institutions analyzed in a special form of
-P-A-G-E-151
  HIGHER EDUCATION. 123 
diagram originally used by the administration of Miami University, 
Ohio.* 
Another interesting and novel arrangement of institutional ex- 
penditures and their proper apportionment among the students in 
attendance appears in the chapter on building costs. 
Bearing on the question of the utilization of the plant for teaching 
purposes, the report contributes a technical chapter containing the 
results of a careful engineering study of a group of typical buildings 
at each institution. The method of this study should prove valuable, 
not only for Iowa institutions, but for universities and colleges in 
general. The available building space is first divided into instruc- 
tional space (defined as space used for the primary function of the 
institution—teaching—and distinguished by the presence of a stu- 
dent or a group of students for the purpose of instruction), and ac- 
cessory space (defined as space not used specifically for teaching 
purposes, but to a large degree essential to the plant because of the 
physical features of building construction and the needs of the admin- 
istrative functions). Although waste or efficient use may equally 
well occur in instructional or in accessory space, attempt is made 
to study merely instructional. space and its relation to the whole 
plant. Instructional space is further divided into scheduled and 
unscheduled space. Scheduled space is that for which the commis- 
sion received a statement of definite student capacities and definite 
hours of actual use for teaching purposes. For unscheduled space 
such information was not furnished. It appears that at the State 
university 39.75 per cent of the total building space is instructional 
space, at the State college 44.15 per cent is instructional space, and 
at the State teachers’ college 44.87 per cent is instructional space. 
The scheduled space is then analyzed to show the occupancy and 
time ratios, i. e., the proportion of time out of a working week of 
44 hours that each room available for teaching is occupied to its 
full capacity. These ratios are first determined for each scheduled 
classroom or laboratory, then for the scheduled instructional space 
of each building, and finally in the same manner for the whole 
plant. The per cent of plant utilization results when the combined 
occupancy and time ratios are multiplied by the per cent of scheduled 
instructional space. According to this calculation, the State uni- 
versity showed an average plant use for teaching purposes of 19.8 
per cent, the State teachers’ college of 23.9 per cent, and the State 
college of agriculture and mechanic arts of 26.4 per cent. The 
report takes pains to caution the reader against an interpretation of 
these figures too unfavorable to the efficiency of the: management 
of the institutions. The percentages seem low, but it is pointed   
1¥For a detailed statement see Bulletin, 1916, No. 19. The method is also discussed in 
Bulletin, 1916, No. 46. 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
124 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
out that 100 per cent utilization is absolutely impossible. More- 
over, there is as yet no norm of possible use. No comparable studies 
have been made, except of one city institution (Drexel Institute), 
where conditions favor an extremely high per cent of utilization. 
That study and the present one, however, indicate that 40 per cent 
of utilization would be very high indeed, and that 35 per cent 
would represent rarely successful utilization for a State university. 
The conclusion drawn from the results shown by the three institu- 
tions here studied is that some economies in the use of buildings 
can be secured without noticeable hardship either to the students 
or professors, by careful rostering of available classrooms and by 
preventing department heads from preempting valuable space for 
fancied departmental needs or for exhibition purposes. The rela- 
tively high per cent of utilization at the State college is chiefly due 
to the care there exercised in these matters. 
The chapter devoted to the work and remuneration of the instruc- 
tional staffs of the three institutions proposes certain standards and 
makes use of at least one new unit of measurement. Three stand- 
ards relate to the size of classes. They are: 
(a) In lecture work a professor may meet effectively as many as can com- 
- fortably see and hear him. 
(b) In recitation or quiz, 30 in a section is probably the largest number that 
can be effectively handled, but the desirable maximum would be from 20 to 25. 
(c) In laboratory work it is commonly agreed that one instructor should be 
provided for every 15 or 16 students. 
The new unit is the “student clock hour,” which is defined thus: 
“One student under instruction in lecture, quiz, or laboratory for 
at least 50 minutes net, represents one student clock hour.” 
The report also proposes one other standard, namely, the minimum 
average salary for a department in institutions of collegiate grade. 
This, it is affirmed, should be at least $2,000 a year. 
SURVEY OF THE STATE HIGHER INSTITUTIONS OF WASHINGTON. 
Mention was made in the last annual report of the creation by the 
Washington Legislature, in 1915, of a commission composed of six 
members of the legislature, charged with the duty of making a com- 
prehensive survey of the State university, the State college, and the 
three State normal schools, and such general survey of the public 
school system as might be necessary. The commission was given 
authority to employ experts. ° It requested the assistance of the Com- 
missioner of Education, who appointed the following persons as a 
committee to investigate the institutions and to report their findings 
to the commission: Samuel P. Capen, specialist in higher education, 
Bureau of Education (chairman); Alexander Inglis, assistant 
professor of education, Harvard University; and Harold W. Foght, 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
    HIGHER EDUCATION. 125 
specialist in rural school practice, Bureau of Education. In the latter 
stages of its work in the State this committee was assisted by the 
Commissioner of Education in person. The committee presented its 
report ‘to the Washington Commission of Educational Survey on 
April 15, 1916. On April 27 the commission reported to the gov- 
_ ernor of the State, recommending that certain legislation bearing 
on the control, the support, and the functions of public educational 
institutions be passed by the next legislature, and submitting by way 
of evidence the report of the bureau’s committee. Bulletin No. 26, 
1916, Bureau of Education, contains both documents. The report of 
the commission followed, in the main, the bureau’s recommendations. 
Tn a few instances it recorded a different opinion. 
Limitations of space prevent the detailed discussion of these re- 
ports. A few points may be mentioned, however. Re-enunciating the 
principle of major and service lines laid down in the Iowa report, the 
committee recommends the partial redistribution of the functions of 
the two existing collegiate institutions. Both now maintain depart- 
ments of architecture, education, engineering (chemical, civil, elec- 
trical, mechanical, mining), forestry, liberal arts, and pharmacy. 
The report urges the abandonment by the State college of architec- 
ture, chemical engineering, forestry, and pharmacy as major lines. 
It declares that only one school of mining engineering should be 
maintained, but suggests that its appropriate location be determined 
on consultation with mining experts. It recommends the sharp dif- 
ferentiation ofthe departments of education at the two institutions. 
In view of local factors, which are discussed at some length, it coun- 
sels the continuance of undergraduate work in civil, electrical, and 
mechanical engineering and in liberal arts at both institutions. It 
proposes that the university abandon extension work in home eco- 
nomics. Graduate work, except in the departments maintained by 
the State college alone, should be developed exclusively at the uni- 
versity. 
Elaborate analyses of costs, of the geographical distribution of 
the student bodies in the different departments at the two institu- 
tions, and of the work and remuneration of the teaching staffs are 
used in support of the recommendations. The average cost per stu- 
dent at the State university was found to be $192.77, and at the State 
college $289.79. A calculation showing the cost of a student clock 
hour of instruction in each of the principal departments at both 
institutions is the chief contribution to financial statistics made by 
this report. Commenting on the support of the State university and 
the State college, the report says: 
(1) Washington has not been spending as much money on its State collegiate 
institutions in proportion to their needs and the State’s wealth as many other 
progressive States. Both should be more liberally supported.
-P-A-G-E-154
  126 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
(2) The State college is for the most part well housed and the pressure on its 
plant is not extreme. On the other hand, the salaries paid its teachers are con- 
siderably below what should be paid to competent men in institutions of this 
character. In the past two years the amount spent per student has been some- 
what higher than the per capita outlay in other institutions which the Bureau 
of Education has studied. However, the committee especially calls attention 
to the fact that, in.order to meet the needs of the State in the direction of agri- 
cultural instruction, extension and experimentation alone, this institution will 
require largely increased appropriations. 
(3) The State university has for many years been starved. It is housed in 
part in buildings which are unworthy of a great university in a great and 
wealthy State. Its expense per student during the last two years‘is much 
lower than the similar expense in any institution of university rank which the 
Bureau of Education has studied. The legitimate expansion of the institution, 
especially the development of a school of commerce, demands large increases in 
its support. 
Probably the most important recommendations of the section of 
the report dealing with public schools are, first, those calling for 
the raising of the professional requirements for holding the county 
superintendency and for the increase of the salary of this office 
(a salary scale ranging from $1,200 to $3,000 is proposed) ; second, 
those looking toward the establishment of definite professional and 
academic qualifications for all persons occupying teaching posi- 
tions ‘and the consequent reorganization of the State system of 
certifying teachers; and, third, those advising a fundamental revi- 
sion of the common-school course of study, with particular reference 
to the varying needs of urban and rural children. 
The section on normal schools proposes certain standards for a 
satisfactory system of teacher preparation. They are, in brief: 
1. The entrance requirements to normal schools to be raised to graduation 
from a four-year accredited high-school course. 
2. The lowest grade of certificate issued by the normal schools to be two years 
above high-school graduation. 
8. The ultimate standard of attainment for all persons teaching in the State 
to be graduation from an accredited high school and at least two years of pro- 
fessional preparation, (The committee recommends specific steps by which 
this standard may be enforced.) However, the process of elimination should 
be gradual, to permit teachers in service to meet the new requirements without 
causing too great hardships. 
4. The normal schools to offer differentiated courses of study two and 
three years in length based on high-school graduation. The certificates should 
eventually be given at the end of the two-year courses and the normal diploma 
at the end of the three-year courses. 
5. The normal schools to organize a thoroughgoing extension service for the 
teachers in service. 
6. No license to teach to be made permanent until the candidate has given 
evidence of progressive scholarship. The State board of education should 
prepare courses of study including both professional and cultural subjects for 
the further training of teachers in service, and within five years of the time 
of the receipt of a provisional certificate every candidate should be required 
to pass examinations in the subjects included in these courses.

HIGHER EDUCATION. 127 
The legislative steps necessary to secure these ends are then pre- 
sented in some detail. This is unquestionably one of the most con- 
structive portions of the whole report. 
The law providing for the support of the five higher institutions 
by a millage tax, and specifying the portion of the tax to be assigned 
to each institution, was enacted in 1911, and was to remain operative 
for six years. One of the commission’s tasks was to examine the 
present rate and distribution of the millage tax and to report to the 
legislature of 1917 whatever modifications might appear desirable. 
Indeed, this was doubtless the most important of the commission’s 
functions. The present tax is distributed as follows:

Convinced by the detailed financial statements made in the bureau’s 
report, the commission, after long deliberation, unanimously recom- 
mended that the total tax appropriations for higher institutions 
should be for the immediate future 1.9 mills on every dollar of tax- 
able property, this amount to be distributed among the institutions

SURVEY OF THE STATE HIGHER INSTITUTIONS OF NORTH DAKOTA. 
The 1915 annual report gave an account of the legislation creating 
the State Board of Regents of North Dakota and ordering, as a 
preliminary to the appointment of the commissioner of education, 
the new board’s executive officer, an educational survey by a compe- 
tent expert or experts of the nine institutions under the board’s con- 
trol. ’ 
In August, 1915, the board requested the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion to undertake this survey. After the necessary correspondence a 
conference in Bismarck was arranged for the first week in November. 
At this time the commisisoner announced that the Bureau of Educa- 
tion would assume responsibility for the survey, and the following 
commission was appointed to make the study: Dr. William T. Baw- 
den, specialist in industrial education, Bureau of Education; Dr. 
Lotus D. Coffman, dean of the college of education, University of
-P-A-G-E-156
  128 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
Minnesota; and Dr. Edwin B. Craighead, former president of the 
University of Montana, who was added to the commission at the 
request of the board of regents. The Commissioner of Education was 
intimately associated with the work of the survey throughout its 
course and personally directed the preparation of the report. A pre- 
liminary report on the findings and recommendations was filed with 
the State board of regents in July, 1916. It covered the following 
topics: 
1. General statement. 
2. Bill creating State board of regents. 
38. Laws touching public education in North Dakota. 
4, The State of North Dakota. 
5, Maps and statistical tables. 
6. An efficient State system of education. 
7. Preliminary survey. 
8. The University of North Dakota. 
9. The agricultural college. 
10. The normal schools of North Dakota and their relation to the rural schools, 
11. The industrial schools: 
(1) The State School of Forestry at Bottineau. 
(2) The North Dakota Academy of Science at Wahpeton. 
(8) Normal and Industrial School at Ellendale. 
12. The State library commission. 
13. Rural population and the rural schools. 
14. The high schools of North Dakota. 
15. The classification and standardization of educational institutions. 
16. Summary of recommendations. 
17. Conclusions. 
The document, somewhat revised, is later to be published as a 
bulletin of the Bureau of Education. 
Among the recommendations in the report which will probably be 
of greatest interest to students of State education the following may 
be noted: : : 
The commission recommends substantially the same differentiation 
of the school of education at the university and the department of 
education at the agricultural college as was recommended by the 
bureau’s committee in Washington. 
Tt counsels the assignment as major lines to the university of 
music, all branches of engineering to be given, except agricultural 
and industrial engineering, of advanced training in the liberal arts 
and pure sciences, and of professional work in law and medicine. 
It recommends that agriculture, professional and technical train- 
ing in home economics, and pharmacy be considered major lines at 
the agricultural college. 
Tt declares that the work of the normal schools should, for the 
present, be confined to the preparation of elementary teachers with 
special emphasis on the rural schools. Recommendations for the

elevation of the standards of academic and professional training of 
teachers similar to those proposed in the Washington report are 
made. The establishment of a normal school in the southwest quar- 
ter of the State is also urged. 
On August 1, 1916,-the State board of regents appointed Dr. 
Craighead commissioner of education. 
EDUCATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS IN PRESIDENT’S RE- 
PORTS AND REPORTS OF SPECIAL COMMITTEES. 
Allusion has been made to the growing tendency among pro- 
gressive colleges and universities to survey themselves, to gather 
as careful a statistical record of their vital operations as possible, 
and to make use of these facts in deciding upon new policies. There 
has also been a gratifying disposition to make such facts public. 
Probably nothing a college can do serves better to strengthen the 
public confidence in the integrity and efficiency of its management. 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON COSTS OF THE COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF 
NEW YORK. 
» One of the most exhaustive and valuable studies of the type just 
referred to is the report of the committee on costs of the College 
of the City of New York. This committee was appointed from the 
faculty of the institution in October, 1914, in response to a resolu- 
tion of the board of trustees requesting a report showing compari- 
sons of the cost per student, the salaries per grade, and the hours 
of instruction of the teaching staff in the College of the City of 
New York and in similar institutions of standing in the country. 
THE REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT OF SMITH COLLEGE. 
The annual report of the president of Smith College for the year 
1914-15 contains careful statistical analyses of the conditions of 
work of both students and teachers, of the sources from which the 
student body comes, of the previous preparation of students, of the 
rate and causes of mortality, and of several. other matters of less 
general concern. Three tables in particular will prove of special 
interest to students of college administration. The first of these 
summarizes the work of the 22 departments of the college. It shows 
by classes (freshman, sophomore, etc.) the number of students en- 
gaged in the study of each subject during both semesters and the 
number of student hours given by each department. The second 
shows the size and number of class sections and the number of hours 
a week that each section is given. The third indicates the geographi-

cal distribution of the student body by States and foreign countries. 
From this table it appears that but 40 per cent of the present student 
body are from the New England States, 88.5 per cent come from the 
Central States, and 21 per cent from the Western States. 
REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT, DEANS, AND OTHER OFFICERS OF MIAMI 
UNIVERSITY. 
A previous report (see Rep. of Commis. of Educ., 1914, pp. 
174 and 175) called attention to several intensive studies of impor- 
tant aspects of educational and financial administration made at 
Miami University. The report of the president, deans, and other 
officers of this institution for the year 1915-16 is replete with graphi- 
cal and tabular records of ‘various phases of institutional activity 
which thus far have been seldom analyzed. In fact, the statistical 
portion of this report presents what is practically a survey of the 
scholastic and fiscal operations of the university conducted by its own 
officers. 
COLLEGE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
For many reasons the current status of college entrance require- 
ments is of great significance. No radical new tendencies have mani- 
fested themselves in the year under review. There has, however, 
been an interesting extension of certain movements already described 
in previous reports. 
COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS. 
Undoubtedly the method of admission represented by the Harvard 
new plan and the Yale new or alternative plan (see Rep. of Commis. 
of Educ. for 1915, p. 148), including as the determining factor 
the “comprehensive examination,”* is the most original and impor- 
tant contribution to educational practice as affecting the relations 
of secondary schools and colleges since the adoption by middle 
western institutions of the policy of admission by certificate. The 
method has evidently commended itself to a large number of col- 
leges of the North Atlantic section. The action of the College 
Entrance Examination Board? in voting to prepare comprehensive 
examination papers for the use of such colleges in its membership 
as admit on that basis, constituted an unreserved indorsement of the 
plan by the organization which is probably at once the most influ- Se 
1The essential feature of the plan is that it combines the certificate and examination 
methods of admission. The candidate presents a certificate from the secondary school 
testifying to the quantity of the work covered. The college takes a sample of the quality 
by examining him in four subjects. The examination is designed to test the candidate’s 
general knowledge of a given subject and his intellectual power, not to ascertain whether 
he has mastered a prescribed book or course. 
*Referred to in the last Rept. of the Commis. of Educ., p. 149.

ential and the most conservative of all those that deal with the 
problem of the articulation of college and secondary school. In 
view of this indorsement, it is not surprising that several of the 
strongest institutions of the Northeast have adopted or propose to 
adopt the new method, with unessential modifications. 
Haverford College has reported to the bureau the adoption within 
the past year of a plan of admission under which the candidate 
submits a certified school record and passes comprehensive exami- 
nations in a few subjects. 
The four large certificating colleges for women in the Northeast— 
Mcunt Holyoke, Smith, Vassar, and Wellesley—have announced that 
they will together adopt a similar plan to replace the certificate 
system in September, 1919. Any candidate may enter under this 
plan prior to 1919 by passing the comprehensive examinations now 
offered by the College Entrance Examination Board and furnishing 
the required evidence from the secondary school attended. Con- 
siderable latitude of choice is allowed the candidate in the selection 
of the comprehensive examinations to be taken. 
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS IN NEW HAMPSRIRE, 
In the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1914 (p. 163 ff.) 
an account was given of the objections raised by certain of the 
New England State departments of education to the alleged 
domination of high-school education in New England by the New 
England College Entrance Certificate Board. It was there pointed 
out that the entrance requirements of the constituent colleges of the 
board were regarded by several of the chief State school officers as 
too conservative, and that through the immense influence and prestige 
of the board this conservatism was carried over to the secondary 
schools oftentimes, these officers believed, to the disadvantage of their 
respective communities.t_ In order that the high schools of New 
Hampshire at least might be free to adapt their curricula to practical 
local needs without fear of being outlawed, the State superintendent 
advocated the establishment of a State university which should adapt 
itself to the work done by the high schools and should raise no 
“ artificial and arbitrary obstacles in the pathway of education.” 
An announcement of changes in the basis of admission to New 
Hampshire College appears to indicate that this institution is pre-   
1It is interesting to note in this connection that at a conference held during the Christ- 
mas recess of 1915 of representatives of the certificating boards of the country—the 
New England board, the North Central association, the associations of the Middle States 
and of the South—the conclusion was reached that in New England only is there any 
certificate board that has done really effective work in making a certificate practically 
equal to an examination. In other parts of the country the list of approved schools is 
merely an honor list, which the colleges follow or not, as they please. No special cer- 
tificate grade is required of pupils, but a mere passing grade entitles them to a certificate. 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  132 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
paring to establish a cooperative relationship with the State depart- 
ment of public instruction similar to that which exists between the 
State universities and the State education departments of certain other 
States. The college has voted to admit any graduate from a high 
school or academy approved by the State department of public in- 
struction on the basis of his graduation, without the special certificate 
formerly required, provided the division entrance requirements of the 
college have been met. In the agriculture and arts and science divi- 
sions these division requirements comprise seven prescribed and eight 
elective units; in the engineering division eight units are prescribed 
and seven are elective. The latitude thus granted to the schools in 
the determination of the content of the secondary curriculum for 
those who plan to attend the State college is considerable. 
INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF ENTRANCE CREDITS DEMANDED. 
The reaction against merely quantitative estimates of college prep- 
aration, which is represented by the spread of the new plan of admis- 
sion in the Northeast, is by no means universal. In other sections 
emphasis continues to be placed chiefly on the amount of ground 
covered. Especially is this the case in those parts of the country 
where lax standards of admission have prevailed in the past. In 
these quarters it is undoubtedly wise for institutions to make sure 
first that candidates have undergone at least a reasonable minimum 
of secondary training. Closer discriminations as to the quality of 
the training may be set up by later enactments. 
The development of public (and to some extent even of private) 
secondary schools has been seriously hampered in certain States by 
an oversupply of colleges, the majority of which depend in large 
measure on students’ fees for support. These States have witnessed 
an annual scramble for recruits which has ignored the interest of 
the public in the establishment of sound secondary schools and has 
too often made a mockery of college standards. More than one State 
school officer has complained that it is impossible to maintain a four- 
year high school within 20 miles of some of the more aggressive of 
these needy colleges. High-school students of the third and even of 
the second years are lured away by the promise of collegiate rating. 
The resulting burden of conditions has also been found to vanish 
during the college course without undue effort on the part of the 
students thus ostensibly handicapped. So a vicious circle has been 
established which has prevented both the development of the public- 
school system and the realization of true collegiate standards. 
South Carolina has been one of the States which has suffered from 
these conditions. The State education department lists 20 colleges 
for whites, 14 of which are recognized by the Bureau of Education
-P-A-G-E-161
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. 133 
  (the total white population of the State is less than three-quarters 
of a million). In 1914-15 the department recorded a total high- 
~ school enrollment of 10,481, and a total of but 673 pupils above the 
third high-school year. The difficulty of building up four-year high 
schools (but 41 schools are listed by the department as having fourth 
year students) has been greatly increased by the readiness of some 
of the colleges to accept pupils with but two or three years of high- 
school training. Concerted steps toward improving the situation 
were taken in April, 1915, when the South Carolina Association of 
Colleges passed resolutions providing that— 
for the session of 1915-16 the colleges shall admit by certificate only those 
students who have completed not less than a three-year high-school course, or its 
equivalent. 
It recommended that: 
It shall be the established policy of the association to discourage students 
from coming from any community that maintains a four-year high-school 
course until they have completed the fourth year. 
A number of other institutions in various parts of the country have 
reported to the Bureau of Education increases in the quantitative 
requirements for admission. Thus, for example, H. Sophie New- 
comb Memorial College, Maryland State College, Oregon Agri- 
cultural College, and Washington and Lee University have raised 
their entrance requirements to 15 units. Baldwin-Wallace Col- 
lege has increased its requirements for conditioned entrance from 12 
to 18 units, and the requirements for full standing from 14 to 15 
units. The University of Oklahoma, which requires 15 units for full 
standing, has raised its requirements for conditioned entrance from 
12 to 14 units. The College of Industrial Arts, at Denton, Tex., has 
raised its regular requirements to 14 units. 
A STUDY OF PENSIONS AND INSURANCE FOR COLLEGE TEACHERS. 
Special reports of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching generally command the thoughtful attention of those 
who have to do with higher education in the United States. Bulle- 
tin No. 9, 1916, of the foundation, “A Comprehensive Plan of 
Tusurance and Annuities for College Teachers,” by Henry S. 
Pritchett, president of the Carnegie foundation, is a noteworthy 
contribution to the literature of a subject in which as yet few scien- 
tific studies have been made. The conclusions reached on a matter 
of vital interest to all college teachers are likely to be regarded both 
by boards of trustees and by college faculties as of the highest im- 
portance. The preliminary statement points out that the report 
describes a plan of relief which it is believed will protect the teacher 
against the life hazards incident to his calling, which is secure and

permanent, which is within the reach of the teacher and of his col- 
lege, and which takes into account not only the interests of the 
teacher, but those of his employer and also those of the general public. 
The conclusion of the report is— 
that a contributory system in which both teacher and college join, and which 
is so constructed that it will not restrict migration from one college to another, 
is the only system of retiring annuities which is at once socially wise, eco- 
nomically sound, and permanently secure. 
This conclusion has been reached by the officers of the Carnegie 
Foundation after 10 years of experience with a different system and 
after exhaustive study of an exceedingly complicated subject. The 
foundation has a large fund to administer for the payment of pen- 
sions to college teachers. The fund is to be used for no other pur- 
pose. The directors of the foundation decided in the beginning to 
spend the income of the fund for the payment of noncontributory 
pensions in a limited number of colleges and universities,’ reserving 
the privilege of modifying the system from time to time as experi- 
ence might dictate. The rapidly increasing load upon the foun- 
dation’s income (due in part to the fact that the mortality experience 
of the foundation during the 10 years of its existence has been far 
below the most conservative tables and the cost correspondingly 
greater) points to the likelihood of the still further limitation of 
the field of its contributions in the future, unless some other plan of 
administration is adopted. 
The report was originally presented as a confidential report to 
the trustees of the foundation. The board has not yet acted upon 
the proposals, except to pass resolutions ordering the circulation 
of the report among the associated colleges and announcing “that 
whatever plan is finally adopted will be devised with scrupulous 
regard to the privileges and expectations which have been created 
under existing rules.” 
TRAINING FOR PUBLIC SERVICE. 
Efforts of university administrators during the past two decades 
have been directed as never before toward the establishment of con- 
tacts between the university and the community which it serves. To 
the observer who views American higher education as a whole, this 
endeavor to make the university in the broadest sense an instrument 
for public service will doubtless appear the most conspicuous present 
tendency. 
A manifestation of this tendency, pregnant with possibilities for 
the development of great governmental efficiency, is reported in the

ciated with the Foundation.
-P-A-G-E-163
HIGHER EDUCATION. 135 
recent projects for the establishment of courses for the training of 
public servants, which have been inaugurated by institutions in a 
number of the larger cities and by several State universities in the 
Middle West and Southwest. These projects have been promoted 
and fostered, first, by the committee on practical training for public 
service of the American Political Science Association; then by a 
national conference on universities and public service held in New 
York in May, 1914; and latterly by the Society for the Promotion of 
Training for Public Service, an organization created to cooperate 
with universities and governmental agencies in the formulation of 
plans and the circulation of propaganda looking to this end. The 
relation of this movement to certain of the purposes of the Associa- 
tion of Urban Universities (mentioned in the report of the com- 
missioner for the year 1915, page 154) will be apparent. 
The character and scope of the training contemplated are indi- 
cated by the recommendations of two institutional committees re- 
porting during the academic year just ended. Cooperation, not 
only with Governmental agencies in the actual work of administra- 
tion, but with other educational organizations, is included in both 
plans. A special committee on training for public service, appointed 
by President Butler, of Columbia University, recommended the fol- 
lowing program for training for unofficial public service and such 
higher nontechnical administrative positions as are now open in 
official service : 
1. Two or three years of regular college training, including elementary gov- 
ernment, economics, etc. 
2. One year of special training embracing the following subjects: (a@) Munici- 
pal government (specialized course) ; (0) Administrative law; (c) Public and 
municipal accounting; (d) Office and works management; (e) Public finance 
and budget making; (f) Institutions of public welfare; (g) City planning and 
social surveys; () Technique of investigation and inquiry; (i) Statistics and 
reporting, including instruction in English and graphic methods of presentation. 
3. One year of contact or field work and observation. This work should be 
done (under the direction of the standing committee on training for public 
service hereinafter described) in New York City departments or in cooperation 
with the Bureau of Municipal Research and Training School for Public Service 
in such a manner that each student may secure practical experience in— 
(a) Budget making; (b) the investigation of several branches of public 
administration; (c) the preparation of reports and recommendation on the 
basis of ascertained results; (d) the practice of presenting oral statements of 
results in short form. 
A committee on municipal service survey, appointed by President 
Mezes, of the College of the City of New York, recommended: 
(1) That there be appointed at the college a director of public service train- 
ing. It shall be the duty of this officer to keep a record of all municipal positions 
which are open to college students and the subjects and dates of approaching 
examinations. He shall also establish at the college in cooperation with  
-P-A-G-E-164
136 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
the municipal civil-service commission an intelligence office or clearing house 
for civil-service positions, and he shall be prepared to advise students as to the 
courses and methods to be pursued in preparation for such positions. He shall 
confer with the civil-service commissioners and chief examiners as to the rela- 
tion between college instruction and civil service as to examinations, standards, 
credit for field work, and eligibility. The director of public service training 
shall also confer with the heads of city departments and bureaus with regard to 
their needs and the ability of the college to supply them. 
(2) That a college standing committee on public service training be ap- 
pointed to cooperate and advise with the director. Such a committee should 
have among its membership representatives of the departments most concerned 
in the technical training of those who will enter public service. 
(8) That the announcements of the several divisions of the college contain 
a statement of the scope and work of the committee on public service training. 
(4) That provision be made for cooperation of the college with such unoffi- 
cial public agencies as the training school for public service and the Bureau 
of Municipal Research, especially with a view to the possibility of exchange 
of students, exchange of instructors, and exchange of credit. 
(5) That the special courses to be recommended and their formal organiza- 
tion be immediately taken up by the director of public service training with 
his committee and all other departments and agencies involved. 
THE PROPOSAL FOR A STATE UNIVERSITY IN MASSACHUSETTS. 
It is a well-known fact that the older Commonwealths of the East 
have less generally provided higher education at State expense 
(except in agriculture and mechanic arts, for the partial main- 
tenance of which Federal appropriations are also made) than have 
the Western and Southern States. 
Recently certain persons in several of the Eastern States have 
urged the creation of State universities as the logical culmination 
of the State’s educational enterprise, and as the only sure means of 
providing equal educational opportunities for all citizens. One of 
these proposals has already been alluded to (see p. 131). A second, 
perhaps of even greater interest, concerns the foundation of a State 
university in Massachusetts. 
Without reference to the rank and reputation of the privately 
endowed institutions of Massachusetts, a mere statistical summary 
of their number, enrollments, and financial resources indicates that 
this State is singularly well equipped with facilities for higher train- 
ing. In spite of this fact, however, the State board of education was 
instructed to prepare for submission to the legislature of 1915 a plan 
for the establishment of a State university. Under these instruc- 
tions the board was allowed no discretion. It consequently sub- 
mitted forms for two acts which might be made the basis of legisla- 
tion. The first provided for an initial appropriation of $500,000, 
for the purpose of acquiring grounds and buildings and organizing 
a teaching institution. The second provided for the annual appro- 
priation of a scholarship fund of $100,000, to be administered by the
-P-A-G-E-165
  
HIGHER EDUCATION. 137 
  board and to be used in paying the tuition of worthy young people 
at existing institutions. 
The board also suggested— 
that as an alternative to a State university established as an institution 
offering regular courses of instruction the Commonwealth might create and 
maintain a university of Massachusetts as a nonteaching organization, which 
should consist of a board of trustees authorized to conduct university exten- 
sion courses and correspondence courses, to administer a system of State 
scholarships, to promote the training of secondary school teachers and of 
school administrators and supervisors, to provide for organized cooperation 
between higher institutions of learning in Massachusetts on the one hand and 
the State and municipal departments on the other, and to secure proper articu- 
lation of. high school and college by organizing and putting into effect plans 
whereby the above results may be secured through cooperation with existing 
colleges and universities. 
Such a university should, at least at the outset, maintain no faculty. It 
should be provided with buildings and equipment necessary for the proper con- 
duct of its administrative work. If circumstances warranted, it might in 
time be authorized to organize and maintain a permanent staff of lecturers for 
Subjects or courses not otherwise available. It is believed that the institutions 
of higher education in Massachusetts would cooperate with such a university, 
and it has been stated that there would be readiness to support, without ex- 
pense to the State, a certain number of exension courses. 
The committee of the legislature to which the matter was referred 
reported that no legislation was necessary. The legislature, how- 
ever, passed a very important measure which looks in the general 
direction of the board’s proposals. This provided for the establish- 
ment of a department of university extension under the direction and 
control of the board of education and appropriated $25,000 for its 
maintenance during the year 1915. 
ACADEMIC FREEDOM. 
The issues implicit in the question of academic freedom transcend 
in importance all others. They concern not only the extent of the 
legitimate powers of boards of trustees; they concern the integrity 
of universities and the integrity of the scholar’s calling; they involve, 
ultimately, the whole principle of progress in the social order. 
The recent series of instances of alleged breaches of academic free- 
dom, which have almost the appearance of an epidemic, deserve ex- 
tended discussion in the commissioner’s report. Such discussion was 
begun last year. (See Rep. of Commis. of Educ., 1915, pp. 157 et 
seq.) Some of the wider implications of the question of academic 
freedom were then mentioned. The reports of several committees 
appointed by various associations of scholars to investigate cases 
of disciplinary action visited by boards of trustees on professors 
accused of expressing unpopular opinions were summarized. The 
formation of the American Association of University Professors, 
and its inevitable preoccupation with this matter, were noted.
-P-A-G-E-166
  138 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
During the year under review a number of reports dealing with 
other cases of alleged breaches of academic freedom have emanated 
from this association. The most significant document published by 
the association is the report of the general committee of 15 (men- 
tioned in the commissioner’s report, 1915, p. 161) on academic free- 
dom and academic tenure, submitted to the association at its second 
annual meeting in December, 1915. Both the representative and 
responsible character of the association which issues it, and the emi- 
nence of the men whose signatures are attached, would bespeak 
for the report in any event the careful consideration of university 
boards and executives. Its content, moreover, is worthy of its au- 
thors and its sponsor. It constitutes one of the most valuable con- 
tributions of the year to the discussion of educational policy. The 
pamphlet has already been widely distributed by the Bureau of 
Education among those concerned with the direction of higher edu- 
cation and only brief mention can be given to it here. 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE, 
The report is divided into two parts, the first a general declaration 
of principles which it is hoped will promote a clearer understanding 
of the issues, and the second a group of practical proposals designed 
at the same time to safeguard academic freedom and to protect uni- 
versity executives and governing boards from unjust charges of its 
infringement. 
It is pointed out in Part I that academic freedom, in so far as it 
concerns the teacher, comprises three elements: Freedom of research, 
freedom of teaching within the institution, and freedom of extra- 
mural utterance and action. 
The report distinguishes between two radically different types of 
institutions, the relatively rare proprietary schools designed for the 
propagation of specific doctrines, religious or economic, and the 
ordinary college or university not strictly bound to a propagandist 
duty. ‘ 
The nature of the trust reposed in the governing boards of what 
the repert significantly calls “ untrammeled institutions of learning ” 
is emphatically declared to be public. Whether the institution be a 
State institution or a privately endowed institution appealing to the 
general public for support and patronage, “the trustees are trustees 
for the public. * * * They can not be permitted to assume the 
proprietary attitude and privilege * * * [they] have no moral 
right to bind the reason or the conscience of any professor.” “ This 
elementary distinction between a private and a public trust is not yet 
so universally accepted as it should be in our American institutions,” 
but it is essential that it be recognized by governing boards.
-P-A-G-E-167
HIGHER EDUCATION, 139 
  The preservation of the dignity and independence of the profes- 
sorate is necessary not only to bring into the profession men of high 
gifts and character, but also to insure the honest performance of their 
function of dealing with knowledge at first hand and reporting the 
results without fear or favor. 
In discussing the relationship between university trustees and mem- 
bers of university faculties the committee makes what is probably 
the most important pronouncement of the whole report: 
The latter are the appointees, but not in any sense the employees, of the 
former. For, once appointed, the scholar has professional functions to per- 
form in which the appointing authorities have neither competency nor moral 
right to intervene. * * * So far as the university teacher’s independence 
of thought and utterance is concerned, though not in other regards, the re- 
lationship of professor to trustees may be compared to that between judges of 
the Federal courts and the Executive who appoints them. University teachers 
should be understood to be, with respect to the conclusions reached and ex- 
pressed by them, no more subject to the control of the trustees than are judges 
subject to the control of the President with respect to their decisions. 
It is pointed out that in the earlier days of American universities 
the chief menace to academic freedom was ecclesiastical, and that 
philosophy and the natural sciences were the subjects chiefly affected, 
but that now the danger zone has been shifted to the social sciences. 
The one [danger] which is the more likely to affect the privately endowed col- 
leges and universities is the danger of restrictions upon the expression of opin- 
ions which point toward extensive social innovations, or call in question the 
moral legitimacy or social expediency of economic conditions or commercial 
practices in which large vested interests are involved. 
Although the fact is not generally recognized, “the existence in 
a democracy of an overwhelming and concentrated public opinion” 
may also constitute a serious obstacle to the real liberty of the 
individual. 
An inviolable refuge from such tyranny should be found in the university. It 
should be an intellectual experiment station, where new ideas may germinate 
and where their fruit, though still distasteful to the community as a whole, may 
be allowed to ripen until finally, perchance, it may become a part of the accepted, 
intellectual food of the Nation or of the world. 
It is not, however, the purpose of the report to imply that the 
university teacher is to be subject to no restraints whatever. 
The liberty of the scholar within the university to set forth his conclusions, be 
they what they may, is conditioned by their being conclusions gained by the 
scholar’s method and held in a scholar’s spirit; that is to say, they must be 
the fruits of competent and patient and sincere inquiry, and they should be set 
forth with dignity, courtesy, and temperateness of language. 
Part II of the report proposes four measures to be adopted by uni- 
versities with a view to preserving academic freedom, protecting 
governing boards themselves, and bringing into the academic pro-
-P-A-G-E-168
140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
fession men of ability and strong personality. They are, reduced to 
lowest terms: 
1. Action by faculty committees on reappointments. 
2. Definition of tenure of office, in order that there may be at every institu- 
tion “an unequivocal understanding as to the term of appointment; and the 
tenure of professorships and associate professorships, and all positions above the 
grade of instructor after 10 years of service, should be permanent (subject to 
provisions hereinafter given for removal upon charges).” 
8. Formulation of grounds for dismissal. 
4. Judicial hearings before dismissal. ‘“ Every university or college teacher 
should be entitled, before dismissal or demotion, to have the charges against 
him stated in writing in specific terms, and to have a fair trial on those charges 
before a special or permanent judicial committee chosen by the faculty senate 
or council, or by the faculty at large.” 
This important report was signed by 13 of the committee of 15 (2 
having resigned during the progress of the committee’s delibera- 
tions). 
REPORTS OF SPECIAL COMMITTEES OF INQUIRY OF THE AMERICAN 
ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS. 
Special committees to investigate alleged infringements of aca- 
demic freedom at the University of Utah, the University of Montana, 
the University of Colorado, and the University of Pennsylvania 
were appointed during the first year of the association’s existence. 
The report on conditions at the University of Utah was published 
in July, 1915, and was discussed in the preceding issue of this doc- 
ument (see Rep. of Commis. of Educ., 1915, pp. 161 et seq.). At 
the meeting of the association in December, 1915, the reports of the 
committees on the incidents at the Universities of Colorado and 
Pennsylvania were submitted, together with a summary report of 
the general committee on academic freedom and academic tenure on 
the case of Prof. Willard C. Fisher, of Wesleyan University, a case 
referred to the general committee by an earlier committee of nine 
from the American Economic Association, the American Political 
Science Association, and the American Sociological Society. (See 
Rep. of Commis. of Educ., 1915, pp. 160 et seq.) All three of these 
reports have since been published by the association. The capacity 
of the association to deal with matters affecting the welfare of its 
own members in a judicial manner, with restraint and with perfect 
fairness toward all concerned, is conspicuously demonstrated in these 
documents. Moreover, its findings and suggestions apparently have 
already helped to bring about at two institutions radical revisions 
of the regulations relating to professorial tenure. 
  
1The committee of inquiry on the Montana case was not ready to report at the Decem- 
ber meeting. It was authorized to lay its report when finished before the association in 
print.

  HIGHER EDUCATION, 141 
THE NEARING CASE. 
  Probably no other case of the alleged infringement of academic 
freedom has attracted such widespread interest and has given rise to 
such prolonged and heated controversy in the public prints as has the 
case of Prof. Scott Nearing, whose appointment as assistant professor 
of economics at the University of Pennsylvania was, contrary to all 
expectation and precedent, not renewed in the spring of 1915. The 
facts, as far as they were then obtainable, were stated in the com- 
missioner’s report for 1915 (pp. 165 et seq.). The commonly assumed 
cause of Dr. Nearing’s virtual dismissal and the attitude of various 
members of the university board of trustees and of groups of alumni 
toward the questions at issue were also indicated. The very brief 
summary of the findings of the committee of inquiry of the American 
Association of University Professors therefore is sufficient to com- 
plete for the purposes of these reports the record of this incident. 
This summary follows: 
As to the procedure followed by the board of trustees in its action with 
reference to this member of the university faculty the following facts are 
established : 
1. The position held by Dr. Nearing was one carrying a definite presumption 
of reappointment in case of satisfactory service. 
2. It was duly made known to the board of trustees by the department of 
economics and by the dean of the Wharton School that Dr. Nearing’s service 
was regarded as satisfactory, and he was expressly recommended for reappoint- 
ment. The board was also informed by the dean that this recommendation had 
the substantial support of the Wharton School faculty. 
8. This recommendation of the qualified representatives of the educational 
staff of the Wharton School was rejected by the board of trustees on June 14 
without further consultation with those representatives, without reference of 
the case for judicial inquiry to any faculty committee, and (originally) without 
assignment of reason. 
4. The board’s own action on June 14 was not judicial in character. No 
opportunity for a hearing upon the charges or criticisms made against him was 
afforded Dr. Nearing; nor did the board conduct any inquiry on its own account 
to ascertain whether the persons outside the university, by whose criticisms the 
board declares its action to have been determined, had been correctly informed 
as to Dr. Nearing’s. utterances or had correctly understood them, or whether 
their criticisms were, in fact, justified by the authentic language of the utter- 
ances in question. 
The committee is accordingly compelled to conclude that at least a contribu- 
tory cause of Dr. Nearing’s removal was the opposition of certain persons out- 
side the university to the views, upon questions within his own field of study, 
expressed by him in his extra-mural addresses. 
It says: 
Removal or refusal of appointment wholly or partly upon such a ground, 
without judicial inquiry by any committee of fellow-economists or other 
scholars, the committee can only regard as an infringement of academic freedom.

  142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
THE NEW STATUTES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. 
This incident, otherwise regrettable, has apparently led the trustees 
of the University of Pennsylvania to alter the regulations previously 
in force with regard to the tenure of teaching positions and the pro- 
cedure in the dismissal of professors. Indeed, evidence is not want- 
ing that the activities of the Association of University Professors 
may have had influence in the decision of the board to take this step. 
Although the new regulations do not coincide with the association’s 
“Practical proposals” (see p. 184)—in fact were adopted before the 
association’s committee made its report—nevertheless, they represent 
a conscientious effort to attain substantially the same ends.

  CHAPTER IX. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
By Witt1am T. Bawbden, 
Specialist in Industrial Hducation. 
1. SUMMARY OF SALIENT FEATURES OF PROGRESS NOTED. 
A review of vocational education for the year is afforded by the 
following condensed summary of the most significant features which 
have been noted as indicating the directions in which progress is 
taking place: (1) In place of the conception of vocational education 
as a comparatively simple matter, which prevailed a few years ago, 
there is an evident tendency to see in it a very complex problem, for 
the solution of which there must be much patient investigation and 
the cordial cooperation of all possible educational and social agencies. 
(2) There appears to be a growing recognition of the fact that voca- 
tional education will not of itself solve all the problems of life or of 
vocation, but that it must take its place as an essential part of a 
complete plan of education that provides for all legitimate interests 
and activities of the individual. (3) There has been almost un- 
precedented interest in the proposed Federal aid for vocational edu- 
cation; it is doubtful if any other educational bill before Congress 
ever attracted an equal amount of popular attention. (4) The seri- 
ous objections urged against vocational education have been stated 
in somewhat more definite and tangible form and the answers to 
these objections suggested. (5) There has been noticeably less in- 
terest in the unit-versus-dual-control controversy, the preponderance 
of opinion appearing to be against the organization of special in- 
dependent boards for the control of vocational education. (6) In 
the States which have organized departments for the promotion of 
vocational education on a State-wide basis the greatest progress 
noted during the year appears to have been in the development of the 
day continuation school for young employed workers. (7) Recogni- 
tion of the importance of proper machinery for insuring a supply 
of adequately trained teachers, including an effective plan of cer- - 
tification, is gradually making itself felt, though much ground still 
143
-P-A-G-E-172
  144 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
remains to be traversed. (8) The emphasis on language work in 
vocational schools, and the high grade of results of such wor’ as 
exhibited in numerous school papers and magazines written, edited, 
and printed by students, afford ample evidence that the cultural pos- 
sibilities of vocational education are not being neglected and that the 
necessity of a thorough grounding in the fundamentals of education 
is clearly recognized. (9) In the vocational guidance field the im- 
portant progress of the year has been a further development of in- 
terest on the part of the public school and the resulting beginnings ~ 
of modification of school methods and courses of study. (10) In 
convention deliberations and in magazine articles there has been in- 
creasing emphasis on the significance of art in industry and the 
great importance of more adequate attention to this matter in all 
plans for education. (11) Within the past year or two there have 
been several notable instances of the employment of a trained di- 
rector, with instructions to make a careful study of conditions before 
buildings or courses of study are planned—in contrast with which 
has been a rather common practice in other types of school in the 
past, namely, to erect and equip the building and then seek a prin- 
cipal. (12) The extension of the survey idea to the field of State- 
wide investigations, in which the Bureau of Education has done 
pioneer work, has for the first time been applied to a State-wide vo- 
cational education survey in Indiana, where a study has been inaugu- 
rated by a group of agencies working in cooperation. (13) There 
has been much discussion, as well as actual development, in the field 
of so-called prevocational education. (14) There has been a notice- 
able development of new types of work in the manual-training shops 
in the effort to meet the demand for courses that shall be more prac- 
tical and that shall have more real value in preparing the way for 
specific industrial education. (15) There has been a noticeable tend- 
ency in the direction of a more sympathetic and sane appraisal of 
the values of the manual arts in the public school on the part of the 
partisans of so-called real yocational education. 
2. CONSERVATIVE OBJECTIONS EXAMINED. 
During the past year educational conservatives have expressed 
themselves on a number of occasions with reference to certain antici- 
pated serious shortcomings of the vocational education program. 
The warnings of those who foresee difficulties in the forward progress 
of a movement that gives promise of being so widespread and thor- 
oughgoing are not to be treated lightly, but should receive attention 
appropriate to the gravity of the situation and the importance of the 
sources.
-P-A-G-E-173
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 145 
Analysis of the serious objections that have been urged against 
vocational education shows that most of them belong to one of the 
following classes: : 
1. Control_—Some of the friendly as well as unfriendly critics of 
vocational education fear lest it fall under the control of sinister or 
selfish interests. To these critics it seems easy to see that prospec- 
tive employers of other people’s talents and abilities will reap some 
advantage from a general increase in the quantity and quality of 
ability for hire; but the possibility of advantage to those whose tal- 
ents are developed seems difficult of comprehension. 
The best-known correctives of control by or for selfish interests are 
publicity and popular understanding of the situation. Since both of 
these correctives show a healthy growth during the past few years, it 
may be confidently expected that the danger, if it exists, will be ap- 
preciated in due time and appropriately dealt with. 
It seems even more certain now than it did a year ago that the 
popular demand will be irresistible that vocational education be de- 
veloped in connection with, and as a part of, the public-school sys- 
tem. Without question the cooperation of other agencies will be 
sought and utilized, but it appears to be generally accepted that the 
logical scheme of administration centers in a single board of public- 
school trustees the responsibility for all forms of education supported 
by public taxation. If, therefore, vocational education be developed 
as an integral part of the public-schoc] system, and if boards of 
education continue to be reasonably responsive to public opinion, 
there seems to be good ground for assuming that vocational educa- 
tion will prove to be as able as any other department of public educa- 
tion to withstand the pressure of interests that are inimical to the 
public good. It is extremely important that public-school authori- 
ties prepare themselves for the new responsibilities that now seem 
imminent, by thorough study of all the factors involved in vocational 
education. 
2. Narrowness of aim—A second form of objection arises from 
the belief that the vocational education program is determined by 
an incomplete vision of the real meaning of education, and that it 
sets up aims that are indefensibly narrow. Basing their judgment 
on the performance of certain private institutions conducted pri- 
marily for gain, critics of this type appear to conceive that to 
train a boy or girl in the operation of some factory machine or 
process by means of a brief intensive course is regarded and accepted 
as vocational education. To this view the one sufficient reply is that 
it is wholly mistaken. There is no evidence that this is the view held 
by the framers of any of the legislation thus far enacted. On the 
contrary, emphasis is quite generally placed, in the laws themselves,
-P-A-G-E-174
  146 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
on the “supplementary instruction necessary to build a well-rounded 
course of training.” 
Furthermore, the experience of the States which have undertaken 
to deal specifically with this problem demonstrates that this narrow 
conception of vocational education is not the one which will prevail 
in this country. It may be possible to find imperfections in ad- 
ministrative machinery and defects in method of instruction, all of 
which are being constantly and earnestly studied with the object of 
their elimination, but it is not believed that the leaders of the voca- 
tional education movement can be justly charged with seeking any- 
thing less than the highest interests of young people and the social 
whole. E 
8. Prescription of future careers.—There are those who proclaim 
the dangers involved in vocational education because of its supposed 
’ tendency to prescribe or fix the future careers of boys and girls on 
the level of the training given, which is assumed to be “lower,” or 
in some way less desirable, than that of traditional education. One 
prominent spokesman for this group publicly charges vocational 
education with being a deliberate attempt to determine arbitrarily 
the life occupations of boys and girls, and to divert them at a tender 
age into careers which hold no promise for the future. 
As Dr. Snedden has ably pointed out, this is a baseless charge. 
There is no issue with regard to vocational education under 14 years 
of age, since there is “little or no serious discussion of vocational 
education, as direct and purposive preparation for a specific calling, 
which now contemplates any claim upon the years required in most 
States to be given to compulsory school attendance, namely from 
6 to 14 years of age.”+ Neither has there been offered any serious 
proposal to curtail existing opportunities for advanced education 
and culture. The point that appears to be overlooked in this criticism 
is that, regardless of where the responsibility lies, there are thou- 
sands of young people who are not receiving the advantages of 
education or training of any kind. Even if the traditional high 
school and college facilities were immediately doubled, many of 
these young persons would grow to maturity without adequate educa- 
tion, because, for a variety of reasons, they do not or will not go to 
the high schools and colleges that are available. 
The new point of view represents, in part at least, a sincere attempt 
to serve the thousands of persons who are not being helped by exist- 
ing schools, because they are not in them. It is merely begging the 
question to assert that the proposed schools or courses will tend to 
prescribe the careers of those who are attracted by them, and that 
the students will thereby be deprived of all prospects of future ad-

vancement. Vocational education of less than college grade has not 
been sufficiently tried out in many places to justify the claim that it 
can not succeed where other efforts have failed. It may be pointed 
out very appropriately, on the contrary, that in places where the ex- 
periment has been made the results to date are highly satisfactory 
to all concerned. 
+. Difficulty of adaptation —Another objection is based on the al- 
leged difficulty, if not impossibility, of adapting specific vocational 
education to the rapidly changing conditions of commerce and in- 
dustry. It is held that it is useless to attempt to train boys to be- 
come efficient workmen in the machine industry, for example, as it is 
to-day, for by next year the methods and processes which they have 
mastered may have become obsolete, and their “jobs” may have van- 
ished. 
Against this objection it may be effectually urged that: (a) Any 
specific training for a useful occupation which may be received, or 
any marketable skill which may be acquired, constitutes a positive 
asset for the individual, and is to be regarded as immeasurably val- 
uable in comparison with the equipment of the individual who has no 
definite training or skill. Further, the very fact of having mastered 
the technic of one occupation, even though that becomes obsolete, 
gives one the confidence to struggle with the demands of a new call- 
ing if perchance that becomes necessary. (b) As already indicated, 
before the problem of vocational education can be considered solved, 
so far as the fields of commerce and industry are concerned, a way 
must be found to do something more than fit the individual for a 
particular “job,” and this the program definitely aims to do. It can 
not be legitimately asserted that public vocational education any- 
where is neglecting or minimizing the importance of this difficulty, 
or is manifesting a disposition to be satisfied with anything less than 
its resolution. (¢) The possibility of some adjustment on the part 
of industry itself must be assumed. It is inconceivable that society 
will permanently and complacently accept working conditions that 
demand the sacrifice of human values in the interest of so-called effi- 
ciency. It is the duty, therefore, of vocational education to study 
conditions and demands as they are, and to arouse popular interest 
in their improvement wherever possible. (d) To advocate a halt in 
the progress of vocational education on the ground that the way is 
beset with difficulties is not becoming to those who would elevate 
education to the status of a profession. 
5. Hapense.—Finally, the development of vocational education as 
a public responsibility has been opposed on the ground that it is 
expensive, and that, therefore, it is a matter to be left to the indi- 
vidual workers or to the employers, who are to profit by it.
-P-A-G-E-176
  148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
Vocational education of less than college grade és expensive, but 
so is vocational education of college or university grade. Ignorance 
is more expensive than either. It costs the public far more to edu- 
cate a surgeon or a lawyer or an engineer than it does to educate 
a young person for one of the industrial or commercial pursuits 
contemplated, and yet there is no great outcry against medical or 
legal or engineering education because it is expensive. It is com- 
ing to be more and more recognized that money devoted to educa- 
tion is an investment rather than an expense. 
3. NATIONAL AID FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
The bill proposing Federal aid for vocational education, drafted 
in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on 
National Aid to Vocational Education (House bill No. 16952, known 
as the Smith-Hughes bill), which was introduced in the second ses- 
sion of the Sixty-third Congress, passed the Senate on July 31, 
1916, without a dissenting vote. 
A summary of the provisions of the bill was given in the 1914 
report.’ ~ 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN THE ARMY. 
An event of much significance to education was the passage by 
Congress on May 19, 1916, of the Army bill, carrying an amend- 
ment which provides that soldiers in service shall be given an oppor- 
tunity for vocational education preparatory to return to civil life. 
The amendment reads: 
In addition to military training soldiers while in the active service shall 
hereafter be given the opportunity to study and receive instruction upon edu- 
cational lines of such character as to increase their military efficiency and 
enable them to return to civil life better equipped for industrial, commercial, 
and general business occupations. Civilian teachers may be employed to aid 
the Army officers in giving such instruction, and part of this instruction 
may consist of vocational education either in agriculture or the mechanic arts. 
The Secretary of War, with the approval of the President, shall prescribe rules 
and regulations for conducting the instruction therein provided for, and the 
Secretary of War shall have the power at all times to suspend, increase, or 
decrease the amount of such instruction offered as may, in his judgment, be 
consistent with the requirements of military instruction and service of the 
soldiers. 
Representatives of the National Society for the Promotion of In- 
dustrial Education assisted in the preparation of the outline of a 
plan for the organization of a commission, which, it is suggested, 
should make a careful study of vocational education in the Army 
and draft a report on the subject.

4, STATE SYSTEMS OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 
There has been much activity during the year that does not lend 
itself to tabular representation, or to description in impressive 
terms. Nevertheless material progress has been made. In those 
States having systems for organizing and supervising vocational 
schools and for assisting local communities in the maintenance of 
such schools through grants of State aid, the most notable advance 
during the year has been in the development and perfection of the 
part-time day continuation school for employed boys and girls of 14 
to 16 or 17 years of age. The provisions of the laws under which 
these schools operate have been discussed in previous reports.! 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Legislation.—No new legislation reported. 
Bulletins —The seventy-ninth annual report of the State board of education, 
1914-15, contains details of the progress made in vocational education. 
The following bulletins were issued during 1915-16: 
Booklet No. 2. Compulsory Continuation Schools: The Massachusetts Plan. 
No. 5. State-Aided Vocational Agricultural Education in 1915. 
No. 6. Continuation Schools in Massachusetts. 
No. 7. Training of Vocational Teachers. Current Conditions in Industrial 
Schools. 
No. 8. Statistics Regarding State-Aided Vocational Education for 1914-15. 
Continuation schools—The objects in view in the organization of continua- 
tion schools are: (1) To make a yital appeal to boys and girls of 14 to 16 
years of age who are employed, and to offer them the opportunity to continue 
their general education and to improve their social and economic status; (2) 
to help these young people to get the most out of their employment; to prevent _ 
drifting in industry; to save time lost through unemployment; (3) to reduce 
the number of misfits by assisting to more intelligent choices of occupations, 
and by assisting the process of promotion from unskilled to skilled trades; 
(4) to establish cooperative relations between schools and employers. 
Experience with these schools appears to justify the expectations that were 
entertained when they were inaugurated. The general-improvement instruc- 
tion has yielded valuable results, and the work in vocational guidance has been 
found practical and serviceable. In increased knowledge of industrial con- 
ditions and in the possession of greater industrial intelligence the pupils 
enrolled give ample evidence of the value of the continuation-school work. 
The pupils for whom these schools are maintained may be conveniently clas- 
sified into three groups, according to their major needs: (1) Those who want 
more general education; (2) those who want to choose an occupation; (8) those 
who want training in occupations already chosen. Special classes are organ- 
ized for these groups. 
The latest report shows that in 1914-15 there were in Massachusetts 77 State- 
aided vocational schools in 39 cities and towns, representing an increase from 
47 schools in 36 cities and towns reported the preceding year. The total cost 
to the municipalities and to the State for these schools was $689,870.66. This 
sum includes $17,115.57 for the expense of administration of the State office. 
The amount of reimbursement by the State to the cities and towns, on the basis

of one-half the net maintenance expense, or two-thirds the salaries of instruc- 
tors less one-half the tuition claims, was $217,914.99. There were 18,322 per- 
sons enrolled in State-aided vocational schools and 10,660 in other vocational 
schools in the State; total, 28,982. The estimated number of student hours of 
instruction for the year was 5,625,369. 
NEW YORK. 
Legislation.—No new legislation. 
Bulletins.—The following bulletins have been issued: 
No. 612. Vocational Training of Girls in the State of New York. 
No. 621. Safety First for Vocational Schools. 
No. 622. Citizenship Syllabus. 
No. 624. Agricultural Education in Secondary Schools. 
No. 625. The Manual Arts in New York State. 
The Rochester Plan of Immigrant Education. 
Training of teachers.—A special institute for the preparation of teachers 
to teach English to foreigners was held in Albany, for the benefit of teachers 
in the capital district. 
The State specialists in agricultural education, with the cooperation of the 
State College of Agriculture, held during the summer a conference of teachers 
of agriculture at the State college at Ithaca. Teachers from all the State-aided 
vocational schools of agriculture attended. 
The State is divided into districts, and a series of conferences are held each 
year for teachers in vocational schools and for teachers of drawing. 
New York City.—The mayor has appointed an industrial survey committee, 
and L. A. Wilson of this department has been chosen as director of the survey. 
An appropriation of $15,000 was made to cover the work, which will probably 
include an analysis of two trades, possibly printing and machine work. 
Special problem.—The greatest special problem is how to give expression to 
vocational education in small communities. There are two types of such com- 
munities: First, the small agricultural; and, second, the small industrial. 
A second problem is that of finding suitable vocational instruction applicable 
to small industrial communities. These communities have vocational needs as 
great in importance as those of the larger communities, and there is just as much 
need of an up-to-date school system in them as in larger cities, but they can 
not afford to spend more than from $1,500 to $2,500 for industrial equipment ; 
they can not afford to engage at the most more than one man and an assistant 
to teach the subject, and these men must not only give vocational instruction, 
but also give the necessary manual-arts instruction in the elementary and 
secondary schools. If the pupils in these communities are to have a fair 
chance at vocational guidance and training, they must receive instruction in 
woodwork, ironwork, sheet-metal work, electrical work, and concrete. The 
work which the State has been doing in these smaller communities has been 
the most interesting phase of all State-aided vocational work and at the same 
time the most difficult. 
PENNSYLVANIA, 
Special problems.—The Pennsylvania State department of public instruction 
has been confronted with the problem of assisting the schools in the adjust- 
ment to the new demands resulting from the operation of the Cox Child Labor 
Act, passed in 1915. Employed minors between the ages of 14 and 16 yéars are

  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 151 
required to attend continuation schools, where established, eight hours per week. 
Many city School systems had already made up their budgets for the year be- 
fore the law was passed and made the necessary readjustments only with great 
difficulty. 
Notwithstanding these: difficulties, 98 districts organized continuation schools 
between January 1 and June 26, 1916, employing 350 teachers, and enrolling 
over 24,000 pupils. 
Training of teachers.—The demand for teachers for the continuation schools 
made necessary the establishment of special summer schools in 1915. Five 
such schools were maintained, enrolling 311 prospective teachers, as follows: 
Philadelphia, 82; Reading, 59; Pittsburgh, 55; Scranton, 102; Altoona, 13. 
The board of education in Philadelphia organized Saturday classes for 
teachers of shopwork in elementary schools. These classes were conducted for 
the purpose of giving such instructors experience in the woodworking trades. 
The course is two years in length and includes the following subjects: First 
year—School shop management, English, drawing, shop mathematics, wood 
finishing ; second year—teaching methods, vocational education, short technical 
courses in bricklaying, cement and concrete work, plastering, and electrical 
wiring. 
Outlines for the guidance of teachers in the summer schools and in the con- 
tinuation schools have been prepared in the following subjects: English, civics, 
industrial geography, hygiene for the worker, industrial arithmetic, industrial 
drawing, pedagogy. For the special use of students in evening schools for 
minors, lesson outlines were prepared in elementary arithmetic, advanced 
arithmetic, and electricity. 
Surveys.—Brief surveys have been made in a number of communities to 
assist in determining the types of vocational education needed, kind of equip- 
ment, cost of establishing and maintaining a vocational school or department, 
and to determine how many young people would be affected by the operation 
of the child labor law. The cities studied include: McKeesport, Homestead, 
Chester, Warren, Wilkes-Barre, Harrisburg, Royersford, Pottstown, and others. 
Conferences.—The State has been divided into six districts for the purpose 
of holding district conferences of special teachers and directors of vocational 
subjects, manual training, home economics, music, and drawing. The confer- 
ences are well attended and of great assistance in developing the work in the 
special subjects. The number of these conferences held during the year was 12, 
as follows: In Pittsburgh, 2; in Philadelphia, 2; and 1 each in Scranton, 
Wilkes-Barre, Reading, Harrisburg, Warren, Ridgway, Williamsport, Bellefonte. 
Types of school.—The types of school organized include the day continuation 
school for pupils 14 to 16 years of age, evening schools, day industrial schools 
or departments, and household arts schools. 
During the year State aid has been given to 32 household arts schools and 
35 industrial schools or departments, in 88 school districts, in 24 countries. 
Over 16,000 students were enrolled in these schools. 
State aid is not Siven to classes or courses in the manual arts and the 
household arts, though the department is charged with the supervision of these 
lines of work. Incomplete reports indicate that there are 63 districts in which 
manual training is taught in the elementary schools, and 75 districts in which 
it is taught in the high schools, for which there are required 223 special, 
teachers of manual training, exclusive of the cities of Philadelphia and Pitts- 
burgh. Home economics, including cooking and sewing, is taught in the ele- 
mentary schools in 64 districts, and in the high schools in 71 districts, for which 
there are required 220 special teachers, exclusive of the cities of Philadelphia 
and Pittsburgh. :

A Digest of the Decisions of the Attorney General and Directions for the 
Issuance of Employment Certificates. 
The department has also issued supplies of the six different forms required

WISCONSIN. 
Legislation—No new legislation. 
Bulletins —Three bulletins have been published, Nos. 12, 13, 14, containing 
reports of papers and discussions at 24 district conferences of teachers and 
directors of industrial and continuation schools held during the year in various 
parts of the State. 5 
Trade agreements.—Wisconsin has an apprenticeship law under which trade 
agreements have been worked out to meet the terms of the apprenticeship con- 
tract. (See Bulletin 14, pp. 67-70.) 
Continuation schools.—Reports from 20 of the 29 cities indicate an increase 
in attendance in the day continuation schools of approximately 33 per cent and 
an increase in per capita costs and total disbursements of about 15 per cent. 
Enrolment.—The total enrollment for 1915-16 in State-aided industrial and 
continuation schools in 29 cities in Wisconsin was 36,701. The enrollment for 
the previous year was 28,215. 
NEW JERSEY. 
Legislation.—Chapter 122 of the session laws of 1916 appropriates $40,000 
for carrying out the provisions of the laws of 1913 relating to State aid for 
vocational schools for the year ending October 31, 1916. Chapter 76 of the 
supplement appropriates $60,000 for the same purpose for the year beginning 
November 1, 1916. 
Chapter 131 empowers the board of education to borrow by temporary loan 
for current expenses in anticipation of the receipt of moneys which may be 
distributed to such county in accordance with the provisions of the laws of 
1918, provided that such board shall not borrow in excess of 80 per cent of the 
amount anticipated. 
Bulletins.—The following bulletins have been published: 
1915. Vocational Education and Manual Training, Annual Report to the 
Commissioner of Education. 
1916. Amendments and Supplements to School Law; Education Bulletin, vol. 
2, No. 9, May, 1916. 
- Plans for training teachers.—A thorough course for preparing home economics 
teachers has been introduced in the State normal school at Trenton, and an ap- 
propriation has been secured for strengthening and enlarging the course during 
the coming school year, so that teachers may be prepared for all departments 
of homemaking. 
During the summer session Rutgers College maintainéd a special course for 
men vocational teachers in methods of classroom management, school discipline, 
and courses of study. ss 
At both Rutgers College and Ocean City special summer courses for women 
teachers in vocational schools have been offered. 
Conferences.—Several conferences have been held during the year, the most 
noteworthy achievement being the organization of associations, by counties and 
groups of counties, for special teachers engaged in vocational work. Wherever 
the number of teachers in attendance is large enough, as in Hudson and Hssex 
Counties, the groups are subdivided and departmental meetings are held.
-P-A-G-E-181
  
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 153 
Special types of school—The county vocational schools are rapidly extend- 
ing their work and usefulness. At the present time four counties have or- 
ganized: Atlantic, Middlesex, Essex, and Cape May. The scheme of county 
organization furnishes a larger unit for vocational schools, and, it is believed, 
will enable many of the smaller municipalities to carry on successful voca- 
tional work. 
In Cape May County and Atlantic County the experiment is being made 
of providing an instructor in homemaking to visit a number of centers, giving 
short unit courses approximately six weeks in length. Instruction is given in 
various kinds of homemaking activities. These two county supervisors also 
organize groups of girls for summer work, giving demonstrations in fruit and 
vegetable canning and other processes. 
The agricultural vocational schools in Cape May County and in Atlantic 
County, attempting strictly vocational work only, have proved very successful. 
INDIANA, 
New appointments—During the year Miss Adelaide Steele Baylor has been 
added to the staff as special agent for the supervision of home-economics in- 
struction in the State and Charles H. Winslow has been appointed as State 
director of vocational research, to have charge of a number of surveys to be 
mage under the general direction of the State department of public instruction 
and a survey committee appointed by the State board of education. 
The number of schools and departments for industrial education and home 
economics established in Indiana to date is 113, with a total enrollment for 
the year just closed of 12,186 students. This represents a net gain for the 
year of 55 schools and 4,647 students, exclusive of the enrollment of two cen- 
ters, the reports for which have not been received. 
Ten new centers for vocational education in industrial and home-making lines 
have been organized since the last report, and preliminary arrangements have 
been made for organizing vocational schools in five additional centers. Two 
centers in which classes in home making were organized last year have been 
discontinued. z 
Vocational instruction in agriculture has been organized in 14 centers, with 
a total enrollment of 492 students, representing a net gain over last year of 
eight new centers and 351 students. 
During the past year five cities—Indianapolis, Anderson, Vincennes, Ham- 
mond, and Terre Haute—have employed directors of vocational education, and 
in 10 additional centers also the vocational work has been improved and ex- 
tended. At Fort Wayne the Kerr-Murray factory plant has been leased and 
will be occupied by the boys’ vocational school; Columbus has built a new 
vocational school at a cost of $100,000; Terre Haute has acquired for use as a 
boys’ vocational school the former plant of Rose Polytechnic Institute, at a cost 
of $100,000, and a model home for the girls’ vocational school, costing $1,600; 
Anderson has effected a cooperative arrangement with the Remy electrical 
plant for the offering of electrical courses; and the day and evening work in 
Indianapolis has been materially extended. 
As noted elsewhere, the State board of education, through the office of the 
State superintendent of public instruction, in cooperation with other agencies, 
has inaugurated a significant campaign of educational and industrial surveys, 
for the purpose of developing the vocational education program of the State on 
a sound basis.

5. THE PROBLEM OF CERTIFICATING TEACHERS, 
In February, 1914, Bulletin 19 was issued by the National Society 
for the Promotion of Industrial Education, which accomplished much 
in the way of focusing attention upon the problems of selecting and 
training teachers for industrial schools. Much, however, remains to 
be done. 
During the past year attention has been called in various ways to 
the importance of applying the same principles that should deter- 
mine the selection and certification of industrial school teachers to 
the selection and certification of manual training shop teachers, and 
other special teachers, in the public schools. If one is to teach ma- 
chine-shop practice to machinist apprentices, or printing to eighth 
grade boys, or ensemble playing to a group of candidates for the 
high-school orchestra, or any one of the increasing number of newer 
subjects in the schools, a special knowledge and a special skill or 
technic are required of the teacher that can not be assumed to be in 
the possession of every person who is 18 years of age or over and 
who has had a high-school education. Stated in this form, there is 
doubtless general acceptance of the proposition. 
Prevailing practice in the examination and certification of teachers 
“indicates that there is not a disposition to assent to the equally valid 
contention that the special technical skill demanded of the teacher of 
such subjects as the examples mentioned can not be detected and 
evaluated by one who does not himself understand something of it, 
and that the possession of such skill can not be demonstrated by 
replies to a questionnaire. 
6. COOPERATION BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND OTHER AGENCIES, 
One of the notable features characteristic of the year’s progress is 
the increasing number of instances of successful cooperation be- 
tween schools and other agencies for the accomplishment of definite
-P-A-G-E-183
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 155 
educational ends.. To indicate the nature of the methods employed 
and the results achieved, the following selected cases are noted. 
SHORT COURSES IN CONCRETE. 
For one week beginning June 26, 1916, a special short course in 
concrete construction for instructors and supervisors of manual 
training and industrial education was held in Chicago, Ill. The co- 
operating interests were Lewis Institute and the extension division 
of the Portland Cement Association. It is reported that more than 
150 instructors were present, representing 21 States. 
A staff of demonstrators, special lecturers, and assistants was 
organized, and a careful program for the work was prepared. The 
instruction included lectures on the materials and processes em- 
ployed, demonstrations, and practical laboratory work in all of the 
important phases of cement and concrete construction. The object 
in view was to assist manual training and vocational teachers to 
acquire sufficient knowledge of the subject matter and processes 
and mastery of the technic to enable them to introduce practical 
laboratory courses in concrete construction in their schools. 
TRADE AGREEMENTS. 
One of the results of the Minneapolis Vocational Education Sur- 
vey was a unique contribution to the administration of industrial 
education and to the technic of cooperation. This was the inaugura- 
tion of trade agreements of five different types between organiza- 
tions of employers and employees, which were also formally ap- 
proved by the Minneapolis Board of Education, the Minnesota State 
Federation of Labor, the Minneapolis Civic and Commerce Associa- 
tion, and the trustees of Dunwoody Institute. In accordance with the 
terms of these agreements, these organizations are to cooperate in 
planning and supporting certain vocational courses which are to be 
offered in Dunwoody Institute, the Girls’ Vocational High School, 
and the technical department of the Central High School. 
The support of employers takes the form of agreement to utilize 
the graduates of the proposed courses as their first source of supply 
of new workers; in certain cases minimum wages for such workers 
are established; in certain trades periods of instruction are sched- 
uled for the dull season, the apprentices to receive one-half of regu- 
lar wages while in school; representatives of the employers will 
assist on advisory committees for the purpose of organizing courses 
of study and maintaining proper standards. 
The support of organized labor takes the form of agreement to 
require apprentices to attend such courses of instruction as are 
offéred in the various trades, and to recognize the instruction given
-P-A-G-E-184
    156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
as a definite part of the apprenticeship requirements; representatives 
of the unions will also serve on the proposed advisory committees. 
Holyoke, Mass——The development of the spirit as well as the 
actual form of cooperation is further exemplified in the experience 
of Holyoke, Mass. A group of 21 workers in the textile mills, mem- 
bers of the local union of the United Textile Workers of America, 
applied to the school authorities for a course in the evening voca- 
tional school that would help them meet some of their special 
problems. A class was organized for loom fixers, and practical 
instruction was given for a period of three months in weave forma- 
tion and cloth analysis. 
A second group of 32 men applied later for instruction in prac- 
tical work on looms. The board of trustees arranged for the use 
of a vacant room in the basement of the high school, and several 
of the local mills loaned or donated the necessary equipment. The 
looms were installed, after working hours, by men interested in the 
class. The line shafting was hung by students from the day voca- 
tional classes in carpentry, machine shop, and millwrighting. 
Kenosha, Wis——One of the women’s clubs, in cooperation with 
the public schools, has established a school for training housemaids. 
The students are employed for a few hours daily in the homes, in 
order that they may practice under normal conditions what is being 
learned in school. The aim is not only to help solve the home-service 
problem, but also to make the girls such efficient workers that they 
can command good wages. 
These widely separated examples of cooperative effort are but 
illustrative of many others which might be cited, and indicate some- 
thing of the development of a principle of action which is of great 
significance for the cause of popular education. This newer con- 
ception of education is rapidly gaining ground in the consciousness 
not only of the schoolmaster, but of the citizen, and there is taking ~ 
place a mutual readjustment in appreciation of responsibility. It 
has been suggested, and the suggestion is now being acted upon with 
salutary results, that the factory, the labor union, the commercial 
establishment, the woman’s club, the parent-teacher association, and 
other representative groups have cooperative responsibilities with 
the public school in the education of children and youth. 
7. ACTIVITIES OF ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
Interest in vocational education on the part of educational and 
other organizations gives no sign of abatement, and the contributions 
of these organizations constitute an important factor in the progress 
of the movement. It has been found necessary to condense this sec- 
tion of the chapter. .

NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
This society, under the able leadership of Secretary Alvin E. 
Dodd, continues to be one of the most important factors in the prog- 
ress of vocational education. 
MINNEAPOLIS SURVEY AND CONVENTION. 
Early in the spring arrangements were entered into with the city 
of Minneapolis for making a vocational education survey, and for 
holding there the ninth annual convention of the society. The sur- 
vey was in charge of the society’s survey committee, and a local 
survey committee, with Dr. C. A. Prosser as director. 
The unanimous opinion of the exponents of industrial education 
who visited Minneapolis for the convention was that the survey, 
prepared by six months’ work preceding the meeting, was by far the 
most important feature of the convention. Its value to Minneapolis 
has been already felt and will save a large amount of money to the 
city in avoiding mistakes in the future. 
An important result of the survey itself was the close relation into 
which it brought the various interested parties for six months. It 
was not an academic, but a working business proposition, and as a 
result of the conferences the business forces of the city are behind 
it and understand it. 
EMPLOYMENT MANAGERS’ CONFHRENCH. 
In connection with the annual convention of the society an in- 
formal conference on employment management problems took place 
at Minneapolis. One of the most important subjects discussed at 
the conference was the means of reducing the labor turnover; that 
is, the proportion of the number of employees engaged in a year to 
the total number of employees on the pay roll. It was urged that 
this reduction may be affected by (a) proper selection of employees; 
(6) developing the efficiency of employees; (c) reducing the num- 
ber of arbitrary dismissals; (d) standardardizing the rate of pro- 
duction; (¢e) protecting the physical health of workers. Other 
remedies suggested are the establishment of a central employment 
department, physical examination of applicants, industrial educa- 
tion, and square-deal management. 
An important feature was the consideration of the necessity of 
adequate training for employment executives, this training being 
such as to develop personality, intellect, and knowledge to the high- 
est possible degree. 
The importance of the relation of public employment bureaus to 
managers of employment was brought out, and the city-State-Federal 
plan of bringing the man and the job together was indorsed as a  
-P-A-G-E-186

means of diminishing unemployment and checking the great waste 
involved in frequent labor turnover. 
STATE VOCATIONAL SURVEY OF INDIANA. 
Work has begun on the State survey of Indiana, referred to else- 
where in this chapter. In the investigations, typical communities 
will be selected, and the school and city authorities will be urged to 
create an interest in the work and to cooperate with the experts in 
gathering information. It is the opinion of the State board that a 
thorough study of the industries and needs for vocational training in 
selected communities will make it possible to work out the problem in 
a successful and comprehensive way. The communities studied will 
be made typical examples for the rest of the State. 
FEDERAL LEGISLATION. 
Efforts in behalf of the Smith-Hughes bill for Federal aid to voca- 
tional education have been steadily put forth by the society and sup- 
port for and interest in the measure is greater than at any time in the 
past. During the past few months considerable information has been 
spread abroad concerning the measure and efforts to draw together 
and focus the forces interested have been successful. 
President Wilson in his message to Congress, December 7, stated 
that: “We should give intelligent Federal aid and stimulation to 
industrial and vocational education as we have long done in the large 
field of our agricultural industry.” In an address on January 27 
he further stated that: 
There are two sides to the question of preparation. There is not merely the 
military side; there is the industrial side. An ideal which I have in mind is 
this: We ought to have in this country a great system of industrial and yvoca- 
tional education, under Federal guidance, and with Federal aid in which a very 
large percentage of the youth of this country will be given training in the 
skillful use and application of the principles of science in maneuver and business. 
SURVEY WORK BY THE SOCIBTY. 
There has been extensive correspondence during the year with a 
number of cities of the country which have asked for advice and 
suggestion on vocational education, particularly on questions of sur- 
veys and studies of industries for purposes of industrial education. 
Boston: In response to a request of the Massachusetts branch of the national 
society, Miss Cleo Murtland, assistant secretary, was assigned to work in 
Boston for the purpose of securing data about the garment trades of that city. 
Cincinnati: The chamber of commerce asked the national society to aid in 
making a study of the garment trades of that city for the purpose of deter- 
mining how best to establish a trade school for girls. Miss Murtland was 
assigned to this work. 
New York: A study of the department-store employments was also under- 
taken by Miss Murtland. A report of this study will be made by the Depart- 
ment Store Education Association, for which organization the work was done.

TRAINING COURSES FOR TRADESWOMEN, 
A teachers’ training course for tradeswomen was conducted by 
Miss Murtland during the past summer under the direction of Prof. 
R. J. Leonard, of the department of industrial education of Indiana 
University. This course, which was presented: according to the poli- 
cies of the national society, is the first attempt to present teaching 
methods to a group wholly made up of women from the trades. 
Eighteen women were enrolled in the course, representing millinery 
and dressmaking trades and housekeeping. Ten sessions of three 
hours each were devoted to lectures, discussions, and demonstrations. 
The afternoons were given over to excursions to places of interest to 
the women and their work. The experiment was eminently suc- 
cessful and will be continued along similar lines next summer for 
several groups of tradeswomen and for a small group of profes- 
sionally trained teachers who are engaged as teachers in vocational 
schools of this State. 
PUBLICATIONS ISSUED AND DISTRIBUTED. 
The publication during the year past of a series of news letters has 
served to emphasize the importance and value of a “house organ” if 
the society is to extend its influence and keep in touch with its mem- 
bership and those interested in the subject. During the past year the 
following publications were distributed to the membership: 
Bulletin No. 20. The Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Convention, Rich- 
mond, 1914.

NATIONAL VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE ASSOCIATION. 
Two important meetings of the association have been held, oné 
at Oakland, Cal., August 17, 18, 1915, in connection with the 
International Congress of Education, and the second at Detroit, 
Mich., February 21, 22, 1916, in connection with the annual conven- 
tion of the Department of Superintendence. Limitations of space 
prevent adequate reports of these meetings. At the Detroit meeting 
officers for the new year were elected, including: President, Meyer 
Bloomfield, Boston, Mass.; secretary, W. Carson Ryan, jr., Bureau 
of Education, Washington, D. C. 
The association now publishes a monthly bulletin, containing re- 
ports of conventions, reviews of current books and magazine articles, 
lists of helpful reference material, and general information relating 
to the development of vocational guidance. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION OF THE MIDDLE WEST, 
The Vocational Education Association of the Middle West held 
its second annual convention in Chicago, March 30 to April 1, 1916. 
The following topics received special attention at the sessions of this 
convention: The experiment with the Gary system in New York 
City and its relation to vocational education; the importance of social 
as well as individualistic ideals in education; vocational education for 
women and girls; school and employment; the vital importance of « 
agricultural education. 
The officers for 1916-17 are: President, George H. Miller, of Sears, 
Roebuck & Co., Chicago; vice president, Paul C. Stetson, principal 
of South High School, Grand Rapids, Mich.; secretary, Albert G. 
Bauersfeld, Lane Technical High School, Chicago; treasurer, Miss 
C. H. Smith, of L. C. Smith Typewriter Co., Chicago. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The committee on vocational education of the National Education 
Association presented a preliminary report at the 1913 convention in 
Salt Lake City, and a supplementary report at the 1914 convention 
in St. Paul. The revised report has been published as a bulletin by 
the Bureau of Education, 1916, No. 21.
-P-A-G-E-189
    
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 161 
The report is prepared in the form of a handbook for the guidance 
of superintendents of schools in studying the needs of a community, 
and in introducing the various types of schools designed to meet these 
needs. 
THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR. 
The American Federation of Labor has again emphasized its coop- 
eration with the forces that are endeavoring to study the problems 
of vocational education, and to seek the organization everywhere of 
schools and courses of instruction that shall advance the best interests 
of all concerned and shall be based on sound principles of public 
policy. 
There are two principles which are conceived by the officers of the 
federation as of paramount importance: (1) The agitation for the 
reorganization of the public school system, in order to make it serve 
more efficiently the real needs of boys and girls and young people, 
must not be permitted to take the form of, or result in, a movement 
to diminish or abridge in any way existing opportunities for general 
education. The reorganization of the schools now in process of 
development, involving the introduction of various kinds of courses 
designed to meet the needs gf all types of children, is believed to be 
progress in the right direction in the main. 
Under existing conditions all children can not attend colleges and 
advanced technical schools, and become doctors and lawyers and 
engineers; consequently there is a real demand that the educational 
system shall recognize other legitimate and worthy aims besides that 
of preparing for college and the higher professions. Nevertheless, 
it is held, the newer types of courses that are developed in the at- 
tempt to meet these recognized needs must not presuppose any in- 
evitable limitations upon the prospects of future advancement of the 
young people-who avail themselves of the opportunities offered. The 
representatives of labor properly maintain that the door of educa- 
tional opportunity and advancement must always be kept open, and 
every individual should be permitted to progress just as far as per- 
sonal ability and willingness to apply himself will carry him. In 
this view, vocational education is not to be thought of as a substitute 
for general education, but as an essential part of it. To every one 
should be vouchsafed the opportunity for a broad all-round educa- 
tion that makes for complete manhood or womanhood, which should 
be supplemented by adequate preparation for a chosen occupation. 
(2) The second principle emphasized by the federation has to do 
with the method of organizing and conducting vocational schools. 
The position taken is that whatever is attempted at public expense 
under the form of vocational education should be under public and 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  
162 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
not private control, and, further, that the control of all types of 
school supported by public taxation should be centered in a single 
authority responsible directly to the will of the people; that is, the 
local board of public-school trustees in a city or town and the State 
department of public instruction in a State. 
Resolutions in support of these contentions, as recommended by 
the committee on education, were adopted at the thirty-fifth annual 
convention, held at San Francisco, Cal., November 17, 1915.1 
Further explanation of the point of view of the workers is given 
in an editorial by President Gompers, from which the following 
extract is taken :? 
To assure every child equal free opportunities for the kind of education 
which meets his needs and talents is the only basis for genuine equality of 
opportunity—the only condition upon which democracy will function. 
The old cultural ideals of education, dealing with the abstract only, denied 
to the great majority of children an education adapted to their minds and 
natures, and hence failed to fit them for the duties and possibilities of the 
work of life. There have come ideals of an education that teaches out of life 
and work; that deals with the concrete materials of environment and the duties 
and activities of life. This education seeks to put into the lives of all that 
understand appreciation of the significance of service performed in all the 
relations of life—an appreciation that shall illuminate all of work and life. 
Because the wage earners have been taught by life that equal educational 
opportunities, adapted to the needs of all, are a condition requisite to equal 
economic opportunities, they have been foremost in pressing demands for the 
incorporation of industrial education and vocational training as a part of our 
public-school system. 
The interest of the federation is not confined to problems of 
industrial education, as an examination of the report of the com- 
mittee on education will show. Not only does the national body 
have a special committee for the broad study of educational prob- 
lems, but State and local organizations have established similar 
committees. One of the latest instances of this action is that taken 
at the annual convention of the Wyoming State Federation, held 
at Casper, Wyo., July, 1916, at which time President H. W. Fox 
recommended and secured the appointment of a permanent com- 
mittee on education. 
During the past. year. the federation has cooperated through its 
representatives in important vocational-education surveys and 
other investigations in the State of Indiana, in Minneapolis, Minn., 
and elsewhere. At a regular meeting of the national executive 
council, held in Washington, D. C., June 26 to July 3, 1916, it was 
decided to recommend a study of the so-called Gary system of public 
schools.

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATION SCHOOLS. 
The fourth annual convention of the association was held in 
Pittsburgh, Pa., May 30 to June 2, 1916. Considerable attention on 
the program was given to reports of committees which had been at 
work during the year, including those on vocational guidance, em- 
ployment plans, schools for office work, and others. 
This convention gave further emphasis to the declaration pre- 
viously made that the attitude of the association toward the public- 
school system is that of cooperation, correlation, assistance, and 
helpful suggestion, rather than of destructive criticism. There was 
much earnest discussion of the question as to how far the public 
schools may be expected to carry their activities, and as to what 
educational functions may legitimately be assumed by industrial 
corporations. The association is seeking also to ascertain its respon- 
sibilities with reference to other problems closely related to educa- 
tion, such as vocational guidance, safety, employment, and similar 
lines of activity. 
_ The 1917 convention will be held in Buffalo, N. Y. Officers elected. 
at the Pittsburgh convention include: President, H. J. Tily, Phila- 
delphia, Pa.; executive secretary, F. C. Henderschott, Irving Place 
and Fifteenth Street, New York, N. Y. 
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. 
Among the powerful national organizations which have been ac- 
tive in the propaganda for vocational education is the Chamber of 
Commerce of the United States. At its first annual meeting in 
January, 1913, resolutions were adopted by the national chamber 
indorsing the principle of Federal aid and encouragement in the 
establishment of vocational schools of manufacture, commerce, agri- 
culture, and home economics. The convention also indorsed the 
Page bill, which was before Congress at that time, and urged its 
enactment. 
On January 18, 1916, the committee on education submitted a 
report on the subject of Federal aid for vocational education. This 
report was considered at the fourth annual convention, and on 
April 1, 1916, a resolution was adopted providing that the recom- 
mendations of the committee be submitted to referendum vote of 
the constituent members. 
On June 2, 1916, a special bulletin was issued making public the 
recommendations and the result of the balloting, as follows: 
1, The committee recommends liberal Federal appropriations for promotion of 
vocational education in the United States. Votes: 8314 in favor; 109} against. 
2. The committee recommends that Federal appropriations should be allotted 
among the States upon a uniform basis and should bear a uniform relation to 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  
  164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
appropriations made by the States for like purposes. Votes: 828 in favor; 
95 against. 
3. The committee recommends the creation of a Federal board, to be repre- 
sentative of the interests vitally concerned and to be compensated sufficiently 
to command great ability. Votes: 7884 in favor; 1434 against. 
4, The committee recommends that the Federal board should be required to 
appoint advisory committees of five members each, representing industry, com- 
merce, labor, agriculture, homemaking, and general or vocational education. 
Votes: 7834 in favor; 1864 against. 
The bulletin indicates that the national chamber now stands com- 
mitted to all of the recommendations, “in that more than one-third 
of the voting strength of the chamber was recorded and more than 
two-thirds of the vote thus cast, representing more than 20 States, 
was recorded in favor of each of the proposals.” 
An examination of the tabulated returns shows that negative votes 
on one or more of the four propositions were cast in 18 of the 48 
States, and that these 18 States lie scattered pretty well over the 
country. In no one of these States did any one of the four recom- 
mendations fail to carry. 
8. INVESTIGATIONS AND SURVEYS. 
The fund of available information to be used as a basis for voca- 
tional education proposals is rapidly growing through the accumu- 
lation of the reports of special investigations. Of these investiga- 
tions four have been selected for brief reference at this time.t 
THE CLEVELAND EDUCATION SURVEY. 
Nine of the volumes of the Cleveland survey report relate to vari- 
ous phases of vocational education, as follows: 
Boys and Girls in Commercial Work. 
Department Store Occupations. 
Dressmaking and Millinery. 
Railroad and Street Transportation. 
The Building Trades. 
The Garment Trades. 
The Metal Trades. 
The Printing Trades. 
Wage Earning and Education (summary). 
Of these nine volumes, all but the last have appeared. To illustrate 
the method of treatment, the report on the building trades will be re- 
viewed briefly. There are six chapters: Nature of building work; 
number in the trades and sources of supply; conditions of labor; 
training before the boy leaves school; training after leaving school; 
summary. 
After outlining the kinds of work performed in the various trades, 
figures are given to show that there are about 30,000 men engaged   
1 See also Ch. XXI of this report.
-P-A-G-E-193
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 165 
in the building industry in Cleveland at the present time, of whom 
nearly two-thirds are in the skilled trades. Journeymen come chiefly 
from outside the city, many coming from abroad; the only other 
source is through apprenticeship. The general decline of the ap- 
prenticeship system appears to have affected the building trades less 
than any other industry, but the burden of training apprentices has 
been shifted from the employer to the unions. 
The building trades are about 90 per cent organized, and in wages 
and hours of labor the working conditions are generally better than 
in any other industry in Cleveland. The strength of the unions is 
declared to be a greater factor in the establishment and maintenance 
of wage standards than skill or technical knowledge. Irregularity 
of employment is greater in building work than in any other leading 
industry. In general, health conditions are good, as are opportunities 
for advancement for the industrious worker. 
The report recommends that vocational training for boys who will 
enter the building trades be started not later than the seventh year 
in school, in order that something worth while may be accomplished 
before the termination of school life at the end of the compulsory 
school period. It is doubtful whether satisfactory courses can be 
offered in existing elementary schools, since the number of boys is 
usually too small to permit of the necessary differentiation of courses. 
The junior high school is recommended as a partial solution of the 
problem, offering a general industrial course, which should give much 
emphasis to applied mathematics, greater variety in shopwork than 
is now given, and more attention to elementary science, mechanical 
drawing, and economic and industrial conditions in wage-earning 
occupations. Since less than 2 per cent of the graduates of the 
Cleveland technical high schools become artisans, the report recom- 
mends the organization of a special two years’ industrial course to fill 
the gap now existing between the end of the compulsory school period 
and the entering age in the skilled trades. 
With respect to training in the industry itself, the analysis of con- 
ditions shows three important changes in apprenticeship that have 
come about: (1) Progressive specialization and subdivision of the 
industry have made the apprentice a much less important factor than 
he was formerly; (2) growth in the size of contracting firms has 
made the relation between apprentice and employer less direct and 
personal; (3) employers interested in the education of apprentices 
aim chiefly at the training of foremen rather than of journeymen 
workmen. The courses which have been offered hitherto in the eve- 
ning schools of Cleveland do not appear to meet the needs fully, since 
less than 1 per cent of the workers in the trades are enrolled in the 
schools, and those who do attend are rarely held for more than 
61355°—16——_13
-P-A-G-E-194
  166 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
one or two brief terms. Among the conditions requisite to success 
are included more active cooperation on the part of both employers 
and unions, accompanied by some form of compulsion to secure school 
“attendance of apprentices and more freedom and flexibility of 
organization for evening schools. 
The constructive recommendations are summarized under five 
headings: Reduction of retardation throughout the elementary. 
schools; introduction of general industrial courses in the seventh, 
eighth, and ninth years; establishment of a two years’ industrial 
trade school for boys; more specific and practical evening trade ex- 
tension classes for apprentices; a considerable variety of practical 
evening trade extension classes for journeymen workmen, directed by 
thoroughly competent persons who give their whole time to the work 
and who have the necessary freedom of action in organizing classes 
and adopting and changing courses. 
MINNEAPOLIS VOCATIONAL EDUCATION SURVEY. 
On January 1, 1916, the report of the Vocational Education Sur- 
vey of Minneapolis was published, and its principal recommendations 
were discussed three weeks later at the convention of the National 
Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education, which was held 
in that city. The principal features of the Minneapolis survey were 
outlined in the last report, and since it is impossible to review a 700- 
page book in the space available here only a few points can be 
touched on. 
One of the most valuable contributions of the Minneapolis survey 
was the formulation of several types of trade agreements, involving 
cooperative educational activity, referred to elsewhere in this chap- 
tert Another unique feature was the study of “What vocational 
education is needed for home workers?” The special subcommittee 
having this study in charge analyzed three types of home for inves- 
tigation: (1) The home where the household labor is performed by 
paid, employees; (2) the home in which the work is performed by 
members of the family, but in which comfort and often luxury exist; 
(8) the home which is economically on the verge of bare existence. 
Homes of all three classes were studied, in some cases by personal 
visit and in others by questionnaire. The conclusions resulting from 
the study are chiefly negative and are valuable as indicating the difli- 
culties that must be surmounted before this extremely important 
problem is solved. : 
Building on the data accumulated in the Richmond (Va.) In- 
dustrial Education Survey,’ the report presents a mass of informa-

tistics.

tion relating to the principal groups of occupations in Minneapolis 
and vicinity that will afford material for study for years to come. 
The report closes with a chapter of valuable and suggestive out- 
lines of proposed courses of study. The courses of study resulted 
from a series of conferences between representatives of the survey 
staff and the trades involved and carry the formal approval of both 
employers and employees. In the carrying out of the general pro- 
gram recommended by the survey, one of the chief factors supple- 
menting the work of the public-school system is the Dunwoody 
Industrial Institute, established by a private trust fund. 
THE DENVER SCHOOL SURVEY. 
The study of vocational education, published as Part III of the 
report of the Denver School Survey, May, 1916, was made by Dr. 
C. A. Prosser, director, Dunwoody Institute, Minneapolis, and Prof. 
W. H. Henderson, University of Wisconsin, Madison, under the 
auspices of the school survey committee representing the Denver 
Board of Education and the Colorado Taxpayers’ Protective League. 
With reference to manual training in the seventh and eighth 
grades, the report recommends that the prevocational aim be em- 
phasized and that a much greater variety of tools, materials, and 
processes be introduced into the shopwork. It recommends also that 
shop teachers be sought who have had practical experience in the 
industries and who will take an interest in boys and their problems. 
An advisory committee is suggested to assist the school authorities 
to work out in the high schools a type of technical course needed to 
fit the conditions as outlined. 
With reference to the Denver School of Trades, the recommenda- 
tions include more emphasis on evening trade-extension courses for 
apprentices and journeymen, as well as development of part-time and 
dull-season day classes for apprentices. Advisory committees and 
more definite understandings or agreements involving the schools, the 
unions, and employers are also urged. 
It is recommended that commercial courses in the public schools 
be reorganized, that a new two years’ course be developed, and that 
all the work be rearranged on the basis of smaller units, so that a 
student will not need to continue in school for so long a time before 
acquiring definite knowledge and skill of value in the business world. 
The addition of courses in salesmanship and provision for practical 
laboratory experience in commercial establishments are also recom- 
mended. 
More thorough and systematic work in drawing and in home eco- 
nomics is urged throughout all the schools under supervisors who are 
given authority to direct the work throughout the entire city.  
-P-A-G-E-196
  168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
The report advises the creation of the office of assistant superin- 
tendent “with a salary sufficient to attract to the position a man with 
the ability, experience, and diplomacy necessary to initiate and de- 
velop policies and plans for vocational training in the many different 
lines in which Denver is interested.” In this position should be 
centered. the responsibility for all the vocational work of the city, 
together with prevocational education, manual training, home eco- . 
nomics, and their correlations with other studies. A growing budget, 
based upon a constructive policy of development, is deemed necessary 
if the local school authorities hope to accomplish satisfactory results. 
STATE VOCATIONAL SURVEY OF INDIANA. 
For the first time a vocational education survey on a State-wide 
basis has been projected, the field work beginning in May, 1916. The 
Indiana State Board of Education has taken the initiative in bring- 
ing about the organization of a survey committee to carry on the 
work under its direction. The committee includes representatives 
of the State board of education, city school superintendents, the 
State university, and the National Society for the Promotion 
of Industrial Education. C. H. Winslow, formerly of the United 
States Bureau of Labor Statistics, has been appointed director of 
vocational research, and will have charge of the survey. : 
The subjects of study will include the following: A large indus-. 
trial city, such as Indianapolis; small industrial communities, such 
as Richmond and Evansville; rural counties, with the county as a 
unit; courses in manual training in the public schools; the 32 schools 
in the State now giving vocational training. 
The results of these investigations will be presented for discussion 
at the annual convention of the National Society for the Promotion 
of Industrial Education, to be held at Indianapolis, in January, 1917. 
9. VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE, 
The most notable evidences of progress in the field of vocational 
guidance are found in the increased interest in the subject in public 
schools and in colleges and universities. During the pioneer stages 
much of the constructive work in vocational guidance was done by 
semipublic or private agencies, but now that the way has been blazed 
to a certain extent, more and more educational institutions are recog- 
nizing their responsibilities and their opportunities. 
During the year the Chicago (Ill.) Board of Education has 
assumed responsibility for the vocation bureau which was organized 
under the direction of Miss Anne Davis. During the period while 
it was demonstrating the need for its existence, the bureau was main- 
tained by the Chicago Federation of Women’s Clubs. The change
-P-A-G-E-197

  in the auspices under which the bureau is to do its work involved 
an increase in the force from three to eight, and consequently means 
greater opportunity for service. 
It is reported that employers testify to the value of the service 
rendered in sifting and classifying the boys and girls who seek 
positions. Notwithstanding the insistence on an initial mini- 
mum wage somewhat higher than that usually paid to beginners, 
employers are glad to patronize the bureau and to indorse its 
methods. : 
Evidence of the growing interest in the problem of vocational 
guidance in higher institutions, of which other instances might be 
cited, is found in the report of a vocational conference held at the 
University of Nebraska, March 21 and 22, 1916, under the auspices 
of the women’s clubs. The principal speaker was Miss Helen 
Bennett, director of the Intercollegiate Bureau of Occupations, 
Chicago, and the special subject of discussion was the future occu- 
pations of girls who do not look forward to teaching school. 
Plans have been perfected for a new type of cooperation in dealing 
with the problem of juvenile employment in Pennsylvania. A new 
State employment bureau was established at Harrisburg, October 1, 
1915, with branch agencies to be opened later in Philadelphia and 
Pittsburgh. In Philadelphia, for example, a conference was held, 
attended by representatives of the State department of labor, the 
State department of public instruction, and the Philadelphia public 
schools, at which a plan was outlined for carrying on the work. 
According to this plan, when a boy or girl between the ages of 
14 and 18 years applies for work, the application is referred to the 
vocational education division of the public schools. Careful 
inquiries are made, and the essential facts concerning the candidate 
are recorded. The available information concerning opportunities 
for employment is gone over, and the bureau is then in position to 
advise with the candidate as to the most promising directions in 
which to look for employment, and to suggest ways and means of 
preparing for more efficient service and promotion. 
An experimental course one year in length for directors of voca- 
tional guidance is announced for 1916-17 by the Women’s Educa- 
tional and Industrial Union, Boston, Mass. 
The course aims to fit women of adequate preliminary training to become 
vocational advisers in grammar and high schools or in social agencies by 
providing them with a knowledge of industrial conditions and methods of 
industrial investigation and the use of statistics, and by supplying such other 
training as is essential, including some practical application of the principles 
and methods studied.

high schools, gathered at the State college at Bozeman, Mont., 
November 18-20, 1915, to attend the third annual vocational con- 
ference, called by the college in cooperation with the State Federa- 
tion of Women’s Clubs. Many men and women who have achieved 
success in their several vocations addressed the conference, discus- 
sing the various lines of work other than teaching that are now 
open to women. Some of the occupations considered are: Agri- 
culture, newspaper work, science work in State and municipal labora- 
tories, nursing, home-economics extension, training for Christian 
social service, office work, costume designing, police duty, home 
making, and making money in the home. 
Chicago, Ill—The public library, a committee of the associa- 
tion of commerce, and the board of education in cooperation have 
published a list of books for boys and girls, entitled “ What occupa- 
tion shall I choose?” The books are listed in four groups: “ Men 
and Women Who Have Made Good,” “ How to Succeed,” “ Voca- 
tions for Boys,” and “ Vocations for Girls.” 
Boston, Mass——Some extremely interesting and significant fig- 
ures have been collected by the public school authorities in Boston, 
Mass. Formerly it was found that children who left the grammar 
grades to go to work changed their places of employment an aver- 
age of three to four times during the year. During the first year 
after the continuation schools opened only about 15 per cent of the 
2,300 children in attendance changed places. 
10. PREVOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
Much importance attaches to the discussion of prevocational edu- 
cation during the year, and to the tangible results in courses and 
classes established. Critics continue to assail vigorously the term _ 
“ prevocational,” on the ground that it can not be applied logically to 
a single line of educational effort, as has been done. Nevertheless 
the designation appears to have achieved a certain currency. 
A part of the criticism has been due also to the confusion that pre- 
vails as to the real meaning of the term prevocational. By voca- 
tional education is understood instruction designed to make one more 
efficient in some specific chosen vocation. A very important service 
which may be rendered the individual before a choice has been made, 
and hence before specific vocational education can begin, is to assist 
him in the acquisition of sufficient knowledge about a number of typi- 
cal and important groups of occupations, upon the basis of which an 
intelligent choice may be made. The plan of having boys and girls 
actually engage in the fundamental activities characteristic of a 
variety of possible occupations, with the accompaniment of an exami- 
nation of the meaning and relationships of these activities, with
-P-A-G-E-199
    VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 171 
related studies in language, mathematics, science, and civics, appears 
to have met with much favor in localities where it has been tried. 
To this work, since it precedes the giving of specific vocational edu- 
cation, has been given the descriptive name “ prevocational educa- 
As an example of the variety of practical activities that may be 
incorporated in a school course when suitable facilities are available, 
the announcement of courses open to boys in the Menomonie (Wis.) 
public schools is interesting. By a cooperative arrangement with 
Stout Institute, 16 lines of work are offered, each of which is given 
for two periods daily, five days per week, for nine weeks. All boys 
in the seventh and eighth grades and first two years of high school 
thus change subjects in a regular scheme of rotation every nine weeks. 
The courses offered are: 
Seventh grade: Architectural drafting, bricklaying, carpentry, plumbing. 
Bighth grade: Mechanical drafting, cabinetmaking, forge shop, printing. 
First year high school: Freehand drawing, joinery, wood turning, printing, 
~ Second year high school: Mechanical drafting, patternmaking, foundry, ma- 
chine shop. 
During the third and fourth years of the high school the students 
are permitted to specialize in any one of the following eight elective 
subjects, the choice being made presumably on the basis of the ex- 
periences of the four years preceding: Machine drafting, foundry, 
machine shop, forge shop, carpentry, plumbing, bricklaying, print- 
ing. The subject chosen may be taken for two periods daily, five 
days per week, for the two years. 
11. CHANGING ATTITUDE TOWARD MANUAL ARTS COURSES. 
A number of events during the past year or two seem to indicate 
a tendency to recognize more fully the claims and the achievements 
of manual arts courses in the public schools. The change in attitude 
‘has to do not only with the manual arts as a part of general educa- 
tion, but also as a factor in the program for vocational education. 
Some years ago statements in criticism of a certain formal type of 
manual training, and characterizing the work as consisting of the 
“fads and frills” of education, emanated from a commission created 
to study the problems of industrial education in an eastern State. 
Because of the standing of the commission, and the vigor with which 
the point of view was presented, these statements gained considerable 
currency, and by others were thoughtlessly applied to manual train- 
ing in general, in some localities without even the formality of ade- 
quate investigation of the work deemed worthy of condemnation. 
_ Thus it came about that many believed that there was considerable 
weight of authority for the assertion that manual arts courses as 
such are of no value in the field of vocational education.  
-P-A-G-E-200
    172 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
It was inevitable that there should be a readjustment in both 
popular and expert educational opinion, since there are many places 
in which work of demonstrated value in the manual arts has been 
carried on for years. The earlier experiments showed, furthermore, 
that some understanding of the place and possibilities of the manual 
arts in the schools is essential to any adequate grasp of the problems 
of vocational education, and quite logically many of the leaders in 
the latter movement have been drafted from among those who had - 
done notable work in the former field. 
One of the events showing clearly the newer point of view was 
referred to in the last report,1 where, in the account of the Cin- 
cinnati conference of superintendents of public schools on the prob- 
lem of vocational education in the small city, it was reported that: 
The trend of the discussion seemed to indicate the belief that practical and 
efficient work in the manual arts and homemaking courses constitutes the 
first step toward vocational education. After these departments have been 
well established, they can be used as a basis upon which to develop subsequent 
and ‘more specialized courses as the needs become clearly defined. 
Another important evidence of change is to be noted in the method 
of investigation adopted, and the subsequent pronouncement made, 
in connection with the subject of manual training in the Minneapolis 
Vocational Education Survey. 
The findings of the Minneapolis survey, and the discussions at the conven- 
tion, left no room for doubt that the society now recognizes the important con- 
tribution which the manual arts courses in the high school may make directly 
to genuine industrial education.’ 
Not only did the survey employ for this part of the work an in- 
vestigator who had been for a number of years a recognized leader 
in the manual training field, but the findings were submitted before 
publication to a special committee of seven experts in this field. In 
approving the findings and recommendations of the survey, in gen- 
eral, the committee reported certain recommendations of its own, 
including: (1) Reorganization of the elementary schools so as to 
offer a wider variety of manual activities for all children; (2) pre- 
vocational courses in the upper grades of the elementary schools in 
order to (a) interest and hold motor-minded children, (6) furnish 
new avenues of expression in learning and doing, (c) aid in proper 
training in book subjects, and (d) help young people to select the 
kind of training and the kind of occupation they desire to follow; 
(3) further development of the intermediate school or junior high 
school; (4) a considerable variety of elective short vocational courses 
in the high school, under a liberal arrangement of entrance require- 
ments; (5) cooperation of representatives of workers and employers

with the school authorities in developing plans for vocational edu- 
cation. 
Other evidence might be cited, but enough is here presented to 
suggest the growing disposition to recognize the importance of the 
manual arts (drawing, manual training, cooking, sewing, and house- 
work) when properly organized and conducted, in at least these di- 
rections: (1) Asa necessary part of the general education that should 
be provided for all children; (2) as a means of assisting young per- 
sons to determine vocational aptitudes; (3) as a foundation upon 
which to base specific vocational courses after intelligent choices have 
been made. 
Not only is there a change taking place in the attitude of educa- 
tional leaders toward the claims of the manual arts, but in many 
places there is evident a changing attitude on the part of manual 
arts teachers and supervisors toward their own work. There are 
indications of a disposition to take themselves and their work more 
seriously, and to vitalize the course of study by the introduction of 
projects and undertakings as distinguished from courses of models 
or exercises. A few examples selected at random to illustrate this 
tendency are appended at the close of the chapter. 
12. ITEMS OF SPECIAL INTEREST. 
Dignity of work.—One of the important values of vocational edu- 
cation is to be sought in a change in the spirit of the workers them- 
selves, and too often this is overlooked or ignored entirely. This 
point has been commented on by Mrs. Lucinda W. Prince, of Boston, 
Mass., who organized several courses in salesmanship in that city. 
The instruction in salesmanship as given in the high schools, together 
with the practice in the stores, has resulted in visibly raising the 
self-respect and status of the sales girl. Before such classes were 
organized, it was usual for office girls to regard themselves as on a 
somewhat higher vocational and social plane than the sales girls in 
the same store, and in this classification the sales girls themselves 
were inclined to acquiesce. 
Now, however, the attitude has completely changed, and it is 
asserted that the high-school classes in salesmanship are responsible 
for the change. The work of the sales girl has been studied, analyzed, 
and reduced to the application of recognized principles; efficiency 
becomes to a certain extent a question of mastery of these principles 
and skill in their use; the sales girl’s job is thus elevated to the status 
of a skilled trade. 
The change in the individual is a new conception of the dignity 
of work in general and of the chosen occupation in particular. There 
is a satisfaction that comes with mastery of certain of the forces of 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
      174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
one’s environment, and a pride inseparable from acquired skill and 
the achievements it makes possible. All of this does not mean less 
respect for any other who is worthy of respect, but more respect for 
oneself—one of the foundation stones of character building. 
Scranton, Pa.—By the will of the late O. S. Johnson funds have 
been provided for the establishment of a “manual training school 
where boys and girls can be taught such useful arts and trades as 
may enable them to make an honorable living and become useful 
members of society.” According to the terms of the will the school 
will be under the direction of a self-perpetuating advisory board of 
’ five members, which is to have “the largest discretionary powers in 
regard to the whole subject, confined only by my direction, that the 
object of this charity shall be the founding and maintaining of a 
manual training school.” The estate amounts to $1,300,000, and 
- about one-third of the income is now available for the school. 
Robert B. Keller, of the faculty of the college of engineering, 
University of Illinois, has been appointed director of the school, 
and has been spending the greater part of the year in visiting trade 
and technical schools, in studying the educational needs of the work- 
ers in Scranton and vicinity, and in preparing preliminary plans for 
the operation of the school in its initial stages. 
In a general way the field to be occupied by the school is indi- 
cated by the fact that of the 52,000 wage earners reported in Scran- 
ton, 17,000 are in manufacturing and mechanical industries and 
12,000 in anthracite coal mining. 
Portland, Oreg—Considerable progress has been made during the 
year in carrying out the provisions of the will of Mr. S. Benson, a 
wealthy timber merchant, who left a gift of $100,000 for the estab- 
lishment of a trade school in Portland, Oreg., on condition that the 
school district contribute an equal amount. In addition to raising 
the sum specified, the city purchased a site for the school, at a cost 
of $160,000. It is expected that other gifts will materially increase 
the total amount available. 
The new school is named the Benson Technical High School, and 
will take the place and do the work of the Portland School of 
Trades, which has outgrown the quarters in which it has been 
housed during the past two years. The courses for boys include: 
Carpentry, cabinet-making, foundry, plumbing, electrical construc- 
tion and inspection; for girls: Cooking, sewing, millinery, and 
other subjects. 
Brooklyn, N. Y.—A new trade school has been opened, the first 
in the borough of Brooklyn as a part of the public school system. 
Temporary quarters have been secured on the seventh floor of an 
office building. The capacity of the school is 224 boys.
-P-A-G-E-203
    
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, 175 
Fort Wayne, Ind.—The following courses were offered in the voca- 
tional school during the year: Wood turning and pattern making, 
cabinetmaking and wood finishing, carpentry and joinery; mill- 
wrighting, electrical work, printing, metal work; commercial illus- 
trating, mechanical drawing; millinery, home making, dressmaking, 
cookery, catering; salesmanship, art and design, machine operating. 
New York, N. Y—The minimum requirements for admission to 
the examinations for positions as teacher in a vocational school in 
New York City are at least five years’ experience as a journeyman 
(or in a higher position) in the vocation in which the applicant 
seeks a license as teacher, in addition to at least one year of suc- 
cessful experience in teaching the same vocation. 
New York, N, Y—A national conference on industrial education 
was held in New York City from September 23 to October 2, 1915, 
under the auspices of a local committee representing the bee ee 
education, the Federation of Women’s Clubs, and several other or- 
ganizations. The chairman of the committee was John Martin, mem- 
ber of the New York City Board of Education. 
Imperial, Cal.—Boys in the high-school shopwork courses razed 
the old shop building, removing the forges and other equipment. 
The new building was built by a contractor, but the shop students 
laid the conduit system for the air blast, installed the forges and 
power machinery, including concrete bases, and an 80-foot line shaft 
with pulleys and belts. They also painted the storage cabinets, in- 
stalled the electric wiring, laid the outside drains, constructed a con- 
crete sidewalk and a concrete driveway. The work was done for 
the most part after school hours and on Saturdays. 
St. Paul, Minn—The school department conducted an experi- 
mental industrial summer high school for boys in 1915, offering 
courses in forge shop, machine shop, cabinetmaking, wood turning. 
Eliminating all bookwork, the aim was to give to a limited group 
of 35 boys an insight into commercial methods of production and to 
turn out a product of use to the schools. For example, a part of 
the plan was the construction of 200 workbenches to replace broken 
and worn-out benches in the manual training shops throughout the 
city. The number of boys desiring to enroll was much larger than 
the capacity of the school. 
Holyoke, Mass.—The local carpenters’ union approved the sug- 
gestion that the vocational school students construct a modern resi- 
dence on condition that all work be done under the direction of 
competent instructors.

    CHAPTER X. 
MEDICAL EDUCATION 
By N. P. Cotwett, M. D. 
Secretary of the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. 
THE REPORT FOR i915. 
The report last year reviewed the progress in medical education 
during the previous 10 years. An oversupply of medical schools 
(162) had given way to a more normal supply. Of the 96 medical 
colleges. which remained, 90° (92.7 per cent) were requiring for 
admission one or two years of collegiate work, in addition to the 
usual high-school education. In 1904 only 4 schools (less than 
3 per cent) were requiring these higher standards for admission 
(see chart 1). The report reviewed the progress in medical research 
since 1876, and showed how this research had greatly enlarged the 
knowledge of diseases. For many of the common diseases a definite 
germ origin had been established, and’ for some diseases a study of 
the specific germs had revealed methods for their prevention and 
cure. From the knowledge thus gained some diseases had been 
practically eradicated, and for others, notably diphtheria, the. mor- 
  
1In the report of 1913 it was shown how during the 30 years prior to 1904 the 
rapid development of the middle and western portions of the country, with the spring- 
ing up of new cities and towns, created an actual demand for physicians. As a conse- 
quence the number of medical colleges multiplied rapidly; many were organized as 
stock corporations and were conducted chiefly for profit, and, indeed, the teaching of 
medicine became a profitable business. The supply soon more than exceeded the de- 
mand, and in 1904 the country had over half the world’s supply of medical schools, 
which were turning out each year large classes of graduates. In 1907 this country 
had one physician to every 636 people, as compared with one physician to every 1,500 
to 2,500 people in the countries of Europe. During this 30-year period medical educa- 
tion was without any effective supervision. Entrance standards were largely disre- 
garded, the medical course generally was crude, and a student who could pay the 
fee—no matter how ignorant—was seldom rejected. Of course, in spite of this severe 
competition, some colleges were struggling to uphold fair standards and were furnishing 
a fair medical training as measured by the medical knowledge of the time. The report 
enumerated the several agencies which had been working to bring about improyements 
and showed the positive and rapid results which were obtained after a supervision of 
medical education was established by the American Medical Association, through a per- 
manent committee, the Council on Medical Education. This was a voluntary super- 
vision, established with the cooperation of a large majority of the medical schools, 
Without claiming any legal authority and having no power aside from that of pub- 
licity, the American Medical Association established a supervision which has lead to rapid 
improvements since 1904. Two standards of preliminary education were urged at 
that time, one fixing a four-year high-school education for adoption by all colleges by 
Jan. 1, 1908; the other requiring one year of college work in addition to the high-school 
education for general adoption by Jan. 1, 1910. The latter was not actually adopted 
1i7

  178 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
tality had been greatly reduced. The discovery that some diseases, 
such as malaria and yellow fever, were transmitted by mosquitoes 
or other insects had resulted in checking those diseases and in trans- 
forming Habana, Panama, and other semitropical localities from 
pest-ridden communities into safe places for human habitation. 
The minimum educational standard which, in accordance with the 
present knowledge of diseases, should be required of anyone who 
is to treat human ailment, by whatever system or method, was out- 
lined, and it was shown that unless the practitioner was trained 
in all the fundamentals of medicine he could not safely be intrusted 
with the delicate life processes of human beings, especially when 
rendered doubly sensitive in times of sickness. 
The number of State boards which were requiring one or two 
years of college work had been increased to 28, of which number, 10 
were requiring, in addition to a four-year high-school education, 
two years of college work. Thirty-nine medical colleges in the fall 
of 1914 put into effect for the first time the higher entrance stand- 
ards, making altogether 82 which were then requiring for admission 
one or two years of college work, in addition to a four-year high- 
school education. This accounted for the unusually large reduction 
in the total number of matriculants in medical schools in the session 
of 1915-16, namely, 14,891, as compared with 16,502 in 1914-15. 
The 1915 report set forth a plan for the reorganization of clinical 
teaching; commented on the increased endowments for medical 
education; set forth estimates of the cost for teaching, respectively, 
the laboratory and clinical portions of the medical course; gave 
further rules regarding graduate medical instruction, and included 
a revision of the standards of entrance requirements for medical 
schools.   
until Jan. 1, 1914. The report also gave a list of medical colleges which had adopted 
the higher standards for admission, and problems of medical education were discussed. 
The 1914 report showed that 6 more medical colleges had been closed, by merger 
or otherwise, leaving 102 remaining. Of these colleges, 78 had put into effect the re- 
quirement of one or more years of college work, in addition to a four-year high-school 
education, and 6 others had adopted the standard to become effective later. Of the 
78 colleges, 34 were requiring two years of college work for admission. A list of these 
colleges and the dates when the higher standard became effective was given. Twenty- 
five State licensing boards had likewise adopted one or two years of college work as 
the minimum requirement of preliminary education for those who should obtain the 
license to practice in those States. Seven of these States had adopted the two-year 
standard. Many of the medical colleges had received larger endowments; had estab- 
lished better laboratories; had employed a larger number of expert, all-time teachers, 
and had established better relationships with hospitals, whereby a greater abundance 
of clinical material became available. A better enforcement of entrance requirements 
was emphasized as one of the most important needs of both medical and liberal arts 
colleges. Emphasis was also laid on the care which should be taken by prospective 
students in the choice of a medical school. This was essential, since diplomas granted 
by 21 medical colleges were not recognized by from 24 to 32 State licensing boards. 
It was shown that to enter such a school would be unwise, since in the same time 
and for even less money it was possible for the student to secure a medical training 
in one of the highest-grade medical schools, the diplomas of which were recognized 
by all State boards. Problems of licensing boards were discussed; lists of colleges 
giving courses in public health and those requiring the hospital intern year as a pre- 
requisite to graduation were given; and rules regulating graduate medical instruction 
were set forth.

effective in the next year or two. (See chart 1.) The number of 
State licensing boards requiring two years of premedical college 
work was increased from 10 to 17. (See chart 2.) 
On February 7, 1916, at the twelfth annual conference of the 
Council on Medical Education the following was urged as the 
American standard of preliminary and medical education: 
(a) A four-year high-school course; (b) two years of work in 
an approved college of arts and sciences, including courses in physics, 
chemistry, biology, and a modern language; (c) a four-year medical 
course; and (@) a year’s internship in a hospital.

Association, recommended that the two-year standard be indorsed 
by that body. The reference committee’s report, which was adopted, 
included the following recommendation: 
That after January 1, 1918, no medical college be retained in Class A by 
the Council on Medical Education that does not require for admission at least
-P-A-G-E-209
    MEDICAL EDUCATION IN 1916, 181 
two years of work in a college of arts and sciences approved by the council, 
or in lieu thereof, an education equivalent to the above, as demonstrated by a 
fitting and properly conducted examination, approved by the council. Your 
committee believes that this standard should be adopted at this time so as to 
bring medical education into better coordination with general education in this 
country. Nevertheless, it should be understood that this represents the highest 
requirement of preliminary education that should be legally established in 
this country. Furthermore, it is recommended that the council cooperate 
with the National Education Association, with the North Central and the 
Southern Associations of Colleges and Secondary Schools, and with other 
educational agencies, in the efforts now being made to save one or two years of 
the student’s time during the period of elementary and high-school education. 
This saving will enable students to graduate from the medical school at an 
average age of 24 or 25 years. 
Thus the American Medical Association not only favored the 
adoption of two years of college work as the minimum standard of 
preliminary education in the United States, but also urged that it 
represent the maximum standard that should be legally required in 
the United States. This standard is looked on, therefore, as perma- 
nent, and medical colleges should feel assured that in the future no 
unreasonably high standard is to be forced upon them. This stand- 
ard was adopted also in the hope that a reorganization of elementary 
and secondary education—regarding which, in recent years, there 
has been much discussion—may lead to a saving of one or two years 
of time in premedical education. The student could then complete 
his medical training at the age of 24 or 25 years. Such a reorgani- 
zation would also bring secondary education on a par with that in 
Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and other countries of Europe. 
Those who have been working for the improvement of medical 
education during the last 12 to 15 years view with much satisfaction 
the results obtained in so short a time. Including the establishing of 
a permanent American standard of preliminary education, the 
progress in medical education has exceeded the highest expectations 
of those who were acquainted with the serious conditions existing at 
the time the campaign for improvement began. Many institutions 
which were conducted for profit have been closed, and the number 
of high-grade, well-equipped, and well-endowed medical colleges has 
been increased. Medical education in this country has now reached 
2 stage which is fairly satisfactory and can be referred to without an 
apology. There are already a score or more of medical schools which 
are equal, if not superior, to those in any other country. A continu- 
ance of the campaign for improvement will result in adding others 
to this group, and the number of colleges conducted without regard 
for reasonable educational standards will become fewer each year. 
For the future there is a hopeful outlook.

Complete returns show the total registration of students in all 
medical schools during 1915-16 was 14,022, or 869 less than during 
the previous session. It is evident that the enrollment of medical 
students has about reached its lowest ebb, since in the freshman 
classes there was an increase of 209 over the registration of the pre- 
vious session—3,582, as compared with 3,373 in 1915. After a few 
-years have been allowed for readjustments under the higher entrance 
standards, the number of medical students will doubtless return to 
normal proportions. 
There were 3,518 graduates in 1916, only 18 less than in the pre- 
vious year. The higher qualifications of these graduates are indi- 
cated by the fact that this year 948, or 26.9 per cent, also obtained 
degrees in arts or science prior to, or in connection with, their medi- 
cal course, as compared with 24.3 per cent in 1915 and only 15 per 
cent in 1910. 
During the year the Medico-Chirurgical College of Philadelphia 
was merged with the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine 
as its graduate school of medicine. Two other medical schools—the 
Georgia College of Eclectic Medicine and Surgery, of Atlanta, and 
the Southwest School of Medicine and Hospital, of Kansas City— 
became extinct. A new but small medical school was opened at Kan- 
sas City, Mo., which is not reported to have the recognition of the 
Missouri State Board of Health, the licensing body of that State. 
The total number of medical schools in the United States is now 94, 
or 2 less than last year. One medical college—the Hahnemann Medi-

184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
cal College of the Pacific—which was reported last year as having 
been closed by merger, will continue to exist until 1918, when its last 
class will have graduated. Of the 94 medical colleges now existing, 
67 are rated in Class A by the Council on Medical Education, 15 are 
in Class B, and 12 are in Class C.t 
FINANCES OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
The total income reported by 82 medical colleges for the session 
of 1914-15 ranged from $411,570, the highest, to $6,080, the lowest, 
for colleges teaching all four years of the medical course. The aver- 
age for each college was $68,277. The income for each college from 
students’ fees ranged from $113,523, the highest, to $500, the lowest, 
‘the average being $23,795. 
Aside from students’ fees, the total incomes ranged from $329,221, 
the highest, to the three colleges which had no income aside from fees. — 
The average income aside from students’ fees was $44,482. Included 
in these figures 34 colleges reported the receipt of a total income 
from endowments of $1,164,602, or an average of $34,253 for each of 
the institutions which reported income from this source; 28 colleges 
reported an income from States or municipalities amounting to 
$864,285, or an average of $30,868 for each institution. 
Seventy-eight colleges paid out $2,985,458 in salaries, an average 
of $38,275 for each of the schools reporting. The highest sum thus 
expended was $139,430 and the lowest was $3,600. The total ex- 
penditure reported by the 82 colleges was $5,432,768, or an average 
of $66,253 for each institution. For 3 colleges all expenditures were 
paid from students’ fees, and for one of these the expenditures were 
less than the income. 
The total enrollment in these 82 medical colleges during the ses- 
sion of 1914-15 was 12,976. The average income received from each 
student in tuition fees was $150, and the average expenditure for 
each student was $419. The cost of teaching each student during 
1914-15, therefore, was nearly three times greater than the amount 
he paid in fees.? 
ANXIETY BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
Since the rapid improvement of medical education began—about 
12 years ago—alarm has been expressed in some quarters because

States diplomas granted by the various colleges are not recognized as an acceptable quali- 
fication for the license to practice medicine, may be obtained by addressing the American 
Medical Association, 535 North Dearborn Street, Chicago.

of some of the results obtained. Certain individuals expressed anx- 
iety lest the marked reduction in the number of medical colleges 
might lead to a dearth of physicians in the United States. Others 
noted the increased cost of medical education and the moderately 
increased charges for tuition and were afraid lest only the “sons of 
the rich ” would be able to secure a medical education. Others were 
concerned lest the higher standards for admission and the demise of 
-numerous low-standard colleges would take away the opportunities 
for “the poor boy.” Still others laid stress on the thinly populated 
and rural districts, which they stated were in need of physicians. 
A few of these statements came from those having no interest in the 
perpetuation of low-standard medical schools and who were un- 
doubtedly sincere in their expressions of anxiety. As already noted 
in this report, there are fewer medical colleges, students, and gradu- 
ates each year than before the campaign for improvement began; the 
cost of a medical education has indeed been greatly increased; there 
has been also a moderate increase in the charges for tuition; entrance 
requirements have been raised; and a number of inferior medical 
colleges have ceased to exist. It is also probably a fact that rural 
communities do not have many doctors living in them. <A right in- 
terpretation of these facts, however, shows there is no cause for 
alarm. The chief result of the campaign for an improved medical 
education is that physicians are securing a better medical training, 
which makes them more able to serve the public in both urban and 
rural communities. 
NO DEARTH OF PHYSICIANS, 
A reduction in the number of medical colleges was expected, since 
in 1904 this country had more than were needed, and at that time 
the use of paid solicitors, the shrewd method of advertising com- 
monly employed, and the absence or nonenforcement of entrance 
requirements naturally resulted in an unusually large enrollment of 
students. The annual output of physicians was correspondingly 
large. What was needed was a larger proportion of high-grade 
and well-equipped medical schools, and this was the result obtained. 
This was brought about chiefly through the merging of two or more 
medical schools in numerous instances into single stronger and 
better equipped institutions. Instead of 28,142 medical students 
and 5,747 graduates each year, only about 6 per cent of whom were 
from high-standard colleges, there are now only about half those 
numbers, but from 75 to 80 per cent of them are in high-standard 
colleges. The facts are shown in the accompanying table:  
-P-A-G-E-214
186 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
Quality versus quantity. 
Although the totals of colleges, students and graduates have been decreased in 11 years, 
the numbers of high-standard colleges, better-educated students, and better-trained 
graduates have been increased.

Of the medical colleges which remain the majority have higher 
and better-enforced entrance requirements; they have stronger staffs 
of salaried, expert teachers; they have more and better-equipped 
laboratories, and have more abundant and better-used hospital and 
dispensary facilities. Physicians coming from these medical schools 
are better fitted to care for the sick and to do a larger part in the 
preservation of public health than the average of those graduated 
under former conditions. Even if the output of physicians were 
entirely discontinued, there would be no danger of a dearth of 
physicians for years to come. The country still has an overabun- 
dant supply of physicians. There is 1 to every 691 people in the 
United States, as compared with 1 to every 1,940 in Germany, 1 to 
every 2,120 in Austria, and 1 to every 2,834 in France; that is, refer- 
ring to conditions before the war. The need, therefore, is not of 
larger numbers of medical graduates, but of those who are better 
qualified to care for the sick and injured, and this result is being 
obtained. 
NO DANGER OF A MEDICAL ARISTOCRACY. 
As already shown in this report, the cost of teaching medicine 
has been greatly increased during the past 15 years. The larger 
number of laboratories, equipped with expensive technical apparatus 
which the modern school must now possess, the score or more of 
skilled salaried teachers who devote their entire time to teaching 
and research, and the increased expenses for administration have 
added tremendously to the cost of conducting a medical school. This 
cost has advanced from the point at which there were large profits 
for those owning the medical school to the present situation, where 
it exceeds the income from students’ fees by 280 per cent; never- 
theless, during the same period tuition fees have been increased by
-P-A-G-E-215
  MEDICAL EDUCATION IN 1916. 187 
only about 25 per cent. In 8 of the State university medical schools 
the fees are very low, less than $100. The excess of expenditure over 
income from tuition fees has been met by State appropriations or by 
private gifts and endowments. During the last few years the number 
of free scholarships for deserving but needy students has been rapidly 
increased, about 300 having been reported last year in 42 medical 
schools. It is quite evident, therefore, that equal opportunities for 
studying medicine are going to be open for all students, regardless 
of their financial status. 
“ HIGHER ENTRANCE STANDARDS AND THE “ POOR BOY.” 
At the beginning of the campaign for the improvement of medical 
education the argument commonly used by those interested in main- 
taining low-standard medical colleges was that the “poor boy” 
would no longer be able to get a medical education. It is the pur- 
pose of higher entfance requirements to keep out of the medical 
schools students who are too ignorant to master the complexities of 
the présent-day medical curriculum. The opportunities for those 
who possess the needed preliminary qualifications, but who are poor 
in purse, have really been increased. Many such students are work- 
ing all or part of their way through the better medical schools. The 
deserving but poor bey is the one perhaps who is most capable of 
looking out for his own interests and usually knows, what some others 
evidently do not, that it costs no more in time and sometimes less in 
- money to attend a high-grade medical school than it does to attend 
some of the poorest equipped institutions. It is usually the high- 
grade, well-endowed medical school also which offers more oppor- 
tunities for students’ self-help; they have more need of such service 
and more funds with which to pay for it. Again, it is in the 
well-endowed institutions that free scholarships are rapidly being 
established. The opportunity for obtaining a thorough medical 
training is now within the reach of any person who is educationally 
qualified to undertake it. 
BETTER MEDICAL CARE FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES, 
The most common argument recently advanced against higher re- 
quirements for admission to medical schools has been that rural com- 
munities are not supplied with a sufficient number of physicians. 
That there is, and possibly always has been, a scarcity of physicians 
in these districts may be granted. Itisclear, however, that this lack is 
not due to the increased entrance requirements of medical schools. 
As pointed out by Flexner,' the existence during a half century of an 
  
1Med. Educ. in the United States and Canada, Bull. 4, 1910, Carnegie Foundation for 
the Advancement of Teaching, p. 15.  
-P-A-G-E-216
  188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
overwhelming proportion of low-standard colleges did not force 
practitioners into these districts. The reasons are economic. No 
physician will stay in a community in which he can not make a 
living. Conditions in these rural communities, however, are gradu- 
ally undergoing improvement. Through the advent of the telephone, 
the automobile, and improved roads, now commonly found even in 
rural districts, physicians in near-by cities have tripled or quad- 
rupled the radius of their practice, and this has brought a more 
abundant and skilled medical care within the reach of rural com- 
munities. The average rural district perhaps has never had as ade- 
quate medical care as at the present time. Even where the contrary 
may be true, the providing of such service will not be brought about 
by the continuance of low-standard medical schools. If mining 
towns and sparsely settled districts, in which physicians can not or- 
dinarily make a livelihood, are to obtain adequate medical service 
it will be necessary for salaried officers to be sent there, either by Na- 
tional or by State Governments. And the people in such communi- 
ties will undoubtedly have better medical service if these officers have 
been trained in high-grade medical schools. 
COEDUCATION IN MEDICINE. 
During the past few years several of the larger medical schools 
have thrown open their doors to women, so that of the 95 medical 
schools, 67 are now coeducational. Over 40 years ago the University 
of Michigan admitted women students to its courses in medicine, 
and since that time 22 of the 29 State universities which have medical 
schools have done likewise. Johns Hopkins University medical de- 
partment and Cornell University medical college have admitted 
women students since their organization, in 1893 and 1898, respec- 
tively. Rush Medical College, which in 1899 entered into a close 
affiliation with the University of Chicago, opened its doors to women 
in 1902. Following that time no similar action was taken by any 
prominent medical school until in 1914 the University of Pennsyl- 
vania voted in favor of coeducation. Like action was taken by 
Tulane University of New Orleans in 1915 and by Columbia and 
Yale during the present year. There remain 28 medical schools, 
including the medical departments of 7 State universities, which are 
not coeducational. Even with these increased opportunities, how- 
ever, the percentage of women medical students is not increasing and 
the proportion of women students in coeducational colleges remains 
about the same. Since 1904 the proportion of all medical students 
who were women has fluctuated between 3.2 per cent and 4.3 per 
cent, and the percentage in coeducational colleges has ranged from 
774 per cent to 83.8 per cent. During the last year just 4 per cent
-P-A-G-E-217
  MEDICAL EDUCATION“IN 1916, 189 
of all medical students were women, and of these 82 per cent were 
in 51 coeducational schools. Incidentally, 16 medical colleges which 
have at various times admitted women had none enrolled during 
the last session. 
FUNDS FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH. 
Several large sums have been given during the year for medical 
research. The University of Pennsylvania school of medicine re- 
ceived $150,000 by the will of Dr. J. William White to establish and 
permanently endow a professorship in surgical research. Columbia 
University College of Physicians and Surgeons received $100,000 
from the executors of the estate of the late William C. Bondy as an 
endowment fund for medical research, chiefly in regard to cancer. 
Harvard University received $100,000 for medical research, $75,000 
of which was by the will of Morrill Wyman and $25,000 by the will 
of William Endicott. Johns Hopkins Hospital received a gift of 
$150,000 by the will of Miss Jessie Gillender, part of which is to be 
used for research into the cause, prevention, and cure of epilepsy. 
Recommendation has been made that a fund of more than 
$3,000,000 for the treatment of cancerous, nervous, and disabling ail- 
ments be given to the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. The 
fund is the estate and its increment willed for the purpose by Anna 
_T. Jeanes, a noted Friend philanthropist, who died in 1908. The 
recommendation was made by Dr. Winford H. Smith, superintendent 
of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, who was selected by the 
trustees of the fund to come to Philadelphia, make a survey of its 
hospitals, and give them his opinion as to where the fortune would 
work the greatest benefit. 
MEDICAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE YEAR. 
Three achievements of the year in the field of bacteriology and 
preventive medicine which stand to the credit of American physi- 
cians are worthy of special comment. The first was the establishing 
of the bacterial origin of typhus fever. This was through the work 
of Drs. Plotz, Olitzky, and Baehr, of the Mount Sinai Hospital, 
New York city, who proved that the specific etiological factor of 
typhus fever is an anaérobic bacillus known as the bacillus typhi 
cxanthematici, first described by Plotz in 1914. The definite knowl- 
edge regarding the germ origin of typhus was timely, since the in- 
creased prevalence of the disease in Austria, Russia, and Serbia has 
furnished the opportunity, of which Plotz has taken advantage, for 
trying out a vaccine and other methods for its prevention or cure. 
As reported last year, the fact that typhus fever was transmitted by 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
insects, such as the body louse and other vermin, had already been 
proved through the work of four American physicians—Anderson, 
Goldberger, Ricketts, and Wilder. 
The second achievement was the checking of the most severe epi- 
demic of typhus fever in modern times, which was raging in Serbia 
early in 1915. The epidemic began in January, 1915, among some 
Austrian prisoners and spread rapidly from them to other individuals. 
The country, weakened by war, was not prepared for the terrible 
and widespread epidemic which resulted. No systematic effort was 
made to check the disease until in the latter part of March, when 
a group of American physicians, under the direction of Richard P. 
Strong, of Harvard University, was sent to Serbia by the American 
Red Cross Sanitary Commission. The epidemic increased through 
January, rose more rapidly in February and March, and reached its 
height in April, when about 9,000 cases were reported each day. 
Through the vigorous efforts of these outside voluntary workers, and 
with the cooperation of Serbian physicians and officials, the epidemic 
was soon under control and within a few months no new cases of 
typhus were reported. Meanwhile, besides those going to Serbia, 
several groups of physicians, organized in what are known as “ hos- 
pital units,” each unit accompanied by a corps of nurses, have been 
sent by some of the American medical schools to help care for the 
sick and wounded in the European war. 
The third achievement, though less dramatic than the one just de- 
scribed,.was of no less importance. It was the success in preventing 
the spread of an epidemic of the plague in New Orleans. The disease 
appeared in that city in the latter part of 1915, and its spread was 
prevented by the prompt action of the United States Public Health 
Service, assisted by the local health officers. The spread of the dis- 
ease was checked by the fumigation of vessels with carbon monoxide 
or with hydrocyanic acid gas, by the spraying of buildings, and by a 
campaign for the extermination of rats. A report * states that 94,307 
buildings were rendered rat proof, that 490,022 rats were trapped, 
and that on examination of the majority of these, 265 were found to 
have rodent plague. No other cases of human plague developed, 
and no further evidence of the disease among rodents has been found 
since November 6, 1915. 
The success in checking epidemics of typhus fever and the plague 
are excellent illustrations of the great good resulting from the 
present-day knowledge of medicine secured since the discovery of 
the germ origin of many diseases referred to in last year’s report. 
They are illustrations also of the excellent service to the public which 
can be rendered by physicians who -have secured their training in   
1 American Year Book, 1915, p. 705.
-P-A-G-E-219
  
  MEDICAL EDUCATION IN 1916. 191 
high-grade medical schools where the latest methods of recognizing 
and preventing diseases are taught. The improvements in medical 
schools during the last 12 to 15 years are resulting in the graduation 
of larger numbers of physicians who are capable of performing such 
highly important services in public-health work. 
GRADUATE COURSES IN PUBLIC HEALTH. 
Graduate courses in public health have been established in con- 
nection with 10 medical schools, the first of which was established 
at the University of Pennsylvania in 1909. The Rockefeller Founda- 
tion has provided funds for the establishing of a school of hygiene

Hopkins University. Dr. William H.*Welch was appointed as di- 
rector of the school and Dr. William H. Howell as head of the 
physiological department. <A site is to be purchased and a suitable 
building erected, provided with laboratories and departments needed 
in such a school, including those of sanitary chemistry, physiology,

statistics, museum, library, ete. About a year will be required for 
the erection of the building, the securing of equipment, and the 
gathering together of a suitable staff of teachers. It is expected that 
the school will be opened in October, 1917. The following table sum- 
marizes the data for the schools in public health in nine other medical

  MEDICAL EDUCATION IN 1916, 193 
GRADUATE MEDICAL INSTRUCTION AT HOME. 
A large proportion of the physicians in the United States for 
financial reasons, or from the nature of their practice, find it im- 
possible to leave their homes for even a few weeks, or months, and 
to pay the enormous expense necessary to obtain graduate medical 
instruction abroad or in distant cities. Many of these physicians 
would be glad to improve their skill, if such instruction could be 
made accessible to them. Efforts to meet this need are now being 
made in several States. The medical society of the State of Penn- 
sylvania was apparently the first State association to establish 
graduate instruction in county medical societies. Many physicians 
well qualified as teachers were found who were willing to conduct 
clinics and discuss medical topics before such societies if their travel- 
ing expenses were paid. This plan was successful for a number of 
years and would doubtless have continued so, if adequate supervision 
of it had been maintained by the State society. Another plan was 
adopted about two years ago by the committee on postgraduate in- 
struction of the State medical society of Maryland. Among the 
younger members of the faculties in the local medical schools, a 
number were found who were eminently qualified to give graduate 
medical instruction and who could be spared from their duties at 
certain periods of the year. The offer was made to send one or two 
of these men to give courses of lectures and clinics to county societies 
desiring them, the only charge made being for transportation and 
entertainment. In 1915 the plan was tried at Hagerstown, and so 
much interest was aroused that this year the committee planned to 
establish 10 or 12 such courses. In Michigan during the past year 
the development of a public health measure has resulted in bring- 
ing graduate medical instruction to the local physicians. The State 
board of health established clinics throughout the State for the ex- 
amination of patients suspected of having tuberculosis. Specially 
qualified clinicians selected by the board were placed in charge of 
these clinics, who, in addition to examining the patients and instruct- 
ing them how to live, demonstrated to local physicians the later and 
more efficient methods of examination and diagnosis. In Ohio a 
committee of the State medical association adopted a plan quite 
similar to the one. in Maryland, whereby teachers from the local 
medical schools were sent out to give lectures and demonstrations 
on special subjects to physicians in small cities and towns. 
The latest plan for bringing graduate medical instruction to the 
physicians has been established in North Carolina. Since June 5, 
1916, classes of about 15 physicians in each have been held in six 
cities, under the auspices of the State board of health and the Uni-
-P-A-G-E-222
  194 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
versity of North Carolina, which. were continued for 17 weeks. The 
instructor was in Raleigh on Monday and in Weldon, Tarboro, Wil- 
son, Goldsboro, and Selma on the other five days of the week, respec- 
tively. The course was opened each day at 11 a. m.; it consisted of 
a lecture covering one hour and a clinic of two hours, and dealt with 
diseases of children. The instructor, a Boston physician, was a spe- 
cialist on the subject. Another class was organized in the western 
part of the State, the instructor being a Chicago physician, who like- 
wise gave lectures and clinics in children’s diseases. ‘The physicians 
enrolled paid fees sufficient to cover the expenses of the course. The 
clinics were supplied with patients by the physicians enrolled, and it 
is reported that sufficient valuable material was readily found. 
A NATIONAL BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS. 
For many years the need of a national board of medical examiners 
has been generally recognized by the medical profession. The licens- 
ing of physicians in this country from the beginning has rested with 
boards appointed under the authority of the 48 States and the Dis- 
trict of Columbia, and there was need of some national qualification 
which would be worthy of acceptance in all States. A national body, 
with full legal powers, could not be established without securing an 
amendment to the National Constitution. It was evident, therefore, 
that the national board would have to be voluntary and that its cer- 
tificate, to be of value, would need to be based on unquestionable 
qualifications. During the year such a voluntary national board of 
medical examiners has been organized, through action taken in 1915 
by the late Dr. William L. Rodman, who was then president of the 
American Medical Association. Dr. Rodman was fortunate in secur- 
ing from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 
a donation of funds generous enough to pay the running expenses of 
the board for several years. The personnel of the membership of the 
board originally selected was as follows: 
Admiral W. C. Braisted, Surgeon General, United States Navy, president; 
Commander E. R. Stitt, United States Navy; Gen. W. C. Gorgas, representing 
the United States Army; Col. L. A. La Garde, treasurer, representing the 
United States Army; Surg.-Gen. Rupert Blue, representing the Public Health 
Service; Asst. Surg.-Gen. W. C. Rucker, representing the Public Health Service; 
Herbert Harlan, representing the Federation of State Medical Boards; Isadore 
Dyer, New Orleans; Victor C. Vaughan, Ann Arbor, Mich.; Henry Sewell, Den- 
ver; Louis B. Wilson, Rochester, Minn.; E. Wyllys Andrews, Chicago; Horace 
D. Arnold, Boston; Austin Flint, Jr., New York; and William L. Rodman, sec- 
retary, Philadelphia. 
The vacancy caused by the death of Dr. Rodman was filled last 
June by the appointment of Dr. Walter L. Bierring, president of the 
Towa State board of medical examiners.
-P-A-G-E-223
    
MEDICAL EDUCATION IN 1916. 195 
The board, therefore, is at present composed of six representatives 
from the Government medical services (two each from the United 
States Army, Navy, and Public Health Service), two members 
(hereafter there are to be three) selected from members of State 
licensing boards, and seven (hereafter six) other physicians ap- 
pointed at large. The Surgeon Generals of the Army, Navy, and 
Public Health Service will serve as long as they hold their respec- 
tive offices. If not reappointed at the expiration of their terms, 
their places on the national board will be automatically filled by 
their successors. 
At an early meeting of the board all other members were by lot 
divided into three groups of four members each, their terms being 
two, four, and six years, so that the terms of four members will 
expire every two years. Their successors will be appointed for a 
term of six years. 
The board has adopted educational standards as high as the 
highest adopted by any State licensing board. Applicants who 
graduated in 1912 and thereafter will be required to have completed 
two years of work in an approved college of arts and sciences, or 
to have had an equivalent education, prior to entering on the study 
of medicine. The date for the first examination of the board was 
fixed for October 16, 1916, in the city of Washington. 
The attainment of the object for which this board was organized 
depends on the acceptance of its certificate by the various State 
licensing boards. It is believed that when this board is once estab- 
lished its certificate will be a qualification worthy of acceptance in 
the selection of officers for the medical reserve corps of the Army 
and Navy to aid the Government in any national emergency. When 
fully established this board will also doubtless provide an avenue 
by which reciprocal relations in medical licensure may be arranged 
between this and other countries.

  CHAPTER XI. 
LEGAL EDUCATION.* 
By Henry M. Bates, 
Dean of the Law School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich, 
GROWTH OF LAW SCHOOLS. 
The outstanding fact in legal education in this country during the 
past 25 years is the shift from the law office to the law school as the 
avenue of approach to the bar. This is shown both by the increase 
in the number of students in the law schools and by the increase in 
the number of schools themselves. In 1891 there were 96 schools, 
with a total attendance of 12,516 students. In 1916 there are, ac- 
cording to the reports of the United States Bureau of Education, 124 
schools, with an aggregate attendance of 22,993 students.? The 
following is a summary of the statistics for the’*year ended June 30, 
1916:

This increase in the number of institutions teaching law and in the 
number of students preparing for the bar in this way makes on the 
whole for improvement, but the ointment is not without its flies. 
The change has been brought about by a number of causes, chief of 
which is that the average law office has become a much less effective 
place than it formerly was for the purpose of instruction. It has 
been pointed out repeatedly that the successful lawyer of to-day is

this review is supplementary. There was no chapter on legal education in the 1915 
report. 
2The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which is conducting an 
exhaustive study of legal education, reports 1387 schools conferring degrees, 10 resident 
schools that do not confer degrees, and 17 correspondence schools. For list see end of

  198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
too busy to give anything like adequate time to the instruction of 
young men in his office. A second cause, resulting of course some- 
what from the first, is that the American Bar Association and many 
State associations have recommended, and even urged, that young 
men going to the bar should seek their instruction in law schools. 
Unfortunately some lawyers, and some persons who are not 
lawyers, have seen in this tendency and in this organized pro- 
fessional support of the law schools an opportunity to make money 
' out of the functions of legal instruction. Thus it is that there are 
a large number of proprietary schools organized on a commercial 
basis, advertising extensively, frequently without any regard to the 
dictates of good taste or of ordinary honesty. It is only fair to 
add that there are some proprietary schools conducted by con- 
scientious men and with as much adherence to the requirements of 
a sound educational policy as is possible within the limitations under 
which they necessarily work. Many high-minded lawyers give of 
their time and energy to the work of instruction in such schools, 
not infrequently for wholly inadequate compensation, and in some 
instances without any compensation at all. They are led to do 
this largely out of a desire to be helpful to young men seeking the 
profession to which they themselves have devoted their lives. Some- 
times such men give really adequate instruction, but the instances 
of this are necessarily growing increasingly rare, for the work of 
legal instruction has become more and more a distinct profession, 
with an increasingly growing appreciation by practicing lawyers’ 
of the demands made upon the time, energy, and devotion of the 
really scientific law teacher. Men engaged in the active practice 
of law, especially if they are able and successful, have neither the 
time nor the energy left after the day’s work in the practice of 
their profession to do the work absolutely necessary for develop- 
ing the highest type of scholarship or for acquiring the technique 
‘ of law teaching in its modern development. It is important, of 
course, that law teaching shall be in close contact with specific 
and practical needs of the profession; but, on the other hand, if 
law is to grow, if it is to become liberalized, and if it is to meet 
the wants of the changing community, it is extremely important 
that the function of legal education should be in the hands of 
men who are able to view law in something of a scientific and a 
philosophical spirit and with a consciousness of its evolutionary 
character. 
Tor these reasons and others more obvious the proprietary city 
school can seldom give to its students a sense of the importance of 
making the law conform to changing conditions of society in per- 
forming its prime function of accomplishing justice. Despite the 
brilliant things that have been said about the difference between
-P-A-G-E-227
  
LEGAL EDUCATION. 199 
law and justice, and conceding all that any rational person would 
claim as to the necessity of certainty and such permanence as may 
be possible in the rules of law, there are nevertheless overwhelming 
reasons why the endeavor should be to make law coincide with jus- 
tice to the fullest possible extent. 
MULTIPLICATION OF SCHOOLS. 
It is with these thoughts in mind that one can not but deplore the 
growth of mushroom schools in the commercial centers. California, 
for example, has at least two excellent schools, amply equipped in 
every way to train all the lawyers the State can possibly need, ex- 
cept those who for one reason or another wish to go outside for their 
legal education. Nevertheless, according to the Carnegie Founda- 
tion study, there were in 1915 seven other schools in California, and 
the past year has witnessed the addition of still another to the list, 
its faculty being made up of men actively engaged in practice at the 
bar. The same situation in multiplication of schools subject to such 
limitations that they can not possibly do the best work is to be found 
in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and other large centers. 
Frank speaking on this subject is unfortunate in that it is almost 
certain to give offense to high-minded, conscientious lawyers who are 
giving their time to instruction in such schools from motives alto- 
gether creditable to themselves. But the future of legal education 
and indirectly of the bar and of the great work which it is its duty 
to perform for the State make it a plain duty, however unpleasant, 
to insist upon a conscientious and open-eyed consideration of the 
situation. : 
Men like to speak of lawyers as officers of the court, and such they 
are in some sense and to a large extent, and in just that sense and to 
that extent they are public officers; and irrespective of their official 
status they are of course the most powerful single agency in making, - 
declaring, and enforcing the principles of private law. Upon their 
intelligence, their knowledge of legal principle, and their real under- 
standing of the function of law depends in no small degree the very 
future of the law itself. Furthermore, as judges, as legislators, and 
as administrators they affect powerfully the administration of law 
and the accomplishing of justice in the State. This being the case, 
it should be frankly recognized that the practice of law isnot a matter 
of private right, but a privilege, and a privilege, moreover, which 
should be controlled by the public in the interest of the public alone. 
These considerations require that the matter of legal education should 
be looked at in the same light and controlled in the same way and for 
the same reasons. These purposes are so nearly self-evident, and they 
concern community interests so important, that it is amazing that  
-P-A-G-E-228
  
  200 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
their force should not be recognized by the public in an insistence 
that legal education and admission to the bar should be regarded as 
wholly without the scope of mere private right or enterprise. A man 
should no more be permitted to practice law merely because it would 
be for him a gainful occupation, or because for other reasons he 
wishes to, than a man should be permitted to become a judge or 
legislator for the same reasons. With almost as much truth it may be 
said that the function of legal education should not be confided to 
persons or institutions merely because the exercise of the function 
may be profitable or agreeable to such persons or institutions. The 
State, in this matter, should insist only upon the best available meth- 
ods and instruments of legal education, and should not tolerate the 
suggestion that it be satisfied with instrumentalities and methods 
which may perhaps suffice to give a man a smattering of the law or 
even to enable him to pass examinations for the bar. This last asser- 
tion is made with confidence, because with the means at hand and 
with the time and other limitations under which boards of law exam- 
iners must act under present conditions, the bar examination, how- 
ever valuable, can not answer as the sole means of determining a 
candidate’s qualifications for practicing law. 
IMPROVEMENT IN REGULATIONS. 
It is gratifying to note important advances made in public opinion 
regarding these matters, and in some cases the actual effectuation of 
that improved public opinion. In New York, Illinois, Michigan, 
Kansas, and other States steady improvement in the regulations for 
admission to the bar have been made during the past three or four 
years, and even a cursory examination of the questions asked upon 
examination for admission will show how these questions are improv- 
ing in many States. 
In Ohio the matter of admission to the bar has been in the hands 
of the supreme court, which acts through a board of examiners that 
has been steadily improving the type of its questions and the method 
of marking answers. The Ohio State bar association at its annual 
meeting in July unanimously adopted a resolution recommending 
that four years of law study instead of the prevailing three be re- 
quired of all candidates for admission to the bar, except those who 
are college graduates. In Michigan a law passed in 1913 has this 
year for the first time become fully operative. This law has repealed 
the old statute exempting the graduates of law schools of the State 
from the State examination. All candidates for admission to the 
bar are now required to take these examinations, which are given by 
a competent and conscientious board of five examiners.
-P-A-G-E-229
  
LEGAL EDUCATION. 201 
POLICIES AND METHODS. 
The past two years have witnessed no radical changes in the law 
school curriculum or in policies or methods. The case method of in- 
struction has been fully vindicated and is now the principal method 
in a large majority of the law schools. But no adherent of the case 
method, however devoted to it he may be, believes that it contains 
the last word on the subject of legal education. Changes in general 
education, shifting industrial, commercial, and social conditions and 
the gradual rise of new types of law business will necessarily bring 
about modifications in present methods of legal instruction. There 
are now so many good law schools in the country, and there is among 
them such generous rivalry to attain high efficiency and usefulness, 
that there need be no fear that modifications will not come rapidly 
enough. Indeed, there may be some danger that experiments and 
changes will be tried too freely and without sufficient consideration 
of the fundamental functions involved. There can be little doubt 
that the law schools of the country have reached a measure of effi- 
ciency beyond that of many other institutions of university or college 
rank. This is due in large measure to forces and conditions for 
which college teachers are not to blame and for which the law-school 
teachers can claim no credit. In the first place, the function of the 
law school is narrower and simpler, and however important it may be, 
the field of law-school endeavor is much smaller than that of the col- 
lege. It is very much easier, too, for the law faculty to get serious, 
hard work from its students than for the college professor to obtain 
the same result from college boys. The law student is older; more- 
over, the law student feels that he is forging the very instruments 
with which he is to make his living, whereas the college student is 
altogether too apt to think that his work is lacking in practical value. 
CURRICULUM PROBLEMS. 
One thing the law school has done—it has “ stuck to its last.” It 
has recognized that it had a definite and important function to per- 
form. It has insisted that that function be performed only in the 
’ best possible way, all conditions being taken into account. It has felt 
that to wander from the main highway of legal instruction into. the 
by-paths of matters of relative insignificance or only collateral to law 
would be to impair the efficiency of its work. It has, moreover, in- 
sisted in the main that only such subjects should be taught as were 
susceptible of treatment with sound pedagogical methods. 
For these reasons the law school of to-day excludes from its cur- 
riculum subjects which it may be well for the lawyer to know some- 
thing of, but which are not immediately and necessarily constituent
-P-A-G-E-230
    202 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
elements of the law. It has not felt that it could or should teach 
sociology, political economy, or philosophy. And it has pretty stead- 
ily refused to include among its courses any which, because of the 
character of the available material for teaching, could not be the 
basis of intensive preparation by the student and then of free discus- 
sion between instructor and class in the classroom. The law-school 
teacher who discusses with his class problems upon which they have 
spent hours of time before the class meeting, who knows what they 
are thinking, who sees their difficulties, who becomes acquainted with 
them while they are becoming acquainted with him, who reads and 
marks all of his examination papers, is by these very facts compelled 
to keep fresh upon the subject matter of the course, to adapt his 
instruction in all respects to the needs and capacities of his students, 
and with each passing year to become more familiar not only with 
the subject but with the best method of handling it and with inspir- 
ing his students to real thinking. 
But the law school has maintained its sound position despite temp- 
tations to depart from it—temptations that are growing in number 
and in intensity of appeal. The insistent demand to “liberalize the 
law ” is not unnaturally accompanied by efforts to introduce liberal 
and cultural elements, so called, into law-school instruction. Herein 
lies a danger which needs to be sedulously guarded against. As the 
case stands to-day the law student in a three-year course can cover 
only from perhaps 60 to 80 per cent of those subjects that are uni- 
versally regarded as of importance to the general practitioner and 
as susceptible of the best educational use. To include in the under- 
graduate curriculum, then, philosophical, economic, or social sub- 
jects would be to exclude an equivalent amount of pure legal study. 
This certainly can not be done to any considerable extent without 
seriously restricting the student’s study of general law subjects in 
which he ought to have careful training, and without impairing his 
subsequent efficiency as a lawyer. It is for this, among other reasons, 
that the law school ought to, and the better schools actually do, insist 
that as much of these and other liberal subjects as possible shall have 
been pursued by the student in school or college. It is this, among 
other reasons, which makes a complete college course highly de- 
sirable, if not necessary, for any student who hopes to become a 
broad-minded, successful practitioner at the bar under modern condi- 
tions. The three-year period is all too short for the law school to do 
for the student what should be done in preparing him for the actual 
practice of his profession. It would seem, then, that the law school 
must recognize that there should be a division of functions, and that 
to the college and the graduate school should be confided the work 
of infusing the spirit and the content of a liberal culture into the 
prospective lawyer’s mind.
-P-A-G-E-231
  
LEGAL EDUCATION. 203 
There is doubtless a place in the undergraduate curriculum in law 
for the elements of such subjects as Roman law, jurisprudence, 
international law, and the theory of legislation; but it is doubtful 
if the average student should be allowed to do much even in these 
fields as an undergraduate in the law school. 
What can be done and what ought to be done is for the law fac- 
ulty to become so saturated with the principles of jurisprudence, 
the philosophy of law, and the economic and social content of law 
that it will, in imparting instruction in strictly legal subjects, give 
to the student an enlightened view of the principles of the great 
subject which he is to practice, and will send him out with a for- 
ward, progressive spirit, with an understanding of the underlying 
philosophic problems involved in any legal system. A few stu- 
dents—those with broad, general education and with minds capable 
of grasping philosophical conceptions—should then be influenced to 
continue their studies in graduate schools in order that there may be 
a constant supply of men qualified in mind, spirit, and knowledge 
to become real jurists, the leaders in legal thought and legal instruc- 
tion of the future. 
It may be objected that if, in courses upon particular subjects, 
anything but the rule of law is taught there will be a blurring of the 
student’s knowledge and understanding of the legal principle. It 
hardly seems as though this is at all a necessary result. For ex- 
ample, if in torts the topics of liability of the employer for injury 
received by the employee in the course of his employment, or of con- 
tributory negligence, or in constitutional law the matter of “due 
process,” are discussed in the classrooms solely with reference to 
the law as it has already been declared, a great majority of students 
are likely to emerge with a purely legalistic conception of law. On 
the other hand, if, when these topics are reached and the law as it is 
has been carefully discussed and criticized, it is pointed out how 
the fellow-servant doctrine and that of contributory negligence, or 
an early nineteenth-century view of due process of law, no longer 
meet the requirements of a growing and highly complex society, it 
is submitted that the student will have an even clearer understand- 
ing of the law as it is, and that he will go to the bar with a forward 
and progressive spirit which will contribute its mite to intelligent 
reform. Similarly throughout the curriculum; if the faculty is 
itself saturated with jurisprudence and is reading and reflecting 
upon the philosophy of law, it will be able to interest the students 
in the nature of law and in the light which the study of jurispru- 
dence and justice philosophy throw upon any given system of posi- 
tive law. Anything like exhaustive or comprehensive study of 
jurisprudence, juristic philosophy, or even comparative studies of 
law ought to be reserved, generally speaking, for graduate work.

    204 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
The faculties are still groping for some suitable material and 
some proper method with which to give instruction in the ele- 
ments of law, as suggested by Prof. Josef Redlich in his report 
to the Carnegie Foundation upon the case method of instruction. 
By this is not meant the old-fashioned course in “elementary law.” 
This problem was discussed at the 1915 meeting of the Association 
of American Law Schools held in Chicago, and two interesting 
papers upon the recommendation of Prof. Redlich, one by Dean 
Stone, of Columbia, and one by Dean Woodward, then of Leland 
Stanford, were read. It may fairly be said that while unquestion- 
ably a study of the real elements of law in a scientific sense would 
be valuable, yet, as the Anglo-American law has never yet been stated 
in “elements” in the sense in which Prof. Redlich used the term, 
it is impossible to teach it in that way. Nevertheless some inter- 
esting efforts to meet what is undoubtedly to some extent a defect 
in legal education are receiving consideration. ‘Courses of one kind 
or another in the elements or principles of law are given at Cali- 
fornia, Chicago, Leland Stanford, and Northwestern. Courses which 
are in some degree comparative studies of law are offered at Cali- 
fornia, Leland Stanford, and Northwestern in the undergraduate 
curricula, and at Harvard and the University of Michigan in the 
graduate courses. Special and more narrowly limited comparative 
studies, as, for example, upon commercial law, procedure and legis- 
lation, are offered in one or more of the schools already named. 
Other interesting developments of the past year or two in law- 
school curricula would include the course in criminal law, crimi- 
nology, and penology offered at the University of California in the 
summer session of 1916, and the advanced courses in procedure based 
upon studies of the reformed procedure of England and several of 
the States as offered at Harvard and the University of Michigan. 
THE CARNEGIE STUDY OF LEGAL EDUCATION. 
As part of its study of legal education the division of educational 
inquiry of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teach- 
ing published a list of law schools in the annual report of the 
foundation for 1915.1 It is claimed for this list that it is “the 
most authoritative list of law schools ever published in the United 
States, at least since the growth of these schools reached its modern 
efflorescence.” The list was purposely made to include all schools 
actually “alive,” so far as could be ascertained. For this reason 
it contains, under the heading of resident institutions, a number of 
schools that have for one reason or another been eliminated from

CHAPTER XII. 
ENGINEERING EDUCATION. 
By ©. R. Mann, 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. 
Engineering education is a thoroughly modern venture. The rapid 
industrial development during the last half century drove men to 
accept for the future engineer whatever training could be had at the 
moment, without waiting for the slow development of centuries, 
which has shaped the educational methods for the older professions. 
Hence the engineering schools were organized and controlled by 
men who had derived their ideas of the proper methods of profes- 
sional training from inherited or acquired experiences in teaching 
the three old “learned professions.” Practicing engineers have sel- 
dom been placed at the head of engineering schools, although in- 
struction in law, in medicine, and in theology has always been con- 
trolled by the leading practitioners in those professions. 
This is not so surprising when it is noted that everyone has a clear 
idea of what a doctor, a lawyer, or a minister is, but is at a loss to say 
what an engineer is. Tredgold’s definition, written in 1828, that 
the engineer is one who “ directs the great sources of power in nature 
for the use and convenience of man” is no longer adequate. The 
successful engineer to-day must direct the powers of men as well as 
the powers of nature; and the work must be done at a minimum cost. 
Therefore, to be successful, the engineering schools must determine 
what characteristics are essential to the men who can do these things, 
and what educational methods contribute most to the development 
of these characteristics. 
The problem was stated in this form by A. M. Wellington in a 
series of articles in the Engineering News in 1892. He says: “The 
aim of every professional school is to train men to succeed in that 
profession and to dwell most on those things most needful to success. 
It has no other purpose or function as such.” 
The following year, when the international congress was held at 
the World’s Fair, the division on engineering education organized 
permanently as the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Edu- 
cation. At that time, engineering education seemed a rather simple 
209  
-P-A-G-E-238
  210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
problem, for Wellington’s statement of the case was not yet under- 
stood. One of the “engineering educators” at that first meeting de- 
scribed “ the ideal engineering education” with the utmost assurance. 
But in time, after a number of excellent committee reports had been 
- presented and discussed at the meetings, it became more and more 
clear that the training of engineers is an even more perplexing and 
difficult task than is that of training lawyers, doctors, and ministers. 
As a result, the society, in 1907, appointed a committee to make a 
comprehensive study of the whole problem. 
This committee soon found that it needed the help of practicing 
engineers. Therefore, the national engineering societies were invited 
to cooperate in the study, and the joint committee on engineering 
education began its work in 1908. The membership of this committee 
is as follows: Desmond FitzGerald (chairman) ; Onward Bates and 
Daniel W. Mead, of the American Society of Civil Engineers; Henry 
M. Howe and John Hays Hammond, of the American Institute of 
Mining Engineers; F. H. Clark and Fred J. Miller, of the American 
Society of Mechanical Engineers; Charles F. Scott and Samuel Shel- 
don, of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers; Clifford 
Richardson and Henry P. Talbot, of the American Chemical Society ; 
J. R. Withrow, of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers; 
and ©, L. Crandall, Dugald C. Jackson, and Gardner C. Anthony, 
of the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education. 
This new committee, however, soon discovered that the work would 
require more time than any one member could devote to it. Con- 
sequently, the committee in 1914 asked the Carnegie Foundation for 
the Advancement of Teaching to undertake such a study with them. 
This study is now in progress and will be completed sometime early 
in 1917.4 
Since the fundamental purpose of every professional school is to 
train men to succeed in the profession, the first problem for every 
such school is to determine what factors make for success. Accord- 
ingly, the Carnegie Foundation sent a circular letter to practicing 
engineers asking what characteristics were most needful for success 
in engineering. The result of this inquiry showed that, in the opin- 
ion of the 7,000 engineers who replied, such personal attributes as 
character, integrity, responsibility, initiative, judgment, common 
sense, efficiency, thoroughness, industry, and understanding of men 
have a weight of 75 per cent in determining the success of an engi- 
neer, while knowledge of his subject and of the technique of practice 
and of business constitute the other 25 per cent. 
Inasmuch as college methods of instruction have been developed 
mainly for the purpose of imparting knowledge of subject matter   
1Copies of the report may be had by applying to the Carnegie Foundation, 576 Fifth 
Avenue, New York.
-P-A-G-E-239
  ENGINEERING EDUCATION. 211 
and have paid little conscious attention to the development of per- 
sonal character, it is clear that progress in engineering education 
consists in devising methods of instruction which give a mastery of 
subject matter and at the same time develop in the student those 
personal attributes that make up three-quarters of the engineer’s 
equipment for success. The solution of this problem can be found 
only by experiment. Therefore, a real insight into the progress of 
engineering education may best be obtained from a study of some 
of the educational experiments that are now being made for this 
purpose. 
One of the most interesting experiments in developing engineers 
who shall possess the necessary factors for success is being made at 
the University of Cincinnati, under the direction of Dean Herman 
Schneider. In 1906 the engineering school entered into a coopera- 
tive arrangement with the industrial plants of the city whereby each 
student spends half his time at the university and the other half in 
actual engineering work. The students are divided into two groups, 
which alternate with each other in biweekly periods, so that the shop 
and the university are always full-manned. In this way the practice 
of engineering is taught under actual commercial conditions, while 
the science underlying the practice is taught in the university. The 
course is completed in 5 years of 11 months each, so that each stu- 
dent has 27 months of university instruction. Since the regular 
four-year course in other schools never gives more than 36 months 
of actual instruction, this plan merely substitutes 27 months of prac- 
tical work for 9 months of the usual instruction. 
This 27 months of practical work is controlled by the university 
and is so organized that the student progresses regularly from the 
cruder and rougher work to the more difficult and responsible posi- 
tions. Thus a civil engineer will probably begin with pick and 
shovel as a member of a track gang repairing track. If he remains 
at railroad work, in course of time he will become foreman of the 
gang, working with the regular foreman. Before he is through with 
railroading he will have worked in the switch and signal department, 
on bridge work, on general engineering work in the engineering de- 
partment, and on evaluation work. He will also have definite experi- 
ence in ferro-concrete construction. He will learn the operation of 
regular trains and work trains; he will know how to place and oper- 
ate the equipment for construction, calculate cuts and fills, and so on, 
all as a part of the regular work on a “real railroad.” 
‘When a student begins a new job he is given a set of “work 
observation sheets.” These contain from 50 to 200 questions con- 
cerning the details of the job and direct the student to sources of 
information where he can find the answers. He is required to be 
prepared to answer these questions during the “coordination peri- 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
  ods,” which come two or three times a week while he is at the uni- 
versity. By the time he completes the work he has not only learned 
how to do it correctly, but has been made to work out many prob- 
lems of machine design, and has learned that success depends on the 
accuracy with which all the details have been fitted together. Much 
of the information required can be obtained only from fellow work- 
men, with whom he must therefore keep on friendly terms. His 
shop time is therefore not consumed in merely becoming a competent 
operator of a machine, but is mainly occupied in gaining an under- 
standing of the meaning of shop practices and in learning to know 
workmen. 
Through the elimination of the “practice shop,” the university is 
spared the expense of maintaining shops which are at best imitations 
of commercial shops and whose equipment soon becomes obsolete. 
The students also benefit financially, because the cooperating firms 
are glad to pay them regular wages for their shopwork; and this 
makes a college training possible for many students who possess the 
necessary qualifications, but who would otherwise be barred because 
of its expense. Thus the work that enables the boys to stay in college 
is also helping to educate them for their future careers. 
Experience has also shown that this frequent change of occupation 
tends to keep the student mentally and physically vigorous and does 
not distract and scatter his attention. 
The faculty, too, benefit by the constant contact of the students 
with the practical world. For while a class that is face to face with 
multitudinous practical questions soon comes to appreciate the value 
of sound theory, it will not permit the professor to feed it long on 
problems that are simply made up to be problems, or on thinking 
that merely leads to more thinking. In Cincinnati theory is taught 
for the sake of its use; and if at any time in his course a student is 
found unable to use some theory that he has studied, he may be sent 
back to repeat that special work. The mechanics teacher may 
“flunk” students in calculus, or the professor of machine design may 
“flunk” them in mechanics. Nothing is finally passed until the 
diploma is granted. 
Such effects as these can not be secured without constant study of 
the problem as a teaching problem by the faculty in a spirit of sincere 
cooperation. The tradition of departmental autonomy is here en- 
tirely destroyed, and the faculty spends two hours every Saturday 
morning discussing not only the details of administration, but also 
the general aims and purposes of the course as a whole, and the prac- 
tical contribution which each department can make to the entire 
result. This cooperative study of their school problem as a problem 
in teaching by a whole college faculty is by no means the least 
encouraging and suggestive part of the Cincinnati experiment.  
-P-A-G-E-241
    
ENGINEERING EDUCATION. 213 
The faculty at Cincinnati is not only studying its teaching prob- 
lems in a scientific manner; it is also experimenting with a system 
of vocational guidance for its students. The idea on which this ex- 
periment is based is that a man is most efficient when his work gives 
him the greatest satisfaction, and he gets this satisfaction when he 
has found the job for which he has inborn talents. Therefore work 
should not be classified according to the materials or the product, but 
according to the human characteristics necessary for success in it. 
The students are also analyzed according to their inherent disposi- 
tions as settled or roving, directive or dependent, original or imita- 
tive, deliberate or impulsive, dynamic or static. The student is then 
guided into the type of job for which he seems to be temperamentally 
‘fitted. 
Dean Schneider’s experiment merits a more extended discussion 
than is possible here. The idea of part-time schools and of coopera- 
tion between the schools and industry is not new. It was included in 
the original plan of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The im- 
portant and original contribution which the Cincinnati experiment 
has made to educational practice lies in the fact that the practical 
work not only secures manual dexterity, but develops this motor skill 
under conditions that impel thought and an appreciation of social 
use. The Cincinnati plan thus creates an environment that contains 
the elements essential to normal healthy growth. 
The cooperative system as it has been worked out at Cincinnati has 
served as an inspiration for other experiments of a similar nature 
both in technical schools and in high schools in various sections of 
the country. Since the fundamental principles of all of these are the 
same, it is not necessary to discuss their detailed differences. They 
have added force to the work of Dean Schneider by showing that the 
Cincinnati method does not depend for its success either on the 
locality or on the personality of the director, but rests upon its own 
intrinsic merits as a genuine advance in educational methods. 
Besides the more general movements in which the college as a 
whole is concerned, there are a number of interesting experiments 
being made in various schools by individual instructors. Thus Prof. 
R. M. Bird is developing an effective method of teaching chemistry 
to freshmen at the University of Virginia. Before taking up teach- 
ing at the university, Prof. Bird worked for a number of years in 
an industrial plant. In this capacity he was impressed by the fact 
that young graduates who came to the factory to work never seemed 
to know how to attack a problem. They had not been taught to 
work on their own initiative and responsibility, but had carefully 
followed the directions given in their laboratory manuals and texts.   
1A detailed description of this experiment is given in Educ, Bul., 1916, No. 87, ‘The 
Cooperative System of Education,” by C. W. Park. 
61355°—16-—16  
-P-A-G-E-242
  214 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
They knew the atomic weights of the various elements and other 
such facts which are ready for use in any book on chemistry. But 
when they were confronted with the kind of problems that arise 
daily in practical work and that require real investigation rather 
than the mere verification of known results, they lacked the ability 
to find the proper avenue of approach to a solution. This lack of 
initiative and resourcefulness was a great handicap to their progress. 
In Prof. Bird’s course, therefore, the student is given, on the very 
first day, certain substances with which he is more or less familiar 
and discovers for himself means of identifying them through their 
physical and chemical properties. This is the method used through- 
out the course. Chemical facts and laws are gradually revealed 
through the solution and discussion of a series of problems such as’ 
these : : 
A solution of copper sulphate has been mixed with iron sulphate; from this 
solution prepare pure copper sulphate. 
Starting with metallic copper, make copper sulphate. 
Separate the copper from the silver in a United States dime. 
Sympathetic ink is a solution of cobalt chloride; starting with the nitrate, 
prepare some of this. 5 
By the second term the students are able to cope successfully with 
problems like these: 
During an absence from home the servant permitted my water heater to be- 
come completely stopped up with the deposit from clear hard water (free from 
mud). I cleaned it out without taking it to pieces (only disconnecting the 
screw union of the inlet water pipe) and without injury to the iron heater or 
the iron pipe. How would you have accomplished this? Prove the value of your 
method experimentally. 
A tobacco manufacturer had returned to him a very large quantity of chew- 
ing tobacco because it was too bitter to be used by the best class of customers. 
The trouble was located in the common salt used in the seasoning of the tobacco. 
What substances in the salt imparted the bitter. taste? 
Prof. Bird secures one of his best results by having pairs of 
students compete with one another in the manufacture of chemicals. 
Each pair must devise its own method and must charge up all costs, 
including their own time at 20 cents an hour. The competition with 
one another and with the market price introduces an element of sport 
which lends zest and reality to the work. 
The. essential point in Prof. Bird’s experiment is that the problems 
which he gives are not merely made-up problems, but have in them 
some really unknown quantity which can be discovered only by mak- 
ing an experiment in the laboratory. Therefore the laboratory is 
for the freshman exactly what it is for the research scientist—a place 
to find out things that can not be found out elsewhere. This treat- 
ment fosters the growth of a genuine spirit of investigation in the 
freshman and strengthens his initiative and resourcefulness, besides 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  ENGINEERING EDUCATION. 215 
giving him a practical working knowledge of chemistry. It must, 
therefore, be a more efficient method of training men for research 
than the current method of storing their heads with information. for 
several years before bringing them face to face with questions that 
can not be answered without investigation and experimentation. 
Educationally, the force in this experiment is very much the same 
as that in the work of Dean Schneider. The student is eager to work 
at projects by which he acquires manipulative skill under conditions 
that compel thinking and an appreciation of social use. Such proj- 
ects challenge his prowess, command his respect, and inspire him 
with a determination to succeed. They rivet his attention on the 
task in hand and occupy his mind out of working hours. As has 
been stated, these are the ideal conditions for free and normal growth. 
Similar experiments are being made in a number of schools not 
only in chemistry, but also in mechanics, mathematics, shopwork, 
machine design, thermodynamics, bridge design, and other scientific 
and technical subjects. These differ from one another widely in 
detail and in the methods used to get the results; but they are essen- 
tially similar in purpose and principle. They are all trying to dis- 
cover a method of presentation that will make the student really 
want to do the work while he is doing it. Inasmuch as the power of 
a school resides in the daily work in the classroom, these experiments 
’ open the way to progress toward the real end of education—greater - 
freedom for the development of personal characteristics through 
work that seems to the student intrinsically worth while. Advance 
will be repaid as soon as more college professors have come to see 
that the scientific investigation of a teaching problem is at least as 
worthy an expenditure of research ability as is the study of one of the 
far less complicated problems of the organic or the inorganic world. 
Tt is a striking fact that the study of teaching problems has as 
yet received little attention in institutions of college and university 
grade. The academic spirit seems to regard such innovations as 
dangerous intrusions, rather than as sources of new power. Even 
in engineering colleges such experiments are relatively rare, although 
schools like Wentworth Institute, Franklin Union, Lowell Institute, 
Pratt Institute, Drexel Institute, Lewis Institute, Hampton Institute, 
and Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute have long since dis- 
covered and made good use of the motivating power of real prob- 
lems. The teachers in the secondary schools have pursued this study 
with real success for a number of years and have numerous live 
associations and journals devoted wholly to this end. The Society 
for the Promotion of Engineering Education and the Society of 
College Teachers of Education are the only organizations of college 
men whose avowed purpose is the study of the teaching problem. 
The anomaly of this condition is not obliterated when it is noted that 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  216 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
about half of all the callege graduates in the country go into teaching, 
many of them without one hour of professional training. 
Teaching of the sort that has been described makes its appeal to 
the student through his instinctive desire for the mastery of material 
things. In so far as the methods of treatment emphasize and illumi- 
nate the social uses of the materials discussed, their training value is 
general, broadening, and even cultural. These experiments therefore 
also contribute directly to the solution of the problem of making the 
engineer a man of broad outlook and wide human sympathy. There 
are, however, two other lines of experiment which aim to accomplish 
this result more directly, and which may therefore lead to practices 
that will have a far-reaching effect on technical education. 
The first of these deals with the teaching of English. Realizing 
the distinction between having to say something and having some- 
thing to say, some English teachers have sought to render the work 
in English in engineering schools more vital by allowing the students 
to select technical subjects for themes, thereby utilizing their profes- 
sional interest to motivate the work. This is an obvious improvement 
over assigning to freshmen in engineering topics such as Socialism, 
The proper dress for girls on the campus, or The dates of Shake- 
speare’s plays. It does not, however, tend to give the technical man 
that love of good reading which is so valuable an asset to him. 
An experiment on a very different principle is being made by Prof. - 
Frank Aydelotte, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The 
assumptions on which this experiment rests are (1) that an engineer 
is first of all a man; (2) that literature interprets life; (3) that 
English is bigger and better than technical English. The first hour 
with a new class is usually spent in discussing with each student why 
he came to college and what he expects to get out of it. Many differ- 
ent view points are expressed. The problem of what a college is for 
is defined and the class is asked to read portions of Arnold’s Sweet- 
ness and Light, or Newman’s Knowledge its Own End, or Huxley’s 
Science and Culture, and to be prepared to discuss them the next 
class hour. After two or three hours of discussion with intervening 
reading, each member of the class is asked to write out his own con- 
clusions. Each of the resulting themes is criticized at a 15-minute 
personal conference with the author. Further discussion and further 
effort to make personal interpretations of writers like those men- 
tioned or of Ruskin, Carlyle, and Wordsworth furnish ample mate- 
rial for much practice in composition. 
The force in Prof. Aydelotte’s method resides in its direct appeal 
to the human instincts. It snatches literature from the grasp of 
pedantic grammarians and restores it to its normal functions. Even 
a freshman is eager to construct for himself some philosophy of life, 
and welcomes the discovery of the riches of literature. Once he has 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  ENGINEERING EDUCATION. 217 
caught a glimpse of its meaning, he will never be able altogether to 
overlook it. As with the other experiments that have been described, 
the educational promise in Prof. Aydelotte’s work lies in the fact 
that the student secures his technical skill under conditions that make 
thinking a necessity and involve an appreciation of social relations. 
Work of this sort fosters the growth of those personal characteristics 
that constitute three-quarters of the engineer’s equipment for success. 
It furnishes another means of adding the development of character 
to the other products of classroom instruction. 
The second experiment that is directly aimed at securing a broader 
outlook for engineers was begun at Yale by Prof. Joseph W. Roe, in 
1907, and has since spread to.a number of other engineering schools. 
The original object was to bring students while still in college into 
friendly contact with workmen and to develop among them a feeling 
of mutual confidence and good will. The work consists in (1) a 
study of welfare activities, and of living and working conditions in 
American industries; and (2) a definite attempt to render some 
useful service to workingmen in the city. This latter is done princi- 
pally through teaching English to foreigners, although there are 
classes in other subjects, as first aid to the injured, shop mathematics, 
civics, etc. Classes are small, in order to insure the element of per- 
sonal contact, and are given at the workmen’s home, in box cars, 
stores, pool rooms, boarding houses, shops, or anywhere where the 
men can be reached. The work is done voluntarily, without pay, and 
is independent of the college curriculum. 
This “industrial service work,” as it has been called, under the 
guidance of the international committee of the Y. M. C. A., has 
spread rapidly until now some 4,000 students are enrolled in it in 
more than 150 colleges. It has become so important that a special 
secretary ‘is required to conduct it. The response and interest that 
it has called forth from students have created a demand for instruc- 
tion on the human problems with which the students through it come 
into vital contact. Hence, there has been issued by the secretary, 
Fred H. Rindge, the outline of a “Suggested College Course on the 
Human Side of Engineering.” The topics treated are The Human 
Factor in Industry, The Evolution of the Individual Worker in In- 
dustry, Industrial Organizations, Human Factors in Production, 
Working Conditions, Living Conditions, Leisure Conditions, Voca- 
tional Guidance, Cooperative Organizations, Legislation on In- 
dustrial Questions, Industrial Betterment, Scientific Management, 
The Engineer’s Responsibility for Service. 
Industrial service differs from ordinary social welfare work in 
that the main object is not so much the benefit of the workman as the 
development of the student in widening his outlook, giving him
-P-A-G-E-246
218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
deeper insight into the social aspects and the human responsibili- 
ties and opportunities. of the engineering profession. 
For the past 50 years engineers have been absorbed in the work 
of inventing, constructing, and perfecting machinery and the ma- 
terial conveniences of life. A large field of usefulness along these 
lines will always remain open to them. But the methods of this 
work have now been standardized and reduced to a system. Every 
large plant has its designing department and even its research labo- 
ratory. Relatively little attention has as yet been given to the 
scientific study of problems of the organization and control of the 
forces of men. These problems of the conservation of human re- 
sources are as much engineering problems as are those of the con- 
servation of material resources. The demand for creative work in 
this field of human engineering is daily becoming more insistent. 
Again, American industry has developed in a land of abundant 
natural resources. It has always been protected by a tariff. This 
protected atmosphere of natural opulence has given strong incentive 
for the development of originality, initiative, and push. Every 
boy in America has felt that the opportunity to become President was 
open before him. There was, however, little incentive for economy 
of production. It was much easier to exploit the Indians or to 
persuade Congress to raise the tariff than it was to make a scientific 
study of production costs. 
The increase in population and the waste of natural resources 
have now brought the United States under the operation of the law 
of diminishing returns. The problem of efficiency of production has 
been thrust upon us. This again is an engineering problem. It 
can not be solved here by merely copying the autocratic methods that 
have been used successfully elsewhere, but demands an American so- 
lution which shall insure efficiency without sacrificing individual 
spontaneity and initiative. 
Progress in engineering education demands the recognition of 
these facts. It therefore involves (1) the modification of traditional 
methods of instruction in such a way that the mastery of facts and 
of manual skill will be secured under conditions that impel thought 
and an appreciation of social use; (2) the extension of its field to 
include industrial production and the organization of human ma- 
chinery. The ‘typical experiments that have been described show 
that a very hopeful beginning has already been made. The demand 
for these changes is so pressing that the schools must either make 
them quickly or give up all idea of holding a position at the head of 
the procession.

CHAPTER XIII. 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
By F. V. THompson, 
Assistant superintendent of schools, Boston, Mass. 
SUMMARY. 
Reports from 81 cities of 100,000 population and over indicate the 
following situation with regard to secondary commercial schools: 
First, respecting proportion of commercial pupils, it is apparent that 
from 10 to 60 per cent of all high-school pupils are enrolled in com- 
mercial courses. Boston and Milwaukee lead in the upper range, 
while Columbus, Dayton, Cleveland, and Cincinnati have lowest per- 
centages. On the average, about one-third of all pupils in the cities 
reporting are in commercial courses. Since 1912, when a similar ‘can- 
vass was made, no noticeable changes of proportion are discernible. 
High-school organization for conducting commercial education 
shows a tendency toward the separate school. Most of the cities 
reporting still maintain commercial courses in general (cosmopoli- 
tan) high schools. New York, Boston, Cleveland, San Francisco, 
Springfield, Worcester, Columbus, Portland (Oreg.), Washington, 
Syracuse, have special commercial high schools. 
Segregation of the sexes in commercial education has made but 
little, if any, progress since 1912. Some cities, like Philadelphia and 
Louisville, conduct all high schools upon the principle of segrega- 
tion, but usually the special commercial school is for both sexes. 
Boston and New York conduct segregated commercial high schools, 
but maintain mixed commercial classes in general high schools. 
Not only are commercial pupils not segregated by sex, but they 
are usually not separated from other pupils while pursuing related 
academic work, such as English, foreign languages, and mathe- 
matics. The commercial pupil receives specialized instruction only 
in technical subjects, such as stenography, bookkeeping, and type- 
writing. While superintendents reply that commercial pupils do

schools of cities of 100,000 population and over in the spring of 1916. 
219

  220 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
receive related academic work, they invariably state that this in- 
struction is given in divisions made up of pupils with all sorts of 
objectives. It is a generally accepted principle in vocational educa- 
tion that subjects such as English, history, and mathematics should 
be closely related to the vocation taught, but commercial education 
in our country is conceived primarily “as general education, and is 
administered chiefly from that viewpoint. Cities maintaining spe- 
cial commercial schools assert that academic work is closely related 
to the vocational aim of the schools. 
The most noticeable extension of program in commercial educa- 
tion appears to be the incorporation of the subject of salesmanship. 
Since the inquiry of 1912 a considerable number of cities have under- 
taken the work. The following cities report the maintenance of 
courses, or the intention of beginning courses with the current school 
year, to wit, Albany, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Colum- 
bus, Dayton, Louisville, Grand Rapids, Kansas City, Omaha, Pater- 
son, Philadelphia, Richmond, San Francisco, Spokane, Toledo, 
Washington, Springfield. 
NEED FOR CLEARER STATEMENT OF AIM. 
The insistent demand that educators formulate clearer statements 
of aim for educational enterprises is a source of some embarrassment 
to those who stand as sponsors for commercial education. The cross 
fires of school practice and of business demands render the present 
situation uncomfortable, at least. There is apparently some incom- 
patibility between a definition of aims in terms of business needs 
and in terms of school practice. As long as generalities were good 
currency in educational thought, the difficulties were not great. The 
college course in high schools prepared for college, the general courses 
for life, and the commercial course for business. Now comes the dis- 
concerting analyst and demands that this general statement of aim 
be explained. Commercial education, in truth, has had no clearer 
recognition of aim than have other school curricula, and is conse- 
quently no better prepared to make clear statements anent its pur- 
poses and methods. 
When commercial education was incorporated into public educa- 
tional institutions the same procedure was adopted that is usual when 
any added function is undertaken. This procedure constitutes, as 
it were, a simple formula, somewhat as follows: Of the subjects 
decided upon as a curriculum approximately 50 per cent will be 
selected to give conventional culture and general information; then 
a group of about 25 per cent is chosen for what is considered related 
work; finally, a component of about 25 per cent technical, applied, 
or vocational work is added to complete the compound. The council
-P-A-G-E-249
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 221 
of commercial teachers of Boston describes the typical situation as 
follows: 
Every secondary school in the city wherein commercial education is offered 
gives a general culture course in science, history, mathematics, English, and 
other languages, and in addition offers courses in commercial subjects. These 
latter may be divided into two groups: First, courses designed to liberalize the 
pupils’ attitude toward business; and, secondly, those courses that issue in 
skill in clerical pursuits. Hence the education now given in commercial courses 
in this city’s general schools is threefold: First, to enable a graduate to enter 
into the inheritance of all educated people and to understand the meaning of 
democracy, of citizenship, and of opportunity ; second, to give him a professional 
point of view that will enable him to see his work in the light of the whole 
and lift it out of drudgery in an awakened spirit of service; third, to enable him 
to succeed in his first humble position. 
This conception of commercial education in no way disturbs the 
equilibrium of the general high school, which is accustomed to apply 
the same formula to each new enterprise, and experiences no discom- 
fort in the assimilating process. The one-time alien, commercial 
education, became immediately naturalized and even undistinguishable 
from the former citizens. In the present indictment of the whole 
Nation, commercial education stands charged with the same faults 
as do the other members. Commercial education, coming as it did, 
and had to come, has developed no distinct individuality. It is not 
a thing, it is a part of a thing. It is wrong, consequently, to make 
an indictment against commercial education as a deliberate offender. 
It is fairer to state that commercial education was as effective in 
the beginning as the conditions, the appreciations, and the realiza- 
tions of the time permitted, and is as effective to-day, perhaps, as 
similar factors make possible. To summarize on this point, the 
commercial course, which is spoken of as a separate entity, is in 
reality quite generally not a distinctive curriculum. It is, on the 
contrary, almost invariably a collection of school subjects which 
might be classified as, first, general subjects, such as English, history, 
mathematics, foreign languages; second, more or less remotely related 
subjects, such as economics, commercial geography, business law; 
third, technical or vocational subjects, such as stenography and book- 
keeping. The general subjects absorb the greatest proportion of 
time—about 50 per cent. Even the special high schools of commerce 
are not so far removed from this situation as to be free from a similar 
characterization. 
It is obviously impossible to discuss the aim of the course as a 
whole, since there is found, when honestly analyzed, no course as 
a whole. It is possible to believe that there should be immediately 
created complete commercial courses, with definite and proper aims. 
At present, however, one can only analyze the aims of the parts of 
the course which are directly intended to fit pupils for business. 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
222 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
The aims of the technical or vocational subjects of so-called com- 
mercial courses—bookkeeping, stenography, office practice—are by 
no means unsound. There is honest and earnest effort to make 
these technical subjects function in the specific abilities needed in 
business. The schools to-day know more definitely than formerly 
about business needs, and they are certain to be much better informed 
in the immediate future, due to the intelligent investigation com- 
monly current. This receptive attitude on the part of commercial 
teachers gives promise of increasingly effective adjustment of tech- 
nical subjects to business needs. 
Commercial courses, if the term may be used somewhat loosely, 
have recognized four general needs for commercial employees: 
1. General office work, including various operations under the head 
of bookkeeping. 
2, Stenography, typewriting, and the operation of office machinery, 
such as the multigraph. 
8. Secretarial work, including stenography and typewriting. The 
position of secretary assumes an ability to exercise a degree of discre- 
tion and responsibility not included under the second classification. 
Preparation for the secretarial function in business can hardly be 
attempted in the regular high-school course. Secretaries are usually 
trained ‘in postgraduate courses or in college. 
4, Salesmanship, including a knowledge of stock and its care, as 
well as service to the customer. This last subject is only beginning 
to be recognized as a proper function of commercial education. 
The inadequacy of aim of commercial courses consists quite gen- 
erally in the failure to analyze out into clear detail the subdivisions 
to be found in each of these general aims. For instance, bookkeeping 
is taught largely under the assumption that each pupil must exer- 
cise on entering a business position the function of a head book- 
keeper. Bookkeeping pupils study the theory of bookkeeping with 
much detail and are led to develop rather highly the judgment facul- 
ties of the art. Since commonly the bookkeeping graduate begins in - 
business as a “ pieceworker,” he needs to have at the beginning of 
his work speed and accuracy in processes rather automatic in char- 
acter. His training in school has emphasized one aspect, namely, 
theory and power—deferred values—while his job emphasizes an- 
other phase, namely, speed and accuracy—immediate values. Our 
schools might profitably give more time to the emphasis of these 
immediate business values, though not neglecting the range of in- 
struction intended to equip the pupil for ultimate leadership. Quite 
generally, following the example of industry, many jobs in business 
are becoming specialized. Business is seeking workers in specific terms 
such as entry clerks, operators of the multigraph, dictaphone, billing 
machine, and adding machine. The schools turn out stenographers 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
    COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 223 
and bookkeepers with but slight acquaintance with special machines 
and almost no acquired speed and accuracy in the standard demands 
of business. While retaining much of the scope and the power 
values of business training, pupils should receive far more intensive 
practice in the unit demands of business. More training in speed 
and accuracy under the somewhat automatic conditions of real work 
will enable the student to adjust more quickly than at present. 
Schools are at present poorly equipped with commercial machinery 
to meet the demands of modern business training. In many large 
high schools where commercial students are numerous there are but 
one or two special machines, where there should be a dozen or more. 
Indeed, it is quite probable that many commercial courses are con- 
ducted with no other commercial machines than typewriters. Filing 
devices, now the standard equipment in business houses, are just be- 
ginning to appear in the schoolroom, and in woefully inadequate 
amounts. There is needed immediately a formulation of standard 
commercial equipment for commercial schools, so many typewriters 
per hundred commercial pupils, so many multigraphs, dictaphones, 
adding machines, filing cabinets. Where there are now samples of 
special machines to be seen by the pupil and perhaps operated but 
once or twice, there is need for the amount of equipment to permit 
practice under the fair conditions that give the pupil a chance to 
make adequate preparation for operating processes. 
TERMINOLOGY. 
It has peen suggested that there is need for giving attention to the 
terminology of commercial education, that present terms are too 
vague and misleading. It will be difficult to improve terminology 
until ideas of what it is intended to designate by terms become more 
clear; furthermore, the schools can hardly anticipate the practice of 
business in the creation of terms intended to indicate the subdivisions 
of labor being evolved in business houses. There is a confusion of 
terms in business at present. The term “clerk” is particularly indefi- 
nite as used in business and in census returns. Many persons are 
listed as “ clerks” by the census whose work may consist in addressing 
envelopes, counting and checking slips, listing slips, or doing general 
office work. The term may, on the other hand, signify high-grade 
work found under civil-service regulations. Again the term is ap- 
plied to sales persons, such as a grocery clerk or a dry goods clerk. 
Dr. David Snedden, formerly commissioner of education of Massachu- 
setts, suggests the following terms as possible of being descriptive of 
definite functions in business houses: (1) Stenographer, stenographer- 
clerk, stenographer-bookkeeper, stenographer-bookkeeper-clerk; (2) 
general clerk, special clerk, office operative; (3) sales girl, salesman,
-P-A-G-E-252
    224 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
indoor salesman, field salesman, bookkeeper,, accountant. The use 
of the term clerk in this suggestion seems more confusing than 
clarifying, however, and until there is some agreement it will be im- 
possible to make progress toward better definitions. 
The schools may more properly attempt to clarify the terminology 
‘ respecting the functions of commercial education and the varieties 
of school enterprises aiming at commercial preparation; for ex- 
ample, such terms, suggested again by Dr. Snedden, as commercial 
education, vocational commercial education, general commercial edu- 
cation, commercial arts education, business education, clerical educa- 
tion, course, curriculum, program, schedule, salesmanship. These 
particular suggestions assume the existence of types of commercial 
education which apparently are nonexistent. There is, for instance, 
hardly any strictly vocational commercial education; again, “ com- 
mercial arts education” would convey but little significance to those 
engaged in the conduct of commercial courses. There will be neces- 
sitated some general agreement on the adoption of any terms, but 
there is every reason why agreements should now be sought, at least, 
with respect to the terminology originating within the schools and 
descriptive of the purposes of the school. 
The chief means of giving commercial education in the United 
States is found in the commercial course in general or cosmopolitan 
high-schools. Economy is perhaps the main reason for this fact. 
Only in larger cities are there found several high-schools, so that 
most of our 500 communities of 10,000 population and over must 
attempt general as well as specialized instruction in but one high- 
school organization. Economy is not the only reason, however. 
Availability and convenience for pupils have caused many of the 
larger cities to adopt a system of cosmopolitan high-schools as the 
means of meeting the need for both general and special high-school 
education. Again, many communities, both large and small, are op- 
posed to the theory underlying separate and special high-schools. 
These communities believe that there is involved in the plan a social 
loss, in that divisive and undemocratic influences are set at work 
when the students with one vocational aim are segregated into 
separate institutions. 
Commercial courses in general high-schools, as has been indicated, 
are not what the name signifies, but are, rather, certain proportions 
_of general subjects combined with related and vocational subjects. 
The usual proportion of time allotted to the three groups of subjects 
is the result of compromise among several forces—school traditions, 
business demands, teachers’ abilities, convictions of the head masters, 
  
17The Vocational Education Survey of Minneapolis, 1916, contains an excellent state- 
ment of terms; see p. 600, etc. See also Bulletin, 1916, No. 21, Vocational Secondary 
Education.
-P-A-G-E-253
    
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 225 
etc. Commercial education under these conditions would be mate- 
rially improved if the commercial course were frankly segregated, 
controlling all its own resources, both general and specific. To do 
this effectively there would need to be created a curriculum or depart- 
ment head, who, subject to the principal, should order and direct all 
the activities and policies of the commercial course.t' Before such a 
plan is generally adopted there will need to be a decided change of 
conviction on the part of those who control present policies—princi- 
pals, superintendents, and boards of education. In many instances 
increased expenses will be involved because the present easy exchange 
and overlapping of teachers and equipment will need curtailing. In 
the desire to obtain more effective results in specialized educational 
attainments other than commercial, a similar plan of organization 
seems inevitable. The tendency of aim of students, as well as the 
necessities of vocational education, are toward specific ends. 
Changes of organization must be made if the schools are to recog- 
nize and effectively meet new conditions. It is entirely sound to hold 
that cosmopolitan high-schools may eventually consist of aggrega- 
tions of sharply differentiated courses, after the analogy of the uni- 
versity composed of a number of distinct schools and faculties. 
Such an organization will be more economical, both in cost of build- 
ings and in overhead and administrative charges, than are physically 
distinct schools, and the social and democratic advantages can be 
conserved in a large degree as well. 
SPECIAL COMMERCIAL SCHOOLS. 
Special commercial schools, known as high schools of commerce or 
commercial high schools, are increasing in number, though chiefly 
confined to the larger cities. The motives for their creation seem to 
be twofold: First, to provide additional high-school accommodations 
for a group of pupils known to be large; and second, to increase the 
effectiveness of commercial instruction through specialized endeavor. 
Special commercial high schools have been created in a much too 
ready-made fashion to have far outdistanced in effectiveness commer- 
cial courses in general high schools, and they differ not fundament- 
ally from the commercial course which was the projenitor. Facts for 
this assertion are not wanting. The study of commercial education 
in New York in connection with the Hanus inquiry gave ample evi- 
dence of such a situation in that city. Various recent surveys of 
  
1The commercial course should contain as many distinct commercial curricula as there 
are separate commercial vocations aimed at, e. g., office workers, stenographers, sales 
persons, secretaries. Commercial curricula should be separate for boys and girls. Bertha 
M. Stevens sets forth the reasons for this principle in the Cleveland Educational Survey, 
and the same contention was made in the New York School inquiry of 1912, section on 
commercial education.
-P-A-G-E-254
    
226 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
other cities indicate that the situation in New York is typical. An 
examination of the courses of study issued by special commercial 
high schools shows that no other situation is claimed by these schools 
themselves. The courses of study for commercial curricula in general 
high schools and those for commercial high schools do not materially 
differ. As late as 1911 President Edmund J. James, of the Univer- 
sity of Illinois, said: 
We have as yet established no independent college of commerce in the 
United States upon an adequate foundation. We have not even established any 
institution which may be fairly called a commercial high school, that is a 
school with an adequate equipment, with a differentiated curriculum, and with 
an opportunity under favorable conditions to show what it can accomplish in 
an educational and technical way. 
Unless it be assumed that the work done in the special high school 
is better, there is no reason to assume that the special school is making 
a greater contribution to commercial education than does the com- 
mercial course in the general high school. Practically the same regu- 
lations concerning the qualifications of teachers, size of classes, 
length of school day, diploma credits, and so on, are found in force 
for commercial courses and for commercial high schools. There are 
not found the differences that distinguish the character of the voca- 
tional industrial school from that of the manual training high school, 
namely, differences in physical equipment of school, differences in 
qualifications of teachers, product, length of school day, and the like. 
The reason for this situation is due undoubtedly to the fact that 
there is no generally accepted body of principles for commercial 
education yet formulated. Industrial education possesses a distinct 
advantage in this regard. Practice, belief, and possibly the evidence 
in so far as it is available, lead educators to hold that commercial 
education is primarily general education, and so commercial edu- 
cation of varying types is administered in the spirit and with the 
methods of general education. There is evidence of a closer analogy 
between the methods of industrial education and that of commercial 
education in some of the newer postgraduate courses in commercial 
training. The Boston Clerical School, established in 1914, shows 
in method and spirit a distinct contrast from other undertakings in 
the way of commercial education. This school attempts no general 
training whatsoever. It is assumed that the applicant has secured, 
before entrance, the amount. of general education which constitutes 
a satisfactory equipment for undertaking special work.+ In this 
school the methods, practices, standards, qualifications of teachers, 
school terms, and similar details are those of vocational education, 
and are not those of general education. The success of the idea 
exemplified in this and similar schools shows the advantage of 
  
1 This school is a graduate school; it is described in the 1915 report of the Commis- 
sioner of Education.
-P-A-G-E-255
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 227 
attempting general and special education successively, instead of 
simultaneously. Were it possible to proceed upon the principle of 
successive steps when attempting vocational education, the gain 
would likely be recognized by all, but the exigencies of the preserva- 
tion of majority opportunity are such that most secondary schools 
must be maintained with school programs which offer general and 
special subjects simultaneously. The postponement of the time when 
the child may elect special subjects has seemed to limit the oppor- 
tunities for those who must leave school early, and none may deny 
that this is a fair assumption. The simultaneous plan is a rough 
compromise which seems to meet varying conditions with greatest 
facility. Conservation of opportunity for the child, and efficiency 
of achievement, involve a conflict of method apparently, but as yet 
there has been developed on an extensive scale no better machinery 
than the simultaneous plan for meeting the twofold aim. The 
simultaneous plan immediately precipitates the question of values, 
such as the amount and relation of general subjects for cultural 
values, and the proportion and quantity of special subjects for spe- 
cific values. The present resultants, as seen in typical commercial 
courses or in commercial high schools, described above, are- easily 
understandable in the light of school traditions, social convictions, 
and, indeed, in some degree, perhaps, in the essential evidence. 
REFORMS. 
‘While the defenses are strong for present practices, it may readily 
be admitted that radical improvements are to be anticipated. Let 
us consider seriatim with respect to the threefold character of com- 
mercial courses some of the improvements that may be expected in 
each group. The general or nonvocational subjects are practically 
the same for commercial pupils as for others. The question naturally 
arises whether or not improvement. may be expected in this group. 
Those who deny that radical changes should be attempted here make 
a fairly good case, though it is by no means conclusive. Business is 
a profession rather than a trade. The business man deals with people 
more than with material. The same kind of general é¢ducation that 
is suitable for the future lawyer or doctor is that which is needed 
for the business man.’ Should the procedure of successive steps be 
followed in commercial education, there could be but little dispute 
about the propriety of the character and content of general subjects 
as a suitable foundation for future specialized training. Again, it 
is generally held by many educators that life appreciations, race 
inheritances, citizenship, culture, or what terms you will, are best

vocation (office work) is, therefore, general education, plus intensive training, plus 
advanced extension courses taken in connection with actual employment.”

attained by means of the systematic pursuit of those subjects con- 
stituting the nonvocational part of our special curriculums. Denial 
of this position involves one in the intricacies of the commonly 
accepted educational philosophy, a bootless task. Certain it is that 
no alternative formulation of principles or of subjects is sufficiently 
clear to-day to warrant a sudden or a radical change. Before leaving 
the old landmarks it will be necessary to perceive more clearly what 
more promising lands lie ahead. General or nonvocational subjects 
are being taught more vitally. There is, likewise, a better selection 
of material. The high-school pupil, whatever his objective, will find 
available a more interesting, more valuable, more intelligible offer- 
ing of nonvocational subjects than was the case a decade ago. 
The evident reform to-day lies not so much in the selection of the 
material offered for the nonvocational part of commercial education 
as in the methods used in teaching. The general subjects should not 
be taught purely on the basis of deferred values, like college prepara- 
tory work. These subjects should not be taught chiefly for abstract 
appreciation values; but, instead, ability to respond, to appropriate, 
and to associate should be constantly sought. The value of the 
career. motive can be made to operate even in general disassociated 
subjects. It is necessary, consequently, to segregate commercial 
pupils into distinct divisions (in general high schools) for purposes 
of nonvocational instruction. There is need for teachers who can 
appreciate the interests of commercial pupils, who know much of 
the environment for which the pupil is destined, and who sympathize 
with the aspirations and outlook of the pupil. Some of the best 
commercial schools are making progress in these matters, but the 
tendency is not uniform, for the established traditions of the general 
schools from which our teachers for special schools are drawn are too 
strong to be easily broken. 
RELATED SUBJECTS. 
The body of related technical subjects for commercial education 
is made up of such subjects as business correspondence, commercial 
geography, commercial law, economics, business organization. These 
subjects constitute, as it were, the general theory underlying com- 
mercial practice. No such controversy regarding fundamental 
character of purpose is found here as is true with respect to the non- 
vocational group of subjects. There are discernible two wings of 
practice with regard to related technical subjects, namely, one wing 
made up of those teachers who emphasize theoretical aspects of these 
subjects, and the other wing of those teachers who emphasize appli- 
cation phases. No particular counsel need be given regarding this 
situation, for the tendency is strong toward the second practice. 
Commercial geography is becoming less descriptive and locative, and
-P-A-G-E-257
  COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 229 
  more concrete and applicable. The pretentious name, commercial 
law, is being abandoned, and this subject is described as the ele- 
ments of commercial law, or “ comercial practice in relation to legal 
procedure.” Selections from economics are becoming more suitable 
for high-school pupils, with the consequent abandonment of the 
speculative phases of the subject common in college courses. New 
and better textbooks and illustrative material are facilitating the 
work of the teacher in improving the character of related technical 
instruction. 
The strongest element of the commercial courses is the vocational 
group of subjects. Criticism here arises over the failure to recognize 
additional functions of business, such as store service and salesman- 
ship and the failure to differentiate our training to keep pace with 
the rapid subdivision of work in business, involving usually the oper- 
ation of various kinds of office machinery. The historic commercial 
vocational subjects of our high schools have been stenography, type- 
writing, bookkeeping. Modern business needs workers with famil- 
iarity in these arts, but it needs in greater proportion workers 
trained in merchandising, salesmanship, and advertising. Business 
itself has but recently required preliminary skill in these kinds of 
service. The schools heretofore have trained the clerical workers, 
but business itself has trained or developed within its own organiza- 
tion the workers who render service other than clerical. Analysis of 
proportions of workers in standard business organizations show about 
15 per cent of the force is clerical, and about 35 per cent, often con- 
siderably more, is in the service section (selling, merchandise). 
Commercial subjects have not been suited for the training of workers 
for the major functions of business, but have, on the contrary, given 
preparation for those specialized duties of business which are too 
technical to be picked up in a haphazard fashion on the job. Analy- 
sis of typical business organizations shows that the majority of work- 
ers have pursued no commercial course in school.t ‘ 
More and more functions of business other than clerical are becom- 
ing too technical to be picked up effectively by the experience process, 
or perhaps it is truer to assume that the standard of service in busi- 
ness houses is rising. Again, the effect of the growing attention to 
efficiency and competitive influences as well unite to raise to higher 
planes functions once considered unskilled, or at least unimprovable 
by the processes of formal training. 
VOCATIONAL WORK. 
The vocational work of commercial courses needs a number of 
changes and expansions. The sexes should be separated, and courses,

different for boys and girls, provided. Commercial courses at pres- 
ent are planned primarily for girls, with the consequence that boys 
are not so successful in them and are not represented numerically in 
proper proportion. The present clerical courses should make pro- 
vision for the specialized demands of office procedure. Additional 
equipment, differing in character from that at present furnished, 
should be provided schools in sufficient quantity to offer our pupils 
opportunity to secure typical and standard experience. Our present 
provision (if there be one) is on a manual-training basis; needed 
equipment should be similar to that of the productive plant. Com- 
mercial education has too long been considered a cheap method of 
routing boys and girls through a high-school course. For larger 
values we must make larger investments. After all, the idea is not 
low cost of instruction, but effectiveness of result. 
It may be assumed that the amount and variety of specialized 
machinery recommended are beyond the resources of smaller com- 
munities, and that consequently only larger communities may be 
expected to heed the counsel here offered. It must be remembered 
that the standards of efficiency are the same for the small high school 
as for the large, and that small communities are as ambitious for the 
success of their boys and girls as are large communities. Small com- 
munities compete in the matter of furnishing effective general and 
college preparatory education, and justice to the commercial pupil 
may well compel a larger outlay for commercial courses, if proper 
standards are to be maintained. When it is apparent that the smaller 
community can not find the resources for proper commercial equip- 
‘ment there should be no pretense about the situation. The commercial 
course should attempt that portion of effective commercial prepara- 
tion which the resources of the school permit, and further steps in 
commercial training should be relegated to more competent and 
favored institutions. The pupil should be advised exactly as to addi- 
tional procedure necessary to secure complete training. In some 
communities it will be far better for the high school to cooperate with 
the private business college than to attempt an impossible competi- 
tion. The community should either furnish the funds for competi- 
tion with other educational agencies or else abandon the pretense; 
the good of the child should not be sacrificed for the sake of scholastic 
conceit. 
It has been suggested that the adoption of the cooperative or part- 
time plan might avoid large outlay for specialized commercial ma- 
chinery. Let it not be forgotten in this connection that a great deal 
of commercial preparation is undertaken in smaller communities 
when local business houses furnish no opportunities for competent, 
part-time plans. The student in such communities looks forward 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 231 
usually to commercial employment in some large city too remote for 
availability for part-time practice. Again, the adoption of part-time 
practices will need a great deal of expansion before it is practicable 
even for high-school pupils in the communities where big busi- 
ness houses are located. For 50 years office workers have been trained 
preliminary to entrance into business. Private business schools fur- 
nish a generous supply of workers with sufficient skill to begin pro- 
ductive work, so that the employer feels no inherent necessity of 
sharing the burden of training. The part-time suggestion is theoreti- 
cally and pedagogically correct, but it lacks availability as an imme- 
diate means of avoiding the necessity of maintaining the all-school 
plan with better and larger equipment as well as with better standards 
of achievement. Our present provisions for commercial education 
must be maintained under improved conditions, while the part-time 
plan is encouraged and expanded. We are in no position at present 
to burn our bridges. 
SALESMANSHIP COURSES, 
The incorporation of salesmanship into high-school commercial 
courses, a current phenomenon, is well under way and expanding 
rapidly. The impetus for this enterprise is coming largely from 
business. The National Retail Dry Goods Association has secured 
Mrs. Lucinda W. Prince, director of the school of salesmanship con- 
nected with the Women’s Educational and Industrial Union of 
Boston, also with Simmons College, to acquaint interested com- 
munities with the possibilities and advantages of the plan. The 
list of cities adopting a practical program for teaching salesmanship 
is already large. Among them are the following: Boston, Spring- 
field, Chicago, Minneapolis, Toledo, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and San 
Francisco. The valuable features of this plan involve, first, the se- 
curing of teachers technically and practically trained, the adoption of 
a part-time method of training pupils, and the active cooperation of 
business houses in the operation of courses. It will be interesting to 
note the influence which the part-time method adopted by salesman- 
ship will have upon older commercial subjects. In teaching clerical 
arts the schools have proceeded quite commonly upon the theory 
that effective practice work should be furnished within the school. 
Part-time office work may naturally be expected to receive en- 
couragement if the methods adopted for salesmanship prove su- 
perior. It is generally accepted by teachers of salesmanship that 
no method other than the cooperative, or part-time, can be successful, 
because the difficulties of providing actual conditions of work in 
the school for sales people are well-nigh impossible. Approximations
-P-A-G-E-260
  232 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
of similarity between real office plants and school imitations have 
been sufficiently close to render defensible achievements in the way 
of training clerical workers wholly within the school. The hope of 
getting better results promises to lie in the extension of part-time 
methods to all kinds of commercial training. 
INVESTIGATIONS, EXPERIMENTS, AND TENDENCIES, 
Investigations regarding the character, worth, and need of com- 
mercial education are coming from school surveys, surveys of the 
National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education, from 
chambers of commerce, and in rare instances from committees of 
commercial teachers.1_ Nearly all studies deal with the objective 
side of commercial education, namely, business needs and values. 
Little analysis has been made of the methods used in schools. Recom- 
mendations contained in these surveys deal chiefly with needed ex- 
pansions, such as the inclusion of salesmanship and with the lack 
of accomplishment in the three R’s, such as spelling, arithmetic, pen- 
manship; also the inculcation of general virtues, such as loyalty, 
neatness, accuracy, responsibility, good manners. Very little ad- 
verse comment is made upon the effectiveness of subjects pursued 
in the schools, unless the failure to achieve better results in ele- 
mentary subjects be a high-school as well as an elementary-school 
responsibility. The high schools are criticized in these investiga- 
tions not so much for what they are doing as for what they do not do. 
The emphasis which business puts upon personal qualifications as a 
business asset is impressive. Business men seem to assume that gen- 
eral moral and personal qualities should be developed in pupils by 
means of particular, specific courses. Modern pedagogy has hoped 
to secure these undoubted advantages indirectly by associations, by 
inspirations from literature, and by social contacts. The schools 
need to devote renewed energy to the securing by some method of 
better standards of the moral and personal qualities demanded in 
business. The common impression that high schools teach subjects 
and not pupils is encouraged by the kind of criticism made upon the 
high-school product. Undoubtedly the commercial teacher can use 
to advantage with commercial pupils the criticism of business men 
anent moral and personal qualities. The pupil may more readily 
apprehend the specific necessity of such virtues when associated 
with conditions of success in business. Here, again, the career motive

may be used as an incentive. It is quite likely that commercial 
teachers have seen more clearly the importance of technique as an 
achievement than the importance of attitude on the part of the pupil. 
The great advantage of the part-time method is that defects on the 
part of the pupil, personal and moral as well as technical, will be 
rendered more evident under real practice conditions, and can be 
corrected in the training period while in school. It is very doubtful 
whether the all-school method can furnish situations sufficiently real 
to bring out the exercise of needed moral and personal qualities. 
Even if the school should be able to present the occasions calling for 
the exercise of such qualities, it is doubtful whether the pupil .can 
be as much impressed by the precept and counsel of the school as he 
will be by contact with the rigorous and uncompromising standards 
of actual business. 
STANDARDS OF ACHIEVEMENT. 
Commercial educators are showing considerable interest in the 
question of standards for achievements in commercial education. 
Contrary to the assumption of many, the formulation of standards 
for educational achievements of any nature is a means of relief rather 
than an added burden. The old adage that worry, not work, kills 
men is particularly true of the teaching profession. The assurance 
that a teacher feels when his objective is clearly discernible is an 
incentive which furnishes a recompense for the additional effort 
involved. It is the uncertainty of what should be attained that takes 
the joy out of achievement. -No clear formulation of standards can 
be hoped for in commercial education until considerably more is 
known about business needs, and until the practices of commercial 
education approach a more common basis. Standard results in 
stenography and typewriting are roughly definable, principally 
through the efforts of typewriter placement agencies, where tests and 
ratings are maintained on a uniform basis. Standards in penman- 
ship are likewise coming into acceptation, through the issuance of 
measurement scales by educational experts and by the devices adopted 
by systems of penmanship, illustrated by the Palmer and Zaner 
methods. Competent standards for results in bookkeeping, office 
practice, and salesmanship are not yet available. A description of 
attempts toward formulation of standards in these subjects is con- 
tained in the chapter corresponding to this in the Report of the Com- 
missioner of Education for 1915, and nothing additional to this 
account can be described at the present time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
234 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
MISCELLANEOUS SUGGESTIONS AND COMMENTS, 
Various surveys and investigations mention the need of voca- 
tional guidance in commercial courses. The pupils looking for- 
ward to commercial occupations should be better informed concern- 
ing the conditions, the demands, the difficulties, and the opportuni- 
ties of business. Present teaching of commercial subjects does not 
bring sufficient attention to these matters. It emphasizes technique 
and theory, but does not effect a keen realization in the pupil of 
actual conditions of employment. Placement of commercial pupils 
by the schools is growing in effectiveness, but analysis of causes of 
placement shows that extraneous and fortuitous agencies are still 
more potent in the placement of pupils than are the organized efforts 
of the schools. The largest number of pupils are placed through the 
efforts of friends; in descending importance pupils secure positions 
through answering newspaper advertisements, through typewriting 
agencies, and only lastly through the school, which ought by rea- 
son of acquaintance with the capacities and aptitudes of the pupils 
to figure as the primary source of placement. It is known that a 
large proportion of commercial graduates now secure positions to 
which their training has not been directed and for which their 
capacities are not suitable. The importance of follow-up work of 
commercial graduates is being recognized and attempted, in so far as 
the meager resources available for the schools will permit. Fol- 
low-up work of graduates can be made of the highest value to com- 
mercial education in two ways: First, for the pupils, in securing 
convincing evidence about business needs and opportunities; second, 
for commercial teachers in obtaining accurate and definite informa- 
tion about the worth of commercial subjects. Commercial education 
has been obliged to estimate its values from the theoretical stand- 
point of the school, and not from the practical judgment of busi- 
ness. No time should be lost in furnishing our commercial schools 
with the resources necessary for the proper guidance, placement, and 
follow-up work of pupils. The plan will involve the increasing of 
present corps of instructors to the extent of adding placement secre- 
taries; or better still, a kind of teacher known as the vocational as- 
sistant should be secured, who is familiar with business conditions as 
well as with school environment, one who has the training and 
capacity to organize and conduct effectively the varied activities 
constituting the service comprised in the term vocational guidance. 
Commercial education can never in any sense be made vocational 
until this function is added. It is useless to state that present 
teachers should perform this service, for they do not possess the   
4+“ Women in Office Service,” Women’s Educational and Industrial Union.

  time, the opportunity, or the knowledge of the problem to achieve 
effective results. 
Commercial education to-day needs the kind of national leadership 
that characterizes other educational effort, such as is found in indus- 
trial educational, manual arts education, college preparatory educa- 
tion. Commercial education to-day lacks any acknowledged lead- 
ership; nor does it possess any recognized philosophy or body of 
principles. No agreement of a national character has yet appeared. 
In 1918 a committee on business education was appointed by the 
National Education Association. No report was ever issued by the 
committee. In 1916 a new committee was appointed by the National 
Education Association, with Dr. Cheesman A. Herrick, president 
of Girard College, chairman. Administrators of commercial courses 
will look forward with considerable interest to the report of this 
committee, for the time has apparently arrived in commercial edu- 
cation when leadership will have influence and when principles will 
receive consideration. It is hardly necessary to state that at pres- 
ent there is no national’ association studying principles affecting 
commercial education and that there is little constructive literature 
on the subject. This situation is not anomalous when it is remem- 
bered that commercial education is conceived primarily as general 
education, and that consequently directors of commercial education 
are concerned with the principles, the literature, and the agreements 
of general education. There are various flourishing associations of 
teachers of special commercial subjects, such as stenography and 
bookkeeping, and there are numerous periodicals dealing with the 
teaching of these subjects. There is much discussion among teachers 
of commercial subjects about systems of stenography, textbooks in 
bookkeeping, methods in typewriting. Commercial education to- 
day is a loose confederacy of school subjects, general and special, 
in a high-school curriculum. After the metaphor describing the 
political condition of this country before the formation of the Union, 
these “stout staves” need binding irons to make a vessel which shall 
take shape, hold together, and constitute a more useful educational 
instrument. 
It is unfortunate that the service of State and National educational 
commissions is as yet unavailable for commercial education. The 
report of the National Commission on Vocational Education did not 
recommend commercial education for national subsidy, on the theory 
that communities were already vigorously committed to the support 
of this kind of endeavor. Commercial education, while not in need 
of the stimulation of financial support, does need extraneous directive 
influences, such as National and State commissions could furnish. 
Left wholly to community control, these promise to continue unduly

the variety of practice and the inadequacy of conception which have 
characterized commercial education in the past. Recent influences 
have brought into prominence two dominant and somewhat con- 
flicting educational forces, one of which may be termed general edu- 
cation and the other industrial education. Vacillating between 
these two poles, commercial education promises to go first in one 
direction and then in the other. Commercial education, however, 
should blindly imitate neither, but from its nature and function 
should become a distinct entity, with its own body of principles, phil- 
osophy, practice, and leadership.

AGRICULTURE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The Bureau of Education attempted during the spring of 1916 
to collect definite and complete information concerning the teaching 
of agriculture in public high schools and in special agricultural 
schools of secondary grade. A tabulation has been made of all 
schools reporting and will be published later as a bulletin. The

  This summary does not include special schools of agriculture main- 
tained by the State colleges of agriculture on the college campus. 
Schools of this type are maintained by the State agricultural col- 
leges of California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, 
Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, and Washington (school 
of science). Agricultural courses of secondary grade are given to 
special students in 20 other State colleges of agriculture. 
The school instruction in elementary agriculture in all parts of the 
United States is becoming more and more closely correlated each year 
with boys’ and girls’ agricultural club work. While it is true that 
most of the club work in the United States is under the cooperative 
direction of the United States Department of Agriculture and the 
State colleges of agriculture, there is much done by education authori- 
ties independently and also by education authorities in cooperation 
with the agricultural colleges. A report on the work of the De- 
partment of Agriculture is given later in this chapter. The work in 
Cook County, Ill., may be cited as an instance of effective teaching 
of agriculture through methods similar to those employed in the 
club work, but independent of the Department of Agriculture or the 
State college of agriculture. 
In the Cook County plan all pupils 10 years of age and over in the 
schools under the supervision of the county superintendent are re- 
quired to take a course in school-home projects as a part of their 
regular school work. The projects are not all agricultural; in addi- 
tion to the field-and-garden project, the poultry project, and the cow- 
testing project there are sewing and cooking projects, a business 
project, and a music project. All projects are under the supervision 
of the county superintendent, his five field assistants, known as 
“country-life directors,” and the regular teachers, a number of whom 
are retained during the summer, giving their entire time to visiting 
the homes and supervising the projects. The five country-life direc- 
tors spend part of their time during the year and all of their time 
during the summer visiting the homes to inspect the home projects.
-P-A-G-E-267
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 239 
A majority of the pupils, both boys and girls, are in the field and 
garden club project. The general plan is as follows: A plat is se- 
lected by each pupil, in consultation with his parents, as near the 
house as possible, varying in size from one-tenth to 1 acre, accord- 
ing to the child and the crop to be raised. The amount of rent to be 
paid is fixed, the pupil being required to pay rent whether the crop is 
on land owned by the parent or not. The child then must stake out 
and measure and draw a diagram of the plat. This is verified by the 
country-life director on his first visit. The child and the father de- 
cide what to plant. The cultivation is done by the child, under the 
joint direction of the parent and the country-life director. The crops 
raised are usually marketed by the fathers with their own garden 
truck, although in several instances boys market their own produce. 
An itemized account of all receipts and expenditures must be kept by 
the child as directed by the county director. Notebooks are furnished 
by the county superintendent; each pupil includes in his book a 
diagram of his plat, an expense account showing all receipts and 
expenditures, and a chronological record of the work of cultivation, 
including the time spent in labor. When the crop has been disposed 
of, the accounts are balanced and the net profit or loss computed. 
The net profits belong to the pupil and must be accounted for in the 
notebook. They are to be banked, loaned, or wisely expended, as 
determined by the parents. Each pupil is required then to write an 
account or story on ‘his school-home project. The notebook, essay 
records, and reports are all taken into account in determining the 
pupil’s standing. 
School achievement credits are granted on recommendation of the 
country-life directors to pupils who complete their project, earn the 
minimum net profit fixed by the county superintendent, and do their 
work in a satisfactory way. 
In the poultry project each child must have a minimum of six 
fowls kept separate from his parents’ poultry. Records are kept in a 
notebook furnished by the county superintendent; there must be an 
exact record of the egg production by the fowls. When a fowl is 
killed for eating purposes, the member credits himself with the mar- 
ket value of the fowl. The project runs for a full year. 
The cow-testing project is open only to boys 12 years of age and 
over. Each member must select two of his father’s cows for testing; 
the tests run for a period of four months. Samples of milk from 
each cow are brought to school on the same day of each week for 
testing; the Babcock method is used. Members must ascertain, by 
weighing, the amount of milk produced by the cows under test on 
the day samples are tested. Pupils must ascertain the weight of the 
different foods consumed by the cow under test on the day samples 
are tested. The records kept in the notebook furnished for this pur-

pose show the date of each test, the weight of milk, per cent of but- 
ter fat, price of butter, value of butter, pounds of different feed con- 
sumed, market price of different feeds consumed, value of feed con- 
sumed, net profit or loss. 
At the close of each school year an annual meeting is held of the 
pupils who have completed satisfactorily their project work. It is 
called “Achievement Day,” and during the public exercises achieve- 
ment credits are awarded to all pupils recommended by the county- 
life directors. Definite credits are given according to fixed points. 
When 10 credits have been earned, the achievement emblem is 
awarded; this is a four-pointed gold star encompassed by a circle 
with the letters “S. A. C.” (School Achievement Credits) on the 
emblem. 
The work in Cook County has been in operation for five years. It 
was inaugurated to vitalize the work of the rural schools by putting 
into practical application the principle “Study what you have need 
of, or soon will need, and learn by doing.” It has been successful 
from every standpoint. 
As an example of club work done in cooperation by education 
authorities and the State agricultural college, the work in Oregon 
may be cited. The State law requires the work to be done under 
the direction of the State superintendent of public instruction, who 
employs two fieldworkers to devote their time to the organization 
and instruction of industrial clubs, assisting in organizing, holding, 
and judging local and county school fairs, and any and all other 
work in connection with industrial education. In all of this the 
field workers cooperate with the agricultural college. All enroll- 
ments of club members are filed with the college, and bulletins of 
instruction are printed by the different departments and sent out 
to the club members or to the county school boards and teachers, who 
distribute them to the club members. The plan seems to be satis- 
factory. It secures the cooperation of the school authorities and 
teachers, and correlates the work very closely with the other work 
of the public school. In Washington State a somewhat similar plan 
is followed. A State leader is employed under the director of exten- 
sion of the State agricultural college. By agreement with the State 
department of education the college directs the club organization and 
instruction, and the State department has charge of the fairs. 
Direct connection with the school is secured through county super- 
intendents, as well as through the State department. Agriculture 
is a required subject in the public schools. Each eighth-grade pupil 
must take either agriculture, domestic science, or manual training 
before receiving a diploma admitting him to high school. The State 
department of education allows credit to boys and girls who have 
completed satisfactorily agricultural club work under the direction 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 241 
of the college, the amount of credit being one-half of. the total re- 
quirement in agriculture. 
The question of the administration of the agricultural club work 
in the various States is receiving more and more attention There 
is marked difference in opinion as to whether the administration in 
each State should be a function of the State department of educa- 
tion or of the State agricultural college, and if in the college, 
whether in the department of agricultural extension teaching or in 
the department of agricultural education. The present movement 
for agricultural clubs started in the agricultural extension teaching 
movement purely as a means of extension teaching to improve agri- 
cultural production and the expense of maintaining the work has 
been borne very largely by the colleges from funds received from the 
Federal Government for extension teaching purposes. For boys not 
in school it will remain undoubtedly an extension teaching move- 
ment; for those in school, however, it is fast growing away from an 
extension teaching movement and becoming an important factor in 
their general education. There seems to be a rapidly growing 
opinion that for pupils attending school the club work, when under- 
taken, should be a definite part of the regular school work, and that 
it should be under the administration of the educational authorities, 
with the cooperation of the agricultural colleges.. The colleges 
should furnish the technical agricultural information necessary for 
conducting the work. The club work would then become the prac- 
ticum for the school instruction in agriculture. If agriculture is to 
be taught in elementary schools, some kind of practice work is nec- 
essary, and the club work or some other form of home-project work 
seems to be the best kind. Incidentally, it would still have value as 
extension teaching, as does the home-project agriculture in voca- 
tional agricultural schools. 
The Bureau of Education attempted recently to collect opinions 
from persons interested directly in the club movement and in the 
public schools relative to this question. A majority of the men 
employed by the agricultural colleges favor the retention of the 
club work as extension teaching in the college; there is strong opin- 
ionion to the contrary, however. 
Dr. L. H. Bailey, formerly dean of the New York State College 
of Agriculture, in a chapter on “ Boys’ and girls’ contest clubs” in 
a recent book,’ declares: 
The fundamental consideration is that all this kind of work is educational. 
It is not primarily agricultural work, not undertaken directly to improve the 
farming of a region. The primary consideration is its effect on the child. 
If we can not accept these propositions then I should be in favor of giving 
up the boys’ and girls’ contests. 
  
1 York State Rural Problems.
-P-A-G-E-270
  242 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
It is legitimate to use domestic animals and crops for the primary purpose 
of improving and advertising the agriculture of a region, but we must not 
use children this way. Animals and crops are agricultural products; children 
are not agricultural products. 
If these positions are granted we shall agree that this contest work between 
children must be put more and more into the hands of those who are trained 
in education and who carry the responsibility before the public for educational 
effort. I think that this kind of work should be a part of the public-school 
system, On their own account schools must take up this and similar work 
if they are to secure the best results for themselves and to cover their own 
fields. The organizing of laboratory work at home under the direction of the 
teacher is one of the most important means of tying the schools and the homes 
together and making the school a real part and parcel of the community. 
When this time shall come the work with crops and domestic animals and 
home practices will be a regular part of the school day, incorporated insever- 
ably with the program of education. We must hope for the time when there 
shall be no necessity for the separate organization of such clubs, the school 
having reached and stimulated the situation on every farm and in every home. 
It is sometimes said that the agricultural agents organize the contest work 
better than the teachers. Perhaps; but the work is essentially school work, 
nevertheless, and we should now be looking for results in the long future. 
This question is but a part of the general question of what should 
constitute a State system of agricultural education and how it should 
be administered. President K. L. Butterfield, of the Massachusetts 
Agricultural College, in his annual report for 1916, expresses what 
seems to be an agreement with the most progressive thought on this 
question when he says that the agricultural college should be an 
organic part of the State system of agricultural education, that it 
can not and should not try to administer the system, but that it 
should be in very intimate association with the controlling factors; 
that the college should have definite responsibilities in the organiza- 
tion of the materials and in the formulation of the methods used in 
all grades of agricultural instruction, in the preparation of teachers, 
and in assisting to correlate the parts of the system. Every State 
college of agriculture is, of course, interested in the problem. Each 
should have a part in the plan and ought to make some real contri- 
bution to it and to its continuing success. The following is ab- 
stracted from President Butterfield’s report: 
SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF A STATE SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
1. It should have definiteness of aim—Fundamentally, it is the province of 
agricultural education to help solve the rural problem. The rural problem is 
partly a question of securing better farm practice; partly a question of or- 
ganizing better farm business; partly a question of developing a better farm 
life. In a word, the rural problem consists in the improvement or progress 
of the rural people. Many forces may be invoked for this improvement, such 
as education, socialization, organization, even religion; but the problems are 
solved by men and women. Hence, the training of rural problem solvers is the 
main purpose of agricultural education,
-P-A-G-E-271
    AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 243 
2. It should be inclusive in its human reach.—It will reach all ages, from 
the youngster in the grades to the graduate student in the college. It will 
provide instruction for those out of school, both young and old. With respect 
to emphasis, it will serve chiefly the people who must make a living by farm- 
ing, but it must also train specialists or professional experts. Nor will it neg- 
lect people of the city; many of them as well as the country folk need agri- 
culture. 
8. It should be broad in its vocational scope.—It will deal at the bottom with 
with the technical or productive process, but it will also concern itself with 
the management of the farm; lay large stress upon such economic questions 
as access to the land, credit, cooperation; and it will emphasize a fuller com- 
munity life, through the home, health, recreation, beauty, morals. 
4, It should be comprehensive in its activities—Teaching is the backbone of 
any system of education, but research and experimentation are vital to good 
teaching, particularly in such subjects as agriculture. And then it will ex- 
tend itself not only to the pupils in the schools, but to every person on the land. 
5. It should be liberal in its spirit—It will emphasize the dignity of voca- 
tion. Vocation is a means of social service as well as an opportunity to make a 
living. It will impress upon the student mind the idea that vocation is also 
both a means of intellectual development and a great factor in the building 
of individual character. Vocational education will recognize that the public 
schools must assist in fitting boys and girls for citizenship in the largest sense, 
as well as in giving them capacity to meet the problems of their personal life. 
6. It should be complete in its correlation of parts.—This is to some degree 
a question of the division of labor between institutions. It is also a question 
of administrative responsibility clearly defined. It means cooperative planning 
among all the different institutions. 
7. It should be an organic part of the State educational system. 
THE GROUPS OF PERSONS TO BE REACHED IN A STATE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION, 
1. Pupils in the “grades” of the public schools——The material which enters 
into agriculture in its simpler forms is capital material for general educational 
use among pupils ranging in age from 8 to 14. They may profit thereby not be- 
cause they wish to become farmers, but because they may gain a part of their 
education by means of agricultural school gardens, home gardens, nature study, 
poultry clubs, and corn clubs; those various types of work with plants and 
animals that are the beginning of agriculture should become an organic part 
of our school system, and available to all pupils under 14 years of age. 
2. High-school pupils desiring general agriculture—The opportunity for edu- 
cation by means of agriculture should be carried through the high school, with 
elective courses, finding a place alongside the other subjects in the course. 
The teaching should be very concrete and practical and should bring the pupils 
into working touch not alone with these processes by which plants and animals 
and all nature’s forces are subordinated to human uses but with the processes 
by which the business and life of rural people are related to the business and 
life of the nation as a whole. 
3. “Boy farmers.’—We come now to those classes of pupils who are to be 
offered agricultural study rather definitely for the purpose of future vocational 
activities. The first group may theoretically comprise boys and girls under 
14 years of age. Personally I question whether “ vocational ” agriculture should 
begin before 14. I have been impressed by the fact that Germany, as well as 
the other European countries which have patterned their educational systems 
after Germany, has declined to permit the serious study of vocational agricul- 
ture by boys and girls under 14 years old.  
-P-A-G-E-272
  244 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
4. The young agriculturists—Numerically speaking, the most important 
group of pupils who should be provided with facilities for definite training in 
agriculture for vocational purposes are those between 14 and 17 or 18 years 
of age. The facilities for this group will be twofold, first, agricultural depart- 
ments of public high schools more or less highly differentiated, and second, a 
system of county, district, or special schools. The “ junior extension service ” 
of the agricultural college, which, if fully developed, will be an expansion of 
the present successful system of our boys’ and girls’ agricultural clubs, prom- 
ises to be of great value also. Moreover, it has been proved that a course in 
agriculture or home economics given one hour a day for four years, in con-- 
nection with other high-school subjects, can be made to yield remarkably suc- 
cessful training for boys and girls preparing for agricultural practice and rural 
home life. But I predict that the Massachusetts plan of agricultural depart- 
ments, in which the pupil gives about half his time to agriculture, will become 
a very important and vital part of our State system of agricultural education— 
perhaps in some respects its characteristic feature—so far as pupils of high- 
school age are concerned. 
5. Candidates for county agricultural schools.—I believe in the county or 
district agricultural school, and that a complete system of agricultural educa- 
tion in any State must provide for a number of these schools. There are objec- 
tions to them. They are rather expensive. If great care is not taken they 
may encroach upon the work of the agricultural college. Their final place 
in the system of agricultural education is likely to be in advanced and 
specialized work for pupils of high-school age who have had perhaps two years 
in the agricultural department of the high schools, or for those who have 
finished the work of such a department, but are not prepared for college. 
6. The college student of agriculture—There is next that group of pupils 
from 18 years upward who will attend the agricultural college. Many of these 
will go back to farming; others will go into expert service in connection with 
agriculture. Probably there will always be a number of students graduating 
from an agricultural college who will never be directly connected with agri- 
culture, for this is precisely what occurs in nearly all professional schools, in- 
cluding law and even medicine. But in the main the agricultural college is to 
be considered a professional school, or at least a semiprofessional school, and it 
is here that there is an opportunity for the training for leadership in solving 
the larger problems of agriculture and country life. 
7. The graduate student.—In connection with the agricultural college there 
is room for the development of a graduate school of agriculture. Not only 
room, but great need, for neither research nor teaching can be vitalized or 
pushed to its full measure of development unless constantly reinforced by 
men of the highest training. 
8. The demand for short courses.—I am convinced that the time has arrived 
when these short courses must be developed more fully and fitted more com- 
pletely into the State system of agricultural education. The men at the head 
of the agricultural departments of our public schools, and especially those 
who are connected with the county agricultural schools, are thoroughly con- 
vinced that many of the pupils of these schools wish to attend an agricultural 
college for a period of from three months to an entire year, for the purpose 
of coming into contact with the recognized authorities in the various agricul- 
tural specialties that are emphasized in a well-regulated agricultural college. 
To such pupils this work would be a sort of graduate course. It would bring 
them into contact with the wider reaches of the subject, with the best prepared 
teachers, with the largest equipment, and with the most complete resources for 
agricultural investigation and instruction. There are, moreover, a great many
-P-A-G-E-273
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 245 
adults who would like special work in summer or winter who can not take our 
regular courses. 
9. The city man and the soil—In a State like Massachusetts, where the 
urban population constitutes nine-tenths of the people, there is rapidly coming 
on a demand for agricultural instruction to persons who are not immediately 
connected with agriculture, and perhaps who do not intend ever to be con- 
nected with agriculture as an industrial pursuit. The homestead commission 
has aroused interest in the problems of teaching agriculture to families, in 
the development of garden cities and in vacant-lot cultivation in the cities. 
There is also an increasing number of men and women, both among the wage 
earners and among the salaried men in the cities, who wish to become farmers, 
but who cannot take advantage of present institutions for agricultural 
education, 
10. A schooling for the youth at work on the farm.—In spite of all we can 
do through institutions, through formal schooling, there will always be a very 
large proportion of youths out of school who still need, and will take advantage 
of, some plan for continuing their agricultural education beyond school days. 
We need, then, extension schools in connection with our public school system, 
chiefly, perhaps, in connection with agricultural departments of public high 
schools and with the county agricultural schools, which shall during the 
evenings of the long winter give very definite instruction in agriculture, home 
economics, and country life to the boys and girls who cannot attend the regular 
day school. 
11. The man in the furrow.—What has been said with reference to youths 
is even more true of adults. The extension service of the agricultural college 
has demonstrated the hunger for information that exists among the great 
masses of the people, and this work must be kept up, organized, systematized, 
and better related to the other agencies. These adults will also be reached 
more or less by the administrative boards already referred to. 
A SUGGESTION CONCERNING THE NECESSARY MACHINERY FOR AGRICULTURAL 
EDUCATION. 
I. The Public Schools. 
Presenting agricultural material as one means of education, through— 
1. Boys’ and girls’ agricultural clubs: Supervision by farm bureaus and 
the college. 
2. School subjects: Nature study; elementary agriculture (?). 
3. Courses in agriculture in the high school: Three to five hours per week 
for one to four years. 
Il. The Public School. 
Teaching agriculture for vocational ends, through— 
1. Agricultural departments of the high school: To reach pupils 14 to 16 
years of age and 16 to 18. 
2. Continuation and extension schools: In connection with public high 
schools, to reach pupils no longer enrolled in the public schools, ages 
14 to 18. 
8. Agricultural education for families, as proposed by the homestead com- 
mission. 
4. The public schools as centers for extension work in agriculture and 
country life, carried on by the farm bureaus and the college.

    246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
Ill. County or District Agriculéural Schools. 
1, General and specialized agriculture: Temporarily for boys 14 to 18. 
2. Specialized courses in agriculture, such as poultry husbandry, dairy hus- 
bandry, pomology, etc., as the eventual purpose for boys 16 to 18; 
these courses correlate with the work of the agricultural departments 
of the high schools. 
8. Extension work, in cooperation with the county farm bureaus and 
improvement leagues; this should be coordinated closely with the work 
of the county schools on the one hand, and with the agricultural college 
on the other. |

(a) Research. 
(b) Experimentation and testing. 
(c) Cooperative studies in agricultural resources, 
2. Teaching. 
(a) The four-year course for a degree.

will parallel agricultural work throughout the whole system. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AT MEETINGS OF THE YEAR. 
Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment 
Stations.—The twenty-ninth annual convention of the Association of 
American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations was held 
at Berkeley, Cal., August 11 to 18, 1915. While the convention took 
no action of outstanding importance, there were fully the usual num- 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 247 
ber of matters of special interest to the land-grant colleges and the 
various departments of their work. 
The solidarity of the land-grant colleges was emphasized in the 
presidential address of President E. A. Bryan, who pointed out the 
national character of these colleges, their common interests and pur- 
pose, and the place they have occupied in education. Because to- 
gether they constitute a national system of education he urged a 
closer relation of the national Bureau of Education to them in help- 
ing them to work out their mission; and he advocated a, national 
Department of Education, presided over by a secretary. 
The correlation of the college of agriculture of Ohio State Uni- 
versity with other institutions in the State was described by Dean 
Alfred Vivian. The plan has now been in operation for two years 
and has proved quite satisfactory. It stimulates both of the partici- 
pating institutions, and it has some advantages for the student, per- 
mitting him to take his elementary course in small classes, often at 
less cost, and to be an alumnus of the arts college as well as of the uni- 
versity. It was explained that such students are found to more 
readily take up graduate work. 
A comprehensive report as to the preparation of extension workers 
was made, based on about 100 replies to a questionnaire sent to agri- 
cultural educators, extension directors and others in charge of ex- 
tension work, and others interested therein. The committee advo- 
cated that a considerable number of the agricultural colleges offer 
undergraduate courses for the purpose and that a few make special 
provision for graduate instruction. 
In one of the general sessions Dr. H. L. Russell described a plan 
for promoting advanced study through exchange with other colleges. 
This had in mind the postgraduate preparation of men from the 
institution, and the purpose of the plan as explained was to “ avoid 
inbreeding” and to promote “cross breeding” with other institu- 
tions. Dr. Russell believed that not more than one-half of the per- 
manent staff above the assistant grade should be chosen from the 
home institution. At the University of Wisconsin assistants are re- 
quired to go elsewhere for advanced sttidy; and to provide for this 
and meet the financial difficulty which often confronts young men, 
an exchange relationship has been established with certain other col- 
leges. This cooperative arrangement provides for mutual exchange 
of staff members, with opportunities afforded for study. The descrip- 
tion of this plan developed so much interest that the paper was re- 
ferred to the committee on college organization and policy, with a 
view to arranging for a consideration of its suggestions. 
American Association for the Advancement of Agricultural Teach- 
ing.—The sixth annual meeting of this association was held in  
-P-A-G-E-276
248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
Berkeley, Cal., August 10. The most important feature of the pro- 
gram was a report of the standing committee on “The use of land 
in connection with agricultural teaching,” prepared by the States 
Relations Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. This 
was based upon a study of the home-project method as followed in 
teaching agriculture in the secondary schools of New York. In this 
method each pupil chooses a project for home study before March 1, 
and after this date most of the time set aside for laboratory work is 
devoted to the projects. Part of the time is spent in school in refer- 
ence reading, the drawing of plans, and such other work as may be 
done to advantage, and as the summer approaches the project work 
gradually replaces class work. Projects may be grouped according 
to their chief aim, as production projects, the chief purpose of which 
is to produce an agricultural product at a profit; demonstration 
projects, where the chief aim is to demonstrate improved methods or 
materials; experimental projects, where there is uncertainty as to 
results; or improvement projects, where students may undertake the 
improvement of plants and animals, the home grounds, or the farm 
in general with little hope of immediate returns. 
National Education Association—Rural and agricultural educa- 
tion received unusual attention at the meeting at Oakland, Cal., 
August 16-28. 
In a paper before the Department of Rural and Agricultural 
Education, C. H. Lane defined the meaning of high-school extension 
work in agriculture. This comprises all educational efforts at the 
homes and on the farms of the people and also such work at the 
school itself as centers directly in interests away from the school. 
Community work in agriculture is a necessary part of the school that 
is maintained by the people for the service of the people. He main- 
tained that before attempting extension work, however, the teacher 
should study the agriculture of the community, the cnaracter of the 
soil and improvements, systems of farming, the class of farmers, and 
the condition of the rural one-teacher schools and of the churches. 
The teacher may then extend his work by supervising the home- 
project work with his pupils, directing agricultural instruction in 
the grades, organizing and following up boys’ and girls’ clubs, acting 
as organizer for the one-week short course for farmers, offering per- 
sonal counsel and advice on certain days to farmers of the com- 
munity, assisting and organizing farmers’ reading courses, directing 
school agricultural exhibits locally and at the county fair, and 
through Saturday meetings with farmers and by farm visitation. - 
He should also have an office in the high school in which facts per- 
taining to the agriculture of the community may be assembled and 
where they will be available for the use of any person who desires 
them. The agricultural teacher would thus be an organizer of in-
-P-A-G-E-277
    
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 249 
formation and of movements and a director of agricultural enter- 
prises within his school community. 
American Association for the Advancement of Science—The two 
features of the meeting of the section of agriculture of the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science at Columbus, Ohio, 
during the Christmas holidays, were the address of the retiring vice 
president, Dr. L. H. Bailey, and a symposium on “The relation of 
science to meat production.” Dr. Bailey’s address was in a sense a 
continuation of his vice presidential address of last year, the subject 
being “ The forthcoming situation in agricultural work.” 
To maintain the proper external influences and to carry forward 
the work through other agencies than the State agricultural colleges, 
Dr. Bailey advised the extension of rural teaching founded on agri- 
culture into general and liberal arts institutions “to the end that 
they may be made a means of culture, a force for training in citizen- 
ship, and a broadening influence in the institutions”; and he pointed 
to the opportunity for a new kind of agricultural institution of very 
high grade, founded on private endowment. Of the latter he said: 
This will be a coordinating and leadership institution, teaching advanced 
and special students in some subjects, engaging in research, but in the main 
making its contribution as a place for conference, for consideration of the large 
civie and social relations of rural life, and as a voluntary meeting place on 
common and neutral ground for all the forces that lie in the situation. . 
Such an institution would afford “better opportunities than the 
land-grant or other State-named institutions are likely to give the 
freest men.” It would “conserve the independence and the oppor- 
tunities of the boldest prophets.” 
Pan American Scientific Congress—The Second Pan American 
Scientific Congress, held at Washington, D. C., from December 27, 
1915, to January 8, 1916, devoted part of the time at the disposal of 
the section on education to agricultural education. 
The papers on agricultural education consisted quite largely of de- 
scriptions of present plans of organization. Dr. A. C. True, of the 
States Relations Service, reviewed the system of education for the > 
baccalaureate degree in the agricultural colleges of the United States 
and subsequently described the extension work under way. President 
A. M. Soule, of the Georgia College, discussed the extensive work be- 
ing carried on by that institution in agricultural extension. Some of 
the national aspects of agricultural education were also taken up by 
President Waters, who advocated specifically the teaching of agri- 
culture as an informational subject to all school children, both urban 
and rural. 
Prof. José Commallonga y Mena, of the University of Habana, 
presented a review of the history and status of agricultural educa- 
tion in Cuba, Director Crawley explained the organization and work
-P-A-G-E-278
  250 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
of the Cuban Experiment Station, and Dr. Alberto Boerger that of 
the agricultural station of La Estanzuela in Uruguay. It may be of 
interest to note that the chief difficulties enumerated by Director 
Crawley were the scarcity of trained Cubans to carry on the work 
and the need of an extension system for bringing the results directly 
to the farmer. Research in Uruguay, it was stated, has dealt espe- 
cially with studies of the laws of inheritance of plants and animals, 
grain breeding and culture, and the adaptation of plants to Uru- 
guayan conditions, and international cooperation in adaptation work 
was suggested as feasible. 
The status of forestry instruction in this country was reviewed by 
Prof. J. W. Toumey, of the Yale Forest School, who regarded the 
provision of vocational training of secondary grade and opportunity 
for demonstration work as more essential at the present time than the 
further development of advanced technical instruction in forestry. 
A paper by President K. L. Butterfield, of the Massachusetts Col- 
lege, called attention to the responsibility of the agricultural college 
through its extension service in the present transition period of 
American agriculture to correlate the various agencies designed to 
bring about a more complete organization of agriculture and country 
life, but insisted that education and not management must be the 
province of the agricultural college or other institutions in this and 
related matters. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES. 
Australia.—The first teachers’ farm school in Victoria was held in 
September, 1915, at the State Research Farm, Werribee, by the State 
departments of agriculture and education. In the opening address 
of the school Dr. S. S. Cameron, director of agriculture, stated that 
it was well known that the agricultural education work carried out 
in Victoria had been somewhat disjointed, and that while the scheme 
provided for (1) elementary agricultural instruction in about 500 of 
the elementary schools, (2) more advanced work in the 12 agricul- 
tural high schools, (3) a three-year diploma course devoted solely to 
agriculture in the agricultural colleges at Dookie and Longerenong, 
and (4) a full university course for a science degree in agriculture, 
thus apparently offering an opportunity of advancing stage by stage 
from the elementary school to a university graduation in agricultural 
science, so far there was no instance of such a career having been 
passed through. If this teachers’ farm school proves successful, the 
scheme will probably be developed into the holding of many such 
schools throughout the year, but devoted to specialization in the vari- 
ous distinct phases of agriculture, such as dairying, cereal culture, 
fruit growing, sheep husbandry, and irrigation farming.

Canada—The Saskatchewan education commission, which was 
appointed May 9, 1912, finds that it is essential in the interests of 
the Province of Saskatchewan that agricultural and industrial educa- 
tion be amplified and extended by the use of existing agencies, viz., 
the public, high, and normal schools, and the university, including 
the agricultural college. It recommends that (1) systematic efforts 
be made to introduce nature study, school gardening, manual train- 
ing, and elementary household science more generally into the public 
schools and to provide in the more advanced schools instruction and 
training for the preparation of teachers and leaders in these depart- 
ments; (2) short courses in agriculture and elementary science dur- 
ing vacation periods where necessary be given in rural schools by trav- 
eling expert instructors; (3) the establishment of industrial evening 
schools be encouraged in villages and towns; (4) provision be made 
in high schools for short winter courses in agriculture and instruc- 
tion in advanced manual training and household science and such 
specialized form of industrial work as may be deemed advisable; (5) 
such work as may be undertaken in public and high schools in 
school gardening and agriculture, household science, manual train- 
ing, and related branches be encouraged by initial and annual 
grants and be placed under expert direction; (6) increased facili- 
ties be provided for dealing effectively with approved methods 
of instruction in school gardening and elementary agriculture, 
manual training, and elementary household science in the pro- 
vincial normal schools; (7) steps be taken to establish in the univer- 
sity a school of domestic science and a college of technology for a 
corresponding development of industrial education; (8) the depart- 
ment of education be asked to accept either agriculture or household 
science in lieu of physics or chemistry in the examination for third 
and second class teachers’ diplomas, and the university to make a 
similar departure at the junior matriculation examination; (9) ex- 
pert district representatives be appointed to assist the department 
and college of agriculture in promoting the welfare of rural com- 
munities. 
Latin America.—In 1914-15 there were over 100 gardens in con- 
nection with the elementary schools in every part of British Guiana. 
The number not having varied much in recent years, the probability 
is that nearly every school having available land suitably situated 
has its garden. Under a new education code the garden grant is no 
longer restricted to the pupils of the four higher grades. Every boy 
between 9 and 14 years of age is now eligible to receive instruction 
in gardening, irrespective of the class or grade in which he is work- 
ing; but on the other hand the grant ceases to be available for girls. 
The maximum grant is $1.20 per pupil, while under the previous 
code it was $1. The nine Government model gardens, originated in
-P-A-G-E-280
  252 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
1903 and costing the Government $2,000 annually, were abolished in 
March, 1915. 
A recent decree of the department of agriculture of the Argentine 
Government establishes a practical home school of agriculture at 
Tandil, the first of its kind to be founded in the Republic. 
The Government of Chile has appropriated $9,490 for the mainte- 
nance of the agricultural farm and $8,358.50 for the agricultural 
school at the Quinta Normal de Agricultura, Santiago. 
According to the message of President Alfredo Gonzales, of Costa 
Rica, to the National Congress on May 1, 1915, the results of the 
rural agricultural schools have been so satisfactory that the de- 
partment of agriculture proposes to establish 50 such schools with 
practical and theoretical instruction and to increase this number as 
the needs of the country require. A proposed plan for the founding 
of a school of industrial arts and a school of agriculture in the cities 
of Alajuelita and Cartago is also being considered. 
A rural normal school, the second of its kind established in Para- 
guay, was inaugurated March 26 last. Stock raising is to be in- 
cluded in the subjects of instruction. The agricultural school -at 
Asuncion has aided greatly in the introduction of improved methods 
concerning the feeding and breeding of stock in the more thickly 
populated sections of the Republic and in influencing particularly 
small farmers to give attention to the question of forage by recom- 
mending the cultivation of suitable grasses and legumes for feed- 
ing purposes. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, 
Two years have passed since the cooperative agricultural exten- 
sion act of May 8, 1914, commonly known as the Smith-Lever Ex- 
tension Act, went into effect. In that period much has been accom- 
plished in creating or perfecting the administrative machinery for 
carrying on extension work in agriculture and home economics by 
the Department of Agriculture and the several States. The general 
lines along which these extensive enterprises will be conducted have 
also been fairly well determined. 
All the States have assented to the provisions of the act either 
through their governors or their legislatures, and the action of the 
governors has been ratified by all the legislatures which have been 
in regular session during the year. A single agricultural college in 
each State has been designated as the beneficiary of this act, thus 
providing for a unified administration of the act within the State. 
In several States where the college designated is not coeducational 
a cooperative arrangement for the work in home economics has been 
made with the State college for women, and, similarly, in a few
-P-A-G-E-281
    
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 253 
States having separate land-grant colleges for Negroes a cooper- 
ative arrangement has been made for extension work among people 
of the colored race. 
The experience of the past 12 years has fully demonstrated the 
value of the county agricultural agent as a means of bringing to 
agricultural people on their farms and in their homes the results 
of practical experience and scientific research in agriculture and home 
economics and securing the practical application of these results 
through demonstrations and otherwise. There is therefore general 
agreement that nothing is more important in the development of 
extension features under the new conditions arising from the Smith- 
Lever Act than the establishment in each county of permanent 
headquarters for extension work, in charge of a competent county 
agent, who shall act as the joint representative of the local com- 
munity, the State through its agricultural college, and the Nation 
through its Department of Agriculture. It is believed that in this 
way the need of the agricultural people in their several communities 
can be best determined, and whatever help the State and the Nation 
can give them in their agricultural and home problems can be most 
speedily and effectively brought to them. A large share of the 
department extension funds, much money derived from State, 
county, and local sources, and a considerable portion of the Smith- 
Lever fund have therefore been devoted to the maintenance and 
extension of the county agent system. There are now over 1,000 
counties in the 48 States which have county agents. 
Considering the limited number of agricultural college graduates 
and the numerous avenues for congenial work which are opening 
up to them, it is not surprising that up to the present time it has 
not been practicable to obtain a sufficient number of such graduates 
with the practical experience and other qualifications required for 
the position of county agent. There will be a steady. demand for 
men of thorough training, combined with satisfactory practical 
experience, to fill these positions. The colleges have therefore a 
special duty to train the future extension workers, and it is en- 
couraging to notice that they are beginning to feel their respon- 
sibility in this direction. 
Another important line of extension work which has been de- 
veloped in a large way by the Department and the agricultural 
colleges prior to the passage of the Smith-Lever Act and which has 
been carried over into their new extension organizations is the boys’ 
and girls’ club work. In the Southern States this enterprise is 
organically associated with the county agent work, but in the other 
States it has a more separate organization. Through the club work 
the extension agencies are brought into close touch with the State 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
    ‘ 
254 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
and local officers and teachers, who largely cooperate in the forma- 
tion and management of the clubs. This has raised many interesting 
questions regarding the relations which the club work might or 
should sustain with the regular school instruction in agriculture 
and home economics. For example, is it practicable and desirable 
to consider the club work as in the nature of a home project for the 
pupils and to give school credit for this work? Undubtedly such 
questions will require much consideration by the extension officers 
in the future. 
There are a total of 62,922 boys enrolled in the corn clubs in the 
South, with an average production of 51.37 bushels per acre. In 
addition to corn clubs, it has been found advisable to organize boys 
in western Oklahoma and Texas into kafir, milo maize, and feterita 
clubs. A few cotton clubs have been organized for the purpose of 
teaching boys how to make the greatest yields at the lowest cost. 
In 1914 peanut clubs were organized in Virginia. Potato clubs are 
organized wherever there is a demanad for them. The office of ex- 
tension work in the South of the States Relations Service, in coop- 
eration with the Bureau of Animal Industry, has organized pig, 
poultry, and baby beef clubs. Further mention of these clubs will 
be given later in this chapter. 
According to States Relations Service Document 27— 
The best results are generally obtained when the following plans are fol- 
lowed in a county: (1) The local teacher organizes the club and sends the 
names and addresses of the boys to the county agent of the farmers’ cooperative 
demonstration work. In case there is no county agent in the county, the 
teacher sends the enrollment to the county superintendent of education. 
(2) The county agent, in cooperation with the county superintendent of edu- 
cation, directs the work in the county, holds county meetings, formulates the 
county rules, and settles all county contests. He receives the names and 
addresses of the boys from the local teachers, makes copy of the same for his 
office, and sends copy of names and addresses to the county superintendent of 
education and to the State agent in charge of boys’ agricultural clubs. When 
there is no demonstration agent in the county the county superintendent sends 
the names and addresses to the State agent in charge of boys’ agricultural 
clubs. 
Demonstration work for the girls and women began in the South- 
ern States with the canning clubs. In 1910 only 4 counties and 2 
States were organized. In 1915 there were 368 counties with women 
county agents. They gave instruction to 32,613 girls and direct 
instruction to 6,871 women. Each of the girls produced a one-tenth 
acre home garden of tomatoes or tomatoes and other vegetables. 
They put up 2,166,515 cans of fruits and vegetables, estimated to be 
worth $300,000. The average profit per member was $24. Instruc- 
tion was also given in the raising of poultry, marketing of eggs, 
making. of butter, keeping of milk, preparation of food for the
-P-A-G-E-283
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 255 
table, baking of bread, etc. In the girls’ work the women county 
agents held 10,784 public meetings, attended by 409,283 persons. In 
the poultry clubs there were enrolled 9,854 members, and 3,062 mem- 
bers in bread clubs. In the work for adult women special attention 
has been given to labor-saving devices, such as simple home water 
works, screening of houses, making of fireless cookers and _ iceless 
refrigerators, construction of wheel trays, fly traps, etc. There were 
6,871 women demonstrators who did some line of work in their own 
homes in the way of home improvements. Two hundred and fifty 
women’s community clubs were organized. In the meetings held for 
the purpose of instruction there was an attendance of 74,335 women. 
In a number of counties in Texas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Virginia, 
and Louisiana, special effort was made to teach farm women to 
market eggs by organizing egg circles and cooperative egg-selling 
associations. These were very successful. 
In the 33 Northern and Western States during the past year 209,- 
178 boys and girls were enrolled in boys’ and girls’ club work, etc., 
of whom 127,882 did the work as outlined and directed by leaders. 
Of this number 82,264, or 64 per cent,-not only completed the work 
but rendered complete and certified crop reports, as required by the 
leaders. Of the total number doing all the work required, 24,299 
were engaged in productive projects or profit-making enterprises, in 
which they produced a total value of $509,325 worth of food products. 
The 50 cooperative leaders employed in 28 States secured the co- 
operation and local leadership of 11,478 people, who assumed respon- 
sibilities over local groups and clubs. The cooperative leaders con- 
ducted 1,670 canning demonstrations, with a total attendance of 
156,580, and field meetings numbering 3,829, and, in addition to 
this, visited 27,733 club plats. Cooperative leaders at the colleges 
of agriculture furnished and distributed 2,108,456 pieces of club in- 
struction, while the Department of Agriculture furnished 1,140,146 
pieces. 
Reports from 3,155 homes where the canning-club instructions were 
used show 546,515 quarts of fruits and vegetables canned during the 
past year, about half of which was vegetables, windfall apples, and 
other food products of the farm and garden which frequently go to 
waste for want of a remunerative market. 
The bankers in many States are realizing the value of pig-club 
work as a means of materially improving rural conditions. Not a 
few of the bankers have made it possible for worthy club members 
to secure pigs on their personal notes. In this way a well-bred pig 
is secured and the member can pay for it from the proceeds of the 
pig as a meat animal or from the sale of offspring in the case of a 
breeding animal. The member enters into a business agreement
-P-A-G-E-284
  256 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
(with the parents’ consent) with the banker and is in this way re- 
lieved of the stigma of charity, which is the result when a pig is 
given outright. This arrangement is a practical means of teaching 
business methods to the rural young people. It is also a character- 
building process. 
Pig-club work has been carried on by the bureau during the past 
year in cooperation with the State agricultural colleges of Alabama, 
Arkansas, California, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mas- 
sachusetts, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Texas. 
Boys’ and girls’ poultry clubs have made rapid progress in the 
States of Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Car- 
olina, and Virginia. The State of Virginia was the first to organize 
poultry clubs, and the result at the end of the first year’s work in 
1913 was 187 members in 11 clubs in 4 counties. This is to be com- 
pared in 1915 with 692 members in 76 clubs in 17 counties. In these 
6 States 95 counties, 328 clubs, and 3,337 members were included in 
the organization, with prize money distributed at the various fairs 
to the extent of $1,458.74. 
The chief of the Forest Service reports that special cooperation 
was extended during the year to the State normal schools of Cali- 
fornia to help them in the teaching of elementary forestry. Lectures 
were delivered before their faculties and students on.the importance 
of forests to the State and ways in which teachers can help in pro- 
moting the care of forests. Publications, lantern slides, and other 
educational material. were furnished to them. At the State normal 
school at San Diego several courses of lectures were given by mem- 
bers of the Forest Service on various subjects in elementary forestry, 
and working out of plans of the best methods of teaching the sub- 
ject were begun in cooperation with members of the faculty, to be 
completed during the remainder of the calendar year. Several 
lectures were delivered before other schools and before teachers’ meet- 
ings throughout the State. 
More than 1,700 lantern slides were loaned to 386 persons engaged 
in educational work; 68 photograph exhibits and 104 wood exhibits 
were loaned to schools and libraries; and more than 1,300 photo- 
graphic prints were loaned, given, or sold for educational purposes. 
The division of agricultural instruction of the State Relations 
Service undertook a project in cooperation with this bureau which 
bas to do with the study of the methods of organization and ad- 
ministration of instruction in agriculture in public schools, the train- 
ing of teachers for this work, and the relationship of different 
agencies promoting such instruction. Under this second project the 
division has held in cooperation with the bureau three sectional con-  
-P-A-G-E-285

ferences on agricultural education dealing with the problem of 
teacher-training in land-grant colleges. The aim of the conference 
for the Southern States was to work out a tentative course which 
may be taken as a guide for training teachers in agriculture, and 
when revised and tested may be made the basis of licensing teachers 
in lieu of the present required examinations. 
The series of bulletins on elementary agriculture for the rural 
schools begun last year by this division, in cooperation with State 
agricultural colleges, experiment stations, and State departments of 
education, has resulted in the issuing of such bulletins for the schools 
of Maryland and Wisconsin. Similar work has been completed for 
the schools of Mississippi, and a bulletin for the rural schools of 
Vermont is in process of preparation. Other publications issued 
during the year dealt with “Lessons in elementary agriculture for 
Alabama schools,” “ Correlating agriculture with the public-school 
subjects in the Northern States,” “Lessons on cotton for the rural 
common schools,” “ Exercises with plants and animals for southern 
rural schools,” and “Home projects in secondary courses in agri- 
culture.” A publication dealing with the methods of teaching soils 
in land-grant colleges is in process of preparation, and a manuscript 
was prepared dealing with “ Lessons on tomatoes for rural schools.” 
Nine numbers of the Agricultural Education Monthly were issued, 
dealing, among other things, with such subjects in secondary agri- 
cultural instruction as “ Methods of teaching agriculture in secondary 
schools,” “Use of illustrative material in secondary schools,” “A 
simple method of cataloguing agricultural literature suitable for the 
school or home library,” and “ Professional improvement for teachers 
of agriculture.” 
The division began during the year the preparation of brief peda- 
gogical statements on how to use in the teaching of agriculture in 
rural schools certain Farmers Bulletins. Eight have been issued. 
At the request of the Mississippi State Department of Public In- 
struction, the division has begun the adaptation of the four units 
of agriculture outlined for the accredited high schools in the South 
to the Mississippi county agricultural schools. 
The problem in agricultural education studied in cooperation with 
the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment 
Stations was the credit to be given work in agriculture in secondary 
schools by land-grant colleges and also the extent to which courses 
now offered by land-grant colleges may be as well given in secondary 
schools. ; 
In addition to making a study of the problems of visual instruction 
in agricultural education, sets of lantern slides have been added to

those already in service. One set is worthy of special note, in that it 
deals in detail with school-garden work in connection with teacher 
training in a normal school, featuring how this work may be corre- 
lated to the extent of vitalizing such subjects in the course of study 
as arithmetic, drawing, and language. 
Card indexes of the world’s literature of agricultural education, 
as well as of American and foreign institutions for agricultural edu- 
cation and instruction in home economics, were maintained by the 
division, Z

  CHAPTER XV. 
SCHOOL AND HOME GARDENING. 
By J. L. Ranpatt, 
Specialist in School and Home Gardening, Bureau of Bducation. 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF GARDENING. 
School and home garden training has become an educational 
activity in so many cities and towns as to merit special considera- 
tion in a review of education for the year. The attempt to project 
the school influence outside of the four walls into the home and 
real life of the people is a significant trend toward a new and 
more complete type of city education of which gardening will 
become a part. 5 
WHY GARDENING IS NEEDED. 
That there is an educational unrest and demand for school re- 
organization in cities is shown by the many recent investigations 
and surveys. To understand why gardening is needed in this 
reorganization it is only necessary to study the census figures of 
the United States and note the change that is rapidly coming about 
in the living conditions of a large part of the people. Since the 
days of colonization the United States has been essentially a 
rural nation, but each succeeding census brings out the fact that 
new industrial conditions are forcing more and more of the popula- 
tion to live in cities, until at the present time more than half (52 
per cent) are living under urban conditions. 
With this change in living conditions there has not been a cor- 
responding change in school organization. The school year, with 
its long summer vacation, was planned that the farm boy and 
girl might help with the planting, cultivation, and harvesting of 
crops. After school hours and during the vacation the country boy 
had good, healthy, out-of-door work. The child having such regu- 
lar work forms early the habit of industry and gains a knowledge 
of purposeful, productive occupation which is educative. To this 
early education is often attributed the success of the farm boy when 
he enters the competition of the city. 
259    
-P-A-G-E-288
  260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
In his paper on the “Changes needed in American secondary 
education” Dr. Eliot declares :* 
The boy on the farm has admirable opportunities to train eye, ear, and 
hand, because he can always be looking at the sky and the soils, the woods, 
the crops, and the forests, having familiar intercourse with many domestic 
animals, using various tools, listening to the innumerable sweet sounds which 
wind, water, birds, and insects make on the countryside, and in his holidays 
hunting, fishing, and roaming. 
Increasing skill in the use of the hands and fingers has undoubtedly had 
much to do with the development of the human mind ever since man first 
stood erect and set free from foot work his fingers and their opposing thumb. 
One of the best methods of developing the minds of children is practice in the 
coordinated activities of the brain and the hand. If brain, eye, and hand 
are cooperating, the developing mental effect is increased, and the mental 
action and reaction is stronger still when eyes, ears, and hands, and the whole 
nervous system, the memory, and the discriminating judgment are at work 
together. 
In the city, on the other hand, when the school doors close for 
the summer vacation, the child has no large field of useful occupa- 
tion to which to turn his energies. About 5 per cent of the city 
children are away from home during the vacation months or are 
with parents at summer resorts or visiting in the country. Some- 
thing less than 10 per cent are employed near home in healthful 
occupation suited to childhood, while the other 85 per cent remain 
at home, without proper employment for any large part of their 
time. Many of these children at the close of school wander about 
aimlessly and often form themselves into gangs, and give outlet 
to their energies in ways that are not acceptable to other members 
of the community or beneficial to themselves. The littered, deso- 
late back lot and alley are not environments that lend themselves to 
character building. Amid such surroundings the vilest habits are 
often formed, and what are at first simple quests for fun are turned 
into crime. 
Tn another part of his paper Dr. Eliot refers to the changing needs 
in city education as follows: 
The great increase of urban population at the expense of rural which has 
taken place during the past 60 years, with the accompanying growth of fac- 
tories and the crowding together of the working people and their families, has 
resulted, so far as schools and colleges are concerned, in placing more children 
and youths than formerly under the influence of systematic education and keep- 
ing them there for a longer period; but this improvement has been accompanied 
by a decline in the amount and- quality of the sense-training which children and 
adolescents have received. An increasing ‘proportion of children goes to the high 
schools, academies, and colleges, but the farm now teaches but a small propor- 
tion of the children born to the Nation, and the urban family can not train the 
children’s senses in so effective and wholesome ways as the rural family could.

    SCHOOL AND HOME GARDENING. 261 
In cities and large towns the trade which a boy chooses, or is assigned to, no 
longer demands for admission a prolonged apprenticeship. Machinery turns out 
an ample product without the need of much skilled labor. The general result 
is an inadequate training of the senses of the rising generation for accurate and 
quick observation. Unfortunately, the schools, which might have come to the 
rescue of the children, have for the most part clung to the traditional pro- 
grams which rely chiefly on studies that train the memory and the powers of 
discrimination and analysis, but do not drill children in seeing and hearing 
correctly, in touching deftly and rapidly, and in drawing the right inferences 
from the testimony of their senses. 
EARLY HISTORY OF GARDENING. 
The school-garden movement had its inception in the desire of city 
educators to provide employment for city children and also to add 
a subject to the curriculum from which knowledge might be gained 
through doing. It is interesting to note that the school garden was 
first started, and has taken firmest hold, in large cities. People feel 
the keenest desire for things when they have lost them. As cities 
become more and more congested, parents feel more strongly that 
their children should have greater opportunity for out-of-door exer- 
cise and first-hand contact with nature. Children’s gardens were 
first started in European countries. As early as 1814 some of the 
German States introduced the study of production of vegetables and 
fruits in their school courses. In 1869 both Austria and Sweden, 
by royal edicts, took up the school-garden movement. France, Russia, 
Belgium, and England have also taken steps to start school garden- 
ing by requiring that all schools using public funds must teach chil- 
dren to cultivate gardens of vegetables and flowers. Canada is now 
engaged in introducing gardening in all her city and rural schools. 
The first school garden in the United States was started at Rox- 
bury (now a part of Boston), Mass., in 1890. From this beginning, 
the school-garden movement spread rapidly, and during the follow- 
ing 10 years many cities became identified with it. One of the early 
gardens that has been a decided success from the beginning was 
started by the National Cash Register Co., of Dayton, Ohio. In de- 
scribing the reasons for starting this garden, the president of the 
company said: 
After an investigation of the successes and failures of the men who had been 
boys with me, I was impressed by the fact that there had been scarcely a failure 
among those boys who had been responsible for some farm or garden “ chores.” 
I decided that in a very rough neighborhood I’ would make the experiment of 
using the surplus energy of the boys in practical garden work and let them 
have the products of their steady work and business energy. So gratifying was 
the result that the garden is to-day a marked feature of the welfare work for 
the employees of the National Cash Register Co.

    262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
PRESENT STATUS OF GARDENING. 
Statistics collected by the Bureau of Education show that the 
larger part of the city school superintendents of the United States 
are now encouraging gardening among the children of their schools. 
Reports have been received from 1,572 city superintendents, of whom 
1,220, or 78 per cent, are encouraging some form of school-directed 
gardening. In some cases encouragement means simply talks on 
gardening by teachers and principals or the distribution of seeds 
and bulbs. In other cities, including practically all of the large 
cities, garden plats are maintained at the school building, and the 
teachers either give their services or are paid a small additional 
salary for the extra work in the garden. In still other cities com- 
plete departments of school and home gardening or of gardening 
and nature study are maintained and separate appropriations set 
aside for the work. The more rapid promotion of garden teaching 
by the schools is prevented by the tendency to adhere to traditional 
subjects, the lack of school funds, and the small number of well- 
trained teachers who can be employed for a salary in keeping with 
that now paid in the elementary schools. 
Traditional influence.—The influence of tradition is well stated by 
Dr. Abraham Flexner in his paper, “A modern school”:1 
A certain amount of readjustment has indeed taken place; in some respects 
almost frantic efforts are making to force this or that modern subject into the 
course of study. But traditional methods and purposes are strong enough to 
maintain most of the traditional curriculum and to confuse the handling of 
material introduced in response to the pressure of the modern spirit. It is, 
therefore, still true that the bulk of the time and energy of our children at 
school is devoted to formal work developed by schoolmasters, without close or 
constant reference to genuine individual or social need. The subjects in ques- 
tion deal predominantly with words or abstractions, remote from use and ex- 
perience; and they continue to be acquired by children because the race has 
formed the habit of acquiring them, or, more accurately, the habit of going 
through the form of acquiring them rather than because they serve the real 
purposes of persons living to-day. Generally speaking, it may be safely af- 
firmed that the subjects commonly taught, the time at which they are taught, 
the manner in which they are taught, and the amounts taught are determined 
by tradition, not by a fresh and untrammeled consideration of living and 
present needs. 
School appropriations for gardening.—While many school officials 
have shown a keen interest in children’s gardening, the subject has 
had to prove its value without being given generous financial support. 
During the last few years the school boards of several cities have 
made substantial provision for gardening in their annual budgets.

Twelve other city superintendents report expenditures ranging 
from $500 to $1,000, while 108 spent less than $500 on school or 
home gardening. Many of the reports on school-directed gardening 
were indefinite in regard to the methods of financing the work, but 
it is apparent that while many boards of education have made no 
special provision for gardening, the superintendents are authorized 
to use part of the general school fund for the purpose. In some 
towns and cities garden teaching is made part of the duty of the 
regular teacher, and funds are not charged to gardening as a special 
subject. The total expenditure for gardening by schools last year 
was $126,680, but complete returns would increase this amount by 
about one-third. 
Teacher training.—One of the greatest handicaps to the rapid ex- 
tension of school-directed gardening is the lack of well-trained 
teachers. If gardening is to be introduced into all the cities, towns, 
and manufacturing villages of the United States, something over 
fifty thousand teachers will be required. This does not mean that 
50,000 extra teachers should be added to the present force, but rather 
that it would be necessary to require a different preparation for one 
teacher in each school. 
The larger part of the State normal schools of the country give 
courses in elementary agriculture and nature study. The greater 
number of city school superintendents state, however, that none of 
the teachers now employed are trained to direct children in garden- 
ing in the practical way in which it should be done. It is the duty 
of the State normal school to train the elementary teachers of the 
State, and as superintendents are now demanding teachers with 
special qualification for garden teaching, these schools should meet 
the requirement. 
GARDEN PROMOTION BY AGENCIES OTHER THAN THE SCHOOLS. 
Children’s gardening has been started in many cities by organiza- 
tions other than the schools. Garden campaigns have been financed
-P-A-G-E-292
  264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
by city councils, chambers of commerce, civic clubs, women’s clubs, 
etc. In New York City $20,000 was appropriated last year by the 
borough council. Children’s gardens were conducted in Pittsburgh, 
Pa., by the Pittsburgh Playground Association for six years by 
funds appropriated by the city council and received from private 
subscriptions before the work was taken over by the public-school 
system. The Syracuse (N. Y.) Herald as early as 1904 conducted a 
successful campaign for home gardening among children. Many 
industrial concerns have also conducted children’s gardens as a part 
of their welfare work. Notable among these are the National Cash 
Register Co., of Dayton, Ohio, previously mentioned; the Carnegie 
Steel Co., of Duquesne, Pa.; and the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Rail- 
way Co., of Birmingham, Ala. It has been impossible to obtain a 
statement of the.money spent by these concerns for gardening, but 
the total for the country would be large. 
In some cases public-spirited citizens have contributed liberally to 
the support of children’s gardens. Such support, however, has 
usually been in the form of prizes for individual achievement. Many 
successful examples of garden work are the result of individual 
efforts of conscientious, far-sighted teachers, who voluntarily have 
undertaken the work without financial support. They have con- 
tributed liberally their time and sometimes their means in order to 
give the children in their charge an opportunity to share in this 
wholesome and elevating activity. They freely admit, however, that 
their efforts are not wholly devoid of personal interest, for they 
claim that children engaged in gardening are more easily taught and 
governed. It is interesting to note that 220 cities have available 
funds of varying amounts coming from voluntary contributions. 
The total amount available from this source is $22,642. 
The School Garden Association of America.—Through the activi- 
ties of a committee appointed in 1910, the School Garden Association 
of America was formed as a section of the National Education 
Association at the San Francisco meeting in 1911. The association 
filled a real need, as shown by its growth to a membership of 415 by 
the end of 1912. Every State in the Union was represented in this 
membership, as was also the Philippine Islands and one Province of 
Canada. From this beginning the association has grown steadily 
and now has added to its list of members the larger part of those 
persons in the United States who are interested in garden educa- 
tion for children; and it also has representatives in Porto Rico, Phil- 
ippine Islands, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, 
Nova Scotia, New Zealand, Quebec, Ontario, and Prince Edward 
Tsland. : 
Two meetings are held each year, one in connection with the sum- 
mer meeting of the National Education Association and the other  
-P-A-G-E-293
    
SCHOOL AND HOME GARDENING. 265 
as a section of the Department of Superintendence of the National 
Education Association, usually held in February. An annual report 
is published each year and at the present time a monthly publication 
dealing with school-garden progress is issued. 
SURVEYS. 
Gardening has been given careful consideration in several of the 
recent city school surveys. In the San Antonio survey, garden teach- 
ing is strongly recommended as a part of the school activities. The 
following two paragraphs from this report are significant: 
The fundamental aspects of the garden training should be at the homes. 
There is plenty of space. San Antonio averages only five individuals to the 
acre. The city is not densely populated. Houses are well removed from each 
other, and back yards, side yards, front yards, sufficient for flowers, shrubbery, 
and vegetables are the rule everywhere. There is no lack of opportunity for 
training in gardening. 
The school garden suggests what can be grown, what processes have to be 
performed, shows the best ways of doing the work, shows to all the pupils how 
difficulties are to be overcome, furnishes material for laboratory work that 
needs to accompany the teaching of the gardening science, etc. In a word, the 
school garden is a small fraction of the fundamental field of gardening that is 
transferred to the school to be used as a foundation for the supplemental train- 
ing in the science, design, and other matters of technical information which 
are then taken back to the home gardens for that serious application which 
alone accomplishes the education of the children. Their fundamental training 
must be in connection with these home gardens. The front and side yards will 
be given to grass, flowers, and shrubbery, ideas and methods having been con- 
tributed by the work at the school. In the back yard or in the vacant lots can 
be developed the fundamental training in kitchen gardening. 
In the Minneapolis survey for vocational education a chapter is 
devoted to “ What should the city do for training in home gardening 
and elementary agriculture?” The history of gardening in Minne- 
apolis is dealt with under four headings: “The garden club move- 
ment”; “ Gardening projects in the elementary schools of Minneapo- 
lis”; “Gardening projects and elementary agriculture in the central 
high school”; and “ Advantages and disadvantages of school, vacant 
lot, and home gardening.” Under the last heading the following 
conclusions were reached : 
(1) The school garden is of much value in the introduction of the work and 
for instruction and demonstration purposes. However, it is merely a means to 
the end. The enthusiasm of the group is essential to the introduction of the 
project. Advantage should be taken of the economy offered by group instruc- 
tion, providing that the dangers from such instruction are carefully guarded. 
(2) The vacant-lot garden offers many attractive inducements to the children 
who have the capacity and ambition to undertake enterprises on a large scale. 
The boy who feels the need of earning money will be attracted to the vacant-lot 
garden. It will usually attract the stronger and more ambitious. Whenever a  
-P-A-G-E-294
    266 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
strong, energetic boy can be accommodated with a vacant-lot garden, it is safe 
to say he will receive a training that will be of great value. : 
(3) The home garden is the one which offers the most promising and lasting 
results. It should be made the most important part of the movement. The 
gardening activities will not have reached the highest degree of efficiency until 
the gardens reach the home yards. The greatest amount of educational value 
is made’ possible when the movement becomes a part of the home experience of 
the family. 
At the close of the chapter a tentative plan is worked out for the 
introduction of gardening in the elementary schools of Minneapolis, 
dealing with the functions of all the educational forces of the State, 
having a relation to garden teaching, under the following heads: 
(1) How educational forces are cooperating to introduce gardening into the 
elementary schools of Minneapolis. 
(2) How instruction in gardening will be given in the elementary schools of 
Minneapolis. 
(8) The opportunities for agricultural education afforded by the city and 
State schools systems to the children of Minneapolis. 
In Richmond, Ind., a survey of the possibilities of school and home 
gardening was undertaken as a part of a vocational educational sur- 
vey of the city. In this survey much attention is given to the eco- 
nomic value of gardening. The eee in the investigation are 
summarized as follows: 
Homes.—Although located in the center of a farming region, the prices paid 
for vegetables are comparatively high. Prices are standardized by present meth- 
ods of selling. Considering the low average labor income, the amount spent for 
vegetable and small fruit foods is large, an average of $138.87 per year for a family 
of five persons. About 30 per cent of the families have home or vacant-lot vegetable 
gardens, but the methods of planting and cultivation are not intensive, and the 
money value of the product is small. Of all the homes in the city, less than 
10 per cent lack space on which to make a practical kitchen “garden; 30 per 
cent have enough land to produce all the vegetables for the family during the 
productive season of the garden; and in 60 per cent there is enough to produce 
fresh and canned vegetables and berries for the entire year and, in many cases, 
to have a surplus to sell. There is enough vacant ground so that all of those 
who are without land could secure enough for a family garden. In most cases 
the use of vacant lots can be secured free of charge, but when it has to be 
rented the price of $1 per lot is so small that it would have little effect in 
decreasing the profits. 
Schools.—The school year in Richmond is nine months in length and the 
school day five hours. The children are out of school nearly half of the week 
days of the entire year and three-fourths of the days of the garden season, On 
school days less than half of the daylight hours are spent in the classroom. All 
of the children of the city might have occupations two hours per day on 
school days and four on Saturdays, holidays, and in the summer yacation and 
yet have enough time left for play, reading, music, and other special studies. 
At the present time only 9.1 per cent of the elementary-school children have 
regular productive occupation during vacation, 7 per cent irregular employ- 
ment, and 4.4 per cent after school hours. In the Garfield School 19 per cent 
are engaged in earning money before and after school and 25 per cent during the
-P-A-G-E-295
  SCHOOL AND HOME GARDENING. 267 
  vacation. Of the high-school students reporting, only one-fourth have vacation 
occupation, 
* Of 889 children in the elementary schools reporting on home garden space, 
6 per cent were without home lots, 39 per cent had an average of 400 square 
feet, and 55 per cent had 1,000 or more square feet. 
In several cities where home gardening was conducted under the direction 
of the public schools, the children were able to produce a net profit of 10 cents 
per square foot. The children of the nine elementary schools of Richmond 
should be able, on the basis of the number of square feet reported, to earn 
from their gardens a total of $62,820, or an average per child of $70.66. The 
home garden income from the 516 reporting from the Garfield School would 
be $34,740, or an average per child of $67.32. 
In some cases the same land has been reported on by two children of the 
same family, one attending the elementary schools and the other the Garfield 
School. These cases will, however, be offset by the large vacant tracts, of which 
no account has been made, and while the figures may seem large, there is little 
doubt that each public-school child of garden age may produce enough to 
reduce the cost of vegetables in his home to half the present cost. 
A comparatively large number of children leave school each year, some be- 
cause they need to earn money toward the support of the home and others 
because school subjects do not interest them. The earnings of these children 
are small, and the earning powers might be much increased if a more complete 
education were received. The number of cases of juvenile delinquency and 
truancy is very much greater in the city than in the country. With each 
industrial depression, city families turn to the country to seek a means of 
livelihood. Agricultural instruction is not given in the schools, and thus the 
younger pupils do not become interested in the subject; older students are 
unable to pursue the subject vocationally, and those who, from financial neces- 
sity, seek the country have a small earning power and are unable to adapt 
themselves to country life. 
The beauty of the city might be much increased if the citizens were familiar 
with the methods of cultivation and care of decorative plants. 
SCHOOL AND HOME GARDENING DIVISION OF THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
Believing in the need for and possibilities of home gardening 
under the direction of the public schools, Dr. P. P. Claxton, Com- 
missioner of Education, asked for and received an appropriation 
from Congress to establish a division of school and home garden- 
ing in the United States Bureau of Education. In this division three 
specialists are now at work, one devoting entire time to the Northern 
States, another to the States of the South, and a third dividing 
time between the two sections. At the present time these specialists 
are engaged in assisting superintendents of city schools to establish 
departments of school and home gardening in their school systems. 
In following the plan of the Bureau of Education school officials 
are asked to employ one garden teacher for each 200 children of 
garden age. This teacher should be employed for 12 months; and 
after school, on Saturdays, and during the summer vacation she 
should instruct the children in the active planning, planting, culti-  
-P-A-G-E-296
  268 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
vating, harvesting, and marketing of vegetables grown in the back 
yard or on vacant lots. After seveial years, when intensive vege- 
table culture is well understood by many of the children, the work 
may be extended to include the growing of berries and fruit for home 
consumption and for canning. Still later the children should be 
taught the methods of growing flowers and shrubs for home decora- 
tion. ~ 
The home garden teacher may be one of the regular grade teachers, 
but in all cases she must continue her work during the summer 
months. A more ideal plan would be to make this teacher a special 
instructor of nature study, elementary science, and gardening, in 
order that she may visit all of the upper grade rooms and give 
garden instruction during school hours. 
It is believed that the removal of the garden to the home will not 
decrease its educational advantages. With a special, trained school- 
teacher in charge of the gardens, more children will be enabled to 
take up the work than ever before, and all the lessons that have been 
taught in the small school garden may be continued and may have 
added to them a purposeful productive education from which habits 
of industry will be formed. 
GARDENING IN PORTO RICO. 
An idea of gardening progress in Porto Rico can best be given by 
quoting the following paragraphs from the report of the commis- 
sioner of education of the island for the fiscal year ending June 30, 
1915: 
The beginning of the school year 1913-14 saw agriculture made an obligatory 
subject for all boys enrolled in grades 6, 7, and 8 of the urban schools and for 
all boys in the rural schools who were physically able. Ten thousand dollars 
was spent in buying over 1,000 sets of tools, each set composed of 16 hoes, 8 
rakes, 6 hoe forks, 2 spades, 3 spading forks, 1 pick mattock, and 1 garden 
plow. These were distributed ‘to the schools. Forty-one special teachers of 
agriculture were provided for by the legislature in the budget, and these teachers 
were carefully chosen and trained during the summer under the direction of the 
general supervisor. These special teachers worked indefatigably, both in the 
urban centers and in the barrios. They had much to discourage them—a corps 
of teachers untrained in agriculture, lack of suitable ground belonging to the 
school, the distrust and at times open hostility of the patrons, and many other 
obstacles. The year closed with satisfactory results, however; considering the 
magnitude of the problem. <A good start at least had been made. 
The school year 1914-15 opened with the 41 special teachers of agriculture 
eliminated from the budget. This meant the elimination of agriculture as a 
required subject in the urban schools, except in those centers where a teacher 
of the graded corps took a special interest in the work and desired to do some- 
thing after school hours. In 20 towns work in agriculture has been carried on 
spasmodically, and reports state that 807 pupils have been given some instruc- 
tion. The average amount of land under cultivation in these 20 towns was
-P-A-G-E-297
SCHOOL AND HOME GARDENING. 269 
seven-tenths of an acre, and the total value of produce raised was $4.55. 
Reports state that 267 pupils in these 20 towns had home gardens. Some of 
these were good and others poor. 
Many teachers and influential people of the island feel that the 
curtailing of the garden work is a great mistake, and there is little 
doubt of the reinstating of the complete plan. 
SCHOOL AND HOME GARDENING IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 
In the Philippine Islands the introduction of gardening was not 
hampered by tradition. With the coming of the first American 
teacher in 1901 there came a new era in labor standards and added 
emphasis on better home surroundings and food conditions. Indus- 
trial training, of which gardening forms a large part, has been re- 
quired in all elementary schools since 1905. More than 100,000 pupils 
were engaged in gardening during the school year 1914-15, and more 
than 48,000 pupils had home gardens which were kept producing 
throughout the year as required school work. A definite idea of 
the plan of this work is given in the fifteenth annual report (1914) 
of the director of education of the islands, as follows: 
Gardening in the form of caring for the lawn and ornamental plants on the 
school premises is required of all schools. Each boy in the primary grades who 
is physically able is required to have a home garden, the area of which must be 
four times the amount of land cultivated by him at school, 20 square meters 
being the minimum requirement. The home work of pupils is inspected and 
credit toward promotion given. The selection and saving of seeds and the 
growing of the native vegetables liked by the people of the community are 
emphasized. In the general course and the course in teaching, advanced gar- 
dening is studied in one or more grades. Nursery work is a feature of all 
intermediate school gardening. 
SCHOOL GARDENING IN CANADA.* 
A report on the care of school gardens during summer vacation 
in Canada shows that in Prince Edward Island, where the schools 
close June 30 and reopen August 9 and where the teacher is paid 
a bonus for a well-kept school garden, teachers who start school 
gardens are held responsible for their garden. In the Province 
of Quebec children must attend to the garden during the summer 
vacation at regular hours appointed by the school authorities, once 
or twice a week, accompanied by a guardian; in small schools 
which are far away from the village children harvest their prod- 
ucts, consisting of early vegetables, at the end of the school year; 
in places where the teacher spends the summer in or near the school: 
an excursion of teacher and pupils to the garden may be arranged;

culture. 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
    270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
where the teacher must leave the school a club of children gar- 
deners may be organized in June, with a trustee or, preferably, a 
farmer acting as patron and accompanying the children to the 
school once a week at an appointed hour. Some teachers arrange 
for home gardens instead of school gardens, all plats being visited 
two or three times during the vacation by the teacher or school 
trustees. In the Province of Ontario teachers and trustees are 
warned not to begin a garden unless they are certain it will not 
be neglected during the summer vacation. Where previous ex- 
perience has shown that a garden can not be expected to continue 
successfully during the vacation, it is advised that the ground be 
seeded down. Where the garden is to be undertaken for the first 
time the best security for care will be the community interest— 
parents, trustees, the local branch of the women’s institute, and ex- 
pupils should be consulted in the work. In Manitoba many chil- 
dren regularly visit their plats during vacation and keep them in 
condition; many parents also visit the garden; the trustees of many 
schools meet Saturday afternoons and round up the village chil- 
dren to accompany them to the school grounds to perform the 
necessary weeding, etc.; in some schools committees are appointed for 
each week of the vacation, each committee in turn being held respon- 
sible; competitions and exhibitions both in rural localities and in 
town have solved the weed problem in hundreds of districts. As 
between the methods of placing all the responsibility for the vaca- 
tion care of gardens upon the pupils or relieving them of all 
responsibility, the director of elementary agricultural education of 
British Columbia advocates a middle course by making two defi- 
nite appointments at the close of the school in June, viz, (1) a 
garden day (or half day) to be observed by the pupils weekly 
during the months of July and August, and (2) a garden manager 
or supervisor who will be in attendance at the garden that day of 
each week in succession. He should be appointed by the school 
board, and should be not only in sympathy with the work, but also 
conversant with the teacher’s method of conducting it. In a small 
garden three hours a week, preferably in the morning, will be suffi- 
cient, but in large gardens eight hours a week may be found neces- 
sary. One hour a week is usually sufficient for each pupil to epend 
in actual garden work.

  CHAPTER XVI. 
HOME ECONOMICS. 
By Mrs. Henrietta Carvin and Carrie A. Lyrorp, Specialists in Home- 
Economics, Bureau of Education. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The efforts of educators throughout the country to direct the educa- 
tion of girls toward preparation for home making have begun to ° 
show fruition in many ways. An interest in the work of the home 
maker has been awakened in a measure in all classes of society ,and 
among women of all ages. Women have begun to prepare them- 
selves for many of the vocations related to home making. In the 
schools special courses to cover these new lines of work have devel- 
oped. While there has been a steady increase in the number of 
schools offering instruction in home economics and in the length of 
home economics courses, the most marked advance has been in the 
type of course offered and in the standards of instruction that have 
been established. Some schools continue to be satisfied with a home 
economics department that does not rank with other courses 
offered and that plays no réle in the life of the school. However, 
State legislation, faculties that appreciate the relation that home edu- 
cation bears to general education, and popular sentiment are mak- 
ing very definite demands of the schools, and a high grade of home 
economics teaching is resulting. Material aids have never been so 
numerous as at the present time, and the wide-awake teacher finds 
illustrative and literary material that will be of assistance for almost 
every subject that she expects to teach. Moreover, she is learning 
that her best laboratory is the home, the shop, and the market of 
her immediate community. Therefore she is striving to tie up her 
work to the problems at hand. Schools of education and systems of 
city supervision are going to be the most potent factors in the devel- 
opment of educational methods in home economics, while colleges and 
universities are developing the subject matter in its scientific and 
economic relationships. Many of the smaller schools have been 
handicapped by the lack of trained teachers and inadequate funds. 
Where the earnestness of the teacher has been great enough to demand 
Bil  
-P-A-G-E-300
2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
better conditions for home economics teaching, the smaller schools 
have contributed much toward the development of the movement. 
There are before Congress two bills of special importance to those 
interested in home economics: The so-called Smoot bill, for the sup- 
port of organized home economics experiment stations, and the 
Smith-Hughes bill, making appropriations for the assistance of 
teacher-training in home economics and the encouragement of voca- 
tional education. 
HOME ECONOMICS IN THE SURVEYS. 
An indication of the attitude of mind of those interested in edu- 
cational questions may be observed in the position assigned to home 
economics in several of the recent educational surveys. Home 
economics received special consideration in the survey of Iowa’s 
higher educational institutions. In the survey of San Francisco’s 
public school system the entire time of one investigator was devoted 
to those lines of work intended to train girls in the art of home mak- 
ing. To the subjects of “household arts and school luncheons” was 
given an entiré monograph in the Cleveland survey. 
In the survey of the Iowa State-supported institutions of higher 
education the effort was made to define the functions of home eco- 
nomics in land-grant colleges, State universities, and State normal 
schools where these institutions are not directly connected nor located 
upon the same campus. The commission declares: 
In view of reasons elsewhere set forth in this report the commission considers 
it unwise to develop at the State university courses in home economics leading to 
degrees. The proper function of the department in the scheme of university in- 
struction should be that of a’ service department. Because of both its prac- 
tical and its cultural value, the continuance of home economics on this basis is 
amply justified in any institution frequented by women. That courses in the 
subject not only afford useful training in the arts and sciences involved in the 
maintenance of efficient homes, but that their content tends to broaden and 
humanize the experience of women students is commonly recognized. <A certain 
amount of duplication in the fundamental lines of home economics teaching 
between the university and the State college is naturally unavoidable, as in the 
ease of English and mathematics and other subjects generally held to be indis- 
pensable in both liberal and technical curricula. Unwarranted duplication can 
be prevented if the university department is kept from expanding beyond the 
limits of a service department. 
Having regard to the definite differentiation of the university department 
from the department at the State college, where home economics constitutes one 
of the major lines of work, the development of courses for the training of high- 
school teachers of home economics should not be encouraged at the university. 
But there is another field which the university department, as it expands, may 
enter legitimately and consistently with the principles here enunciated. 
Although the demand for trained women as prescribing dietitians is new, it 
will apparently soon be considerable. If the State desires to create such courses 
they should be connected with the home economics department at the university. 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
      
HOME ECONOMICS. 273) 
This is not to be understood, however, as implying a recognition of professional 
courses in home economics at the university. The conjunction at the university 
of a department of home economics with a hospital and a medical school of 
the first rank presents an unusual opportunity for the development of this type 
of instruction. 
In considering the work at the land-grant college, the following 
statements were made: 
There are certain directions in which the division of home economics may be 
developed logically and consistently with the principles already emphasized in 
this report. The State board may appropriately encourage the enlargement at 
State college of facilities for preparing women for various positions of responsi- 
bility in dormitories, tea rooms, hospitals, and cafeterias. To this end it seems 
desirable that the college cafeteria be placed under the charge of the home 
economics division and as far. as possible used as a practice place. The train- 
ing of hospital dietitians, however, appears, in view of the considerations 
already mentioned, to be more fittingly the function of the university depart- 
ment of home economics in -conjunction with the university hospital. The 
commission recommends that effective cooperation between the home economics 
division and the authorities in charge of women’s dormitories be established. 
In addition to training high-school teachers of home economics, a task to which” 
the State college is already committed, the institution may well respond to the 
growing demand for the preparation of teachers of this subject for trade and 
industrial schools. 
There may be local or geographic conditions which will make 
necessary the modification of this pronouncement, but without ques- 
tion certain policies relating to the function of home economics 
instruction should be evolved. Many schools may frankly withdraw 
all attempts at teacher training in home economics and offer their 
courses in this subject as material properly finding placement in any 
or all plans of study prepared for women students. 
Continued efforts have been made to lift the college and university 
courses in home economics to a higher level. It is the desire of many 
teachers to establish the requirements of one or more years of high- 
school home economics for entrance to the college courses in that line 
of instruction. Were this requirement made, it would open the col- 
lege courses to more liberal courses in the sciences and at the same 
time give merited recognition to the excellent instruction now given 
in high schools. 
HOME ECONOMICS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
While certain courses usually classified under home economics have 
been offered at the University of California for several years, the fall 
semester, 1916, begins the existence of a definitely organized depart- 
ment of home economics. The courses will be of university grade 
and will be of the highest standard of work in home economics. 
The summer school of 1916 of the University of California offered 
degree courses in home economics for the first time. The previous

summer-school courses in both food preparation and garment mak- 
ing were of college entrance grade only. 
Johns Hopkins University has maintained for the past two sum- 
mers regular courses in home economics designed to prepare the 
students for teachers’ certificates specified by the recent Maryland 
law. Some of these courses not only meet the State-law requirement, 
but credit toward a B. S. degree of that institution. 
The University of Georgia maintains well-organized summer 
courses in home economics, though only men are in attendance 
during the regular school year. 
A department of home economics has been recently established in 
the University of Oklahoma, Norman, Okla. 
Texas Christian University, located at Fort Worth, Tex., has 
inaugurated a new course in home economics. 
The Curtis School of Home Economics at Akron, Ohio, is a unit 
of the Municipal University of Akron. This school is now offering a 
four years’ course in home economics based upon a 15-unit entrance 
requirement. 
The National School of Domestic Arts and Science, of Washington, 
D. C., has started the erection of a series of college buildings which 
call for the expenditure of a million dollars. 
The Mother Craft School, New York, of which Miss Jean Read 
was in charge, closed its doors during the year. <A reorganization 
is to be effected during the coming year. 
The Polytechnic Institute of Auburn, Ala., which is the land- 
grant college for white students of Alabama, has a well-equipped 
laboratory in which instruction in home economics is given to summer 
school students. 
The University of Louisiana inaugurated a department of home 
economics with headquarters in the new George Peabody Building at 
the opening of the fall semester, 1915-16. 
At the third “ Merchant short course” of the University of Kansas, 
given under the auspices of the university extension division at Law- 
rence, February 7 to 11, 1916, an audience varying from 100 to 250 
men listened appreciatively to the daily talks given by the home 
economics department. 
In the Connecticut College for Women, which has completed its 
first year of work, special attention has been given to the dietetics 
laboratory. 
CONFERENCE OF HOME ECONOMICS TEACHERS EMPLOYED IN LAND-GRANT 
COLLEGES. 
The Commissioner of Education issued a call for a conference of 
home economics teachers in land-grant colleges to be held in Berkeley,  
-P-A-G-E-303
  HOME ECONOMICS. 275 
Cal., during the week of the annual meeting of the American As- 
sociation of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations. 
This conference lasted for three days, and each meeting was at- 
tended by about 40 home economics teachers. The interrelation of 
high-school courses in home economics and college courses in the 
same group of subjects; the more adequate preparation of teachers 
for secondary school positions; the assistance which the college may 
give to the teachers in the rural school; and the relation of extension 
service to the home economics college departments, were the subjects 
especially considered. 
The sense of those in attendance was that such meetings should be 
held in the future and that a request be made to the officers of the 
American Association of Agricultural Colleges for recognition and 
the establishment of a section of that association to be devoted to the 
consideration of home economics questions. 
PRESENT STATUS OF HOME ECONOMICS IN NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
In addition to the special home economics courses, most of the 
State normal schools are now giving elective courses in home eco- 
nomics for those who desire to make preparation to become special 
teachers, or for those who wish to take some courses that will give 
them a broader perspective for their general teaching or directly 
prepare them for housekeeping. The tendency to require a brief 
course in home economics of all women students in the normal school 
is growing, particularly in those States in which home economics 
courses are given in the rural schools and in the graded schools of 
the small towns. A demand from the men students in the normal 
schools for a general survey course in home economics is reported 
from many parts of the country. Such a course has been given 
during the year at Maryville, Mo., and in the Miner Normal School 
(colored), Washington, D. C. In many States special courses for 
the training of home economics teachers are restricted to one normal 
school in the State. At least 20 of the State normal schools have 
planned special courses in home economics for the rural teacher, 
either during the year or in the summer session. At the New Mexico 
Normal University in East Las Vegas the Spanish-American stu- 
dents have had special training for rural work in home economics. 
In those normal schools in which the home economics courses are 
best developed science courses are required either as prerequisites or 
as parallel courses. For the brief courses offered to general students 
there are no science requirements. Courses in economics and sociol- 
ogy rarely appear in the two-year normal-school curriculum. i 
The home economics courses in some of the normal schools allow 
electives in order that students may prepare to teach subjects other 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
than those included under “ home economics,” since many schools can 
afford only a part-time teacher of home economics, even though a 
special teacher is employed; the additional subjects chosen may be 
from among the sciences which the home-economics student must 
pursue and in which her training must necessarily be thorough, or 
they may be such as to prepare her to teach in the elementary grades. 
Practice teaching.—In all of those schools in which a special course 
in home economics is given practice teaching is general, but in most 
instances the students suffer from not having a wide diversity of 
courses before practice teaching begins and from their limited op- 
portunity for observation of home-economics teaching in the grades. 
In addition to practice schools maintained by the normal school, 
practice teaching is frequently carried on in rural, grade, and high 
schools of the community through cooperation with local school 
boards. Practice teaching is carried on in this way from the Massa- 
chusetts State Normal School at Framingham, the Industrial Insti- 
tute and College at Columbus, Miss., the Chicago Normal College, 
and one of cookery each week during their last two years in school. 
The fields of work upon which graduates of normal schools enter 
differ according to the locality in which the school is situated. In 
those States in which home economics is just beginning to be included 
in the school curriculum, normal-school teachers are in demand for 
both high-school and grade teaching. Where the work has been 
longer established and the college degree is required for the high- 
school teacher, normal schools are only supplying grade and rural 
teachers, except in those few cases where the normal school offers a 
four-year course leading to a degree. This serves to restrict the 
home-economics course to the particular line of work for which the 
normal school was established—the preparation of teachers for the 
common schools of the State. : 
During the year the Commissioner of Education called five sec- 
tional conferences of State normal-school teachers of home econom- 
ics. These were held in Nashville, Tenn.; Kansas City, Mo.; Moor- 
head, Minn.; Chicago, Ill.; and Scranton, Pa.; and were attended by 
teachers from the near-by States. The attendance at these confer- 
ences of a group of teachers engaged in normal-school work made 
possible a discussion of their special problems that was of great 
value. These discussions centered about the following subjects: 
1. The planning of courses two years in length to prepare special teachers of 
home economics for the common schools. 
2. The planning of brief courses, ranging from 36 to 108 lessons in length, 
for the elementary and rural teachers, who may have to teach home economics in 
addition to their general school subjects. 
8. A standardization of courses of home economics through a determination 
of the character of the courses that should be given in the grades, high schools, 
and normal schools, and of the credit that should be granted for such work.
-P-A-G-E-305
    HOME ECONOMICS. 277 
4, A recognition by the normal schools of the home economics courses in other 
schools by providing special advanced classes for those who have pursued such 
courses in high-school or the grades, by demanding certain grade and high-school 
courses as prerequisites for entrance, or by allowing some credit for the courses 
already pursued. 
5. A differentiation of the normal-school courses in home economics from 
grade-school courses, since the: normal courses are planned for students of 
mature mind and a considerable experience of life who are studying with the 
distinct object in mind of preparing themselves to help others to make better 
homes and to live more efficient lives. 
6. Means of effecting a close organization in the normal school of those 
teachers whose work may be correlated with home economics in order to avoid 
duplication of effort and to afford a wider perspective for the students that 
they may better appreciate the significance of education for the home and its 
relation to other subjects in the school curriculum. = 
7. Better-developed systems of practice teaching with a sufficient number of 
grade classes of average size in the training school and available rural schools 
in the vicinity that may be used as practice schools to give an adequate amount 
of practice to all. 
8. A closer acquaintance with public-school home economics courses and class 
work, emphasis on careful and thorough instruction, a continued improvement 
in methods of conducting all class work in grades and high schools, guarding 
against the danger of making home economics a scholastic subject, and the 
treating of all processes and problems in their relation to home life, keeping 
them as nearly as possible in their proper setting. 
9. The development of courses based on the needs of the woman in the home 
and planned to cover the entire field of the home maker’s duties, rather than 
a limitation of the subject to the two industries of cooking and sewing, at 
the same time making sure that the students learn the essential things well 
and do not get a superficial kowledge of much that is nonessential. 
10. An increased emphasis on the social and economic responsibilities of 
women. 
11. The development of helpful relations with the community, since the in- 
terest and support of the community are absolutely essential to the success of 
the home economics courses. 
12. Methods of keeping in touch with the graduates and observing the prob- 
lems they meet and the effectiveness of their training as shown in their teaching. 
13. The development of the true spirit of home making, which is as much the 
home economics teacher’s task as the giving of instruction in the care of those 
material things that form so large a part of the housekeeper’s concern. 
In addition to these sectional conferences called by the Commis- 
sioner of Education, the New York State normal school teachers of 
home economics have met in conference during the year at the State 
College for Teachers in Albany. New phases of the teaching of the 
household arts and sciences and methods of improving the normal 
school courses in the State were considered. Thus the teaching of 
home economics in State normal schools, which began in Framing- 
ham, Mass., in 1898, has come to be recognized as a distinct field of 
instruction and its specific purpose and methods of training are more 
and more receiving the attention that their close relation to general 
education makes imperative.

HOME ECONOMICS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The present agitation concerning the reorganization of city schools 
has called attention to the lamentable weakness in the organization 
and administration of home economics departments in many of the 
larger towns and cities. In many of these school systems the high- 
school work is unsupervised, while a supervisor is in charge of the 
elementary classes. In others the supervision is divided between two 
persons, one of whom has all responsibility relating to food classes, 
the other authority over all phases of sewing. In order to discover 
what was the most desirable form of organization, a letter of inquiry 
was sent to 25 women who are experts in the subject of home eco- 
nomics. From the replies seven “ home-economics letters ” were pre- 
pared and mailed to city superintendents and teachers of home eco- 
nomics. Letter No. 4 consisted of the expressions of opinion relating 
to supervision of home economics in public-school systems. A typical 
reply was as follows: 
The most effective organization for supervision is one supervisor for all home- 
economics teaching, with an adequate force of assistant supervisors,some of whom 
might be distinctly interested on the food side and others in the clothing subjects. 
There will be less wasted time through needless repetition, and hence more 
valuable lessons taught, if the home-economics work is planned by a broad- 
minded, well-trained person to proceed in an orderly sequence through the 
grades and high school. As in business, there will be less friction if one per- 
son is responsible for the management of all the work. In the elementary 
schools it is.our experience that it is more efficient to have one person—except 
in the prevocational schools—teach both the food and clothing subjects. If 
there was a supervisor for each subject, unjust demands might be made upon 
the teacher, and there would be difficulties in assigning teachers and arranging 
classes. 
Reports of the introduction or the enlargement of departments of 
home economics in the graded and high schools of many smaller cities 
and towns indicate a marked increase in the amount of such teach- 
ing. Some schools report the school lunch as the basis of the home- 
economics course, while in many high schools the isolated courses in 
sewing and cooking have been brought together and a home-eco- 
nomics course leading to a special diploma has been organized. 
The William Penn High School in Philadelphia, the Washington 
Irving High School in New York City, and the Lucy Flower High 
School in Chicago offer typical courses in home economics for the 
technical high school. 
The organization of the home economics work in the public schools 
of Kansas City, Mo., shows an interesting method of adapting the 
courses to the needs of the community in which the school is located. 
There are 55 elementary schools whose children receive instruction
-P-A-G-E-307
  
  HOME ECONOMICS. 279 
in cooking, and 69 schools in which sewing is taught. Cooking be- 
gins in the fifth grade. Of the 55 schools, 6 have cafeteria lunch 
rooms in which the second-year cooking classes prepare all the food 
served in the lunch room. The children in these schools would have 
to carry lunches or prepare their own lunch at home were not lunches 
provided for them in the school cafeteria where they are under the 
careful supervision of the teachers. Six schools have a noonday 
lunch costing 10 or 15 cents a plate prepared and served by second- 
year cooking classes. ‘This makes possible the preparation of recipes 
in family size and helps to fit the girls for the home duties that soon 
fall to them. 
‘In the five elementary schools of Kansas City which are called 
prevocational schools, because they give one-fourth of each day 
instead of one-fourth of a day each week to some form of industrial 
work, the girls have three periods of sewing, one period of millinery. 
and one of cookery each week during their last two years in school. 
There are six high schools in Kansas City in which domestic art 
is taught the first two years and domestic science the last two years. 
Three of these have large lunch rooms run by ‘a manager appointed 
by the board of education, and three have small cafeteria lunch rooms 
run by the domestic science department, most of the food being 
cooked by the girls in the cookery classes. Two high schools have 
equipped housekeeping suits; one elementary school has a bedroom 
and bathroom and two elementary schools have a bedroom and 
family-sized kitchen. 
A two-years’ course in household arts was given last year in six 
academic high schools in Cleveland, Ohio, for the first time. 
CAFETERIAS AND LUNCH ROOMS, 
In many colleges and universities there has been a decided effort 
to establish courses for students not desirous of preparation for 
teaching, yet needing some equipment for income earning. The 
articulation of the home-economics department with the dormitory 
management and with college lunch rooms has done much toward 
giving the needed training. Certain schools have maintained a cafe- 
teria entirely under the management of the home-economics depart- 
ment. These courses in lunch-room management have proved of 
value to the prospective teacher, since in many public schools the 
home-economics teacher is in charge of the school lunches. This 
latter condition exists at the State Normal School at Valley City, 
N. Dak., where the plan is as follows: 
The food courses are self-supporting and recipes are prepared in quantity 
for family use; that is, to serve an average of from four to eight. The list of 
recipes to be prepared during the day is posted on the bulletin board in the  
-P-A-G-E-308
  280 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
main hall; a small show case is provided at the entrance of the cooking labora- 
tory, and as soon as a recipe is completed the dishes are arranged for sale. 
There is a constant demand for these products from teachers, students who 
are doing light housekeeping, and housekeepers in the town. 
The students figure the cost of the recipes and become acquainted with the 
market value of the food materials before and after preparation. They are 
permitted small servings of all the dishes, so that they may know the flavor 
of all of them. The added interest that the preparation of a salable product 
creates is apparent in the spirit with which the students work. The home- 
economics department becomes also a recognized factor in the community 
through its relation to the housewife, and has an opportunity to keep in touch 
in a small measure with the needs of the home.* 
The summer school at Lake Chautauqua especially emphasized a 
course in lunch-room and cafeteria management. This course proved 
interesting to teachers anticipating the responsibilities of school 
lunch rooms. 
In a description of the practical training in lunch-room manage- 
ment afforded by the Women’s Educational and Industrial Union 
of Boston, Miss Ethel M. Johnson says: 
The union offers to properly qualified students who are interested in the 
business side of domestic science opportunity for gaining practical experience 
in lunch-room and food-shop management while they are pursuing their college 
work. 
The lunch rooms at the Union and New England Kitchen (a branch of the 
union plant) conduct a business amounting to more than $250,000 yearly, and 
employ a force of over 100 paid workers. The school lunch department pre- 
pares and sends out daily luncheons for more than 5,000 high-school pupils in 
17 different centers. The food shop carries on a business amounting to over 
$100,000 yearly and has a force of 32 workers. Connected with the food shop 
is a catering department, a food laboratory, and a candy kitchen, each offering 
excellent opportunities for practical experience.’ 
The home economics department of the Oregon Agricultural 
College conducted a dining room in the Oregon Building throughout 
the entire time of the Panama Pacific Exposition. The work was 
installed with the double purpose, first, as training to senior women 
in the conduct of a commercial venture, and, second, as a working 
exhibit of student work in the Oregon Agricultural College. Not 
all senior home-economics women could be given the training, but 
about 42 of the students each received six weeks of training. One 
result that was not anticipated, but was most welcome, was a profit 
which placed $1,000 in a student loan fund for home-economic stu- 
dents and gave to the department at the college enough equipment 
to make possible the maintenance of a cafeteria on the campus and 
the furnishing in part of a residence for senior home-economics 
women. 
The cafeteria at Simmons College, Boston, Mass., was planned 
and equipped for 200, yet serves an average of 515 students daily 
+ Journal of Home Economies.

HOME ECONOMICS. 281 
with perfect orderliness and dispatch. From 12.30 to 1 o’clock it has 
been found possible to serve 10 students each minute. This has been 
accomplished largely by putting into the hands of the college seniors 
the regulation of the routing of the students, and of the hours when 
each group may be served. In the 20 school days of October, 1915, 
there were 10,280 meals served, averaging 16} cents each. The cafe- 
teria, though under the direct supervision of the professor of home 
economics, is each year placed in charge of a student who. has com- 
pleted the course during the previous year. This plan makes it 
possible to give a year’s excellent experience to some member of the 
class. 
It is pointed out in the Cleveland Survey that at the West Tech- 
nical High School a group of about 15 senior girls is specializing 
in lunch-room management, with a schedule providing 25 periods per 
' week for lunch room and 15 for academic work. The daily program 
is planned in advance so that when they report each girl knows ex- 
actly what she has to do and whether she is to work alone or with 
others. 
In the Polytechnic High School of San Francisco, the food classes 
are maintained without cost to the board of education, as all cooking 
is in family-sized portions and is sold either in the school lunch room 
or is combined into a teachers’ lunch and served to a group of in- 
structors. 
TRADE COOKING. 
In the Cleveland Survey, under “Household arts and school 
lunches”, the statement is made that: 
At the East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio, the work for senior and 
junior girls who specialize in foods and sanitation is trade cooking, and each 
year about 15 take it. They spend five periods a day in classroom work in 
addition to whatever catering they do outside. One of the most interesting and 
valuable features of the course is the accounting. Supplies for this work are 
not included in the regular food-supply budget for other classes. At stated 
times girls hand in their advance supply orders with estimated costs, and in- 
dividual members take turns in going to market and keeping accounts. 
HOT LUNCHES IN RURAL SCHOOLS, 
No other State has done as much with the rural-school lunch as 
the State of Washington. From Garfield County, Wash., comes 
this report: 
The majority of the schools here serve hot lunch in some form during the 
winter. The children enjoy it and do better work. The preparation of the 
lunch gives them ideas which in many cases are worked out at home. 
The teacher in charge of the Model Rural School, Geneva, Wash., 
after deciding that the children needed a hot lunch every day, took
-P-A-G-E-310
    282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
ene of the cloak rooms and converted it into a kitchenette. The 
work is carefully arranged so as to be shared by all, and “a few min- 
utes before noon we spend discussing the values of foods; what we will 
cook for to-morrow, its food value, and of what the lunch the chil- 
dren bring from home may consist in order to make a nearly perfect 
meal.” i 
That the hot-lunch plan is invaluable as a method of practical 
instruction in domestic science in the country districts is testified to 
by many communities. Marengo, Iowa, reports as follows: 
A new school law of Iowa states that domestic science must be taught after 
July 1, 1915. When school began last fall it was still a problem as to how it 
should be taught. Hot lunches were started, and by this means we are giving 
training in cookery. Directions are given and the girls are allowed to do the 
work alone. Once a week we have a lesson on food values and the theory of 
cooking. 
The rural school near Eagle Grove, Iowa, serves a hot lunch every 
day from December 1 to March, and “once or twice a week has a 
lesson from a textbook and a talk on food values and food principles.” 
From near Osceola, Iowa, comes the report that the equipment 
was purchased from a fund gained by giving an entertainment and a 
pie supper, and that “ the work was introduced not only to afford the 
children some hot food at noon, but to give them training in cookery.” 
A notable experiment in teaching homemaking in the typical rural 
school has been made in the Farm School, near Rock Hill, S.C. The 
cooking consists in preparing the midday lunch, in which all partici- 
pate; more formal lessons in cookery are given for the larger girls 
only. In sewing, the school reports: “We make those things for 
which a real need is felt. Towels are hemmed, sewing and cooking 
aprons planned and made, and we have even attempted a dress for a 
baby.” 
Mrs. Josephine Preston, State superintendent of schools of Wash- 
ington, points out the possibilities of the teacher’s cottage in connec- 
tion with this work: 
If there is a teacher’s cottage it may be used as a laboratory for domestic 
science. These cottages are equipped with the usual kitchen utensils, cook 
stoves, sinks or suitable washstands, and worktables. One of the teachers in 
our State who utilizes the district cottage for domestic science demonstration 
allows the pupils to prepare the noonday lunch of the school here. The 
farmers’ families contribute milk and potatoes and other vegetables for this 
community plan of noonday hot lunches at the school. The idea of linking the 
teacher’s cottage with domestic science is only passing from a remote possi- 
bility to a reality, but the rural schools in the future that give their most 
efficient training will feel that they have not been given their full opportunity 
until they have been given a teacher’s cottage in which to teach the fundamental 
principles of home economics.*

Several State educational institutions have published valuable 
bulletins concerning rural school lunches, among which are the fol. 
lowing: 
Oregon Agricultural College, “ Hot Lunches for Rural Schools.” 
University of Nebraska, “ Lunches for the Rural Schools.” 
Normal School of Washington, Cheney, ‘“ Hot Lunches in Rural Schools.” 
Kansas State Agricultural College, “ Home Economics in Village and Rural 
Schools.” 
PRACTICE COTTAGES. 
Interest in practice cottages continues to increase, and, with few 
exceptions, home economics teachers consider them the most desirable 
additions to department equipment. ; 
The Journal of Home Economics reports as follows on the practice 
cottage at the University of Washington: 
A small cottage which has been on the campus since the exposition of 1909 
has come into possession of the home economics department. 
The home economics decoration class worked out a color scheme. Textile 
students dyed unbleached muslin to screen the alcove. Students made braided 
rag rugs and dyed and wove others. They also wove pillow covers. Their 
only resource was a fund of $50 from the treasury of the home economics club 
of the university. 
The home economics. department of Iowa State Agricultural 
College was given an old residence on the campus and $5,000 to 
modernize the house and to furnish it complete. 
The Michigan Agricultural College home economics department 
has been given the residence long used by the president of the col- 
lege and will furnish and use it as a practice residence. 
The senior class in home economics at the University of Minne- . 
sota was so large during the year 1915-16 that a second practice 
house was made necessary in order that all seniors should have the 
desired experience in a residence. 
Two model apartments in Cleveland enable instruction to be given 
to 228 girls besides the usual classes in the formal laboratories. 
That the home economics schools in the United States are not alone 
in their interest in practice houses is illustrated by the report of the 
“ Girls’ Hostel in Christ Church, New Zealand.” ? 
The hostel is the practical training home of the girls attending the technical 
college. It is in charge of a principal and three student assistants, who are 
training as teachers of domestic science. The girls, after having a course in 
domestic science in the college, are sent to the hostel in groups, and they attend 
daily at the hostel for several weeks. 
HOME ECONOMICS IN COLORED SCHOOLS. 
Home economics occupies a prominent place in the education of 
the colored girl. Thoughtfully worked-out courses designed to give   
2 Blackmore, M. A., in Journal of Home Economics, December, 1915.
-P-A-G-E-312
    284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
thorough technical training are to be found in the Methodist girls’ 
homes, the Presbyterian girls’ seminaries, and in Tuskegee and 
Hampton Institutes and their outgrowth. Courses of varying de- 
grees of merit are to be found in practically all of the schools at- 
tended by girls. In a measure the work in most of the schools is 
handicapped by a lack of well-trained teachers acquainted with the 
conditions of the Negro homes and prepared to adapt the lessons to- 
the real needs of the pupils. 
In many of the Negro schools the home economics courses have 
failed to accomplish effective work through lack of cooperation with 
the boarding departments. In recognition of this weakness, special 
emphasis is now placed upon the maintenance of a close relation 
between the home economics department and the boarding depart- 
ment, where such a department exists within the school. The need 
of strong teachers, possessed of sufficient executive ability to carry 
on both types of work, is keenly felt. 
Scotia Seminary, in Concord, N. C., offers an example of a home- 
economics department which is closely related to the life of the insti- 
tution. The cooking teacher has the assignment of all work schedules 
and direct supervision of all the work in kitchens and dining rooms. 
The advanced classes prepare lunch to serve at the teachers’ table. 
A carefully established laundry schedule is maintained, and all per- 
sonal laundry is taken care of by the girls. 
The excellent training in home economics presented through class 
and institutional practice at Hampton Institute has been supple- 
mented by the use of a tea house, which provides a place where dainty 
service is possible and special orders can be prepared for sale. Classes 
in industrial dressmaking have recently been established. Similar 
classes are successfully maintained at Spelman Seminary, Tuskegee 
Institute, and other places. At Tuskegee Institute the preparation 
and sale of cooked dishes forms a large part of the technical training 
of the girls. 
Practice cottages are used as residences for the girls in some of 
the Negro schools; for example, at Tuskegee Normal and Industrial 
Institute, at Atlanta University, and at Thayer Home. The girls 
are given entire charge of the housekeeping in these cottages, and 
thus acquire a sense of personal responsibility. They become ac- 
quainted with the problems of the individual home, and in so far 
as the work is carefully supervised, they learn the best method of 
carrying on household activities. 
Probably no more interesting work in public colored schools has 
been developed than in Washington, D. C. Well-equipped lab- 
oratories, trained teachers, and careful supervision make possible 
a type of work that promises as great a development as the work
-P-A-G-E-313

in the white schools. During the spring bread contests held between 
the pupils in the graded schools roused much interest throughout 
those sections of the city in which the schools are located. In the 
vocational schools the work in sewing and dressmaking is especially 
planned to give the girls training in renovating and remodeling 
garments. : 
In the public colored schools of San Antonio, Tex., the home 
economics courses have been particularly well adapted to the needs 
of the pupils. Special cooking classes are provided for those boys 
who expect to become cooks and waiters on dining cars, and many 
boys are placed each summer. : 
Since funds have been made available by the Smith-Lever Act, 
the United States Department of Agriculture has cooperated with 
the State colleges to further the formation of farm makers’ clubs 
for rural Negro children, that the boys may become better farmers 
and the girls better home makers. 
The Interstate Industrial Arts Association, a federation of organi- 
zations, has brought together the colored teachers of Washington 
and Baltimore who are “interested in the industrial, economic, and 
home development of the Negro and in means of furthering such 
development through the schools.” Its aims are: (1) To round out 
the personality of the Negro through those phases of development 
that are dependent upon his industrial and economic growth, by a 
concerted effort directed from the school side; (2) to improve the 
conditions of living in the home and community and to effect a 
closer cooperation between the school and the home. This associa- 
tion hopes to become the nucleus about which the colored teachers 
of other States will organize. At the annual meeting in April, 
held in Washington, D. C., a large portion of the program was 
devoted to home-economics problems. 
HOME-ECONOMICS ASSOCIATIONS. 
At no time has home economics occupied so prominent a place on 
the programs of the various educational associations as during the 
the past year. The wide range of affiliations bespeaks the varied 
types of work that have developed and the lines of activity in 
which home-economics courses awaken an interest. In addition to 
the annual five days’ meeting of the American Home Economics 
Association, programs were held during the annual sessioris of the 
National Education Association. By an unusual arrangement of 
dates the American Home Economics Association held two annual 
meetings within twelve months—one in Seattle, Wash., August, 1915; 
the second in Ithaca, N. Y., in June, 1916. Home-economics subjects 
were also presented on the programs of the following organizations:

The National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education, St. Paul, 
Minn. 
American Chemical Society, Urbana, Ill. 
Pan American Scientific Congress, Washington, D. C. 
The Biennial Meeting of the National Federation of Women’s Clubs, New 
York City. 
Central Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers, Chicago, Il. 
Southern Conference for Education and Industry, New Orleans, La. 
Eastern Arts Association, Springfield, Mass. 
Western Drawing and Manual Training Association, Grand Rapids, Mich. 
Many States have held special home economics conferences inde- 
pendent of or in conjunction with State educational associations. 
The home economics teachers in most large cities have begun to form 
associations. In some cases the city associations have allied themselves 
with the housewives’ leagues, and through them are assuming active 
responsibilities outside of the schoolroom. State organizations have 
been working on unified State courses of study or other pertinent 
problems. Local associations are also making a study of special prob- 
lems. 
EXTENSION TEACHING. 
Undoubtedly the extension teaching of home economics as fostered 
and promoted by the Smith-Lever Act is one of the most significant 
educational movements of the time. 
The little girl of the ungraded school and the mother in the rural 
home are alike interested in subjects related to homemaking. At the 
present time the demand in the extension service for well-trained 
women with the qualities of agreeable personality, tact, and practical 
experience, and accurate scientific knowledge which will enable them 
to reach all types of women, far exceeds the supply. To find capable 
women, and to give them the exact information which must be at 
their command, is the peculiar province of the agricultural and 
mechanical colleges in the North and West. In the South this same 
type of teaching has been undertaken by the State colleges for women 
as well as by the agricultural and mechanical colleges. 
Winthrop College, at Rock Hill, S. C., held a month’s school in 
January for the women county agents. The extension department 
paid the agents their regular monthly salary during their time of at- 
tendance and the agents paid their own local expenses. Since many 
of these women are graduates of Winthrop College, and have had 
courses in home economics, the arrangement was most successful. 
Similiar courses of instruction have been established at the 
Women’s College of Florida, at Tallahassee; at the women’s Normal 
and Industrial Colleges in North Carolina, Kentucky, Alabama, 
Tennessee, and other Southern States.

HOME ECONOMICS. 287 
  The organization of extension teaching is somewhat different in 
other sections of the country, but the need of careful instruction for 
the extension workers is equally great. 
To discover good extension material among the more mature stu- 
dents, to develop in them the ability to present in agreeable form 
the knowledge that is theirs, to detail them to some form of rural 
service that will thoroughly acquaint them with rural conditions, is 
a task that must be assumed by the home economics departments of 
the State colleges. 
The function of the county agent has been described as follows: 
A county agent is one who demonstrates, both practically and scientifically, 
subjects which pertain to home and community betterment. She may give these 
demonstrations to groups or clubs, or she may demonstrate to the individual 
farm woman or girl in the home. Before she can do the latter she must gain 
the confidence of the housewife. Often some simple service rendered the house- 
wife at the psychological moment in a quiet, unobtrusive manner opens up the 
pathway to her heart. She resents the teacher, but she soon learns to welcome 
the cooperator and helper. Once the county agent has proved her ability in 
these capacities she becomes a source of inspiration, then a counselor, and, as 
her field of activities leads her from the home into the community, she becomes 
a leader among the women of her county. 
The problems confronting the county agent are as broad and as comprehensive 
as the family, the home, and the community. To meet these problems success- 
fully she must possess a personality which disarms criticism and arouses enthu- 
siasm, a power to sense situations quickly and an adaptability which enables 
her to render the most humble service with a willingness that wins admira- 
tion." 
In an effort to assist the rural teacher, who by the law of Iowa must 
teach some phase of home economics throughout the year, the Iowa 
State College at Ames has arranged a correspondence course, which 
is announced as follows: 
This is a course of 80 simple lessons so arranged that they can be easily 
applied in the schoolroom. No elaborate equipment will be necessary to carry 
out the work in the school, and only the practical phases of home work are 
included. The course begins with a few lessons on the principles of sanitation; 
then takes up briefly personal hygiene, and home management, and more fully, 
cooking and sewing. The subjects are treated so that a lesson prepared in the 
course is adaptable to the schoolroom with but little additional labor. 
Enrollments may be made at any time. The lessons will be sent in the form 
of circulars containing an assignment of five lessons each. The fee is $2. 
One definite form of home economics education, i. e., the printed 
article relating to the management of home affairs, has been given 
more attention during the past year than ever before, and many 
home-economics teachers have come to realize that teaching through 
the printed page is of great importance. A committe of 50 for 
journalism in the field of home economics presented a program at   
1Journal of Home Economics, July, 1916. 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  288 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
the American Home Economics Association at the annual meeting 
held in Ithaca, N. Y. It proved to be one of the most interesting 
and important sessions of that association meeting. 
CONCLUSIONS, 
There is noticeable growth both in extent and in quality of in- 
struction in home economics in universities, colleges, normal schools, 
and in public-school systems. 
There is a marked effort to relate school instruction in home eco- 
nomics to home life and home conditions. In public schools this 
effort is observed in changed methods of lesson presentation and in 
the extended use of practice cottages. 
In colleges and universities there is a manifest desire to strengthen 
teacher-training courses, that the graduates may more easily meet 
the needs of the pupils and be enabled to adjust themselves more 
quickly to local school needs. 
The rapid growth of extension teaching has made new demands 
upon colleges and universities for the installation of courses with 
special adaptation to the needs of those anticipating this type of 
employment. 
The recent school surveys have recognized home economics as an 
important portion of public-school education, and have given un- 
usual prominence to discussions relating to this line of work. 
The desire among teachers for a better professional spirit has 
been manifested by their interest in numerous conferences and their 
attendance at local, State, and National home-economics association 
meetings.

CHAPTER XVII. 
EDUCATION IN THE HOME. 
By Mrs. Freperic Scuorr, Director, and Erten C. LomsBarp, Secretary, Home 
Education Division, Bureau of Education. 
Schools may be measured for efliciency from the outside, as in 
recent school surveys; but the home must necessarily be judged 
from the inside. Coincident with the attempt of schools to fit them- 
selves into their environment and to contribute more and more to 
the development of the children is the attempt of those interested 
in the home to find some working basis for awakening home makers 
to a consciousness of the needs and responsibilities of the home and 
of the community and an effective plan of home education. Or- 
ganizations of parents, women’s organizations, health boards, peri- 
odicals, and other agencies have done much to bring about a new 
sense of responsibility in home making and an intelligent desire to 
meet the obligation. During the past year, particularly, there has 
been an effort throughout the country to see that parents are in- 
formed regarding the physical care of children, especially young 
babies, and to improve hygienic conditions generally. 
Some effort has also been made toward intellectual development 
in the home. It is realized more and more that this important phase 
of home life should not be neglected, since without it the home is a 
barren place and gives meager opportunity for the development 
of the whole nature of the individual, the unfolding of the mind, 
and the development of will power, which are so set te a at the 
beginning of life in the upbuilding of character. Increasing ac- 
tivities have been noted in social settlement and neighborhood 
houses through the establishment of homes for workers that are in- 
tended to be model homes. 
Significant signs of progress are noted in the effort to coordinate 
the work of all existing agencies, social, economic, religious, educa- 
tional, and philanthropic, with local, State, and educational agencies, 
in solving the problems of home life, the determining forces in the 
character of national life.

    290 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
SCHOOL AND HOME IN RECENT SURVEYS. 
The school is realizing as never before its dependence upon home 
life and its relation thereto, as well as its relation to the community. 
Dr. Charles Hubbard Judd, in the Cleveland survey volume on 
“Measuring the Work of the Public Schools,” says in regard to 
causes of failure of children in school: 
We find that there are children whose home environment is bad. These 
unfortunate children can not find opportunity or encouragement to study. 
* * * The community can not afford to let a child grow discouraged, be- 
cause the discouraged child becomes an unproductive citizen. * * * The 
failure of a child in school because of adverse home surroundings is a large 
problem in which the community should be more interested than any individual. 
On the rural side the problem is well stated in the survey of three 
counties in Alabama made by the State department of education. 
In summing up the causes of failure in school children under totally 
different conditions, the report points out that the influences of the 
home are back of the discrepancies of school life. “A nation of 
tenants will never be a nation of home builders. Farm tenancy has 
a decided and detrimental influence on school conditions.” 
In analyzing the factors of vocational efficiency for the San An- 
tonio survey, Prof. J. F. Bobbitt asserts that the fundamental aspect 
of the training of children takes place “in the home, in the street, 
in play activities, observations, and taking part in the human activi- 
ties in the community.” He points out to teachers the need of social 
contact with families in order that they may know the lives and 
home conditions of the children as fully as they know books and edu- 
cational methods. 
The recent “ Study” of the Dansville High School, by J. Murray 
Foster, contains a special section on “The Parents.” Mr. Foster 
describes four means used to awaken the interest of parents in the 
school: (1) Publicity through the press; (2) handbooks printed and 
distributed by the board of education; (3) reports and notices sent 
to the parents; and (4) meetings of the parents held in the school- 
house. The handbook proved helpful, but most interest was aroused 
through the parents’ meetings. 
Changed home conditions are also used by Dr. Alfred Hall-Quest 
in his recent investigation of home studying? as the basis for a de- 
mand that supervised study at school take the place of assigned study 
at home. Dr. Hall-Quest analyzes the factors of modern home life, 
especially in cities, summing up as follows: 
The instinct of self-preservation with its expression of the individual’s inde- 
pendence has found unlimited stimulus in American democracy. Once the child 
remained consciously and quite willingly dependent upon the parents for a

  EDUCATION IN THE HOME. 291 
number of years. Beyond the home there were only a few occasional attrac- 
tions indulged in, and these did not materially disturb family unity or stability. 
But to-day the boy seven or eight years old begins to earn “ spending money ” 
by selling papers, running errands, or doing odd jobs. Parents pay their chil- 
dren a few pennies a day for doing household work. The child is early taught— 
and rightly so—to be economically independent. By the exercise of this inde- 
pendence the child becomes skilled and even versatile. His plasticity, curios- 
ity, and energy make possible a wide range of information and ability, beyond 
that of the parents in many instances. The older children are even more 
independent. They usually pay for their board and room at home. They ex- 
ercise their own judgment in selection of wearing apparel. They make acquaint- 
ances outside of the circle of friends frequented by the parents. Resulting 
from this economic independence is a decrease in respect for parental authority. 
The children may even feel superior to their parents. 
The industrial unity of the early family required that every child contribute 
to the general store of supplies. Practically everything needful was made at 
home, Candles, clothing, furniture, food—all necessities were made by the 
family. There was constant exchange of service. The division of labor was 
individual. and familial. The small family group was quite sufficient unto 
itself. To-day, however, industry is widely differentiated. Few things are 
made at home. Many families rent apartments and board. There is little or 
no visible evidence of interdependence. Each member of the family feels that 
he owes nothing to the others and that they owe nothing to him beyond mone- 
tary assistance—and this is an elastic band. 
The school child in these independent family groups soon finds that there 
is little time, little inclination, and less ability to serve him along intellectual 
lines. Ideals and interests have become so individualized that only with dif- 
ficulty can any member of the family render competent service to the child 
attending school. Moreover, providing the child with a suggestive and hygienic 
study environment is unthought of or at best not understood. The child must 
attend the school—so the law demands, and what a relief to the mother !—but 
beyond the common. necessities little is contributed in many homes toward the 
success of the child’s career. 
THE VISITING TEACHER MOVEMENT.* 
One of the most vital factors in.drawing the home and the school 
more closely together is the employment of the “ visiting teacher,” 
as instituted in several large cities. Boards of education and phil- 
anthropic educational organizations have recognized the value of 
visiting teachers to the efficiency of the schools, and this movement 
has shown marked development during the past year. 
The need of cooperation of parents has long been felt by the teach- 
ers. In the village and open country, teachers have had better op- 
portunity to reach the homes, and some teachers of a progressive 
type have managed to enter into the community life of the school 
district and in various ways become acquainted with the home life 
of the children.   
1For an interesting statement of this new field see: The Visiting Teacher in New 
York City: A statement of the Function and an Analysis of the Work of the, Visiting 
Teacher Staff of the Public Education Association from 1912 to 1915, inclusive, by 
Harriet M. Johnson, June, 1916,
-P-A-G-E-320
    292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
Similarly kindergartners have kept in close touch with the parents 
and home conditions and have found home visiting an important 
factor in solving the problems of the individual child. One report 
received by the bureau shows a record of several thousand visits made 
by two kindergartners during the past year. 
While grade and high school teachers have done much home visit- 
ing and tried to meet the many demands outside of the school, it has 
been impossible to meet all of the demands of a large school district 
in the limited time remaining after school hours. Hence the visiting 
teacher. She has come into existence to supplement the work of the 
class teacher, especially in cases of retarded and failing pupils. Sym- 
pathetic understanding and cooperation with the class-room teacher 
and actual knowledge of teaching methods, as well as familiarity 
with all the forces at work in the community, detrimental to the 
progress of the children and knowledge of all the social agencies ex- 
isting in the community which might be called into cooperation not 
only in their city but outside institutions that might be of service, 
are necessary if the work is to be effective. The visiting teacher must 
be well versed in the traditions and prejudices of the foreign coun- 
tries from which the parents may have come, and must have had 
actual experience both in teaching and in social service. The visit- 
ing teacher is the mutual friend who brings the parent and teacher 
together and serves not only the school, but the home through her 
sympathetic contact, so that home and school work together to benefit 
the children. 
PROGRESS OF THE MOVEMENT. 
In California a State law was passed to the effect that “Boards of 
school trustees or city boards of education of any school district, may 
employ teachers to be known as home teachers, not exceeding one 
such home teacher for every 500 units of average daily attendance in 
the common school of said district as shown by the report of the 
county superintendent for the next preceding school year.” The 
duties of the home teacher are divided between the two domains of 
home and school. 
The following are other items of progress reported from various 
localities during the year: 
New York, N. Y.—Visiting teachers have received official recognition in New 
York City. Six visiting teachers have been employed by the board of educa- 
tion, and 7,721 homes visited at least once during one year. More than 53 
agencies have been named as cooperating with the visiting teachers, but this: 
does not represent the large number actually cooperating in this work. 
Boston, Mass.—Visiting teachers or school visitors have won unofficial recog- 
nition in Boston. Twenty visitors are at work in connection with one high 
school and the grammar schools from which the children come to this high 
school. Seventeen social agencies cooperate with the school visitors. Hight 
hundred homes were visited and upward of 1,200 calls made.
-P-A-G-E-321
EDUCATION IN THE HOME. 293 
Rochester, N. Y—A_ visiting teacher’ is maintained in the public-school 
system and there are eight visiting nurses under the board of health. All city 
agencies are in close cooperation. Students in the normal school are made 
acquainted with agencies that can be called on for the welfare of the child. 
Montclair, N. J—The home department in connection with the public schools 
and supported by the General Federation of Women’s Clubs has a visiting 
teacher whose work it is to go into the homes of foreigners and help them to 
higher standards of living. 
Gary, Ind.—The district plan has worked favorably here. The district 
teacher or register teacher is the point of contact between the home and the 
school. She visits the home of each child at least once a year and keeps the 
same district as long as she is in the school. 
Columbus, Ohio.—The visiting teacher is employed by the Parent-Teacher 
Association. In 10 months on half-time work the visiting teacher made 513 
visits; 156 cases were handled, 12 of which were referred to the truant officer, 
15 to the nurse, and 17 to other agencies. 
Baltimore, Md.—A nurse who is also a social worker is paid by private sub- 
scriptions. Perceptible improvement in daily attendance of school children has 
resulted. : 
Springfield, Mass.—The visiting teacher gathers the school history, the story 
the home gives of the child’s development, and the knowledge of the child’s 
environment, and habits outside of school. * * * She cooperates with ex- 
isting agencies for social welfare. Work here has been done in cooperation 
with the psychological laboratory. 
Newton, Mass.—A school and home teacher is employed under the board of 
education. Some time is given to teaching. 
Lincoln, Nebr.—Room teachers, about 50 in number, are assigned groups of 
pupils of not more than 30. These teachers become visiting teachers and 
are responsible for visits to the homes of the pupils. 
FIRST CONFERENCE OF VISITING TEACHERS. 
Much interesting and valuable data were brought together at the 
section devoted to “The Visiting Teacher” and “The Problems of 
Retardation and Delinquency” at the meeting of the National Edu- 
cation Association at New York City in July. The visiting-teacher 
idea was developed as well as the attendance-oflicer idea. Dr. Kath- 
erine B. Davis said, in regard to the effectiveness of the visiting 
teacher : 
The work of the visiting teacher is one of the most important things that 
can be done in a large city where the teachers in the grades have such large 
classes to deal with. It is a way of tying the family, the school, and the teacher 
together. 
Howard W. Nudd, in giving his address of welcome, said: 
The visiting-teacher work * * * seeks to be preventive, by getting in 
touch with the difficulty early, before it has had a chance to grow acute and, 
by removing the causes, minimize the growth of maladjustment and thus make 
unnecessary the more drastic and sometimes ineffectual corrective treatment 
later on. 
In speaking of the importance of this work to the community, 
Miss Elizabeth P. Durham asserted that the visiting teacher per- 
61355°—16——21  
-P-A-G-E-322
  294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
forms a function which can not be well performed by any other 
group in the community. She said: 
Representing the school, she has the entrée which thousands of families 
absolutely deny to other social workers. * * * In addition to helping the 
teacher to do a more effective. job within the school, she recreates bad home 
life without the school and makes available for the use of the school the many 
social organizations existing for family and individual service. 
Miss Jane McCrady, head worker of the Ellis Memorial and EI- 
dredge. House, Boston, Mass., advocated giving to future teachers, as 
a part of their normal school preparation, an intelligent training in 
social service. Miss Elizabeth Roemer gave an account of the work 
of visiting teachers in Gary, Ind., where each classroom teacher is 
given charge of a certain district in order to bring her in touch with 
the home life of her pupils. 
Miss Harriet M. Johnson summed up the function of the visiting 
teacher as follows: 
To recognize, to study, and to respect the individuality of the child; to this 
end to establish informal relationships with him; and to adapt conditions of 
the home, school, and society to his needs. 
FEDERAL AID IN HOME EDUCATION. 
Nearly all departments of the Federal Government have con- 
tributed something toward the betterment of the home during the 
past year. The Department of Labor issued a bulletin on “ Baby- 
Week Campaigns,” which deals with the organizations of such cam- 
paigns, programs, baby-welfare information, etc. A section of the 
Department of Agriculture yearbook contained an article by Helen 
W. Atwater on “ Selection of Household Equipment,” which is help- 
ful to home makers. It deals with planning for buying; choosing 
for necessity, convenience, and pleasure; fitting equipment; what 
makes a well-furnished house; economy in cost and care; general and 
permanent equipment, etc. 
The Bureau of Indian Affairs is making efforts to better the 
Indian homes. Commissioner Sells says: “Approximately three- 
fifths of the Indian infants die before the age of 5 years. * * * 
One Indian baby out of every three dies before it is 3 years old 
because it does not have the right kind of care.” The Department 
of the Interior has just issued a bulletin called “Indian Babies” to 
meet this need. 
The Commissioner of Education has said that “the home, the 
primitive and primary institution for the education of children, is 
still the most important agency for education for life—mental, moral, 
physical, industrial, economic, social, and civic. The school is only 
supplementary. Any agency, therefore, that would promote right 
education most effectively must find some means of cooperating with
-P-A-G-E-323
  EDUCATION IN THE HOME. 295 
the home and of helping parents, who are the most constant—and 
should be the most effective—teachers of their children.” 
The Federal Government gave recognition to the importance of 
home education in the establishment of the Home Education Divi- 
sion in the Bureau of Education, with the cooperation of the 
National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations, in 
this way assuming the consideration of education from birth to 
maturity, for 12 months in the year instead of 10, for 24 hours in the 
day instead of 5 hours. : 
It is the purpose of the Bureau of Education to stimulate intellec- 
tual life in the home, to assist in the training of the children before 
they are of school age, to help boys and girls to further their educa- 
tion after they have left school, and to bring about a closer coopera- 
tion of home and school. 
The actual cooperation of over 150,000 women has made it pos- 
sible to reach upwards of 240,000 homes with information on the 
care and training of the baby and other reading matter relating to 
home making. During the past year at least 20,000 mothers of young 
children have received the pamphlet en the “ Care of the Baby.” 
To bring about a closer cooperation of home and school, hundreds 
of pamphlets on “ How to Organize a Parent-Teacher Association ” 
have been distributed. 
NATIONAL READING CIRCLE. 
The National Reading Circle of the Bureau of Education came 
into existence because of the demand of boys and girls, men and 
women, to read under direction in the home. A committee of pro- 
fessors of literature in some of the universities was formed to select 
the books in some of the courses. This committee was composed 
of Prof. William Lyon Phelps, of Yale University; Prof. C. Al- 
phonso Smith, of the University of Virginia; Prof. Richard Burton, 
of the University of Minnesota; and Prof. Charles Forster Smith, 
of the University of Wisconsin.

School superintendents, principals, and teachers, as well as librari- 
ans and the press throughout the country, have created interest in 
home reading. State libraries and library commissions have placed 
the books recommended in these courses at the disposal of the read- 
ers in their respective States. 
In California a reading club of about fifty mothers has been formed 
which meets weekly. With a chosen leader these mothers discuss 
parts of books which have been assigned for them to read during 
the preceding week. They write summaries of the books when they

complete them. Many other reading clubs have been formed and 
are doing creditable work in various parts of the country. 
About five thousand readers are now enrolled in the National 
Reading Circle, but this does not represent the large number of per- 
sons known to be actually reading the books selected. 
HOME EDUCATION THROUGH EXTENSION COURSES. 
Among the new developments in home education during the year 
is the announcement by the Massachusetts State department of edu- 
cation of correspondence study courses for residents of the State. 
This will give men and women an opportunity to study at home in 
their special field of endeavor. Sixty-six courses have been offered 
covering a wide range of subjects. University extension courses in 
reading and study have been in operation in Wisconsin, Pennsyl- 
vania, Iowa, Chicago, and elsewhere. 
PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS. 
The Parent-Teacher Association movement has grown steadily dur- 
ing the past year. Recognizing their own need, parents have made 
united and earnest efforts in various parts of the country to better 
their conditions by coming together to talk over their problems. 
They have joined with the teacher in discussing their problems. 
Every State has joined the nation-wide movement in the interest of 
the home and the school to a greater or less extent. Thirty-four State 
conferences of parents and teachers on home education and child wel- 
fare were held during the past year. 
Three national conferences on home education were held during the 
year—one at the meeting of the Department of Superintendence of 
the National Education Association at Detroit, one in connection with 
the meeting of the National Education Association in New York, and 
one in Nashville, Tenn. Thousands of district and local conferences 
were held throughout the country. The welfare of the child and 
home education were the chief topics of discussion at these meetings. 
At the New York meeting, the cooperation of mothers and kinder- 
gartners was under discussion. 
Miss Elizabeth Harrison, of Chicago, in her address on “ Mothers 
without kindergartens,” said: 
There are many thousands of young mothers in our land who long to give the 
advantages of the kindergarten training to their children, but who are powerless 
to accomplish this because of the apathy, the ignorance, or the poverty of the 
community in which they live. 
But the children of these many earnest mothers need not be entirely without 
the development of mind and body which the kindergarten brings. There is 
much which such mothers, alone and unaided, may do along kindergarten lines 
if they will give as much time and effort to this important thought of awaken-
-P-A-G-E-326
    298 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
ing and nourishing aright the best instincts of their children as they are now 
giving to less vitally important subjects. 
The thoughtful young mother realizes that there is a vast difference between 
a strong, well “ young animal” and her child’s possession of a well-controlled, 
serviceable body which obeys the slightest command of the spirit within. 
The kindergartner understands this and gives to her children experiences in 
the coordination of their muscles by letting them walk on a raised board, or a 
chalk line on the floor, by encouraging their running or skipping or hopping 
in time to loud or soft music, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. The 
isolated mother may not be a musician or she may not have time to play on 
the piano for her children’s lively dancing, but she can sing as she works and 
they can run or skip or dance in time to her song. I once heard Miss Frances 
Willard state that she learned to dance by keeping time to a hymn which her 
mother would sing, over and over again, for her and her little sister to dance 
by. Learning to go up and down stairs alone, to climb fences, to swing on 
branches of trees are all helpful means of giving the child confidence in the use 
of his body. 
Again the kindergartner knows how much added zest the imagination gives 
to all such exercise and the breadth of sympathy which it adds throughout all 
life, so she soon leads her children to dramatize the world about them. They 
learn to play that they are flying birds, or fluttering butterflies, or running 
brooks, or growing trees, or the rushing and whirling wind, as well as to play 
that they are mammas and papas, grocerymen and messenger boys, or other hu- 
man agencies. For she, the kindergartner, has learned that the child’s simple 
reenacting of the activities which surround him is helpful to him not only 
in exercising his body more vigorously but also in awakening his interest in 
nature and in the right kind of human activities. May not a mother in the 
midst of her many cares still find time while she performs her necessary work 
to play thus with her child? A few words on her part will start the little one 
along a whole line of dramatic representation which will be as good for the soul 
as it is for the body. 2 
Again, the kindergartner knows the influence of stories upon the life of the 
child—how they help to lift him out of his own narrow little world into an 
almost limitless world of ideals and possibilities. Surely the young mother 
who cares enough for her child to desire to awaken right ideas in his mind 
can soon train herself into a story-teller! It will give to her an added charm 
in the eyes of her children which will last far into their growing boyhood and 
girlhood. Wisely selected stories, well told, bring an impetus as can no other 
means toward the real culture which comes from a love of literature and of 
history. 
The kindergartner encourages the child to express his ideas by using chalk. 
crayon, pencil, or, when skilled enough, with water-color paints. The mother 
need not be an artist to start these lines of interest in her child. His own 
eager little self will gladly seize the opportunity for self-expression through 
these easy means of representations. Again and again I have known mothers 
to be astonished at the tinsuspected ability of their children to express them- 
selves in this way when given the free use of a small blackboard and chalk. 
Last, but not least, the kindergartner realizes the social value of the child’s 
commingling with other children near his own stage of growth or development 
and consequently divides her children into groups of helpers and helped, thus 
teaching them to bear and forbear, to respect the rights of others, and to en- 
rich their own small lives with the ideas and experiences of other small lives 
that lie nearer their comprehension than do the ideas and expressions of grown.

up people. The only way in which the isolated mother can compensate for the 
lack of this great influence in her child’s life is by becoming as a little child 
herself and striving to understand the child’s point of view. If she does this 
her reward will be rich and wonderful, for it will bring to her a glimpse of 
her child’s inner world of which without this comradeship she will know nothing. 
Miss Lucy Wheelock, of the Kindergarten Training School, Bos- 
ton, Mass., spoke on the “ Need of Preparedness for Service.” She 
referred particularly to preparedness for the girls. She said’: 
Every woman, be she mother, sister, or aunt, needs to know how to “live 
with children” in the spirit of Froebel’s motto. Hence she should have a 
liberal course in child study, including child hygiene, child psychology, child 
literature, games and plays, and occupations. The laws of life and growth 
should be unfolded to her through a study of biology, and the storybook of 
nature, “the dear old nurse,” becomes her daily text. ‘The person with a 
story ” is the best friend of children, and no teacher or mother should be with- 
out a story. To give the story means knowledge of literature—an acquaintance 
with the myth, the legend, the folk tale and fairy tale. A song and a lullaby 
take equal rank with a story as part of a woman’s life equipment. Asylum 
children and tenement-house children miss many of the goods of fortune. Their 
greatest lack is the “ mothering” which finds expression in the cradle song, 
in the songs without words, which the mother heart devises for the awakening 
of the child’s soul. 
In Daddy-Long-Legs and in The Dear Enemy, Jean Webster has pictured the 
difference between The Home and a home. 
The story, song, and play are necessary to the atmosphere of a home. “No 
one study of any college curriculum or of any finishing school can be compared 
to the intimate study of child life as suggested by Froebel’s “ Mother-Play ” 
with its accompanying store of songs and plays. 
Instinct is usually wise and leads to a desirable goal. In motherhood of 
human beings it must be supplemented by insight and training. 
Play is instinctive, and children with half a chance will get the benefit of 
nature’s tuition. But with the artificial and crowded conditions of city life, 
play can not be free and natural. Play spaces are lacking and incentives as well. 
Organization and guidance are needed for the play instinct, as for any other, 
that it may reach its full fruition. 
To be a friend of children is to be a playmate. For this reason our girls 
should know how to play. They should have a repertoire of plays and games— 
and best of all, the spirit of play. It is this spirit of play which keeps the 
zest and freshness of life. It is the root of art and the sweetener of tasks. 
And, finally, every woman needs to know her neighbors and her relations to 
them. We may call this study of the neighborhood, sociology or social welfare, 
or any other name. The main thing is to secure the feeling of responsibility 
which makes each human being his brother’s keeper, or her sister’s keeper. 
The American home training is charged with a serious lack—a lack of the 
sense of responsibility for the rights and welfare of others. No lack could be 
more deplorable. The family tie, which binds together parents and children, 
brothers and sisters, is the first to strengthen. Next the bond which holds to- 
gether communities with common interests and common claims for weal or woe. 
Beyond the community is the State with its call for loyal service, and last that 
“ great society ” of world citizenship. Loyalty to the family, to the State, to 
the great human family wherever gathered—this the aim of our course in 
social service.  
-P-A-G-E-328

Mothers, you are the home makers! You are the true “ keepers of the city ”! 
Your daughters, too, are to be home makers. Give them the training that they 
may live better the lives you meant to live. 
ACTIVITIES OF PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS. 
Among the activities of parent-teacher associations that seem to be 
typical are: 
San Diego, Cal——Conducting baby health centers. 
Mitchell, S. Dak.—Promotion of physical inspection of school children. 
San Antonio, Tex.—Established a dental clinic. 
New Jersey.—A traveling baby health exhibit made available by parcel post. 
Pamphlets on the care of the baby in Italian, German, Hungarian, Yiddish, and 
English. : 
Providence, R. I—Prenatal clinic in hospital. 
Nashville, Tenn.—The children’s clinic reports 1,031 treatments. 
Portland, Oreg.—The parents’ educational bureau has examined 2,000 babies 
and helped 1,500 parents. 
Denver, Colo.—Three thousand children registered for home gardens. Pro- 
vided lunch rooms in high-schools. 
Oakland, Cal.—Established school cafeteria in Washington school and made 
it self-supporting. Supplies for school luncheon provided by parent-teacher 
association and pupils prepare the food under direction of their teacher in a 
one-room schoolhouse. 
Twombly, Colo.—Organization of 300 girls in seventh and eighth grades for 
education in home making. " 
Montgomery, Ala.—Provided kitchen utensils and dishes for the domestic de- 
partment of one of the schools. Conducted an antigrippe campaign. 
Texas.—Over 50 parent-teacher associations include in their programs the 
value of the kindergarten, home and school gardening, and playgrounds. 
Chatham, N. J.—Helped organize girls’ home culture clubs with 75 members. 
Some other types of work reported by parent-teacher associations 
are: Providing heating and ventilating plants; providing shower 
baths for boys; giving talking machines; installing an electric clock; 
purchasing pictures and pianos for schools; furnishing schoolrooms; 
equipping playgrounds; providing motion-picture machines; es- 
tablishing social centers; cooperative investigation to correct curricu- 
lum; sewing classes to teach girls to make their own clothes; rest 
rooms; providing milk for children not properly nourished; drinking 
fountains to replace open pails in schoolhouses; placing warning 
signs to motorists at approaches to schools; establishing State loan 
funds for education of boys; lessons to school children on table man- 
ners; organizing mothers’ study clubs; furnishing layettes to ex- 
pectant mothers; child-welfare exhibit ; helping to have streets graded 
and paved from school buildings to business districts; physical-cul- 
ture classes for mothers; building and equipping kindergartens; es- 
tablishing room for anemic children under conditions of correct 
feeding; all night summer camp for mothers and babies in a park;
-P-A-G-E-329

securing medical inspection; flagpoles for school yards; clean-up 
weeks. 
In Oregon a local junior exposition. was held to show parents 
the great variety of children’s interests and the ways in which they 
can direct those interests into constructive work by furnishing 
materials and tools. 
MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS IN HOME EDUCATION. 
Negro mothers organize-—The effort of Negro mothers to learn 
more about home making and child training has resulted in a 
national organization which now has membership in 17 States. 
Second annual home education towr.—-The second joint tour of the 
United States Bureau of Education and the National Congress of 
Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations took place in March, 1916. 
Forty-two meetings were held. The topics of discussion were: Coop- 
eration of parents and teachers; the responsibility of the home and 
how to meet it; measures for saving babies; and continuation educa- 
tion for boys and girls and men and women in the home. Many of the 
meetings were held in rural districts. The States visited were Vir- 
ginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, 
and Tennessee. 
School for mothers in Detroit—The recent bequest of a million 
dollars by Mrs. Thomas Palmer, of Detroit, for the establishment of 
a school for education in home making and child nurture is another 
effort to place the home on a higher, more intelligent basis. The 
tuition of this school is to be free to those who are unable to pay 
tuition. 
Baby-week campaigns——Many baby-saving campaigns have been 
carried on during the past few years, but the “ Baby-week cam- 
paign” in March planned by the General Federation of Women’s 
Clubs in cooperation with the Children’s Bureau of the United 
State Department of Labor was Nation-wide and called for the 
cooperation of every National, State, and local organization. State, 
county, and city boards of health, as well as school, philanthropic 
and religious agencies, worked for the success of the campaign. It 
was a united effort to reduce the loss of infant life throughout the 
country by placing educational material in the hands of parents 
through lectures, moving pictures, clinics, etc. 
For immigrant mothers.—Five classes of immigrant mothers have 
been conducted, with 25 in each class, in Chicago, Tl. 
One class received 15-minute talks, with the aid of an interpreter 
if necessary, on preventable diseases. A kindergartner took charge 
of the children who were obliged to accompany the mothers. This 
class voluntarily requested instructions in English. Soup was served
-P-A-G-E-330
    
302 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
after each class was dismissed. Another class of 25 Italian mothers 
received instructions on the proper food for children. A class of 
Italian mothers were taught to make clothing for children. The 
Woman’s Club furnished the material, including trimmings, and a 
pattern publishing company contributed 1,000 patterns. A class of 
Bohemian mothers learned something about proper and improper 
methods of punishment and were shown how to make newspaper 
toys and finger plays. 
In mining towns.—In three mining towns in Tlinois—Auburn, 
Thayer, and Virden—during the summer when the mines have been 
closed and the men idle, an afternoon and an evening school has 
been conducted in each town, under the direction of Miss Frances 
Wetmore of Chicago. Small groups of women have been reached. 
The teacher made a house-to-house canvass, gathered the mothers 
together, and went to one of the homes, where instruction was given 
in the care and training of children, English speaking, sewing, and 
cooking. The same teacher taught the men English and civics in the 
evening. In spite of the heat, the newness of the work, and some 
previously unsuccessful attempts at night schools, about 100 men 
were under instruction. 5 
Cooperation of National Organization for Child Welfare.—Thirty 
national organizations of women in the United States, representing 
a membership of 5,000,000, have united in the National Council of 
Women. This organization has joined the International Council 
of Women which includes councils of 26 different nations. Child 
welfare is a universal interest. A department of child welfare has 
been formed to promote cooperation of all, either by influence or 
by work. This is a new and larger avenue through which the wel- 
fare of the child may be promoted.

  CHAPTER XVIII. 
KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 
By Atmira M. Wincuester, Specialist in Kindergarten Practice, Bureau of 
Education, and Louise ScHorretp, Editor, National Kindergarten Associa- 
tion. 
EXTENSION OF KINDERGARTENS.! 
During the year 1914-15, the number of kindergartens increased 
from 8,825 to 9,486, providing an enrollment of 486,800 children, as 
compared with 465,868 during the preceding year. Complete figures 
for 1916 are not yet available, but a still further growth is evident. 
Of the kindergartens newly established during 1914-15, 620 were 
public and 41 other than public. Fifteen years ago private kinder- 
tens numbered practically twice as many as those in public schools. 
California reports the largest number of new kindergartens; 119 
classes were added to its public schools in 1914-15. This record is 
due mainly to the success of the field secretary of the National Kin- 
dergarten Association in inducing parents to petition for kinder- 
gartens as the State law permits. 
The petition plan—The method of work continued with such 
success has been, first, to secure resolutions on the part of the Federa- 
tion of Women’s Clubs, the Congress of Mothers, and the Women’s 
Christian Temperance Union to have individual clubs secure signa- 
tures to petitions. The resolution passed by each organization in 
the State is then printed on the petition form used by the local 
branches in securing signatures. 
Letters are subsequently sent to the presidents and secretaries of 
all local organizations telling of the law, urging them to take advan- 
tage of their privilege, and inclosing a proper form of petition to be 
signed, together with popular circulars to aid in awakening interest 
in the kindergarten. Every letter advises working with local school 
authorities, and puts special emphasis on the fact that care must be 
taken to secure as kindergarten teachers graduates from accredited

remaining sections by Miss Winchester.

training schools. This work is carried on with the approval of the 
State superintendent of schools and of the commissioner of ele- 
mentary schools. 
Cities all over the State are visited for the purpose of arousing 
interest and enlisting active aid. The ultimate object, of all this 
work, whether undertaken with groups or individuals, conducted 
personally by the field worker, or delegated to others, is to find the 
enthusiastic mother or father who will see that the petition is 
properly signed by the parents of 25 children of kindergarten age 
living within a mile of the schoolhouse, and presented to the school 
board. 
A good example of the way in which the work is done may be 
shown by the campaign conducted in San Francisco during the past 
year.. With the assistance of the Congress of Mothers and other 
local organizations, 40 petitions were secured for kindergartens in 
different parts of the city. These were formally presented to the 
board of education, which was asked to include in its school budget 
an appropriation large enough to establish and maintain 50 kinder- 
gartens. Up to this time there had been but 11 kindergarten classes 
in the public schools of the city. 
The cooperation of the Chamber of Commerce and the Citizens’ 
Educational League was enlisted. The League appointed a com- 
mittee of three to aid in the campaign. In addition, valuable sup- 
port and publicity were secured through the daily press. 
The result of all these efforts was that the school authorities 
recommended to the county board of supervisors that 20 kinder- 
gartens be added to the public school system in San Francisco. 
This meant that if the board of supervisors passed favorably on the 
estimate made by the school board for these classes, approximately 
1,000 more children, each year, would be receiving kindergarten 
training. 
During the year since the Nevada kindergarten law came into oper- 
ation, permitting establishment of kindergartens on petition, there 
have been but three new classes added to the five formerly main- 
tained in the State. This slight increase may be explained by the 
fact that, so far as known, no one in Nevada has been working 
systematically to acquaint fathers and mothers with the advantages 
the law enables them to secure for their children. Such was also the 
experience of the first year under the California law, during which 
no special efforts were made to interest parents in its provisions, the 
increase in the number of kindergartens consequently being, in pro- 
portion, no greater than in Nevada. 
Local workers in the latter State are hoping that some way may be 
discovered of employing the same means as are used in California 
to induce parents to work for kindergartens. This they believe
-P-A-G-E-333
  KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 305 
could best be done, as in California, by some one especially employed 
for the purpose, but it is a question whether the results which 
could be obtained in such a sparsely settled State would justify the 
expense involved. In how far similar results might be obtained 
through the already organized machinery of the women’s clubs of 
the State is also a matter for conjecture. 
Practically the same conditions that were found true of Nevada 
and California during the first year under the petition form of 
legislation have existed since 1905 in Florida, which at that date 
adopted a law permitting boards of education to establish kinder- 
gartens when parents guarantee the attendance of 25 children. The 
average annual increase in the number of kindergartens in Florida 
has not been more than two or three in recent years; at the present 
time the public-school classes in the State number only 10. 
So far as known, no special efforts are under way in Florida to 
inaugurate a campaign of petitioning among parents so that the 
benefits of kindergarten training may be provided for more of their 
children. » 
Thus the petition form of legislation, unless vitalized by a cam- 
paign of petitioning, is no more effective than the so-called per- 
missive law, which allows school boards to decide whether or not new 
kindergartens shall be established. 
The only other State which authorizes petitioning for kinder- 
gartens is North Dakota, in which at least one-fifth of the voters in 
the larger districts (a majority in the smaller) must present a peti- 
tion in order to have the matter considered by the school. board. 
The comparative difficulty with which’ kindergartens are secured 
under such requirements is illustrated by the efforts of a woman in 
North Dakota during the year to have a kindergarten opened for 
children of her locality. In order to bring this about she had first 
to secure the signatures of practically 400 individuals. North Da- 
kota opened four new public-school kindergartens during the past 
year, making a total of nine to date. 
Extension through school boards.—In consideration of certain new 
attempts to make the establishment of kindergartens easy through 
improved legislation, and of some doubts as to the best type of 
law to work for, it is interesting to note the growth of kinder- 
garten classes in States where the question of opening them is 
solely in the hands of the school authorities. There are 27+ States 
in which kindergartens are established in this way. Some of them 
have the largest number of kindergartens. in the country, as, for 
1 Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Ken- 
tucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, 
New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Washington, 
West Virginia, and Wyoming. 
 
-P-A-G-E-334

instance, New York, with 4,764, New Jersey 615, Michigan 684, Ohio 
469, Massachusetts 363, Illinois 325, Iowa 328, and Missouri 273. In 
several States the annual increase reaches as high as 30, 40, and even 
50 classes. 
This progress compares favorably with the California record dur- 
ing the past two years, when it is considered that in the localities in 
question there has been no State-wide campaign undertaken by a 
special worker. 
In communities in which the kindergarten movement has made 
little headway at the hands of school boards, no harm could arise 
from attempts to secure the petition form of legislation, and if a 
campaign of petitioning be conducted wherever the mandatory-on- 
petition law is passed, a large number of new kindergartens will 
undoubtedly be the result. Several States are working in this 
direction. 
The States without special kindergarten legislation’ are the ones 
that have fewest kindergartens, with the exception of two—Nebraska 
having 157 classes and Rhode Island 98. It is not surprising to find 
that whatever attempts are under way to secure legislation in the 
States mentioned are directed toward securing the form that pro- 
vides for establishment by boards of education. In Georgia, where 
the law makes 6 the minimum age for entering school, thus prohibit- 
ing the use of regular school funds for the education of children 
under 6, a bill will be introduced this year providing for the estab- 
lishment of kindergartens by boards of education. This is the third 
year in which such an attempt has been made. The bill is sponsored 
by the State Federation of Women’s Clubs. 
With a view to possible legislation in the near future, campaigns 
of education upon the kindergarten subject are being conducted 
either by mothers’ clubs or kindergartners’ associations in several 
States which now have no kindergarten legislation. 
Extension through local community efforts—So far as it is pos- 
sible to judge from available information concerning the open- 
ing of individual kindergartens, with the exception of those 
started by women’s organizations, the initiative has seemed to ema- 
nate most frequently from the public-spirited kindergartner who 
is interested either in getting her superintendent to start or add 
more kindergartens to the public schools in her vicinity, or in in- 
ducing school authorities to take over private kindergartens. It 
is the kindergartner, too, who, realizing the importance of creating 
and maintaining interest among the general public, has done much

Virginia.

  KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 807 
to eliminate possible opposition to the kindergarten both before and 
after establishment. Many school superintendents and other edu- 
cators in communities which up to the present time have had no 
kindergartens have been taking steps to start the movement by 
arousing interest among parents and by investigating requisites for 
equipment, course of study, and other matters relating to the main- 
tenance of a kindergarten. Women’s clubs of all varieties have been 
active in promoting individual kindergartens as well as in working 
for State-wide advancement through legislation. 
Study of causes of discontinuance—One aspect of the work of 
starting a kindergarten movement has had considerable light thrown 
upon it asa result of an inquiry into the causes which led to the dis- 
continuance of a number of kindergartens during the past two years. 
This investigation disclosed, in brief, that there was little or no 
opposition to the kindergarten on the part of grade teachers. The 
chief reasons given for discontinuing these classes were lack of funds, 
lack of room and facilities, and indifference on the part of school 
boards or parents. It was evident that in most of the places covered 
by the inquiry the kindergarten was regarded as experimental, and 
at best a luxury, and was not maintained in proper relation with the 
public educational system. It must be concluded from this condition 
of affairs that the kindergarten had not demonstrated to parents and 
school authorities its right to live; had not been maintained in such 
relation to the community generally that its abandonment would be 
thought of last, hot first. It is clear that what is most needed, when 
inaugurating a kindergarten movement in any community, is to edu- 
cate the people generally and keep them informed regarding the 
fundamental purpose of the*work, and especially to show them that 
it bears a vital relation to the whole course of education and is not 
merely a more or less superfluous day nursery to keep little children 
amused until they are old enough to enter the primary grades. 
It was also apparent from this investigation that to establish 
kindergartens in small places too poor to maintain them is a waste 
of effort. When such kindergartens are tried and fail, the abandon- 
ment not only leaves a local hostility which must be removed before 
the work can be resumed, but produces an impression upon neighbor- 
ing communities far out of proportion to the importance of the 
failure. 
To aid in the work of arousing interest in the kindergarten, start- 
ing kindergarten classes, and successfully maintaining them, as well 
as securing improved legislation, the United States Bureau of Edu- 
cation has added considerable helpful material to its educational 
propaganda, including bulletins, leaflets, exhibits, motion pictures,

and lantern slides on the subject of kindergarten extension. This

THE KINDERGARTEN AND THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL." 
National Council of Primary Education—Among recent educa- 
tional events, one of special significance to kindergarten teachers is 
the formation of the National Council of Primary Education, an 
organization which came into being quite spontaneously at the meet- 
ing of the Department of Superintendence of the National Education 
Association at Cincinnati, Ohio, February, 1915. Membership in the 
council is open to teachers, supervisors, principals, and all persons in- 
terested in the educational problems of the first four school years; and 
the avowed purpose is “to secure the cooperation of all those inter- 
ested in primary schools for their betterment, through (1) greater use 
of the activities, (2) greater freedom of method, (3) a closer relation 
with the kindergarten and with the grades above.” It is evident that 
a definite, conscious movement reaching toward better integration 
with the kindergarten has been begun among the primary teachers. 
At the first annual meeting of the council, February 22, 1916, in 
Detroit, Mich., the topic selected for consideration was “ A greater 
use of activities in the primary school.” Taking part in the discus- 
sion were assistant superintendents, primary supervisors, and pri- 
mary teachers from Minneapolis, Minn., Toledo and Cincinnati, Ohio, 
Baltimore County, Md., Pittsburgh, Pa., and Harrisonburg, Va. 
Frequent references were made to the valuable assistance given by 
kindergartners to the primary teachers in these cities. “ Life-savers” 
was the characterization made by Anna Logan, of Cincinnati, in 
speaking of the arrangement by which éertain kindergarten teachers 
give half the day to kindergarten work and during the other half 
assist the first-grade teacher. Under these conditions games, hand- 
work, and excursions are possible, and— 
the regular teacher is enabled to work with a small group while the visiting 
kindergartner takes charge of the rest of the children: Better bookwork is 
thus accomplished, and both kindergartner and primary teacher have an oppor- 
tunity better to understand each other’s methods, problems, and point of view. 
A Louisville suggestion—The kindergartners and the primary 
teachers of Louisville, Ky., have advanced beyond the first stages of 
friendliness and general interest in one another’s work into concrete, 
specific forms of related working plans. These were described by 
Mary Hill, supervisor of public kindergartens in that city, in an 
address before the meeting of the kindergarten section of the   
1 This section and those following were prepared by Miss Winchester.

  National Education Association in New York. The subject was 
“Educational values which the child carries over from the kinder- 
garten into the primary grades.” The preliminary steps consisted 
in the contribution from every kindergarten teacher of a list of 10 
stories, 10 games, 10 poems, 10 songs, 10 pieces of handwork, 10 
‘definite habits, etc., with which a child should be familiar and skillful 
as a result of a year in kindergarten. These lists were studied by a 
“jury” of expert teachers, who selected therefrom certain stories, 
games, poems, songs, handwork, habits, etc., with a view to their 
usableness in the first grade. <A copy of the selected list, or “ mini- 
mum course for kindergarten,” was then sent to each kindergartner 
and first-grade teacher, with the understanding that henceforth the 
grade teacher may assume that the kindergarten children know these 
specific things and have these specific habits. The grade teacher 
must not repeat these stories, games, and pieces of handwork, unless 
she repeats them with additional combinations. 
During the latter half of their year in kindergarten the children 
make booklets of various pieces of handwork, which are to be car- 
ried by them into the first grade and utilized as reading devices. 
Another excellent practice in the Louisville schools is the changing 
of the term “seat work” in primary grades to “period of inde- 
pendent expression,” with a corresponding change in content; such 
work is now related to the children’s experiences. 
Exhibits of kindergarten work.—The exhibits of the past year re- 
flect the movement toward better coordination between kindergarten 
and primary education. At the International Kindergarten Union 
meeting in Cleveland, May, 1916, the exhibit contributed by the 
Cleveland schools consisted of kindergarten and first and second 
grade handwork so arranged as to make it clear that while materials 
and processes are the same in all three grades the work is not re- 
peated in the same way, but is planned with a view to calling for 
progressive mental and manual ability on the part of the children. 
The kindergarten exhibit at the National Education Association 
meeting in New York, July, 1916, was housed in the Washington 
Irving High School as part of a large and interesting display of | 
public-school activities. In place of the ordinary conventional ar- 
rangement of series of handwork, the committee representing the pub- 
lic-school kindergartners of New York City presented a demonstra- 
tion of the educational values found in kindergarten experiences. 
In a leaflet of description and interpretation the basis for this unusual 
organization of an exhibit was set forth: 
The form of this exhibit is somewhat of a departure, and is offered by a com- 
mittee representing the public-school kindergartners of New York City who are 
interested in education as an unbroken process from the home through the kin- 
dergarten to the cniversity.

    310 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
The committee has taken into consideration the fact that the school has en- 
deavored, more or less successfully, to formulate the values of life along eduta- 
tional lines designated for convenience as certain school subjects. These sub- 
jects represent not only a body of knowledge, but habits and attitudes which 
should be cultivated in a child. 
This exhibit is an unpretentious effort to demonstrate the fact that these 
school subjects should begin to shape in the kindergarten—consciously in the 
mind of the kindergartner, unconsciously in the experiences of the child. 
The exhibit consisted of (1) a room equipped for kindergarten 
purposes and filled with suggestive materials, such as toys, wall 
decorations, window transparencies, nature experiments, etc.; (2) a 
series of six panels mounted with photographs of children’s kinder- 
garten activities and with pieces of handwork. In accordance with 
the scheme of organization, the “values of life” educationally ex- 
pressed made the headings for the panels, Industrial Arts, Civics, 
History, Geography, Nature Study, Composition, Fine Arts, and 
Mothers’ Clubs’ Activities. 
The method employed in arranging the photographs and hand- 
work was explained in the leaflet: 
The endeavor has been to emphasize each value in three ways: 
(1) As a living vital experience (it is only through photographs that such 
experiences can be presented in an exhibit). 
(2) The reaction of the child in his desire to re-live the experience through 
play and constructive materials. 
(8) The reaction of the child shown in his desire to record his experience. 
It was recognized by the committee that the limitations of an ex- 
hibit always give undue prominence to handwork, and that the most 
important things done in kindergarten can not be visualized; also 
that the child’s experiences are for the child himself, unseparated and 
unclassified. It is only for the mature mind of the teacher and 
the student of education that these experiences are analyzed and 
organized. 
The “living vital experience” on the panel dealing with industrial 
arts was presented by means of a photograph of children visiting a 
blacksmith. The printed explanation was as follows: “Social indus- 
trial ideals presented through adult activities are observed by chil- 
dren through visits to the baker, farmer, market man, shoemaker, 
blacksmith, wheelwright, carpenter, toyshop. These experiences are 
re-lived through the free play and organized games in the kinder- 
garten.” Then followed suggestions as to means of helping the 
children to make daily practical application of ideals of industry 
and good workmanship: “Putting on and taking off wraps; dusting 
room; washing lunch dishes occasionally; making dolls and dolls’ 
clothes; furnishing doll’s house; constructing wagons; butter mak-
-P-A-G-E-339
  
KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 311 
ing; biscuit making.” A note was added to the effect that, while 
paramount importance is not attached to these activities as forms 
of industrial education in the kindergarten, they are valuable as a 
means of presenting ideals of workmanship. The constructive ma- 
terials were canvas and worsted for sewing, and clay marbles mod- 
eled and then strung by the children. Paper cutting was the medium 
of expression for recording the experiences. 
The “living vital experience” on the panel dealing with civics was 
represented by photographs of children visiting a fire-hall and a 
museum. The accompanying comment was: “Civic ideals presented 
through adult activities are observed by the children and re-lived 
through free play and organized games. These include fireman, 
policeman, soldier, sailor, knights; also excursions to public buildings 
and monuments.” Practical application of civic ideals to daily life 
involves: Caring for the room; taking care of other children; taking 
care of the school grounds; keeping scraps picked up from floor 
and street; participating in fire drill. Drawing and paper cutting 
were the materials used for recording the experiences. 
The same procedure was observed in the panels relating to history, 
geography, nature study, composition, and fine arts. 
KINDERGARTEN TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
The curricula.—The results of a study of kindergarten training 
schools in the United States were published as Bulletin, 1916, No. 5, 
of the Bureau of Education. One immediate outcome of the publi- 
cation was the calling of an informal conference of kindergarten 
training teachers and kindergarten supervisors at Cleveland, Ohio, 
just previous to the International Kindergarten Union convention in 
May, 1916. The purpose of the conference was to discuss the com- 
parative curricula, more especially the wide differences in the number 
of recitation periods devoted to the various subjects in the various 
schools. For instance, a comparison of figures in Table 5 of the 
bulletin showed that the amount of time given to physical training 
ranged from 15 periods (90 minutes in length) in one school to 255 
periods (46 minutes in length) in another school; the time given to 
music ranged from 14 periods (60 minutes) to 228 periods (53 min- 
utes); that given to psychology and child study ranged from 12 
periods (40 minutes) to 360 periods (52 minutes). A glance at the 
' table herewith shows that the least amount of time spent in practice- 
teaching was 4 weeks in a two-year course; the greatest amount, 76 
weeks in a two-year course.

What should constitute a minimum of essentials in respect to the 
number of recitation periods in all subjects, and to the amount of 
time devoted to practice teaching, and how a more uniform standard 
can be secured, were the questions into which the problem resolved 
itself. It was felt that ways and means of arriving at some degree 
of conformity to a norm should be devised by a thoroughly representa- 
tive body of kindergartners; consequently the executive board of the 
International Kindergarten Union was asked to name a committee to 
undertake the task. 
Kindergarten-primary courses —There is a distinct increase in the 
number of schools, public and private, offering kindergarten-primary 
courses. The students in such schools receive preparation for teach- 
ing in the first two or three grades as well as in kindergarten, and 
State certificates entitling them to do so are conferred upon those 
who graduate in such sources. Under these circumstances the neces- 
sity for lengthening the course from the customary two years to 
three years is becoming more urgent. 
Illinois legal enactment.—Changes in the school code of Illinois 
have made it possible for kindergarten training schools that conform 
to certain requirements to be legally recognized as “higher institu: 
tions of learning.” 
Response to appeal from Porto Rico.—Through the United States 
Bureau of Education the commissioner of education for Porto Rico 
has made an appeal for assistance in making it possible to establish 
kindergartens in that island. Ready responses have been made by 
seven training schools which offer free scholarships to native Porto 
Rican girls who are able to come to the United States for prepara- 
tion and then return to teach in the island.

THE KINDERGARTEN IN SCHOOL SURVEYS. 
The kindergarten has received considerable attention in recent city 
school surveys. The report of Dr. Frank McMurry on the New 
York City kindergartens, in his “ Elementary School Standards,” is 
sufficiently well known. 
In Butte, Mont., the survey commission (1914) made urgent 
recommendations for the establishment of kindergartens for “all of 
the children between 4 and 6 years of age in the district,” character- 
izing as “a marked defect of the school system” the lack of kinder- 
garten instruction, and also the “absence of the kindergarten spirit 
in the early primary grades.” It was recognized that— 
the kindergarten does much for the social training of children, that the play 
activities which are to be found there have a very definite educative value, and 
that the free intercourse among children and teachers does much to lay the 
foundation for later intellectual development. 
In the published report of the Portland (Oreg.) survey the portion 
dealing with “ Needed reorganizations and expansions of the school 
system” includes kindergartens as a necessary group, together with 
elementary schools, intermediate schools, and high schools. The 
commission suggests that the school authorities should work as 
rapidly as possible toward the practical ideal of making “ kindergar- 
ten instruction available for all children of the district.” Another 
suggestion was that the kindergarten work should merge naturally 
and gradually into that of the first grade, also that first grade work 
should be “modified to more nearly meet that of the kindergarten.” 
A supervisor in charge of both kindergarten and first grade is con- 
sidered the best medium of coordination. 
The Salt Lake City (Utah) survey commends the kindergartens as 
far as they exist; there is need for more of them. The commission 
reported that the more prosperous parts of the city are well supplied, 
but those sections in greatest need are overlooked. 
Where there is great need there is naturally little realization of the need, 
and therefore no demand has made itself felt. This does not relieve the school 
department of the duty to look out for the portions of the city in which the 
people do not know how to look out for their own interests. 
Oakland, Cal., reported in 1915 that more kindergartens were 
needed, and that probably one should be established in connection 
with each school of four or more rooms in the city. The report con- 
tinues: 
The value of good kindergarten instruction for children has become so well 
established that it is not deemed necessary to present any arguments in favor 
of this form of instruction. 
The most recent survey dealing with the kindergarten was that 
of Cleveland, Ohio. In the volume entitled “Measuring the Work 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
    314 EDUC: 
  CON REPORT, 1916.. 
of the Public Schools” occurs one chapter on “ Kindergartens and 
primary grades.” The summary of the chapter contains the fol- 
lowing points: 
(1) That the kindergartners are unsupervised and are dominated by a train- 
ing school which is outside the school system; (2) that the equipment of the 
kindergartens is superior to that of the primary grades; (3) that the effects of 
kindergarten training are by no means clearly defined and that they are often 
regarded by primary teachers as of doubtful value; (4) that the teachers are 
not in close touch with one another and not, in general, in sympathy with the 
mode of sending children from the kindergarten to the first grade. 
As an offset to the negative comments, however, the recommenda- 
tions are positive in their nature and include suggestions— 
that the training of kindergarten teachers be more intimately related to the 
work of the city training school for teachers; that the first grade and the 
kindergarten be organized in such a way that there shall be a more equitable 
distribution of teaching staff and material equipment; that promotion from the 
kindergarten to the first grade be based on maturity of pupils and not merely 
on age; and that a single supervisor be put in charge of the kindergartens and 
primary grades. 
The following table serves to indicate the numerical status of the 
kindergarten in the cities just mentioned :

THE KINDERGARTEN AND ABILITY TESTS. 
Tests and measurements applied to children in the kindergarten 
may at first glance appear contradictory to the very nature of the 
kindergarten itself, for spontaneity does not seem to lend itself 
gracefully to scientific measurements. Yet there are various kinds 
of ability, even in little children, that are decidedly measurable, and 
in pursuance of the present-day endeavors to bring the kindergarten 
and the grades into organic relations, certain types of tests have 
been found to be both possible and serviceable. 
The proper evaluation of the kindergarten has long been a sub- 
" ject of conjecture and debate. It is generally believed that certain 
habits, mental attitudes, and forms of skill are developed by a year 
or so in a kindergarten, but there remains the task of showing by 
facts that something really does happen in the child. In past years 
the usual basis for judgment as to the value of the training was
-P-A-G-E-343
  
  KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION. 315 
the rate of speed with which kindergarten children subsequently. 
accomplished the work of the grades. 
A more scientific approach to the problem is now under way. To 
a committee of experienced kindergarten teachers has been intrusted 
' the responsibility of formulating a kindergarten “curriculum” by 
whose standards the worth of the year in kindergarten may be 
judged, and of preparing a series of tests based upon these standards. 
The tests are then to be handed over to about 50 selected kinder- 
garten teachers, who will know how to apply them and how to make 
entries at the beginning and again at the end of the year for the 
same children. From these 50 carefully kept records it should be 
possible to make a set of scales for testing the ability of kindergarten 
children in their various achievements. These scales can then be 
circulated among kindergartners in general, and reports from them 
on their own work as judged by these tests will have an actual 
scientific and fact value. 
The dangers and limitations of tests and experiments are obvious; 
comparatively few institutions are so situated that experimentation 
and measurements of a systematic and worthy nature can be carried 
on in them. Fortunately, however, those who are leaders in the 
movement are in thorough agreement as to the necessity for safe- 
guarding children from immature and inexperienced teachers and 
for insisting that the work be done sincerely and quietly, free from 
premature exploitation, under conditions whereby scientific records 
can be kept. 
In some training schools the normal students are allowed to apply 
the tests; for, while the use of student labor in psychological proc- 
esses is recognized as of questionable wisdom as far as the value of 
the data is concerned, the value of such work to the students them- 
selves is considerable. During the past year, Elizabeth Ross 
Shaw, chairman of the child study committee of the International 
Kindergarten Union, has trained members of the faculties of two 
training schools to give general tests of mental endowment; and the 
senior students of one of the schools were trained to test children. 
OTHER ITEMS. 
Outdoor kindergarten work.—Among the inquiries carried on by 
the Bureau of Education during the past year was one pertaining 
to open-air kindergartens and outdoor work in the ordinary kinder- 
gartens. Responses indicate that the kindergarten teachers are con- 
triving, in spite of the difficulties of climate and popular objec- 
tions to exposure, to have their children out of doors a great

deal. In many instances playground apparatus has been added to 
the equipment, and many other forms of kindergarten activity are 
held in the open air whenever weather conditions make it possible. 
As might be expected of kindergartens in Hawaii, bathing suits are 
included as part of the regular equipment of the free kindergartens. 
Demand for reading couwrses—From several sources have come 
requests for organized and supervised courses of reading for kinder- 
garten teachers. In the multitude of books on education, teachers 
feel themselves bewildered, and they ask for some guidance in the 
matter. A committee of kindergartners has taken the task in hand, 
and will, before long, be able to respond to the expressed need. 
New books on the kindergarten—The library shelves of the kin- 
dergartner must be enlarged to take in two recent publications which 
are of unusual interest. “Kindergarten Theory and Practice,” by 
Nora Atwood, is a thoroughly practical presentation of kindergarten 
procedure and the meanings which lie beneath the procedure. In 
one chapter the nature of the kindergarten is set forth, and two types 
are described; in another the accessories which should make a favor- 
able environment are discussed; other chapters deal with the pro- 
gram, the use of the gifts, the use of the story; and the final chapter 
discusses the relation of the kindergartner to the primary teacher. 
The book carries out fully the avowed purpose of the writer to make 
it helpful and suggestive. 
“Froebel’s Kindergarten Principles Critically Examined,” by 
William Heard Kilpatrick, is a scholarly and thoughtful presenta- 
tion of certain phases of Froebelian doctrine. It is intended to be. 
studied by kindergartners and students of education in general. 
The book contains much that makes it a source of stimulus and argu- 
ment. In his preface the author makes plain that the reason why his 
criticism seems so largely negative is because, “What all accept, 
demands little discussion.” Emphasis has therefore been placed upon 
the more debatable aspects of Froebel’s principles. 
Susan E', Blow.—No record of the events connected with kinder- 
garten education for the year 1915-16 would be complete without at 
least a reference to the passing of Susan E. Blow, whose contribution 
to the establishment and development of the kindergarten in America 
has been greater and more far-reaching than that of any other person. 
From all sides have come tributes of admiration, praise, and affection 
for the large-souled woman who devoted her entire time, interest, 
skill of authorship, and wealth for the best good of little children.

CHAPTER XIX. 
EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 
By Wirarp S. SMALL, 
Principal, Hastern High School, Washington, D. O. 
The volume and variety of activities in the field of educational 
hygiene are constantly increasing. The topics selected for treat- 
ment in this chapter are military training, physical education, social 
hygiene, eye hygiene, ventilation, and rural school hygiene. 
. PREPAREDNESS AND GOOD HEALTH. 
Once in a lifetime, or, it may be, once in a century, the common 
mind of a nation is so aroused and unified as to make possible far- 
reaching educational reconstructions. Such was the case in the Ger- 
man States after the Battle of Jena. Such particularly is the case in 
the United States to-day. “ Preparedness” has taken firm hold upon 
the national mind. The preparedness psychosis is accompanied by 
hysteria and ghost dancing, but it has been productive also of a real 
. searching of the national heart. Beneath the confusion of tongues 
and the naive fancy that preparedness can be bought with great ar- 
maments and with mercenary soldiership, there is a gradually form- 
ing resolution to understand and to achieve real preparedness. There 
is sudden recognition of the truth that the very foundations of pre- 
paredness for war and for peace are physical and moral discipline. 
It has required the scourge of fear, born of the horrors of the great 
war, to make vivid and real the thing that “everybody has known.” 
The statistics of rejection of applicants for enlistment in the Army 
and Navy have been available for years and have been quite as sig- 
nificant heretofore as they are in 1916. Under the stimulus of the 
preparedness issue, they are suddenly exploited and uncritically in- 
terpreted as symptomatic of physical degeneracy of the Nation. In 
interpreting these figures it must always be remembered that the 
physical standards for recruits are very rigorous, and that most of 
the recruits in time of peace are young men who are temporarily 
out of employment, this second fact carrying the implication of a 
large admixture of physical incompetency. Allowing for these facts, 
however, the figures are sufficiently impressive.

    318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
In the year 1915 there were, in round numbers, 160,000 applicants 
for enlistment in the United States Army. Of these 117,000 were 
rejected upon preliminary examination, and 7,000 of the remaining 
43,000 were rejected upon detailed medical examination; 30,000, or 
about 20 per cent, were accepted. 
The records of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, United 
States Navy Department, for the year ended December 31, 1914, 
show that, of the 72,410 applicants for original enlistment in the 
Navy and of 20,674 in the Marine Corps, 76 per cent of the former 
and 82.4 per cent of the latter were rejected for physical and mental 
disabilities; and that, during the year ended December 31, 1915, 
there were 73,028 applicants for original enlistment in the Navy, and 
21,676 in the Marine Corps, of whom 75.4 per cent were rejected by 
the Navy, and 83 per cent by the Marine Corps, for like causes.*

The really impressive thing revealed by thesé figures is not that 
they demonstrate or even suggest physical degeneracy, but rather the 
fact that a very large part of the disabilities recorded are of such 
nature that they might have been corrected or prevented in childhood 
by health supervision in the schools, adequate medicophysical ex- 
amination, corrective follow-up work, proper exercise and instruc- 
tion in personal hygiene, and hygienic environment. Practically

2Ibid. This table does not tell the story as completely as would be desirable: (1) The 
“all other causes ” group is entirely too large. This includes such causes as underheight 
and underweight, which do not necessarily connote physical inefficiency. (2) There is 
probably a disproportionate amount of rejection on account of visual and dental defect. 
Requirements in these respects are very rigid and such defects are easily detected. This 
qualification cuts both ways: (a) Individuals rejected for these defects may have other 
more serious defects that are unrecorded; (b) individuals having these defects in suffi- 
cient degree to warrant rejection may be absolutely sound in other respects and, hence, 
very efficient physically.

50 per cent of the specified disabilities recorded by the Navy and 
40 per cent recorded by the Marine Corps would have yielded to 
remedial measures in childhood. It is possible that some of the 
“all others” belong in the same category. 
It would be illuminating if the statistics could be compared with 
similar statistics for graduates of high schools. Unfortunately, such 
statistics do not exist. Few school systems provide for continuous 
and detailed examinations during the elementary-school years and 
fewer still in the high-school years. The high-school graduates 
ought to be a selected group, physically as well as mentally, but 
most persons who are familiar with the situation would hesitate to 
predict that more than 50 per cent of the boys graduating from the 
high schools would meet the Army and Navy standards. The condi- 
tion of those who are eliminated before graduation and of the much 
greater number who never reach the high school is even less favorable. 
It is this formidable fact—that the educational organization has 
tolerated physical inefficiency, even if it is not a contributing cause— 
that the interest in preparedness is bringing acutely to the national 
consciousness. The realization of the folly and extravagance of such 
a lack of policy will become more vivid in the next two or three years. 
Professional educators will be a trifle ashamed of “resolving” at 
educational conventions that health is of paramount importance in 
education and forgetting about it when they return to their own 
routine. School boards and boards of estimate will be more likely to 
see the folly of spending large sums “now devoted annually to the 
reeducation of children held back in their classes in part, at least, 
by incapacitating though preventable and curable physical and 
mental defects,” * and will think twice before making appropriations 
for health work in the schools on so penurious a scale that the work 
is crippled at its birth. The public, at least the thinking part of 
the public, will perhaps shake off its good-natured indifference and 
recognize the validity of the health programs urged by earnest school 
and health administrators and by civic and philanthropic agencies. 
There is sufficient movement of the waters in many places to justify 
the hope, at least, that out of the preparedness psychosis there may 
be developed a genuine reconstruction of policy in regard to the 
place of health in education. 
COMPULSORY MILITARY TRAINING. 
Naturally enough the first fruit of this new spirit was a sudden, 
sporadic but widespread, and very uncritical demand for compulsory 
military training in the high schools and even in the elementary 
schools.   
1D. B. Armstrong, M. D., Social Aspects of School Hygiene, Am. Jour. Pub. Health, 
vol. 5, No. 12,  
-P-A-G-E-348
  320 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
In the first flush of enthusiasm no one stopped to inquire very 
deeply what military training really involves, what is the specific 
physical and intellectual character of the raw material, the adolescent 
boy that is to be trained, and the specific national conditions, environ- 
mental and psychological, that must be met if preparedness is to be 
real, permanent, and constructive. 
In some instances “military training,” consisting merely of in- 
fantry drill, has been introduced without adequate consideration of 
the fitness of this form of exercise for the physical character of young 
boys and of the reaction that may result from it. The first bills and 
drafts of bills that were introduced into the national and State legis- 
lative bodies were characterized by the same uncritical, almost hectic 
haste. 
The reaction of sober second thought, however, has come quickly, 
and the relation of military training to school organization is be- 
coming fairly clear. Military training in a strict and technical 
sense will not be grafted upon the schools, but military training in 
the sense of a comprehensive program for physical, moral, and civic 
education, in which some appropriate military exercises may be 
included, is likely to find its way into all schools. 
The reasons for this are inherent in the constitution of boy nature 
and the nature of military drill. 
In the first place, observes Capt. Godfrey, of the Regular Army, 
speaking of Boy Scout activities: 
Soldiering itself is a man’s business and is not for the boy under 18. It would 
not be advisable to equip Scouts with the rifle and to teach them the regulation 
infantry drill. To do so would be to repress initiative that needs self-expression. 
It is the time to instill not the minutie of the drill ground but the fundamental 
principles of the good soldier which scouting stands for so squarely. 
Gen. Baden Powell put this truth bluntly in three words: “ Drill 
is wooden.” Employed as a form of exercise in the formative period 
of early adolescence it tends not only to “repress initiative ” but also 
to produce stiff, angular, and inelastic muscular action. 
Another aspect of the harm that may be done by premature mili- 
tary drilling is expressed trenchantly by Dr. C. Ward Crampton, 
director of physical training in New York City: 
I am strongly opposed to military drilling of elementary school boys. They 
are too young to be soldiers. Only men can be such. It is true that by the 
manual of arms and the school of the soldier they learn much, but these things 
can be learned better by more appropriate physical training methods. At the 
best, they only become toy soldiers; they appeal to the populace as “ cute,” 
1See “ Scouting,” May 15, 1916. The article is by Capt. Stuart Godfrey, instructor 
in West Point. Capt. Godfrey’s words have special force. He is an inspiring leader of 
boys as well as an Army officer. rs

and an absolutely-wrong ideal is established. This training, taken before the 
boys are ripe for it, breeds a distaste for the real training which should follow 
at its appropriate time. 
A wave of enthusiasm for military training has swept over the country. If 
this spends itself in the military training of infants, nothing but waste and 
harm will result. 
It must be remembered that this statement would apply in a large 
measure to the first years of the high schools. It is a matter of 
physiological age, not of school placement. 
A third important consideration is the effect upon health. The 
popular belief that military drilling per se is a wholesome and 
effective form of physical exercise is not supported by facts. For the 
youth whose growth is practically complete it is not harmful and may 
be beneficial, but for the boy in the plastic developmental stage of 
early adolescence it has little value and may be positively harmful. 
As stated above, it tends to produce “stiff, angular, and inelastic 
muscular action.” This in itself is bad, as bad as the older systems 
of physical training that aimed at hard, bulging muscles—excessive 
local development—and neglected the fundamentals of wind and 
digestion. 
Military training in the schools conceived as military drilling is 
undesirable and unavailing; military training conceived as a “ com- 
prehensive program for physical, moral, and civic education,” in- 
cluding the “fundamental principles of the good soldier,” is de- 
sirable and even necessary. It offers the possibility of unifying and 
ennobling the now confused and disjointed activities in the field of 
physical and moral discipline. The physical and moral values of 
both gymnastics and athletics are well understood, but both lack 
comprehensive and unifying motive. All systems of gymnastics are 
individualistic. Their appeal is to the desire of the individual for 
physical perfection. Competition is narrowly individualistic. Sys- 
tems of athletics are mostly based upon group competitions, and if 
properly managed are very valuable, not only for physical develop- 
ment but also for training in the very fundamentals of social 
morality. But the pliilosophy of athletics is the philosophy of play, 
and the philosophy of play is the philosophy of instinct—a philoso- 
phy that is not comprehensive enough to serve as a sole basis of 
physical and moral education. Military training rightly conceived 
includes these motives and subordinates them to the ideal of pa- 
triotism. 
The fighting instinct in man is ancient and seemingly ineradicable. 
The “ moral equivalents for war,” if discovered, are not yet effective. 
The purpose of military training should be to capitalize this ancient 
“and ineradicable instinct; to exercise, train, and educate it; to
-P-A-G-E-350
322 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
  make of it a productive educational investment and compel it to 
yield adequate dividends in physical and moral discipline.+ 
The program worked out by Lieut. E. Z. Steever, U. S. A., in the 
high schools of Wyoming approximates this ideal.? In the Wyoming 
plan all cadets are organized into competition units. Leaders take 
“turnabouts” choosing the members of their units, so that each 
unit (squad, platoon, or company) is made up of an equal number 
of strong, medium, and weak lads. All the work is done by compe- 
tition units. There are wall-scaling units, infantry-drill units, troop- 
leadership units, scholarship units, field-firing units, camp and field 
units. i 
Sponsors are elected from the girls in the mixed school and 
assigned to the competition units. The sponsors are in every sense 
members of the cadet organization. They attend all drills, are the 
leaders in all social functions, and while they do not actually 
drill, are entitled to and receive such individual rewards as may 
be won by their units. Medals, ribbons, and distinctive marks 
on the uniform are given each member of a winning unit, the sponsor, 
of course, included. Each cadet organization is based on the volun- 
tary enlistment plan. The cadet classes are held generally during 
and not after school hours, and credit toward graduation is awarded 
therefor. Cadet tournaments are held during the school year between 
the different high schools, to which the public is invited, and at 
which are held infantry drill, wall scaling, field firing, and camp 
and field and troop leadership competition “ games.” 
On the basis of the Wyoming experience the following system is 
advocated : 
1. Cut the school year into separate, short, intensive training periods, work- 
ing up through preliminary to final competition dates, with the fixed compe- 
tition units. 
2. September 1 to December 31, wall-scaling and calisthenic events; mini- 
mum of drill, maximum of body building. ~ 
8. January 1 to February 28, troop-leadership competitions, 12-inch Gettys- 
burg war-game map. Include military policy of the United States. 
4, January 1 to February 28, minimum of drill, maximum of gallery practice, 
group competitions. 
5. March 1 to May 7, minimum of drill, maximum of range practice, and 
field-firing competitions. 
6. May 8 to June 15, minimum of drill, maximum of camp and field problems, 
competitive between high schools. 
7. All through school year, commencing in the spring and running through 
the following fall and winter, take boys into camp each week end and harden 
them to the rigors of camp life. Teach them sanitation, cooking, woodcraft, 
simple fieid engineering, plains craft, castramentation, sketching, scouting,

THE NEW YORK MILITARY COMMISSION IN RELATION TO PHYSICAL 
TRAINING. 
New York is the first State to respond to the “ wave of enthusiasm 
for military training” by the enactment of military physical-training 
legislation. This legislation epitomizes accurately the present status 
of responsible public opinion upon the question of school military 
training and its relation to physical education—the confusion and 
indecision in regard to the former and its clarity and certainty in 
regard to the latter. The laws enacted are two in number:* One, an 
amendment to the military law providing for the creation of a “ mili- 
tary training commission” and for instituting compulsory “ military 
and disciplinary training”; the other, an amendment to the educa- 
tional law providing for compulsory “ physical training and disci- 
pline” for all children of 8 years and over in all schools of the State, 
public and private. 
The important feature of the military amendment, apart from the 
creation of the military training commission (which is the essential 
feature), is the requirement that— 
All boys above the age of 16 years and not over the age of 19 years, except 
boys*exempted by the commission, shall be given such military training as the 
commission may prescribe for periods aggregating not more than three hours 
in each week during the school or college year, in the case of boys who are 
pupils in public or private schools or colleges, and for periods not exceeding 
those above stated between September 1 of each year and the 15th day of June 
next ensuing in the case of boys who are not pupils. 
The exemptions are liberal, so liberal indeed .as to make com- 
pulsory military training a penalty for school attendance after 16 
years of age. “Any boy who is regularly and lawfully: employed in 
any occupation for a livelihood shall not be required to take such 
training unless he volunteers and is accepted therefor.” 
The military training commission consists of three members, “ the 
major general commanding the National Guard, ex officio, who shall 
be chairman of the commission; a member to be appointed by the 
board of regents of the university of the State; and a member to be 
appointed by the governor.” 
The relation of the commission to physical education is shown in 
the following provisions. It is specifically empowered to— 
appoint and at pleasure remove an inspector of physical training at a salary 
not exceeding $5,000 a year and other assistants and clerks and employees at 
  
1 The legislation as originally proposed was in one bill, an amendment to the military 
law. The thoughtful educators of the State, under the leadership of Commissioner Fin- 
ley, brought about the modification into two bills. Not all confusion was eliminated, but 
the essential integrity of the State educational authority was preserved.
-P-A-G-E-352
  z 324 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
salaries to be fixed by the commission; provide for the observation and inspec- 
tion of the work and methods prescribed under the provisions of this article 
or under the provisions of the education law relating to instruction in physical 
training prescribed after conference with the commission; and to prescribe the 
powers and duties of the inspector of physical training. 
The commission further is authorized to— 
advise and confer with the board of regents of the University of the State of New 
York as to the courses of instruction in physical training to be prescribed for 
elementary and secondary schools as provided in the education law. 
In order to more thoroughly and comprehensively prepare the boys of the 
elementary and secondary schools. for the duties and obligations of citizenship, 
it shall also be the duty of the military training commission to recommend from 
time to time to the board of regents the establishment in such schools of habits, 
customs, and methods best adapted to develop correct physical posture and 
bearing, mental and physical alertness, self-control, disciplined initiative, sense 
of duty, and the spirit of cooperation under leadership. 
The second law providing for State-wide physical training re- 
quires that— 
all male and female pupils above the age of 8 years in all elementary and 
secondary schools (public and private) shall receive as part of the prescribed 
courses of study therein such physical training as the regents, after conference 
with the military training commission, may determine. 
It further requires that the time shall not be less than 20 minutes 
a day; that competent teachers shall be employed; that development 
of correct physical posture and bearing, mental and physical alert- 
ness, self-control, discilpined initiative, sense of duty, and the spirit 
of cooperation under leadership be emphasized. The board of regents 
is required to prepare courses of study. Most important of all is the 
provision for payment by the State of part of the salary for teach- 
ers of physical training. 
“The virtue of a thing is in the application.” The personnel of 
the commission is of radical importance. The major general com- 
manding the National Guard of the State, Gen. O’Ryan, is ex officio 
a member and chairman. The other two members are Commissioner 
Finley, named by the board of regents, and Dr. George J. Fisher, 
appointed by the governor. Dr. Thomas A. Storey, professor of 
physical education in the College of the City of New York, has been 
appointed by the commission as State inspector of physical training. 
The commissioners and the inspector worked continuously during 
the summer months and have formulated a comprehensive program 
for carrying out the provisions of the two laws; the schedule for 
physical training in the schools of the State as outlined in this pro- 
gram is as follows:

1. Physical training A: Correlation with school medical inspection, daily in- 
spection of every class by the regular class teacher. 
2. Physical training B: Five-minute setting-up drills at the beginning of each 
class period, or at least four times every school day, under the direction of 
the regular class teacher.

minimum of 30 minutes for each period, under direction of special teacher 
of physical training.   OTHER ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION. 
Other than the impetus given to physical education by the pre-~ 
paredness issue, the most interesting recent aspects of physical edu- 
cation are the broader and more philosophic conception of the scope 
and problems of physical education and the demand for standards 
by which progress and attainment in this field may be judged with 
some degree of scientific verity. 
The former of these tendencies is apparent on all sides. Con- 
cretely it is manifested in the rapidly growing practice of expand- 
ing the functions of the director of physical training or establishing 
a new office to cover all or most of the phases of educational hygiene. 
Boston, with its department of school hygiene, covers the entire field. 
61355°—16——23  
-P-A-G-E-354
    326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. zi 
New York, with its bureau of educational hygiene, covers every 
phase of the work except “ medical inspection.” Kansas City, Cin- 
cinnati, and other cities within the past two years have established 
such departments and have consolidated the previously scattered 
activities. This creates a demand for a new type of school officer, a 
director of health activities, whose equipment includes the essentials 
of both the medical curriculum and the physical training curric- 
ulum. Comparison of a program of the American Physical Educa- 
tional Society of a decade ago with the program of the association 
of the current year shows significant progress in this respect. A 
report now being compiled by the bureau, based upon a nation-wide 
investigation of actual conditions as to physical education, shows 
strikingly this broadening scope and purpose. The integration of 
athletics and the teaching of hygiene with physical training is shown 
to be complete in many school systems; and even more complete 
consolidation, as indicated above, is found in not a few instances. 
The tendency toward the establishment of standards is also mani- 
fested widely. The following examples, probably the most impor- 
tant, are at least typical manifestations: 
(1) Minimum Essentials of Physical Education—Prof. L. A. Rapeer, of 
Pennsylvania State College, has been delegated by the national committee 
on economy of time in education to report in February, 1917, on “The 
minimum essentials of physical education,” to be published in the sixteenth 
report of the National Society for the Study of Education. Cooperating 
committees have been appointed from several national organizations: Amer- 
ican Physical Education Association, National School Hygiene Association, 
Child Hygiene Division of the National Education Association, New Jersey 
Association of Medical Inspectors and Nurses, and others. i 
(2) Baldwin’s Measuring Scale for Physical Growth and Physiological Age.— 
In this study* Dr. Baldwin has attempted to formulate tangible norms 
which may be used by physical directors and teachers as standards for 
comparison with all types and races of children between the ages of 5% 
and 18 years. The norms are based on the best available data in this 
country from the Horace Mann School, the Francis W. Parker School, and 
the University, Elementary and High Schools of the University of Chicago, 
where a limited number of American children were measured consecutively for 
several years by trained anthropometrists using standardized apparatus of 
minute units with the age recorded exactly in days. 
On the basis of these data Dr. Baldwin has formulated norms for physical 
growth in height, weight, and lung capacity. These are in the form of cards 
which may be used as a measuring scale for physical growth and stages of 
physiological maturity, as well as for records concerning physical conditions. 
(3) Efficiency Methods for Posture—The efficiency methods for posture 
worked out in Brooklyn several years ago and now used throughout New 
York City afford, through a triple test which all class teachers conduct, a 
standard of measurement for judging attainment and progress in this phase 
of physical development.

EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 827 
Once each month each class in the New York City schools is given a so-called 
triple test for posture; the class is grouped on this basis, and a percentage 
record kept of the number passing the test. 
The same spirit and purpose, though less concretely worked out, 
is characteristic throughout the new course of study in hygiene of the 
New York City schools. 
Another very interesting example is a plan by which the pupil 
keeps his individual hygiene record, worked out by Mr. E. F. Brown, 
of the child-welfare division of the New York Society for Improving 
the Condition of the Poor. 
SOCIAL HYGIENE, 
The relation of social hygiene to national efficiency is too obvious 
for comment. The manner and the extent of the contribution of the 
school to the unraveling of the knotty problems blanketed under this 
somewhat euphemistic title is far from solution. The issues are not 
clear and attitudes are determined in general more by temperament 
and preconception than by detached consideration of facts. This is 
equally true of those who oppose and those who favor action by the 
schools. The indefiniteness of the situation is illustrated in the fol- 
lowing rather wistful expressions of two of the foremost advocates 
of sex education, Mrs. Ella Flagg Young and Dean Balliet, respec-_ 
tively: : 
Thus far, however, no construction of the meaning of religious instruction 
obliges the secular free schools to limit their instruction to a commercial, a 
utilitarian view of life; and no construction of sectarian or religious instruction 
forbids the common schools to teach so that the boys and girls shall impress 
on their minds and engrave in their hearts the truth that purity in life and 
thought.is the first essential in achieving dominion over one’s self. 
The necessity for the right kind of sex education is generally admitted. It 
can not be safely left to the parent or church, as both have failed in the past, 
and many parents will always be incompetent to give it. The school, in some 
way not yet clearly devised, must ultimately do its share. Neither personal nor 
religious prejudices must be allowed to stand in the way of it. It is a problem 
for educators to study. Such education must be made essentially a part of, 
the instruction in hygiene and in ethics. Its motive, to be clearly impressed 
upon the pupil at every point, is the preservation of health and right moral 
living. 
One thing, however, is certain, and that is the moral imperative 
that teachers themselves should be sanely alive to the problems of 
social hygiene. Class instruction may or may not be sanctioned to- 
morrow, but the understanding of sex both in its individual and in its 
social significance is essential to the teacher who expects to deal 
understandingly and adequately with adolescents. The publications

of the American Social Hygiene Association, especially the Monthly 
Bulletin, are invaluable. The bulletin is an epitome of information 
relative to legal and administrative phases of the subject and a mir- 
ror of the changes of attitude of society toward the problems involved. 
Intelligent and effective work in this critical field of social educa- 
tional service has been carried on for five years by the Oregon Social 
Hygiene Society.1 Generous cooperation has been secured from 
“schools, churches, newsdealers, newspapers, railroads, theater own- 
ers, druggists, boards of health, teachers, business houses, legislatures, 
city officers, police and district attorneys.” The State legislature has 
enacted effective legislation. 
EYE HYGIENE. 
Commerce and industry, as well as medicine and education, have 
shown keen interest in the conservation of vision and in promoting 
scientific study of its problems. The most recent of these contribu- 
tions are summarized below: 
(1) Committee on Conservation of Vision of the American Medical Associa- 
tion—This committee was instituted in 1913. Its purpose is systematically to 
spread information in regard to eye hygiene and to stimulate and promote neces- 
sary legislation for the conservation of vision. During 1914 and 1915 it provided 
829 lectures to audiences aggregating 183,223 people; it caused to be written 
20 pamphlets on eye subjects, with a distribution of 34,000; it supplied the press 
bulletin of the American Medical Association with short, practical articles on 
eye subjects that have reached hundreds of thousands of people; it aided the 
campaign against “shop accidents” by its pamphlets, lectures, ete., warning 
the public against such accidents, and how they can be best prevented. The 
committee has been especially active in promoting legislation for eye, ear, nose, 
and throat examinations of school children. Seventeen States now have such 
Jaws. Inasmuch as the enactments have taken place in 10 of the 17 States 
since 1913, it is fair to assume that the passage of these laws was inspired by 
the existence of the committee. 
An excellent summary of the laws of these 17 States has been prepared by 
Dr. Allport,’ the chairman of the committee. The Wyoming law, passed in 1915, 
is “particularly praiseworthy for its brevity, plainness, and unambiguous 
danguage.” 
The committee urges strongly that teachers should make the preliminary ex- 
aminations to ascertain the presence of defects, not to attempt diagnosis. A 
testing chart, modified from the familiar Snellen chart, has been carefully worked 
out. This is accompanied by instructions for the examinations of children’s 
eyes, ears, etc., presented in clear, concise, and nontechnical form.’ It is stated 
by the committee that “ by setting aside a day for this work and by having each

can be examined in one day. By properly systematizing the work a child can be 
examined in five minutes.” 
Objections to examination by teachers are met in the following statement: 
The objection has been raised that inasmuch as teachers have had no medical 
education, they are not competent to make these tests. A mere reading of the 
“facts” a teacher has to ascertain will show that no medical education is neces- 
sary to ascertain the “facts.” Any one who knows enough to be a teacher can 
surely learn whether the child has red eyes, is cross-eyed, has frequent head- 
aches, what lines can be read on the vision chart, whether the child is a mouth- 
breather, has pus discharging from its ear, etc. 
(2) Eye Hygiene in the Schools—The report of the committee of the 
American School Hygiene Association in 1911 covered both textbooks and 
instructional procedure. ‘“ Reasonable minima” in the making of textbooks 
were laid down, and these have been adopted by a number of textbook 
publications, 
The investigations of the committee of the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science, as set forth in the most recent report, dispose of the 
question of glare or gloss. 
Experiments conducted to obtain an objective measurement of the gloss of 
paper showed that glossiness depends chiefly on specular reflection—reflection 
as from polished metals—which is liable to interfere with binocular. vision. 
The ideal surface for books would exhibit no specular reflection ; all the reflected 
light would be scattered or diffuse reflection, equal in all directions and inde- 
pendent of the direction of the incident beam. In practice it is found that when 
the specular reflection does not exceed the diffuse reflection when the light is 
incident at 45°, the paper is satisfactory; when the specular reaches 56 per 
cent and the diffuse only 44 per cent, then there will be injurious glare, especially 
by artificial light. 
(3) IUuminating Engineering Society—The society maintains a committee 
on school lighting, of which Mr. M. Luckiesh* is chairman. The objects of 
the committee are investigation of problems of school lighting and propaganda 
both for improved practices by engineers and for necessary legislation. Within 
the past year this committee has submitted to its fellow committee on lighting 
legislation a report covering the essential features that should be incorporated 
in legislative codes. 
(4) Investigations by Mr. F. L. Godinez.—In 1910 Mr. F. Laurent Godinez, 
of Jersey City, was employed by “several hundred representative architects 
who desired an authoritative expression upon the entire subject of artificial 
school lighting and who were prepared to defray the expense of investigation,” 
to make an investigation of this problem, or, rather, group of problems. The 
investigations carried on by Mr. Godinez “ have extended through five years 
and have involved an exhaustive consideration of over 4,000 individual prob- 
Jems related exclusively to schoolroom lighting.” The results are unpublished, 
as they are the property of the architects who financed the investigation and 
are solely for their files. A summary of results and conclusions was presented 
at the second annual meeting of the New Jersey State Association of Medical 
Inspectors and School Nurses, Newark, N. J., May 20, 1916.’

Lamp Works of the General Electric Co., at Nela Park, Cleveland, Ohio. This laboratory 
is equipped for the adequate investigation of all problems of illumination.

  330 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
The conservation of vision, in spite of all the progress that has 
been made in the 50 years since Cohn opened up the problem, is still 
one of the most serious of the problems of educational hygiene. In- 
creasing mastery of the artificial production of light has involved 
new and difficult problems. In view of the complicated character of 
these problems and of their practical significance, it would seem 
desirable and practicable that there should be joint action on the 
part of the various bodies and individuals that are now carrying on 
their very commendable activities independently. It ought to be 
possible to form such a committee made up of competent working 
members representing the American Medical Association, the 
National Education Association, the American School Hygiene Asso- 
ciation, the Illuminating Engineering Society, and any other scien- 
tific or professional bodies that have anything to contribute. Pos- 
_sibly the group of architects who promoted Mr. Godinez’s investiga- 
tions would be willing to contribute the detailed results of his inves- 
tigations. Accepted facts should be classified and clearly and 
cogently set forth. Doubtful matters should be set forth with equal 
clearness and cogency but without controversial heat. Necessary 
lines of investigation should be clearly marked out and means should 
be devised for conducting such investigations systematically and 
without crossing of wires. Cooperation with the Bureau of Educa- 
tion should be secured in the interest of publication and adequate 
dissemination of results. 
VENTILATION. 
Ventilation is still am unsolved problem. Much progress, however, 
has been made from the naive acceptance of carbon dioxide as the 
deleterious agency in bad air to the present careful, thorough, and 
systematic study of the constitution and effects of air under various 
controlled conditions. The investigations of physiologists have al- 
most the fascination of a romance. Excess of CO,, defect of oxygen, 
presence of organic toxins, have been weighed and found wanting as 
the causes of the badness of confined air. The exhaustive researches 
of the New York State commission on ventilation, when completed, 
should clear up many of the disputed points. Until that authorita- 
tive report is issued the following poe be accepted as a practical 
standard for inside air: 
Good air is cool air, not over 68° F.; it is moist air with at least 50 per 
cent relative humidity; it is air in motion, free from dust, bacteria, and odors. 
The chief problems (in ventilation) are the maintaining at the normal level E 
the body temperature, the elimination of dust as the vehicle of bacteria, and 
the keeping up of the indoor humidity somewhere near the outdoor humidity. 
The following statement of the work of the New York commission 
has been furnished by Mr. G. T. Palmer, chief of the investigating 
staff of the commission:
-P-A-G-E-359
  
  EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 331 
The New York State commission on ventilation was appointed by the governor 
in June, 1913, at the request of the New York Association for Improving the 
Condition of the Poor. It was given by the association a fund of $50,000 for 
its work, this fund being part of a large sum given by Mrs. Elizabeth Milbank 
Anderson, of New York City, for various phases of constructive social investi- 
gation. The fund for the ventilation work was later increased to $75,000. 
The purpose of this movement was to increase the general knowledge on 
the subject of building ventilation. 
The fields of science believed to be most vitally concerned in this question 
included public health and sanitation, physiology, medicine, ventilating, engi- 
neering, chemistry, and psychology. The members of this commission selected, 
with this broad program in mind, and who serve without pay, are: Prof. C. EB. A. 
Winslow, Prof. Frederic S. Lee, Dr. James Alexander Miller, Mr. D. D. Kim- 
ball, Prof. Earle B. Phelps, Prof. E. L. Thorndike. 
Following its organization the commission first undertook the construction 
of an experimental chamber at the College of the City of New York, where- 
the trustees of this institution generously provided the necessary space. It 
was desired to reproduce in this chamber any. indoor atmosphere which might 
be met with in practice and hence be able to study the behavior of people 
exposed for varying periods to a known air condition. The chamber itself 
consisted of a small room, adequate for from four to eight people, which was 
elaborately fitted with devices for producing and maintaining heat, cold, dryness, 
moisture, freshness, draftiness, stagnation, and odor. With this equipment 
it was possible not only to reproduce air conditions found in various types of 
environments, but it was also possible to go further and produce the extremes 
of these conditions, to isolate each factor by itself and study its effects while 
keeping constant the other factors. 
Here during the past three years experimentation has been in progress almost 
continuously, from 200 to 300 different people, young and middle-aged, male 
and female, students, stenographers, clerks, truck drivers, boiler makers, people 
of various occupations, those whose work keep them in the open air, in hot dry 
atmospheres, in hot moist atmospheres, have at some time for varying periods 
been under observation. 
To extend the knowledge thus obtained and to verify it on a more practical 
scale, the commission has, through the cooperation of the boards of education 
and health of the City of New York, as well as similar bodies in other places, 
carried on its work in schoolrooms and school buildings. Two full-size school- 
rooms in particular were equipped somewhat after the fashion of the experiment 
chamber at the city college permitting the observation of different ventilating 
methods within the same room and on the same group of pupils and over, 
a period of several months. Exhaustive psychological and physiological tests 
have been utilized here likewise in an effort to measure accurately the mani- 
festations of different atmospheric effects. 
In addition to this work with school classes, intensive surveys have been made 
of the condition of schoolroom air under different methods of ventilation. Ob- 
servers of the commission’s staff have spent their entire time within the school- 
room during the school session for two weeks continuously and have conducted 
these biweekly surveys in the same school at different seasons of the year—fall, 
* winter, and spring. It has been the feeling that much is to be gained in careful 
detailed work of this character which can not be obtained by inspections at 
random. 
The commission has been in existence for three years and expects to complete 
its work and issue its final report the latter partof 1917. Progress reports and

descriptions of special phases of the work have been issued from time to time, 
appearing in the journals of the various scientific societies.’ 
HYGIENE OF RURAL SCHOOLS, 
As pointed out in the chapter on educational hygiene last year, 
the importance of health work in the rural schools is receiving in- 
creasing attention. A number of careful surveys of rural-school con- 
ditions, covering entire counties or smaller territorial units, have been 
made during the past year. 
L. Surveys by United States Public Health Service—tIn a recent 
address Dr. Taliaferro Clark,’ of the Public Health Service, gives 
the most recent data and conclusions relative to health work in the 
rural schools. He shows that the physical care of school children 
demands serious attention in every community. Intensive studies of 
rural-school conditions conducted by the Public Health Service, he 
declares, have revealed a special need of health supervision of rural- 
school children because (1) they constitute 60.7 per cent of the 
total school enrollment of the country; (2) they are largely denied 
medical attention by specialists, such as may be had in hospitals and 
clinics in cities; (3) they can not be protected en masse by health 
laws as in urban communities. : 
Dr. Clark points out the need for the establishment of an efficient 
system of health supervision. 
Unfortunately, only a small part of the rural school population of the 
country enjoys the benefits of such supervision. For example, in States where 
the laws are mandatory for the medical inspection of rural schools only 39.8 
per cent of the total school enrollment is in rural districts; where they are 
permissive, 60 per cent; and where inspection laws do not apply, 61.4 per cent. 
There are several reasons for this state of affairs: (a) The lack of a 
proper appreciation of such measures in rural communities; (6) the scarcity 
of persons in rural districts who are properly qualified for this service; (c) 
the financial inability of a number of rural communities to maintain an inde- 
pendent medical inspection service. 
The following practical means of meeting these conditions are 
suggested : : 
The interest of rural communities in the matter of medical inspection can 
best be secured through intensive school surveys. By calling attention to un- 
suspected physical defects in their children and to school conditions requiring 
  
1 Several of the reports of experiments with school children have been reported from 
time to time “in School and Society. The most recent reports describe an interesting 
series of experiments undertaken to ascertain the relative effects of outside air and 
“recirculated ’ washed air upon the intellectual efforts and progress of school pupils. 
The experiments were made upon 88 pupils, who were carefully tested regarding their 
mental capacity and proficiency in arithmetic and English by six tests of from 10 to 30 
minutes’ length. The results showed that the ability or readiness of pupils to learn did 
not seem to be appreciably impaired because of their working in a room ventilated by 
recirculated air, though unpleasant odors were often noted.

EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 333 
attention, the necessity of some form of health supervision is brought home to 
parents. We have had practical experience of the educational value of such 
investigations through reports of an increased number of children seeking relief 
following surveys of this character. 
The medical inspection of schools in rural districts is accompanied by a 
serious handicap, due to the impossibility, under existing conditions, of secur- 
ing the services of a person properly qualified for this position. The appoint- 
ment of a local practitioner is, as a rule, barren of results. He is unable to 
devote his whole time to this work, while the jealousy and quiet opposition of 
other local practitioners frequently render his efforts nugatory. 
The requirements of a medical inspector are: (1) He should devote his whole 
time to this service and not engage in private practice or other calling that 
would interfere with the proper discharge of the duties of this position; (2) 
he should be skilled in medical diagnosis, able to refract children for glasses 
when necessary, and qualified to advise with and assist the family physician 
when it is so desired; (3) he should have a thorough understanding of the 
principles of hygiene and the ability to apply them to school purposes. 
Tn addition to this handicap is the fact that the restricted financial 
resources of most rural communities precludes the offering of a 
salary commensurate with the attainments of a desirable school 
inspector. This difficulty can be overcome, in great measure, by com- 
bining the duties of the school physician with those of the district, 
‘county, or local health officer, with a salary equivalent to the com- 
bined salaries of the two positions. This would enable these com- 
munities to secure the full-time services of a trained sanitarian for 
health work and school inspection.’ 
Two changes in school administration are urged as essential con- 
ditions to the establishment of efficient health work in rural schools: 
The establishment of the county unit of administration and the con- 
solidation of rural schools. The former would be a positive step 
towards the employment of a full-time school and community health 
officer. The latter reform would mean larger buildings with im- 
proved sanitation. The concentration of pupils would render super- 
vision both more thorough and more economical.’ 
2. The school nurse in the rural school——In the chapter last year 
the school work of the town and county nursing service of the Amer- 
ican Red Cross was referred to briefly. In spite of the heavy de-   
1In New York it is the intention of the law that the trustees of a school district shall 
employ for school medical inspection the health officer of the town in which the district 
is located. This is not obligatory. The trustees may employ another physician in their 
discretion. 
2 An interesting development in connection with consolidation is the use of auto-vans, 
heated by the exhaust, for transporting children. Such a van used in Auntaulaunee 
‘Township, Berks County, Pa., is unique in that it seats 45 to 50 pupils. It has a double 
seat facing the two sides of the van running down through the middle. It makes the 
trip from the farthest home to the school in a half hour, makes two trips a day, never 
varies more than 5 minutes from the schedule, and has missed only two days during 
the entire school year. The directors say the $3,000 paid for it was earned during the 
year. All who see it consider it far more sanitary than the horse-driven vehicles which 
take much longer time to get to school and are not so well heated. 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
    334 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
mands made by the war upon the resources of the Red Cross, this 
constructive work in the department of civilian relief has been main- 
tained and extended. During the past year Red Cross visiting nurses 
have been employed in 19 different States. There has been an in- 
crease in the number of training centers for the preparation of public- 
health nurses. The State University of Ohio is to cooperate with 
the local visiting nurse association in Columbus in offering a course 
in the fall of 1916. The University of Cincinnati is also to offer such’ 
opportunity. Washington University, in St. Louis, will probably 
make a beginning in 1916, as will also the State University of Iowa, 
and possibly some other State universities of the Middle West. 
Some of the more important examples of methods and results of 
the rural nursing work follow: 
In Livingston County, Ill, the nurse is employed by the county antituber- 
eulosis association. In this county data relative to the health of the rural school 
children have been compiled and correlated with grade, age, attendance, and 
consequent cost to the county. The visiting nurse holds classes in home nurs- 
ing in the high schools of two districts. In one of these the course is com- 
pulsory. 
In Kent County, Mich., the county commissioners and the county antitubercu- 
losis society share the expense. This includes the cost and maintenance of an 
automobile. : 
In the report for 1915 an account is given of the organization and activities 
of the hygienic league, the object of which is the cultivation of interest in the 
prevention of disease and in clean personal habits and the spread of general 
health knowledge among the school children. The plans have been worked out 
with care and foresight. The incentive to become a member of the league is 
found “in the ambition of the child not to be outdone in the improvement of 
personal appearance as well as in personal health.” Membership is granted upon 
evidence of standardized improvement, and is visibly signified by an attractive 
badge. 
Near’ the end of the school year in 1916 a dental clinic for rural children was 
held for two weeks (12 half days) in Grand Rapids. A dentist was employed 
and the children were brought by the nurse from the outlying districts. 
The University of Tennessee has launched a new plan in the employment of 
a public health nurse as a special home demonstration agent in the extension 
department of the institution. The nurse is emphasizing in her talks construc- 
tive hygiene in the home, school, and public meeting place. She prepares ma- 
terial on health subjects for the use of county agents. She has just prepared 
a bulletin on “ Talks to girls on health,” to be sent to the girls in the canning 
clubs of the State. 
The mayor of Jerome, Ariz., a small mining town where a Red Cross visiting 
nurse has been employed, writes: 
Miss Kraft’s work has resulted in wonderful improvement in health and 
sanitary conditions. The death rate is reduced, and we have not had occasion 
to spend a lot of money in quarantine guards in the endeavor to control out- 
breaks of contagious diseases, which has been the heaviest expense of the 
health department in past years. 
During the past year county nursing has been initiated in North Dakota, Vir- 
ginia, and several other States. The Illinois Legislature enacted a law (Glacken 
law) for the encouragement of county nursing.
-P-A-G-E-363
  EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE, 335 
MISCELLANEOUS. 
Of the subjects treated at length last year, cooperation in admin- 
istration, schoolhouse sanitation, medical inspection, and hygiene 
of the rural schools, only one, the last, receives extended notice this 
year. The exhaustive investigations by the public health service of 
rural school conditions and the work of the town and country nursing 
service of the Red Cross in the rural schools are so important and 
suggestive that they could not. properly be passed over with a word. 
Cooperation in health work is developing into coordination. Dr. 
Stiles, of the United States Public Health Service, makes the sane 
suggestion that the health officer in every jurisdiction should be ex- 
officio a member of the corresponding board of education; vice versa, 
the school superintendent a member of the health board. 
There has been no important legislation relative to schoolhouse 
sanitation in the past year. In the sections of this chapter on venti- 
lation and eye hygiene, certain aspects of sanitary construction and 
equipment are touched upon. 
The standard sanitary requirements for schools, worked out by Dr. 
Cornell, director of school medical inspection in Philadelphia, fill 
a well-recognized need. These standards were purposely “made so 
low that they can not be criticized as impractical and ideal.” They 
have been in operation for about five years and have proved their 
usefulness. They should serve as points of departure at least for 
school systems that desire efficient sanitary inspection and control of 
school buildings.*

    EDUCATIONAL HYGIENE. 337 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
The committee on hygiene of the National Council of Education 
in its annual report projects the following program of health work 
in the field of education: 
I. Experiments in and demonstration of improved health work in the schools 
(particularly in the rural schools), to which our committee has given special 
study and attention, Proposals for such experiments and demonstrations (par- | 
ticularly for improved health of rural school children) have received cordial 
approval from leaders in the fields of public health, education, and sociar 
service. 
Ii. A comprehensive and authoritative study of physical conditions and char- 
acteristics of children for the purpose of establishing physical norms of child 
development. Such standards would improve greatly the value and efficiency 
of health examinations and health supervision of children generally. All those 
who are engaged in work for children agree in indorsing a study and report of 
this kind. 
III. A national investigation of the health and general welfare of teachers. 
The present study of health and welfare of teachers in New York State points 
convincingly to the need of a national study in this field. 
Iy. A thorough investigation of the health effects of athletic games upon 
school pupils of various ages and of both sexes. Such an investigation is rec- 
ognized as of great present importance by leaders in the medical field as well 
as by educators. 
V. A study and report on health teaching and training in the schools. 
Health teaching is in a period of rapid and significant transition. An investi- 
gation of the work of the schools brings to light many valuable efforts in this 
field. A report in the near future which might authoritatively support- the 
principles of sound health teaching and make conveniently available informa- 
tion regarding some of the best efforts in this field would provide a valuable 
document for the guidance of teachers.

  CHAPTER XX. 
EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 
By H. H. Wuearon, 
Specialist in Immigrant Education, Bureau of Education. 
I. GENERAL. 
In 1914, when the Bureau of Education began a national inves- 
tigation of facilities for the education of aliens, chaos existed in this 
important phase of education. Few established and well-approved 
standards existed, and practically all methods were in the experi- 
mental stage. Policies, except that of Federal noninterference, were 
known only to cities and States where evening schools for immigrants 
had been long maintained. Public agencies of various kinds were 
endeavoring to treat the problem each in its own way, without defi- 
nite endeavor to cooperate with other agencies, and with no fixed 
policies. Immigrant education was considered at this time pri- 
marily a matter for local attention and jurisdiction. The spectacle 
of cities working out methods independently and adopting fads in 
immigrant education without the coordinating influence of even a 
clearing house of information was so common as hardly to excite 
comment. State supervision, and especially State aid, had not at 
this time been seriously considered. Only one State, New Jersey, 
had specified financial aid for the encouragement of immigrant 
classes. Only one other State, Massachusetts, had legislative pro- 
visions requiring the school attendance of illitefates up to 21 years 
of age. Federal interest was considered in some quarters both in- 
opportune and improper. Establishment and maintenance of educa- 
tional facilities had, by established precedent, and constitutional 
and legislative provisions, been left primarily to State governments 
and municipal and district school jurisdictions. The same policy was 
applied to the education of immigrants. Such Federal interest as 
existed derived its impetus largely from the national attempt to 
remove illiteracy, since the foreign-born whites contributed in large 
numbers to the body of illiterates. The establishment of funda- 
mental principles and policies in the education of immigrants was, 
so far as the Federal Government was concerned, agitated chiefly 
339
-P-A-G-E-368
    340 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
by reformers and social workers who came into more direct contact 
with the problem than governmental officials. 
In contrast to State and Federal agencies, numerous private agen- 
cies and organizations—city, State, and National; civic, patriotic, 
and educational—were exploiting the field of immigrant education 
extensively. Frequently this was due to ulterior motives, among 
which may be cited the desire to secure financial support. Owing to 
the general, and, in some cases, unintelligent public interest in the 
immigrant, appealing instances of‘his condition were described for 
the purpose of securing contributions. Again, the creation and 
maintenance of English and civics classes were utilized as a means of 
building up the schools of private agencies, many of which, if in- 
vestigated, would not have received full public sanction. The efforts 
of some private agencies, furthermore, were well meaning, but di- 
rected through the wrong channels. Types of educational facilities 
and instruction were provided wholly unsuited to the immigrant 
type, need, and condition, with the result that immigrant men and 
women were induced to attend classes of no practical value either to 
them in their life in America or to the country as an Americanizing 
influence. While the activities of the various private agencies so 
far mentioned were excusable, their general intentions being good, 
the exploitation of immigrants by political organizations and fellow 
countrymen, who maintained classes of instruction either for the pur- 
pose of securing excessive fees or for the purpose of making partisans 
politically of the immigrants who were being trained, was peculiarly 
harmful and a common occurrence. In several States, particularly 
California, through the investigation of the Commission of Immi- 
gration and Housing, instances were found where immigrants paid 
from $25 to $50 for a two weeks’ course in English and civil govern- 
ment that they might be equipped to pass their naturalization exami- 
nations. So-called political clubs were formed in many localities by 
foreign-born citizens who were hirelings of petty political leaders, 
and who, under the guise of giving civic training, promoted the 
interests of such politicians or of some political party. 
LACK OF COOPERATION. 
Further accentuating the chaos existing in immigrant education, 
public agencies failed to cooperate among themselves or to call for 
the cooperation of private organizations, while, on the other hand, 
private organizations not only failed to cooperate among themselves, 
but actually competed with public agencies in providing facilities 
and instruction for immigrant residents. This lack of mutual as- 
sistance had three results: First, decentralization of all educational 
work among immigrants; second, a positive diminution of public
-P-A-G-E-369
  EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS, 341 
activity; and, third, rivalry among private agencies both to secure 
the bulk of financial support and to build up powerful organizations. 
Such were the conditions in immigrant education which confronted 
school officials and social workers at the beginning of the national 
investigation by the bureau in 1914. 
PROGRESS SINCE 1914. 
Progress in every way has been rapid, definite, and extensive. 
Governmental authorities everywhere, city, State, and Federal, have 
expressed serious interest in the problem, and have taken definite 
steps to provide adequate facilities. Municipalities have seen that 
the education of the immigrant, especially through the provision 
of evening classes, is to be treated as a fundamental part of the 
educational system, rather than as an incident or adjunct to the day- 
school system to be maintained or not at will, or according to the 
amount of money in the school treasury. Many of the States, such 
as California, Michigan, and New York, and particularly the State 
departments of education, have come to appreciate the fact that the 
immigrant is not merely a local problem. The transitory nature 
of his employment, and hence residence, have been increasingly appre- 
ciated in their bearing upon his education. While the primary obli- 
gation of the city has been acknowledged, both officials and citizens 
have grown to sce that the secondary obligation of the State to assist 
the city and the local school district in this particular type of educa- 
tion is one of such imperative nature as to demand financial assist- 
ance and State supervision and coordination of activities. The 
Federal Government, especially the Bureau of Education, as a 
result of an investigation of facilities, has come to take the stand 
that inasmuch as admission of an immigrant to the United States, 
together with his admission to citizenship, are both Federal matters, 
then, equally, is interest in his training for life and citizenship in this 
country a Federal matter. With immigrants moving from city to city 
and from State to State, with different nationalities in each State, 
and with the necessity of a clearing-house of information becoming 
more and more apparent, this Federal interest has been increasingly 
directed toward the establishment of fundamental principles, poli- 
cies, and standards, together with approved practices in this form 
of education. 
On the other hand, private agencies have seen the futility of com- 
petition among themselves and with public agencies and institutions. 
Hence they have increasingly adopted the practice of establishing 
facilities only where they do not exist, or where public facilities can 
not, for financial reasons, be made to meet the local problem. The 
practice has become more and more established of placing private 
facilities under the supervision of appropriate public school officials, 
61355°—16——24
-P-A-G-E-370
      342 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
and of turning over to the latter such facilities as rapidly as finan- 
cial and other reasons will permit. The result is to-day that, while 
conditions are far from satisfactory, the evolution of education has 
forced a larger measure of cooperation on the part of all agencies 
and individuals interested in the training of immigrants for citi- 
zenship in America. Although this is the transition period, yet 
principles, policies, standards, and methods are now more clearly 
delineated than ever before, while the most effective procedure of 
all—cooperation—is daily teaching those interested its potency in 
the Americanization movement. 
Il. CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL STANDARDS. 
Some of the standards virtually established by State constitutions 
are unfortunate. In effect, the provisions in many State constitutions 
operate against the establishment and extension of evening-school 
facilities, through which, primarily, the non-English-speaking for- 
eigner must be reached. Such is the case in the States of Alabama, 
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South 
Dakota, and Wyoming. In these States the constitutions, in most 
instances, authorize the legislature to provide for establishment and 
organization of free schools only for children within the ages of 6 and 
21 years. Some of these States restrict the division of State school 
funds so that only children 21 years of age or under are the bene- 
ficiaries. In only one constitution, that of California, are evening 
schools specifically mentioned by name, and their establishment au- 
thorized. While it is true that, under existing rules of legal con- 
struction, constitutional provisions in the other States enumerated 
do not prohibit legislatures appropriating money from general State 
funds for the support of evening schools and do not make impossible 
the maintenance of evening schools by local communities, yet the fact 
that State school moneys can not be used except for children below 
the ages of 18 or 21 years discourages legislatures from separate ap- 
propriation for evening-school purposes, and operates to discourage 
local communities from maintaining such facilities on their own 
financial responsibility without State aid. 
EVENING-SCHOOL LEGISLATION. 
Most legislative provisions applicable to evening schools are per- 
missive in nature so far as establishment of evening schools by local 
communities is concerned. Massachusetts and Connecticut are excep- 
tions to the rule. They require, under certain conditions, that eve- 
ning schools must be maintained. In Massachusetts, every city or
-P-A-G-E-371
  
EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 343 
town in which labor certificates are granted within the year to 20 
or more persons to whom the literacy law applies must maintain 
an evening school during the following year. In Connecticut, every 
town having a population of 10,000 or more is required to establish 
and maintain such schools for the instruction of persons over 14 
years of age. In other States, evening schools must be established 
by local communities, provided a stipulated number of residents 
present a formal petition. This is the case in Indiana, where night 
schools must be established in cities of over 3,000 inhabitants upon 
the petition of 20 or more inhabitants having children between the 
ages of 14 and 21 years, necessarily employed during the day, who 
will attend such evening schools. Practically the same requirement 
affects Baltimore County, Md., except that the petition must be 
signed by 20 persons over 12 years of age who desire to attend eve- 
ning school. In Pennsylvania, the provision is mandatory in second, 
third, and fourth class school districts upon the application of 25 
parents of pupils above the age of 14 years who are residents of the 
school district. 
On the other hand, legislative provisions meking the establishment 
of evening schools ee optional on the part of local boards of 
education have been passed in several of the principal immigration 
States, such as California, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Wis- 
consin. In fact, this seems to be the standard adopted by most 
legislatures. The result is that evening-school facilities are not 
maintained in a large number of communities where a genuine de- 
mand and need exists. Even in those cities where facilities are 
established they are usually considered merely adjuncts to the day- 
school system, rather than an integral part of the educational sys- 
tem. Thus in the principal immigration States above specifically 
mentioned the number of communities maintaining evening schools 
is surprisingly low. In New York, with a foreign-born white popu- 
lation of 2,729,272, the largest in the entire country, a State having 
148 urban centers with over 2,500 inhabitants, and 71 urban centers 
with over 1,000 foreign-born whites, the number of cities maintain- 
ing evening schools is only 41. In Pennsylvania, the number is 
slightly higher, 42, but is really lower when taken in connection with 
the fact that this State has 263 urban centers with 2,500 inhabitants 
and 127 such centers with 1,000 foreign-born whites. New Jersey 
has only 30 communities with evening schools, as against 61 urban 
centers with over 1,000 foreign-born whites; Ohio, 20 as against 40; 
California, 9 as against 80; Wisconsin, 19 as against 38. On the 
other hand, Massachusetts, owing to the operation of its mandatory 
evening-school law, has 65 communities with evening schools, as 
against 117 communities with over. 1,000 foreign-born whites. In 
Connecticut, every city over 10,000, with the exception of one, a  
-P-A-G-E-372
  344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
wealthy suburban community which has no reason to comply with 
the State law, maintains evening schools pursuant to the mandatory 
provision above referred to. No State during the past two years has 
passed any legislation making the establishment of evening schools 
mandatory. 
In commenting upon legislative standards, mention should be made 
of the fact that during the last year a method of securing the estab- 
lishment of evening schools has come into common use although not 
required by law in any considerable number of States; namely, peti- 
tion by immigrants desiring evening-school instruction in English 
and civics. The Bureau of Education is in receipt of a number of 
such petitions requesting it to use its influence with local boards of 
ediication in securing evening-school facilities. It was also advised 
of several instances where similar petitions have been made directly 
to local school authorities as a means of securing action by them. 
This suggests a very definite scheme of securing evening schools in 
States where these facilities are authorized by law, but are not re- 
quired to be maintained. As interest in acquiring the common 
language of the country develops among the foreign-born whites, 
the tendency seems more and more to be in the direction of making 
formal petitions for instruction through evening schools. This is 
quite likely to be adopted by legislatures as a standard condition 
precedent to requiring evening schools, for the purpose of ascertain- 
ing the desire on the part of immigrant residents for training in 
English and civics. 
A most significant law was passed by the California Legislature 
last year, setting a high standard for other States. This legislation 
provides for the appointment of “domestic educators” by local 
boards of education, upon the basis of one appointee to each 500 
units of attendance in the day schools. These educators are to go 
from house to house, especially in the foreign sections, for the pur- 
pose of training the mothers and children in the rules of health, sani- 
tation, and hygiene, the principles of buying food and clothing, the 
English language and civics, and other appropriate subjects. The 
Commission of Immigration and Housing of California, the Federa- 
tion of Women’s Clubs, and the Daughters of the American Revolu- 
tion have united in developing facilities authorized by this new law. 
STATE AID. 
Eleven States grant State aid benefiting evening schools: Cali- 
fornia, Connecticut, Indiana, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, New 
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin. 
The amount of State aid, together with the conditions under which 
it is granted, however, is not standardized in these States. Under
-P-A-G-E-373
  
EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 345 
‘ certain limitations, Pennsylvania, to promote vocational instruction, 
grants to a school district two-thirds of the sum which has been ex- 
pended during the previous school year for such instruction. Even- 
ing schools for foreigners are thus indirectly benefited if vocational 
instruction is given therein. In Maine two-thirds of the amount ex- 
pended for the salaries of teachers is allowed for evening schools in 
which certain vocational subjects are taught. One-half the cost of 
maintenance or of actual expenditure for evening-school instruction 
is the standard most frequently adopted. This practice obtains in 
New Jersey under a special law to promote immigrant classes, and 
in Rhode Island and Wisconsin under certain restrictions as to the 
total amount receivable by a community. Divers other methods of 
apportionment obtain in the remaining States, as in California, 
where it is based upon average daily attendance in evening schools; 
in ‘Connecticut, where a fixed rate of $2.25 per pupil in average at- 
tendance is paid; in Minnesota, where also obtains a per capita basis 
for evening-school pupils between the ages of 5 and 21 years; in 
New Jersey, where a fixed amount per teacher is paid, together with 
a per capita allowance based upon attendance; in New York, where 
the basis is the number of teachers and the days taught by each; and 
in Washington, where aid is given according to the actual number 
of units of attendance of all pupils. In the two States where aid 
is granted upon the basis of attendance an evening attended is 
credited as half a day provided the session is two hours in length. 
It would seem, therefore, that some very high standards have been 
set in the apportionment of State aid, yet none of them has received 
such general adoption as to warrant the statement that it is an ap- 
proved, standard. While the principle of State aid for evening- 
school maintenance is firmly established, the conditions under which 
it is granted still need standardization. 
STANDARDS IN ADMINISTRATION. 
Supervision of evening schools ought to be as definite and as 
extensive as supervision of day schools. It is not upon a satisfactory 
basis in most communities. The general practice seems to be to leave 
supervision to the superintendent. Only about one-third of the 150 
cities reporting during the last year employ a director of evening- 
school work. Many large communities report no such school official. 
Only one city, Rochester, N. Y., reports a director of immigrant 
education, whose duties are exclusively limited to this particular 
phase of education. It is needless to remark that this city has 
made rapid strides in its Americanization work, due largely to 
this specialized supervision. A very few other cities report the 
detailing of a principal to supervise the immigrant work in addition 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
  346 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
to his other duties, but in these cities Americanization work has not 
progressed so extensively or along such definite lines. Detroit has 
announced for the coming year the appointment of a supervisor of 
immigrant education for the purpose of training teachers in meth- 
ods, selecting appropriate courses and texts, coordinating the work 
of the various schools and classes, and working out appropriate en- 
tertainment on “ social” evenings. 
In the appointment of evening-school teachers it seems to be the 
general practice to select teachers most capable from the day-school 
staff. Superintendents who follow this method from choice do so 
feeling that a day-school teacher is most competent and has training 
in educational methods. Those who follow the practice from neces- 
sity, not being able to secure suitable teachers from other sources, 
do not approve of the practice, feeling that the double work, phys- 
ically and mentally, placed upon teachers reduces the efficiency *of 
both day and evening school instruction. Until adequate means. of 
training teachers for the instruction of immigrants in English and 
civics are devised, coupled with increased salaries, it is quite likely 
that this custom will obtain generally. 
Methods of appointing teachers are quite diverse. While the ideal 
method would be recommendation by the supervisor of immigrant 
education, after proper professional determination of fitness, nomi- 
nation by the superintendent, and appointment by the board of edu- 
cation, yet local whim seems to have determined the particular 
method. Some communities report appointment by superintendents, 
others by boards of education, others by committees of the board of 
education, others by principals, others by directors of evening schools, 
others by supervisors of extension work, or by the board of industrial 
education. 4 
The qualifications considered in the determination of fitness have 
gravitated toward the following tests, the order set forth indicating 
the commonness of the method: first, general teaching ability, train- 
ing, and experience; second, known ability to teach immigrants; 
third, experience in teaching immigrants. Training in the teaching 
of immigrants has been given slight consideration, due to the fact 
that few cities have given definite training in this particular line 
of work. Knowledge and appreciation of the immigrant and sym- 
pathy with him and with his national and racial characteristics have 
not come to be regarded as important. Ability to speak the foreign 
language is a requirement in some places, and personality receives 
consideration in a number of cities, but no standard test or definition 
of personality prevails. 
In training teachers of foreigners, some progress has been made 
during the past year. In Rochester, N. Y., a high standard has been 
established, the teachers being brought together in meetings fre-
-P-A-G-E-375
  
  EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 347 
quently, and training given them in their own classrooms by the 
supervisor of immigrant education. Small groups of teachers are 
taken about from school to school by the supervisor for the purpose 
of watching the work of the most competent instructors. Similar 
methods have been utilized in other cities, but the training is not so 
highly specialized. Several teachers’ institutes have been held dur- 
ing the past year in order to develop an interest in this type of edu- 
cation and to point out some of the most effective methods utilized. 
Boston has conducted a teachers’ training course over a considerable 
period of time. At the close of the school year a course was given 
in the city of Detroit, two specialists from outside of the city giving 
two lectures each day to about 300 persons. A similar course was 
given in Buffalo at the close of the evening-school term, while sev- 
eral courses have been given in teachers’ colleges and even in univer- 
sities where teachers were in attendance. The most notable of such 
courses were the ones given in the State Teachers’ College at Albany, 
N. Y., and in the summer school of Columbia University. This par- 
fiéolar method of training probably marks the beginning of great 
advance in the equipment and qualification of teachers for the type 
of instruction under consideration. Several other cities have also an- 
nounced such courses for the coming school.year. Special confer- 
ences and meetings of teachers have been held in Harris Teachers’ 
College at St. Louis, Mo., Wilmerding, Pa., Rockford and East Chi- 
cago, Ill., Franklin, Mass., Hibbing, Minn., Garwood, N.J., Hudson 
Falls and Yonkers, N. Y., Milwaukee and Superior, Wis. About 35 
cities report lectures on immigrant-education problems. 
Lack of standards in training, of course, is due in part to lack of 
standard in methods of teaching English and civics. As progress is 
made in the latter direction, so equally will advance be made in com- 
petent training of teachers. 
Salaries of both teachers and principals in the evening schools are 
generally paid upon the evening basis. Of 354 communities report- 
ing upon the basis of payment, 271 pay at a fixed rate per evening; 
41 at a fixed rate per hour or period; 31 on the monthly basis; 6 upon 
the yearly basis; and 5 upon the weekly basis. While payment upon 
the evening basis is the standard usually adopted, yet distinct ad- 
vance has been made during the last year or two toward payment 
upon the monthly basis. The whole question of payment is involved 
in the schedule of hours and sessions. As long as teachers are taken 
from the day-school staff and evening schools are conducted on only 
three or four evenings per week, payment must by necessity in most 
cities be made upon the evening basis. Where evening schools are 
conducted four or five evenings per week, and where adult classes 
are also held during the day, the tendency is toward payment upon a 
monthly basis. The extension of evening-school facilities and_ the
-P-A-G-E-376
848 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
combination of adult day classes with evening-school instruction will 
enable an increasingly large number of communities to make pay- 
ment upon that basis. The professional side of instructing adult 
immigrants will never be developed until a teacher is placed in a 
position to specialize in this form of work to the exclusion of day- 
school instruction of children and other vocations. Principals are 
usually paid upon the same basis as teachers, although in 14 instances 
a different arrangement prevails. 
Salaries of teachers and principals show the greatest diversity. 
The most frequent salary in cities of over 100,000 population is $2 
per evening. This obtains in 10 out of 36 cities reporting, although 
the range of salaries in these cities is $1 to $3, while the average is 
$2.20 per evening. The most frequent salary in cities ranging from 
25,000 to 100,000 population is also $2 per evening, as well as in cities 
from 10,000 to 25,000. Twenty-five out of the 81 cities in the second- 
mentioned group and 26 cities out of 82 in the third group pay this 
amount. The range of salaries, however, in both of these last-men- 
tioned groups is greater even than in the first mentioned, being from 
$1 to $3.50. The average in both, however, is below the first-men- 
tioned group. The general tendency seems to be to raise the rate per 
evening as interest and appreciation of the Americanization move- 
ment develops in each community. 
TERMS, SESSIONS, AND HOURS. 
The greatest diversity exists in the number of evenings taught 
during the term. In Traverse City, Mich., the term runs through 
20 sessions, one evening per week, while in Los Angeles and Oakland, 
Cal., the term extends throughout 187 sessions of five evenings per 
week. It must be remarked, however, that the length of the terms 
in. the two California cities mentioned is due to the requirement 
of State law, it having been made a standard by legislative 
enactment that evening school facilities shall be coextensive with 
those provided in the day schools. In the 48 cities of over 100,000 
inhabitants reporting, in which the range of sessions is from 46 to 
187, the average number of sessions is 83. This, however, does not 
mean that the average is by any means a standard. Only 9 of these 
cities report over 90 sessions; 24 report from 70 to 90 sessions, and. 
10 less than 70. Again, of the 102 cities of 25,000 to 100,000 popula- 
tion reporting, with a range of sessions from 40 to 185, the average 
number of sessions is 79. In 22 the term runs over 90 sessions; in 
59 from 60 to 90 sessions; and in 21, less than 60. Out of the 113 
cities of 10,000 to 25,000 inhabitants reporting, with a range of ses- 
sions from 20 to 177, the average number of sessions is 59. Thirteen 
cities report over 80 sessions in a term; 78 report from 40 to 80; and 
22 report less than 40.
-P-A-G-E-377
EDUCATION OF IMMIGRANTS. 849 
State aid is the most powerful factor in standardizing the number 
of sessions in a term. In New Jersey, under the provision of the 
general aid law, a community may not receive State aid unless it 
maintains night schools on at least 64 evenings. In Connecticut, the 
minimum is fixed at 75. In Minnesota, State aid is not available 
unless the pupils attend on 40 nights or more. 
The number of sessions per week ranges from one to six. The 
standard seems to be three nights per week on alternate evenings. 
Of 376 cities reporting, 175 had three evenings per week, and 102 
had four evenings per week. Monday is selected by 335 cities, and 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings constitute the most fre- 
quent combination in 86 cities, although classes are conducted on the 
first four evenings of the week in 80 cities. The tendency during the 
past year or two has been toward the first standard mentioned— 
three alternate evenings per week—Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. 
At the close of the last evening-school year, the school officials of 
Detroit announced that the four-evening combination would be 
abolished and a three-evening combination would be substituted 
during the coming school year. 
The length of a session is unusually well standardized; 323 out 
of 428 cities reporting use a two-hour session. Nevertheless, 74 cities 
have sessions of one hour and a half. Although 122 cities use the 
7 to 9 o’clock period, the most common hours of conducting classes 
are from 7.30 to 9.30. One hundred and forty-six communities have 
adopted this as a standard period. 
REGULARIZING ATTENDANCE. 
Although cities have used several methods of regularizing attend- 
ance of immigrant pupils, the most common practice is to require a 
deposit returnable upon regularity of attendance. At least 150 com- 
munities require deposits conditioned upon two-thirds to four-fifths 
of the evenings taught. The amount of the deposits varies widely. 
The most common amount required is $1. Out of 429 cities 77 
report an actual fee charged. This operates to discourage attendance 
rather than to regularize it. 
PUBLICITY AND COOPERATION. 
In bringing evening-school facilities to the attention of prospec- 
tive pupils, the most common methods used by school authorities 
are announcements in the foreign-language newspapers, posters, 
placards, and handbills. In seven cities slides are shown in moving- 
picture theaters. In a few cities circular letters are sent to em- 
ployers, labor organizations, foreigners’ societies, and civic clubs.  
-P-A-G-E-378

350 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
The greatest contribution to publicity methods has been made by 
the city of Detroit, where the board of education and the board 
of commerce united in a city-wide publicity campaign to induce 
foreigners to attend night school. Several hundred industrial 
establishments cooperated in having their non-English speaking 
employees enroll. Posters and handbills were disseminated broadcast 
and notices were placed in pay envelopes. Priests, foreigners’ soci- 
eties, foreign-language newspapers, patriotic societies, civic clubs, 
and fraternal organizations cooperated in bringing the value of 
night schools to the attention of foreign-born residents. As a result 
enrollment was increased in excess of 150 per cent beyond the year 
preceding. 
For the sake of stimulating an appreciation of the value of pub- 
licity as a means of getting foreigners into the night schools, the 
Bureau of Education caused the distribution of over 150,000 “America 
First” posters. These set forth in English and seven foreign lan- 
guages the advantages of attending night school and learning the 
English language. The response was definite and conclusive. Not 
only was a perceptible increase in attendance noted, but a positive 
demand for night schools came from many sections where such facili- 
ties had never been maintained. A considerable number of communi- 
ties established night schools as a result, and a keen interest in the 
Americanization movement was developed among American citizens. 
Another method of publicity was devised by the United States 
Bureau of Naturalization in the Department of Labor. The names 
of declarants and petitioners for naturalization were entered upon 
cards and sent to the respective school authorities in those communi- 
ties where these aliens resided. Through the contact developed in 
this way between naturalization courts and school officials a consid- 
erable number of classes in citizenship for those preparing for 
naturalization have been established. 
In December, 1914, the Bureau of Education suggested to the 
United States Bureau of Immigration in the Department of Labor 
that the names of alien children of school age be sent to the proper 
school authorities in those communities to which such children were 
destined upon arriving at the ports of entry. The names of a 
limited number prior to that time had been sent to certain cities 
upon ‘request. The plan was extended to all communities at the be- 
ginning of the school term of 1915-16. A great number of enthu- 
siastic letters were received from superintendents setting forth the 
value of the plan in enabling-them to locate newly arrived immigrant 
children before they become unlawfully employed. 
Americanization through education has been denoted, in 1915-16, 
by greater tendency toward cooperation. Private agencies espe-  
-P-A-G-E-379

cially have shown more desire to unite with governmental authori- 
ties in dealing with the problem of immigrant education. Chambers 
of commerce, industrial establishments, patriotic societies, philan- 
thropic organizations, newspapers, women’s clubs, labor unions, and 
public-spirited citizens, alike, have put sincere endeavor into the 
Americanization movement. In many instances privately main- 
tained schools have been transferred to the supervision of the consti- 
tuted school authorities. This indicates a healthy tendency toward 
centralizing work for immigrants.

  CHAPTER XXI. 
EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS.t 
By Epwarp FRANKLIN BUCHNER, 
Professor of Education, Johns Hopkins University. 
INTRODUCTION. 
A review of the activities during the year just closing reveals 
a more thorough establishment of “the survey” as a means of edu- 
cational progress. Communities, large and small, are finding this, 
too, increasingly useful as a means of acquiring and disseminating 
information concerning the work of any given school system. The 
method of comparison necessarily involved in a survey also yields 
a ready perspective from which may be gained a more or less 
clear vision of the lines along which further progress or readjust- 
ment may be made. The number of surveys that have been com- 
pleted and have been in progress during the period reaches a total 
of 76. This increase may safely be regarded as further evidence 
of growing satisfaction in the public mind with this recent method 
of “stock-taking” in educational activities. 
The secure establishment of “the survey” as the proper means of 
inviting progress in any and all forms of educational affairs is unmis- 
takably indicated by the increase in the number of responsible agen- 
cies which have accepted this most recent mode of approach to the 
problems involved in large and complex situations. The services of 
the Bureau of Education have been “freely placed at the disposal 
of any educational institution in the United States which might 
desire a survey of its work and organization.” The bureau was the 
  
1In the report of the Commissioner of Education for the year ended June 30, 1914 
(Ch. XXIV, vol. 1, pp. 513-562), and June 30, 1915 (Ch. XVIII, vol. 1, pp. 433-492), 
appeared two reports of school surveys in the United States. The educational inquiries 
and surveys, the reports of which, with two exceptions, had been published up to the 
close of each of the two years respectively, were analyzed with reference to the place and 
time, the authorization, the details of the staff, the situation leading to the inquiry, the 
method and scope, and the fundamental problems investigated, with a summary of the 
more important findings and the recommendations. 
This third report includes those surveys of which the reports have been published 
during the year under review or are in process of publication. Owing to the limitations 
of the present report the usual summary of the important findings and recommendations 
has been omitted. There is appended a list of those surveys the reports of which may not 
be published.

active agent in the first organized survey in 1911, and nearly one- 
third of the studies included in this chapter have been prepared by 
its representatives. The recent announcement of the General Edu- 
cation Board that it was prepared to enter upon survey activities 
adds the worth of the collective judgment of this large foundation 
to the growing value of the survey. Thus, to individuals and the 
temporary commissions created by local authority, the first five years 
of the movement have witnessed the addition of departments of gov- 
ernment, National and State, public and private universities, and 
great private foundations as surveying agents. 
The year under review is characterized chiefly by the wider adop- 
tion of the social point of view in judging educational aims, activi- 
ties, and results. It would seem that, inasmuch as the survey is a real 
community instrument, it is yielding richer fruit by showing an almost 
nation-wide sense of community responsibility for what happens to 
every individual child. As expressed by Prof. Charles H. Judd, in 
connection with the Cleveland Survey, “the time has long since 
passed when the community can look with any complacence on the 
failure of a child.” The survey accordingly appears to be the most 
serviceable method democratic communities have discovered by 
which they can secure the information and inspiration needed in 
order to discharge their ever-growing educational responsibilities. 
In addition to the extensive application of the survey, the period 
under review is characterized by further refinement in survey meth- 
ods. This is evident from a comparison of what is included with 
what is excluded in the scope of the surveys made at different times 
during the past five years. This gain becomes more impressive when 
one compares the older method of educational analysis by means of 
personal observation of individual activities with the newer analysis 
by means of carefully gathered and properly treated objective data. 
The advantage of having standardized tests and scales is most ap- 
parent in the survey movement. Several reports during this period 
bring out this feature in a most interesting fashion. In Salt Lake 
_ City the old andthe new method are brought together in the re- 
ports on the work of the school under “the instruction and super- 
vision as seen,” on the one hand, and “ the efficiency of the instruction 
measured,” on the other. The examination of the Buffalo public 
schools is conspicuous because of its uniform reliance upon data 
secured by the method of observation, marked with such extreme care 
as to specify the number of schools, teachers, classes, or recitations 
supplying the material recorded. A similar aspect appears in one 
of the reports of the Cleveland survey, “ Measuring the work of the 
public schools,” which may be regarded as presenting “the central 
studies® of this investigation. As a preliminary to more exact
-P-A-G-E-383
    
EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 355 
studies the 1,553 visits of observation were recorded by means of a 
specially devised card system. Efforts toward scientific accuracy 
were put forth in a scheme of varied tests, by means of which more 
stable judgment and definitive conclusions could be arrived at. A 
critical student of scientific method in education may now find in 
survey reports adequate material for determining the mutual checks 
and limitations of the old and the new method of interpretation of 
school activities. 
STATE SURVEYS. 
Maryland.‘ Public Education in Maryland, A Report to the 
Maryland Educational Survey Commission,” by Abraham Flexner 
and Frank P. Bachman (176 pp.; second and later editions, 230 pp.), 
on behalf of the General Education Board, presented to Gov. P. L. 
Goldsborough, December 20, 1915, makes distinctive contributions to 
the aim, method, and results of State-wide studies of educational 
systems. The work was undertaken in compliance with legislative 
action in 1914, under the directive form of a commission of three 
citizens. The field of the investigation included the elementary and 
the high schools of all the counties, and omitted Baltimore City. 
The original scope contemplated also a study of the higher educa- 
tional institutions receiving State aid. The method of investiga- 
tion, differing from previous State studies, involved chiefly the field 
labor of one surveyor who visited every county during nearly five 
months, selecting schools at random. It is significant that this study 
did not make use of the widely recognized tests and scales which 
have been employed in preceding surveys. The scope of the study 
included the social and economic situation of the State, the State 
board of education and State superintendent, the county school board 
and county superintendent, teachers, enrollment and attendance, 
instruction, and finance. It was found that “public education in 
Maryland is, on the whole, soundly organized” and that “the State 
deals generously with its public schools in the matter of money.” 
It was also found, however, that many defects characterized the 
system. “The large majority of schools are poor; teachers are, for 
the most part, poorly trained; instruction is ineffective and obsolete; 
children attend school with disastrous irregularity; school buildings 
are far too often in unsatisfactory condition, school grounds neg- 
lected and untidy.” Special recommendations, designed to correct 
the system, and in the future eliminate the defects discovered, were 
accordingly made. These involved improvements in the State or- 
ganization, in the county organization, and in financial readjust- 
ments. 
The presentation of the report to the General Assembly of Mary- 
land was accompanied by a group of bills exhaustively revising the 
education system of the State. The bills were enacted into law and
-P-A-G-E-384
356 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
became effective June 1, 1916. Among the main features of the 
resultant legislation it is noteworthy that the general structure of 
the public-school system of the State, involving the State, county, 
and district boards, remains practically as before. The State is not 
called upon to provide for increased appropriations. No officer, 
teacher, or employee was legislated out of office or otherwise affected 
so far as limitation of tenure, decrease of salary, or eligibility for 
reappointment is concerned. The legislation, however, seeks to make 
the State board, by certain readjustments, more effective, gives to 
the State superintendent of schools greater authority and responsi- 
bility, including the full responsibility over all professional matters 
pertaining to the system. Likewise, county boards will be more ef- 
fective and a professional status given to the county superintendent. 
The staffing of the system includes adequate assistance in both State 
and county departments. The financial readjustment includes a con- 
solidation of all State school funds and a distribution of public 
moneys after the deduction of the fixed charges for the maintenance 
of the general system. The apportionment of the funds to the 
counties will be as follows: Two-thirds, according to the total num- 
ber of school children in the county between the ages of 6 and 14 
years, and one-third, according to the aggregate days of school at- 
tendance. State aid to the counties is made conditional upon the 
local levy during a current year of 34 cents for every $100 of assessable 
property. The counties at present below this minimum are required 
to increase school levies at the rate of 2 cents a year until the mini- 
mum of 34 cents is attained. The approval of the county commis- 
sioners must be secured for any levy over 40 cents for school purposes. 
The most gratifying feature of the legislation consequent upon 
the survey is the compulsory school attendance provisions that are 
to go into effect. Earnest efforts had been made in the State since 
1902 to secure reasonable legislation on compulsory school attend- 
ance, but without success. The present requirement provides as 
follows: Children 7 years of age and under 13 are to be in school 
the entire time the schools are in session unless excused by proper 
authority for reasonable and legal reasons; children 13 and 14 years 
of age are to attend at least 100 days during each school year, and 
children 15 and 16 years of age, unless they have completed the ele- 
mentary school course, are to be in school 100 days each school year. 
The legislation in which the Maryland survey culminated is 
striking. By one bound the State has leaped into a truly profes- 
sional status in matters relating to public education. A. legislative 
welcome was extended to the unanimous desire of the school forces, 
and the system is to receive at once the full benefit of the educational 
progress made in other States during a long period of years and 
after numerous efforts.

Wyoming.—On June 15, 1916, Mrs. Katherine M. Cook and Mr. 
A. C. Monahan, the two representatives of the United States Bureau 
of Education, transmitted to the Commissioner of Education the 
report of the survey of the educational system of the State of 
Wyoming. This report resulted from the action of the Wyoming 
General Assembly in 1915, which provided by law for the formula- 
tion of a school code committee of five members, whose duty was to 
submit in 1917 recommendations for a revised code of school laws. 
At the beginning of the work of investigation in July, 1915, it was 
decided to conduct a general survey of educational conditions in 
the State, in order to secure “a general measurement of the system 
as a State system in terms of its service to the State.” ° 
The survey comprised: 
(a) A thorough investigation of grounds, buildings, water supply, 
etc., conducted through personal investigation and collection of in- 
formation through questionnaires; 
(6) A careful inquiry into the education and professional quali- 
fications, living conditions, and salaries of teachers, conducted in the 
same manner; 
(ec) An intensive study of instruction offered in three counties 
selected as typical of general conditions made by personal investiga- 
tion by members of the committee and representatives of the bureau; 
(d) An investigation into qualifications and work of the county 
superintendents ; : 
(e) A study of financial support, State, county, and local; 
(f) General information concerning high-school and city-school 
systems. 
The method of the inquiry included conferences, visits to schools 
and special institutions, and, where possible, questionnaires, designed 
to secure State-wide data. The report is published by the United 
States Bureau of Education, Bulletin, 1916, No. 29, and includes 
the following material: A brief historical sketch of the public- 
school system of Wyoming (by Prof. H. C. Dale); the present 
system as far as organization and administration are concerned— 
State, county, and local; the status of education in the State—build- 
ings, teaching, attendance, instruction, supervision, revenue, and 
support; a comparison of Wyoming with other States in education; 
movements in other States as outlined in recommendations for 
Wyoming; and recommendations. Chapter VI, presenting the move- 
ments in other States, is a national survey itself.

COUNTY SURVEYS. 
Georgia.—The study of rural school conditions in Georgia was 
continued, under the direction of the State department of education, 
by M. L. Duggan, rural school agent, and published in “The Educa- 
tional Survey of Morgan County, Georgia” (77 pp.). The data se- 
cured included teachers, nearest school, grounds, building, equipment, 
organization, and organized help. The total attendance for each 
pupil in the different grades published in the report may become use- 
ful for comparative purposes in future studies. 
Missouri ‘A Study of the Rural Schools of Saline County, Mis- 
souri,” by Prof. J. D. Elliff and A. Jones (32 pp.), was published 
August, 1915, by the University of Missouri as No. 11 of the Educa- 
tion Series Bulletin. The data were secured through the cooperation 
of superintendent and teachers, and were tabulated by the help 
of a number of assistants. The descriptions include heating and 
ventilation, lighting, seating, care of room, drinking water, play 
and playgrounds, building and grounds, equipment, finance, attend- 
ance, community attitude toward the school, use of school building 
during previous year, and instruction, the whole resulting in a 
summary description of “the median school.” The median value of 
the schoolhouse was found to be $400; of the PPTSES barn, $500; of 
the best barn, $1,200. 
Wisconsin Owing to a state of dissatisfaction with the develop- 
ment of the Milwaukee County School of Agriculture and Domestic 
Science, which began operations July 1, 1912, Walter Matscheck, 
director of the Wisconsin Efficiency Bureau, assisted by Miss Sara 
Rivet, presented, in May, 1916, a “ Report of a Survey Made for the 
Milwaukee Taxpayers’ League” (76 pp.). The declining efficiency 
of an elaborately equipped plant brought forward the question as to 
whether or not the school should be abolished. The survey did hot 
undertake to answer this question; its purpose was only “ to give all 
the facts as found from the study of the records, reports, documents, 
and from conferences, consultations, and observations.” The ques- 
tion is left by the survey to be decided by the county authorities and 
the public. 
California.—The utilization of the survey as a means of proposing 
a plan for the complete reorganization of a system of county schools 
is illustrated in “ Reorganizing a County System of Rural Schools: 
Report of a Study of the Schools of San Mateo County, Cal.,” by J. 
Harold Williams. The study was made in 1914, at the suggestion of 
Prof. E. P. Cubberley, and is published by the United States Bureau 
of Education (Bulletin, 1916, No. 16, 50 pp.). Following a general 
survey of the county with reference to its geological, geographical, 
social, and economic features, the study of the present school system
-P-A-G-E-387
  EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 359 
leads to the proposal of a system designed “to meet more adequately 
the needs of the people of this larger community.” A special plea is 
made for the county-unit plan to supersede the district-unit plan in 
force at the time of the investigation. 
Oregon.—During the school year 1915-16 Prof. Fred C. Ayer con- 
ducted, by means of reports and personal visitation, a survey of the 
educational conditions of Lane County, Oreg. A portion of the ma- 
terial collected is presented under such topics as adjustment to geo- 
graphical conditions, instruction and the course of study, material 
equipment, organization, etc., and forms a part of the larger under- 
taking of the Presbyterian country church work on the Pacific coast, 
in cooperation with the University of Oregon, which included a 
study of the economic, social, and religious life of this county. The 
report, “A Rural Survey of Lane County, Oregon,” was published 
August 15, 1916, by the extension division of the University of 
Oregon as Bulletin, New Series, Vol. XIII, No. 14 (109 pp.), pages 
71-109 comprising the educational section. 
CITY SURVEYS. 
Los Angeles, Cal.—A novel plan of securing disinterested educa- 
tional experts to make a brief investigation of the activities of the 
schools under its direction was adopted by the board of education of 
this city when it commissioned Presidents Butler, of Columbia Uni- 
versity, and Judson, of the University of Chicago, on February 14, 
1916, to name three persons, preferably “from Eastern States,” for 
this purpose. Of those named only two, Dr. Albert Shiels and Dr. 
Walter A. Jessup, were able to visit the city, and accordingly consti- 
tuted the advisory committee whose “information, assistance, and 
advice” were sought. The “Report of the Advisory Committee to 
the Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles on Certain As- 
pects of the Organization and Administration of the Public School 
System” (177 pp.) includes the results of the study which was begun 
April 17 and concluded May 22, 1916, and was presented as “in no 
sense a complete survey.” 
The investigation of the problems of administration, compulsory 
attendance, the elementary, intermediate, and high schools and junior 
colleges, the evening schools, the proficiency of pupils, and the ex- 
perience, training, and certification of the members of the staff cul- 
minate in the leading recommendation that there be established a 
division of educational research to which should be referred for 
ample and continuous study all the features of the system. The 
item of cost also appears as a recurrent determinjng factor in the
-P-A-G-E-388
  360 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
analysis of several aspects of the system, and recommendations look- 
ing toward betterment without cost increase are made. 
Denver, Colo—A report of the school survey of School District 
No. 1 in the city and county of Denver was published in the latter 
part of 1916. The report comprises five parts and a supplemental 
report, as follows: 
I. General Organization and Management. By Franklin Bobbitt. 
II. The Work of the Schools. By Franklin Bobbitt and C. H. Judd. 
III. Vocational Education. By C. A. Prosser and W. H. Henderson. 
IV. The Business Management. By J. T. Byrne. 
V. The Building Situation and Medical Inspection. By Lewis M. Terman. 
Supplemental report on Organization and Administration. By E. P. Cubberly. 
Part I points out the peculiar situation by which “a form of school 
government devised in the main for rural and village districts has 
been rather unconsciously inherited by the large metropolitan city of 
Denver.” 
In Part II of the report Dr. Bobbitt discusses reading, literature, 
and memory work; vocabulary; spelling; pronunciation; language, 
grammar, and composition; penmanship; German in the grades; 
history; civics; geography; arithmetic; nature study or elementary 
science; hygiene; physical education; music; and “Finding the 
time.” Dr. Judd analyzes the internal organization of the high 
school, the relation between the elementary and high school, and 
possible reorganization of the upper elementary grades to adapt the 
work better to the secondary schools. 
In Part III the census occupation statistics are studied; child 
labor and compulsory school attendance are reviewed; and it is 
recommended that the shopwork of the seventh and eighth grades 
have for its dominant aim the giving of prevocational training. The 
importance of salesmanship as a part of commercial education is 
pointed out. Household arts subjects are considered so important 
for girls that a department of home economics is recommended, to 
include both elementary and high schools, and the surveyors urge 
that Denver at once enter, as other cities are entering, upon the 
development of a complete program for vocational education. 
The report on business management points out that— 
of several experts consulted or brought to Denver in connection with the present 
school survey, each in his individual capacity arrived at practically the same con- 
clusion with respect to the fundamental weaknesses in the public school system of 
Denver as administered up to the present year. * * * The evidence points 
clearly to a lack of centralized directing power guiding all business matters and 
procedure in accordance with a clearly defined business policy and program of 
action. There is duplication of functions and of duties and responsibilities. 
In Part V, Dr. Terman finds that Denver has relatively few school 
buildings erected later than -15 years ago, and that the average “age”
-P-A-G-E-389
  
EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. : 361 
of its classrooms is a little more than 22 years. Few of the school-’ 
rooms are well lighted, he says; many of the heating systems are 
primitive; the ventilation is unsatisfactory in at least half of the 
buildings; dusty and parched air is carried to the classrooms; the 
toilets are usually dark, often cold, and sometimes foul smelling. 
Some of the school buildings, according to Dr. Terman, are sur- 
rounded by playgrounds hardly wider than an alley, and 80 per cent 
of the school children have less than a reasonable amount of play 
room for a city of Denver’s type. 
In the supplemental report on “Organization and Administration,” 
Prof. Ellwood P. Cubberly renders a professional opinion as to 
whether the new by-laws adopted by the board of directors of Den- 
ver on January 12, 1916, conform to good administrative principles 
in the matter of city school control, and whether they will secure an 
-improvement over the form of organization previously in force. 
His answer is an emphatic affirmative. 
Leavenworth, Kans.—The survey made of the public schools of 
Leavenworth, Kans., during the early part of 1914 is one of the most 
interesting cooperative enterprises that has appeared during the 
whole survey movement. The undertaking was initiated by the su- 
perintendent and teachers and financed largely by contributions from 
the latter. The board of education provided for the expense of 
publication. The investigation was conducted under the auspices of 
the bureau of educational measurements and standards of the Kansas 
State Normal School, and directed by Prof. Walter S. Monroe, who 
was assisted by Flora J. Cooke, Ella V. Dobbs, Minnie E. Porter, 
and Walter R. Smith. Dr. W. C. Bagley, Dr. J. F. Bobbitt, and Dr. 
W. W. Charters served in the capacity of an advisory committee. 
The report (202 pp.) was published in November, 1915. 
The report is the result of an elaborate inquiry into all the features 
of the city and its traditions, the general scheme of the school system, 
and its activities. Ample attention is given to every detail. The re- 
sults of the teaching in the schools were estimated by the methods 
of observation, and, in a number of instances, by the standard tests. 
The observation process was guided by a consistent effort to judge the 
effects of teaching upon the pupils in terms of motivation, evaluation, 
organization, initiative, and acquisition. The inevitable questions as 
to the value of a survey and of the results that are accomplished find 
an interesting answer in this report which includes a statement by 
Supt. Moore 15 months after the first draft of the report had been 
made accessible to the local authorities, teachers, and community. 
Zowa.—tThe conditions obtaining in the schools of 181 cities and 
towns in Iowa from April 1, 1914, to January 1, 1915, are found in 
the report on the “ Hygienic Conditions in Iowa Schools,” by Irving 
King, published by the University of Iowa as Extension Bulletin
-P-A-G-E-390
    362 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
“No. 11, May 29,1915. The data were secured by means of a question- 
naire containing approximately 176 questions which were designed 
to be “filled out while the school wa’ in session and the children 
actually in their seats.” To exhibit the main facts discovered, 32 
diagrams are devised, such as: 21 per cent of the school grounds 
are less than 1 acre in size; 15 per cent are reported as unsuitable for 
play; 86 per cent of the stairways are wooden; 40 per cent of the 
schools depend on wells for drinking water; 40 per cent report the 
use of paper towels; 70 per cent hang thermometers too high; 11 per 
cent of the schools report adjustable seats; 34 per cent of the schools 
report testing the eyes of children; and 3.5 per cent report dental 
inspection, etc. 
Salt Lake City, Vitah—On June 380, 1915, the “Report of the Sur- 
vey of the Public School System of Salt Lake City, Utah” (324 pp.), 
which was made during the month of May, was submitted to the 
board of education. Dr. Ellwood P. Cubberley, director of the sur- 
vey, was assisted by James H. Van Sickle, Lewis M. Terman, Jesse B. 
Sears, and J. Harold Williams. The work was accomplished during 
18 days. The chief object of the inquiry was to study the leading 
problems in relation to buildings, teachers, and finance, and to sug- 
gest the new legislation which was deemed essential to make the 
progress to which the school system was entitled. The report closes, 
accordingly, with a suggested law for the management of the Salt 
Lake City school district. The report is admirably arranged under 
the general headings of organization and administration, the work of 
the schools, buildings and health, and finances. An extended array 
of over a hundred figures and tables illuminate the data and dis- 
cussions. As already mentioned, the survey is characterized by an 
interesting alinement of what might be designated as the old and the 
new methods of estimating the work of the schools. An application 
of the recently devised standards was made in the subjects of writing, 
spelling, composition, arithmetic, and reading in the elementary 
schools. The outcome was to secure results that are comparable with 
similar studies made in other cities. By this means the survey has 
made contributions to educational progress outside the system under 
investigation. : 
Buffalo, N. Y.—A new agency in the conduct of educational sur- 
veys appeared when the University of the State of New York and the 
State department of education undertook, on June 5, 1914, in re- 
sponse to the request of Supt. Emerson, to make an examination of 
the school system of this city. In undertaking this work, Dr. John 
H. Finley, president of the university and commissioner of educa- 
tion, announced it as his intention “to make a careful inquiry into 
the management of the schools of various cities, from time to time, 
in order that we shall have accurate knowledge of their excellence,
-P-A-G-E-391
EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 363 
their defects, or needs.” The work was conducted under the direc- 
tion of Dr. Thomas E. Finegan and involved the time of about 14 
weeks for each of 10 men of the staff of the inspection division and 
other members of the department staff, between September, 1914, 
and February 1, 1915. The inspection of the school plant received 
about one-third of the time, the remainder being given to the 
observation of the work of instruction and to an inquiry into the 
general management of the school system. In estimating the quality 
of the activities within the classrooms, the method of visitation was 
carefully safeguarded by having the observers work in groups of 
three. The fact basis for the general conclusions was made in a 
total of 3,011 classroom visits. The leading lines emphasized in the 
examination included organization and administration, the school 
plant, the teaching staff, teaching in the elementary schools, teaching 
in the high schools, industrial education, mandatory statutes, and 
medical inspection. 
In view of the historical development of public education peculiar 
to Buffalo, the study lays chief stress upon the legislation which is 
inherently involved in the situation. It was found “that the weak- 
nesses of your school system are fundamentally those inherent in its 
organization.” It is concluded that— 
no enduring progress can be expected until the whole system is so organized 
as to confide the direction and control of the schools in a board of education, © 
independent of political association, which shall have full power to administer 
the schools and full responsibility for the results. 
The report further declares: 
The ineffectiveness of the supervision of the schools, the inefficiency in the 
teaching force, the utter lack of respect for superior authority which permeates 
the whole system, the waste of pupils’ time and of taxpayers’ funds, the 
absence of good business methods and procedure, and the failure to obtain 
from the public-school system the greatest service which that system is capable 
of rendering the city, all of which will be clearly shown in the succeeding 
chapters of this report, are directly traceable to the type of organization under 
which the school system of Buffalo has been controlled, operated, and managed 
for a half century. The continuance of the same general plan of school 
organization does not give to the city of Buffalo encouragement to believe that 
the city will have under such plan a more stable, independent, efficient, and 
effective administration of her public-school system. 
Ashland, Oreg.—In July, 1915, the University of Oregon pub- 
lished, as Bulletin No. 11, volume 12, the report of a “ Constructive 
Survey of the Public School System of Ashland, Oreg.” (52 pp.), 
which was made by Prof. Fred C. Ayer, Supt. Charles R. Frazier, 
and Prof. Don C. Sowers a few months earlier. Because of the 
town’s size, it was possible to give exhaustive attention to all the fea- 
tures of school and community interests. While giving, in general, 
approval of the public schools which this community had developed,
-P-A-G-E-392
364 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
the survey had as its chief aim that of specifying in its recom- 
mendations the “proper points of departure for constructive im- 
provements.” 
Port Townsend, Wash.—In August, 1915, the University of Wash- 
ington published, as University Extension Series No. 17, a report of 
“A Survey of the Port Townsend Public Schools” (112 pp.), which 
was conducted under the direction of Prof. Herbert G. Lull, who had 
been assisted by Joseph K. Hart, Henry M. Grant, and Paul J. 
Kruse. The unfortunate economic history of this “boom” town in 
the far Northwest lends special interest to the study which, as in 
Ashland, undertook to solve the problem of “what is practical and 
realizable for Port Townsend in the next 10 years.” A review of 
the administration and of the course of study and instruction and 
the working out of the educational program for the future are espe- 
cially characterized by the attempt to show clearly the intimate con- 
ditions between public education on the one hand and the industrial, 
economic, political, and social world on the other. More than one- 
fourth of the report is devoted to the results of tests which were given 
in spelling, writing, arithmetic, reading, English, and composition. 
Cleveland, Ohio—It is 10 years since the inquiry into the govern- 
ment, supervision, and course of study of its public schools was made 
by the educational commission appointed by the Cleveland Board of 
* Education. Prior to that time, and since, this city evidenced a great 
deal of educational unrest. This has been indicated by the frequent 
changes of administration as well as by an increasing amount of pub- 
lic criticism. During 1915 the school system underwent an extensive 
and painstaking examination as a part of the Cleveland Foundation 
Survey and under the immediate supervision of the survey committee 
of the Cleveland Foundation. The education survey was directed by 
Dr. Leonard P. Ayres and a large staff of specialists and assistants. 
The survey staff completely coordinated its different lines of work, 
while at the same time allowing departmental initiative and respon- 
sibility for each specialist assigned to a particular task. 
The report of the Cleveland survey is unique in its mode of pub- 
lication. The reports on the special topics are being printed in a 
series of small bound monographs, of which 22 had been issued on 
June 30, 1916. The series will be completed with the addition of 
one special report and two summary volumes. 
The progressive conclusion of this survey was treated in a unique 
manner. As a substitute for the usual practice of issuing the re- 
port in completed form, the material in the different divisions of 
  
1These reports can be secured from the survey committee of the Cleveland Founda- 
tion, Cleveland, Ohio, and from the division of education of the Russell Sage Foundation, 
in New York City, at a uniform price of 25 cents each, and of 50 cents for each of the 
three double volumes in the series.
-P-A-G-E-393
  
EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 365 
the investigation was made public and discussed at the time of its 
completion. This interesting procedure has been thus described by 
the director of the survey: 2 
These small volumes appeared at such intervals that they were made public 
and discussed at a series of weekly luncheon meetings, open to the public, and 
held in one of the city’s leading hotels. At these meetings the report was 
discussed by the author of the volume or the director of the survey. In addi- 
tion, other similar lunch meetings were held while the preparatory work of 
the survey was in progress. The result was that for more than a year weekly 
meetings were held at which the educational problems of the city were dis- 
cussed, and during this entire period the capacity of a large hall was no more 
than sufficient to accommodate the audiences that attended. The newspaper 
reports of these conferences were unusually extensive and detailed. 
The leading feature of the inquiry as a whole is the division of 
its work into two main lines: One relating to the regular work of 
the public schools; the other to industrial education. The subjects 
covered and the authors of the volumes constituting the first group 
are, in the order of their publication, as follows: 
Health work in the public schools—Leonard P. Ayres. 
Child accounting in the public schools—Leonard P. Ayres. 
What the schools teach and might teach—Franklin Bobbitt. 
Financing the public schools—Zarle Clark. 
Education through recreation—George H. Johnson. 
Educational extension—Olarence A. Perry. 
School buildings and equipment—Leonard P. Ayres. 
Overcrowded schools and the platoon plan—Shattuck O. Hartwell. 
Measuring the work of the public schools—Charles H. Judd. 
School and classes for exceptional children—David Mitchell. 
The teaching staff—Walter A. Jessup. 
The school and the immigrant—Herbert A. Miller. 
The public library and the public school—Leonard P. Ayres and Adele Mec- 
Kinnie. 
School organization and administration—Leonard P. Ayres.   
  
The subjects covered and the authors of the volumes relating to 
the field of industrial education are, in the order of their publica- 
tion, as follows: 
Department-store occupations—Iris P, O’Leary. 
Boys and girls in commercial work—Bertha M. Stevens. 
Railroad and street transportation—Ralph D. Fleming. 
The building trades—Frak L. Shaw. 
The printing trades—Frank L. Shaw. 
The metal trades—R. R. Lutz. 
The garment trades—EHdna Bryner. 
Dressmaking and millinery—Edna Bryner. 
The method of investigation and the form of presentation of 
the report are exemplary in the contribution which they make to 
the solution of these special problems of school systems. The 
typical procedure is to give, first, an adequate and appreciative  
-P-A-G-E-394
  366 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
historical account of the genesis of the particular situation being 
studied; second, a complete presentation of the primary data ac- 
quired and a patient analysis of the educational factors involved; 
and, finally, an interpretation of the situation by means of recom- 
mendations for such readjustments as seem to promise relief from 
the general situation. Summaries of the different chapters in each 
report afford an easy means of keeping up with the progress of 
the particular investigation. Tables, diagrams, and photographs 
are used in abundance. By these various means the report of the 
investigation forms an interesting illustration of how to keep the 
material in good scientific form and at the same time clarified for 
easy understanding by the public. 
The director of the education survey finds the origin of the city’s 
unending educational troubles to be in the methods of board con- 
trol. In the volume on “ School Organization and Administration,” 
he writes: 
In this city there is a tradition that many years ago there happened to be 
an able and aggressive board of education at a time when the city superin- 
tendent was elderly and unaggressive. It is said that during this period the 
poard took over little by little many of the details of the superintendent’s work, 
reached decisions for him, and generally relieved him of the more burdensome 
duties of his office. It is said that this inaugurated an unwritten rule through-~ 
out the school system that decisions on all matters should be put off whenever 
possible until they could be referred to the board. 
Boards of education exist for the purpose of getting public schools managed, 
not for the purpose of managing the schools themselves. Their work is to get 
things done rather than to do them. When they overlook this fundamental 
principle, confusion results, responsibility becomes scattered, details displace 
fundamentals. After a year of study and the preparation of 25 volumes of 
reports the survey staff has reached the conclusion that this is what has hap- 
pened in Cleveland. 
Grand Junction, Colo—* A demand on the part of the people for 
a reduction in the public expenses and the desire on the part of 
the board of directors to meet this request without crippling the 
schools” led the board of directors of Grand Junction, Colo., on 
March 4, 1916, to authorize an educational survey. The chamber 
of commerce of the city cooperated to the extent of defraying the 
expenses above $150. (The total cost, including printing the report, 
was $167.54.) The survey committee comprised three lay members— 
“and any member of the school board may be a member ex officio 
of this committee”—and three professional members: Frank L. 
Clapp, director, and William A. Cook, of the University of Colorado, 
and Samuel Quigley, of the Colorado State Normal School. The 
time spent on the ground by each of the professional members totaled 
10 days. The report (64 pp.) was made in May, 1916, and includes 
the results of the study made of organization and control, instruction,
-P-A-G-E-395
    
EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS. 867 
and financial support. The Ayres spelling test, Starch’s silent- . 
reading test, Curtis’s arithmetic test, and Ayres’ penmanship test 
were given, Twenty Colorado towns were selected for purposes 
of comparison. 
Survey outlines—In response to requests for suggestions as to 
“how to have a school survey without expense,” made by “ superin- 
tendents of schools in the smaller cities where funds for the employ- 
ment of a survey commission are. not available,” the United States 
Bureau of Education issued in January, 1916, City School Circular, 
1915-16, No. 2, entitled “Some Suggestive Points for Superintend- 
ents in the Smaller Cities Who are Surveying Their Own Schools” 
(4 pp.). The topics included and outlined by suggestive procedure 
are: Efficiency of schools, administration and supervision, teachers, 
buildings, and hygiene and sanitation. A brief outline of sugges- 
tions for a community survey, including the social and vocational 
phases as related to the schools, is added. These suggestions have 
been adopted by a number of superintendents of smaller cities as a 
guide for auto-surveys. 
SPECIAL INSTITUTIONS. 
The “Report of a Survey of the University of Oregon made by 
the United States Bureau of Education, September, 1915,” (pub- 
lished as University of Oregon Bulletin, vol. 13, No. 4, December, 
1915, pp. 28), is one of the earliest results of the announcement by 
the Commissioner of Education that “the services of the Bureau of 
Education were freely placed at the disposal of any educational in- 
stitution in the United States which might desire a survey of its work 
and organization.” In the course of 22 days, Dr. S. P. Capen, 
specialist in higher education, made a study of the following phases 
of the work of the institution: The relation of the university to the 
State, the organization and administration, including the board of 
regents, administrative officers and heads of departments, the faculty, 
its training and composition, methods of appointment, provisions for 
research and results in service to the State, the curricula of the vari- 
ous schools and departments, the students and requirements for ad- 
mission and graduation, the financial status in comparison with that 
of other State institutions, and equipment. 
In a limited number of recommendations the surveyor emphasizes 
the importance of consistent effort on the part of the university to 
interpret itself to the people of the State. The board of regents 
should meet more frequently and should follow a more consistent 
policy of educational control. The increasing recognition of the fac- 
ulty as the governing educational body of an institution of higher 
learning is emphasized in the need of cooperation between the board
-P-A-G-E-396
368 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
of regents and representatives of the faculty in shaping educational 
policies and in the suggested creation of an academic council to act 
in the capacity of adviser to the president. Emphasis is placed upon 
the need of making more liberal provision for research. 
Towa.— “State Higher Educational Institutions of Iowa” is the 
title of the report of an epochal survey conducted under the direc- 
tion of the United States Commissioner of Education and published 
by the Bureau of Education, Bulletin, 1916, No. 19 (206 pp.) The 
study of the situation among these institutions was designed— 
To restore and preserve peace between the State higher schools, to facilitate 
a harmonious evolution of the State’s higher educational system and each of 
its parts—these are the ends which the State itself seeks. These are the ends 
which the commission has held constantly in view.- 
The problem approached in this inquiry, largely because of the 
same situation in 19 other States, is regarded as the most important 
problem in educational administration in the United States at the 
present time. It involves all the issues that have developed between” 
the State universities and the land-grant colleges, not to mention the 
other State-supported educational institutions. 
This inquiry was authorized by the Iowa State Board of Education 
May 15, 1915, the report being requested by March 1, 1916. The 
commission included Dr. Samuel P. Capen, chairman; Dr. James R. 
Angell, Dr. Kendric C. Babcock, Dr. Liberty H. Bailey, Dr. Hollis 
Godfrey, Dr. Raymond M. Hughes, and Mrs. Henrietta W. Calvin. 
Upon organizing, it “decided to consider the whole field of higher 
education in Iowa,” in order best to supply information upon the 
seven matters specified by the State board of education: 
1. The duplication in courses in education and psychology at Ames and Iowa 
City. 
2 The extent of liberal arts courses offered at Ames. 
8. Should there be a school of journalism at this place? 
4, The status of graduate work at the State university, State college, and 
State Teachers’ College, and preventing duplication. 
5. The feasibility of consolidating the extension work-of these three institu- 
tions. 
6. The adequacy of the buildings. 
7. The best avenues of expansion of the State university and the State 
college. 
The surveyors collected extensive data from the institutions, opin- 
ions from prominent citizens, and additional material by visits to the 
institutions and through various conferences. The report comprises 
16 chapters, and concludes with a grouping of the 52 recommenda- 
tions. 
The most important contribution of this study is to be found in 
the principle of major and service lines, which it offers as a means 
of marking out the desired adjustment of these types of institutions.
-P-A-G-E-397

Each State institution should have assigned to it certain major fields, which 
it may be expected to develop to their fullest extent. * * * Service lines 
are such subordinate subjects as are essential to the proper cultivation of a 
qeagor dite. 782s. * 
Once this principle of major and service lines is adopted, the whole situation 
clears up, not only as regards intramural work, but also as regards extension 
work. An institution would be permitted to do extension work only in a 
major line.* 
Washington —On March 9, 1915, the Legislature of Washington 
provided by law for a commission to make an educational survey 
of the State. This body of six members was designated the Com- 
mission of Educational Survey of Washington. The cooperation 
of the United States Commissioner of Education was secured, and 
the survey was made under his direction by Dr. Samuel P. Capen, 
Mr. Harold W. Foght, and Dr. Alexander Inglis. The meetings 
and labors of the commission extended from July 5, 1915, to April 
15, 1916. The work of the three specialists extended from March 4 
to April 14, 1916. The report of the commission was made April 
27, 1916. The full report of the commission and of the survey is 
published by the United States Bureau of Education as Bulletin, 
1916, No..26. 
The scope of the inquiry was extended beyond the five State in- 
stitutions, namely, the University of Washington, the State College 
of Washington, and the normal schools at Cheney, Ellensburg, and 
Bellingham, so as to include— 
such a study of the elementary and secondary schools of the State and of 
the preparation of teachers in these schools as was necessary to an intelligent 
consideration of the functions and standards of the higher schools. 
The occasion of the considerations leading to this inquiry is well 
described in this statement: 
There is at present no machinery for the formulation of State policies in 
higher education. The result of this lack is painfully apparent, and has in 
fact given rise in a large measure to the difficulties which the present survey 
is designed to remedy. 
The topics treated in the report include: General consideration 
of higher education in Washington, with incidental treatment of 
secondary education; the support of higher education in Waslrington 
and in other States; State officials and administrative machinery; 
the formulation of State policies in higher education; costs of State 
university and State college; present scope and functions of these 
institutions; warranted and unwarranted duplications, with an 
‘application of “the principle of major and service lines” developed 
in the Iowa survey; differentiation of functions, the departments of 
education, etc. Twenty-one recommendations are made relating to   
1¥For a more detailed account of the Iowa Survey, see ch. 8, p. 124,

  870 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
the university and the college. Six chapters form a special section, 
which presents general aspects of the public-school system and offers 
11 recommendations. The State normal schools have four chapters, 
and 12 recommendations relating thereto are made. 
MISCELLANEOUS. 
In view of the intimate relationship between the standards and 
tests and school surveys during the recent years, note should be 
taken of every effort designed to improve the scientific character of 
educational judgments. Every student of these newer tendencies 
will need to refer to two recent publications. The Fourteenth Year- 
book, Part II, of the National Society for the Study of Education 
(pp. 88, June, 1915, University of Chicago Press), by Arthur C. 
Boyce, is a monograph on “ Methods for Measuring Teachers’ Effi- 
ciency.” The author describes the present methods of measuring 
teaching efficiency, summarize sseveral studies on qualities of merit 
and their values, develops a method for guiding and controlling the 
rating of teachers, shows the results arising from its application by 
actual tests, and concludes with a technical discussion of the relative 
importance of qualities of merit. Sample score cards for rating 
teachers are appended. 
More important still is the Fifteenth Yearbook, Part I (172 pp.), 
of the National Society for the Study of Education, which appeared 
from the same press in February, 1916. This yearbook is devoted 
to “Standards and Tests for the Measurement of the Efficiency of 
Schools and School Systems,” and is the 1916 report of the committee 
of the National Council of Education of the National Education 
Association on standards and tests of efficiency. The 15 chapters 
include the following contributions and discussions: 
A Measuring Scale for Physical Growth and Physiological Age, by Bird T. 
Baldwin; Notes on the Derivation of Scales in School Subjects, with Special 
Application to Arithmetic, by B. R. Buckingham; Score Card for City School 
Buildings, by George D. Strayer; Completion Tests for Public-School Use, by

The pursuit of more exact procedure in dealing with educational 
problems is increasingly showing a double value. Because of their 
accuracy, the results thus acquired are more satisfactory than those 
with which we are traditionally familiar through the method of 
observation. A more exact procedure also tends to open the way for 
the discovery of new and unexpected problems in teaching and 
learning and in organization and administration. The chairman of 
the committee, Prof. George D. Strayer, well expresses these values 
in his introduction to this monograph: 
The measurement of results of any sort, whether of the achievements in 
school subjects, of the cost of any unit or function, or of the rate. of progress, 
and the like, furnishes primarily a knowledge of the situation which makes 
clear the problems involved and which may suggest a method of experiment 
that looks toward the improvement desired. 
Madison, Wis.—Because of its treatment of certain educational 
situations, attention may be called to the play and recreation survey 
conducted by the executive committee, under the chairmanship of 
Prof. Clark W. Hetherington, of the representative committee ap- 
pointed by the Board of Commerce of Madison, Wis. The report 
(103 pages) was made June, 1915, and published the following 
October. This board was especially interested in securing “an in- 
ventory of the positive and negative factors of recreation” in its 
own city. Chapter IV presents the recreational facilities of the 
public schools. Chapter VIII discusses home work and play of 
children. Chapter IX is principally a contribution by Dr. William 
Healy on social and educational conditions of play.

CHAPTER XXII. 
EXTENSION EDUCATION. 
By J. L. McBrien, 
School Batension Agent, Bureau of Education. 
Extension education is such a broad term, its field so large, and 
its agencies so numerous that it is difficult to limit its meaning and 
scope to one chapter. It has been called, at different times, by differ- 
ent people, “the lecture system,” “ university extension,” “home edu- 
cation,” “educational extension,” “popular education,” “school ex- 
tension,” and “extension education.” 
As to the meaning and scope of the work and what it is that is 
being extended, it may be a wider use of the public school plant; the 
beautifying of school buildings and grounds; the improvement of 
teachers in service; the establishment of school, home, and county 
libraries; the direction of boys’ and girls’ industrial clubs in home- 
project work, including school credit therefor; the organization of 
parent-teacher associations, so as to secure a better cooperation of 
the home and the school in the education of the child. It may be a 
campaign for a longer school term, better qualified teachers, better 
supervision, and a larger unit of taxation and administration; a 
crusade against illiteracy, such as is now being waged in Alabama, 
North Carolina, and Oklahoma; a fight to amend the State constitu- 
tion so as to provide for local taxation for education, as now going 
on in Alabama, or to permit a higher rate of school tax, as in the 
case of Arkansas and Texas; or a revival of public sentiment in be- 
half of popular education, asin Delaware. It may mean county school 
fairs, as in Maryland and Tennessee; elementary school promotion 
exercises, as in Nebraska and North Carolina; correspondence 
courses of study and lecture centers, as now directed by many uni- 
versities, colleges, normal schools, and by special correspondence 
schools; the commencements held and the lecture courses maintained 
by high schools, colleges, universities, normal schools, Young Men’s 
and Young Women’s Christian Associations, churches, Chautauquas, 
and other organizations throughout the country; or a nation-wide 
campaign for better rural schools, like that now being carried on 
by the Department of the Interior through the Bureau of Education.

  374 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
The limited scope of this chapter will allow only brief mention of 
some of the more significant recent developments in extension edu- 
cation. 
CORRESPONDENCE STUDY. 
Correspondence study, once looked down upon in many educational 
centers, has gradually won its way to recognition in some of the 
strongest American institutions of learning. 
The number of active students pursuing correspondence study for 
the school year 1915-16 at the University of Wisconsin was 10,000; 
the teaching staff in the correspondence division of the university, 
comprising the instructors who write the tests and examine corre- 
spondence-study papers or conduct classes, is about 25 on full time, 
15 on part time, and 20 on a fee basis, besides 12 on full time and 16 
on part time at the district centers. 
According to the report of the University of Chicago, published 
March, 1916, for the year ending June 30, 1915, the total number of 
registrations in the correspondence division was nearly 5,000. The 
total number of different instructors was 126. 
According to the report of the extension division of the University 
of California the number of university extension classes rose from 66 
in 1914 to 149 in 1915, the enrollment of students in the bureau of 
correspondence instruction from 1,506 to 3,399, and the number of 
lecture centers from 21 to 42. : 
LECTURES. 
In addition to the more strictly educational lectures offered by 
members of the extension division at extension centers, the University 
of Minnesota has entered the field of lyceum courses of popular 
lectures, entertainments, concerts, and dramatics. The general exten- 
sion division of this institution obtains the services of the best lec- 
turers as well as of the lyceum companies, presenting entertainments, 
readings, and concerts at a much lower rate than is possible for the 
average community. The university recognizes that the drama in 
most of the small towns, as well as in many of the smaller cities, is in 
a decadent state, and it is seeking to displace harmful agencies by 
providing something wholesome, uplifting, inspiring, and entertain- 
ing in their stead. 
City boards of education—One of the best examples of successful 
extension education is found in the course of free lectures under 
the direction of the Board of Education of the city of New York. 
According to the Twenty-fifth annual report of the supervisor of 
lectures there were 174 lecture centers, 676 lecturers, speaking on 
1,695 topics, before 5,405 audiences. The total aggregate audience 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
  
EXTENSION EDUCATION. 875 
was 1,154,066, an average of 214 per lecture. The attendance was 
an increase of 15,364 over the preceding year. For 25 years these 
free lectures have cost the city of New York over $150,000 annually. 
UNIVERSITY WEEKS. 
For two or three consecutive years past the University of Minne- 
sota has endeavored to carry the university atmosphere to the people 
of the State through somewhat unique forms of visitation called 
university weeks, reaching about 25 towns on each year’s circuit. 
The university week is a six-day program conducted in each of the 
towns visited throughout the State. During these six days the effort 
is made to present in epitome as many as possible of the widespread 
activities of the university. Members of the faculty lecture on a 
great variety of subjects, the glee club gives concerts, the debating 
societies hold debates, the dramatic club gives performances of one 
or two plays, various musical organizations give concerts; there are 
talks to business men at noonday lunches and talks to women’s clubs 
in the afternoon. The ultimate purpose is to stimulate the construc- 
tive force for each community and to produce permanent, wholesome 
effects. It is a singularly successful way of making the people of 
Minnesota well acquainted with their university. It follows that they 
better appreciate the university, realizing that it is their institution— 
that it is of them, by them, and for them, and not the property of the 
board of regents or the faculty members. 
OTHER AGENCIES IN EXTENSION EDUCATION. 
Few people realize the extent to which the United States Govern- 
ment, through its free publications and the sales at cost of its publi- 
cations, through Congress, and through the Congressicnal Library, 
is engaged in extension education throughout the country. 
Public documents——During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1915, 
84,714,186, copies of Government publications were mailed free by 
the Government Printing Office on mailing lists and miscellaneous 
orders of the various departments of the Government. In addition, 
there were also sold, at cost, by this office 3,252,919 Government 
publications, making a total of 37,967,105 copies of Government 
publications thus distributed. These publications not only report the 
legislative, executive, financial, postal, military, and naval functions 
“common to all governments, but also present the results, in popular 
printed form, for the instruction and practical use of all the people, 
of scientific investigation conducted by the Government. These 
. various bulletins, reports, and publications now number over 200,000 
separate publications.

THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS. 
The Library of Congress is one of many seldom-recognized agencies 
in extension education. It contains two copies of every book, maga- 
zine, encyclopedia, and reference work printed in the United States 
under the Federal law relating to copyright. It contains about 
2,500,000 books, 150,000 maps and charts, 750,000 volumes and pieces 
of music, and 400,000 prints (pieces). The number of persons who 
enter the library as visitors or users is now about 750,000 a year, the 
daily average being about 2,000. 
THE PRESS. 
The total number of newspapers published in the world at pres- 
ent is estimated by statisticians at about 60,000. More than a third 
of these are in the United States. The American Newspaper Annual 
and Directory for 1916 gives the following figures: Daily, 2,494; 
triweekly, 73; semiweekly, 605; weekly, 16,091; fortnightly, 58; semi- 
monthly, 283; monthly, 3,064; bimonthly, 92; quarterly, 251; miscel- 
laneous, 29; total, 23,024. It is only necessary to state these figures 
to indicate the significance of the press as a factor in education beyond 
school walls.
-P-A-G-E-405
EXTENSION EDUCATION. 377 
A proper use of the local press is a great help in local school mat- 
ters. Some high schools conduct an educational column in the local 
papers, the material for which is prepared by members of the senior 
class, under the direction of the teacher of English. Some colleges, 
universities, and normal schools give a course in reporting for the 
home papers in the territory of their respective schools on matters 
of interest to the patrons of the institution, as well as to the institu- 
tion itself. Some of these institutions also instruct their students who 
are preparing to teach how to use the local press to advance the work 
of their own schools locally and also give suggestions in the art of 
reporting for the State papers in order to promote the cause of edu- 
cation in the State at large. Many papers issue educational num- 
bers once or twice each year which do much in promoting the cause 
of popular education throughout the country. 
THE GENERAL FEDERATION OF WOMEN’S CLUBS. 
The General Federation of Women’s Clubs, with its 9,000 clubs, its 
50 or more federations, and nearly 3,000,000 members, working 
through 12 to 15 departments, stands for better homes, better schools, 
better things for men, women, and children, and a broader vision of 
life. Among its departments are art, music, literature, civics, library 
extension, conservation of public health, social and industrial condi- 
tions, social hygiene, child hygiene, legislation, home economics, and 
education. 
The department of education is one of the largest and most thor- 
oughly organized divisions of the federation. It has four general 
committees: Peace, political science, vocational training and guid- 
ance, and rural schools. In the Southern States the most notable 
work is that of the school improvement associations. The club 
women of Texas gave their support to the bill passed by the last 
legislature of that State appropriating $1,000,000 as a special fund 
to be expended in the improvement of the rural schools. 
One of the most praiseworthy activities of the club women is the 
rural-welfare service. Many local club women in the towns are in- 
viting the farm women to come to a “ get-acquainted meeting,” at 
which informal discussion of school and other problems is subordi- 
nated to visiting and general social enjoyment; then other meetings 
are held to which each farm woman brings as many of her neighbor 
women as she can; presently the rural women organize among them- 
selves, as in Nebraska, North Carolina, and other States. Mrs. 
Claude D. Sullivan, director of the extension division of the Ten- 
nessee Federation of Women’s Clubs, has had signal success in this 
work in that State. The education committee of the Maryland State 
Federation of Women’s Clubs rendered the cause of education in-
-P-A-G-E-406
  378 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
estimable service in that State through the school improvement asso- 
ciation during the year 1916. aii 
At the New York meeting of the Federation resolutions were passed 
favoring a more rigid censorship of moving pictures, the teaching of 
domestic science in public schools, the Federal child-labor bill (now 
a law), and the Smith-Hughes vocational bill. 
THE CHAUTAUQUA. 
The Chautauqua has been described as the most American thing 
in America. Eminent foreigners who have written or spoken about 
America in recent years have recognized the Chautauqua as a potent 
factor in American life. During the Chautauqua season of 1916 
over 3,000 assemblies were held and probably 5,000,000 people were 
reached through these agencies. Among the typical assemblies for 
their respective sections of the country are: 
1. The parent Chautauqua: The parent Chautauqua, located at Chautauqua, 
N. Y., had, in the session of July 10 to August 18, 1916, 13 departments, with 
125 instructors and 2,500 students enrolled. Chautauqua is the children’s 
paradise. For over 40 years it has been America’s greatest public forum. It 
is estimated that over 50,000 persons have completed its four-year reading 
circle course since its organization. 
2. The Winona Lake Chautauqua: The assembly held at Winona Lake, Ind., 
is the largest and best-known institution of the Chautauqua movement ex- 
ecepting the parent assembly. The Winona assembly is under Presbyterian 
management, but it is interdenominational in its talent and conducts the 
largest summer Bible school in the world. 
8. The Nebraska Epworth Assembly: The Nebraska Epworth assembly, .lo- 
cated at Hpworth Park, near Lincoln, Nebr., is under the management of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church, but is nonsectarian, its talent is interdenomina- 
tional, and it includes those of Catholic and Protestant faith. It has probably 
reached at least 25,000 different people each season for the past 10 years, with 
an aggregate audience annually of over 100,000. 
4, The Monteagle Assembly: The Monteagle assembly was organized in 1882 
at Monteagle, on Cumberland Mountain, Tenn. It has the distinction of being 
the first summer school on a large scale in the Southern States. From the 
outset the assembly has included three divisions: (1) Sunday school and church 
work; (2) summer schools; (3) program of lectures and concerts for popular 
culture. It maintains the Chautauqua spirit by being interdenominational. 
The summer session at this institution for 1916 was one of the most successful 
in its history. 
5. University Chautauquas: Twenty-one Chautauquas were conducted by the 
extension division of the University of Wisconsin during the season for 1915 
and a still larger number for 1916. Hach community pays the university 
$1,000 for its program, for which the university sends to each community a 
large tent with platform, chairs, and electric lights; a small tent for housing 
educational exhibits; a canvas tent to inclose the two; a corps of four workers 
for six days, who give platform talks, conduct community round tables, lead 
the music, display educational motion pictures, tell the children stories and 
teach them games, and present two popular programs each day for six days,

each program preceded by a musical or literary prelude. Each community is 
: amply supplied with advertising material. Every day in the week is filled by 
speakers and professional musicians, the Sunday program being especially 
adapted to the occasion. 
THE SOUTHERN CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY. 
The Southern Conference for Education and Industry grew out of 
the efforts of the southern people to solve special economic, social, 
and educational problems. The peculiar attainment of the confer- 
ence has been to enlist citizens of all callings in the effort to develop 
an educational system in its entirety. The work of the conference 
includes three divisions, as follows, each directed by special com- 
mittees: 
I, The Business Administration of the Educational System. 
1. Taxation and revenues. 
2. Apportionment and expenditures. 
8. Organiation for administration: Boards, superintendents, super- 
visors, local trustees, administrative units, ete. 
4, The school plant—grounds, buildings, equipment. 
II. The Administration of Instruction. 
1. The course of study forming a continuing educational career for the 
individual from the elementary school on through the university, 
with stress on the human being, human activities, human relation- 
ships, rather than on subject matter. 
2. The extension activities of school and college, including physical, eco- 
nomic, and social development. 
3. Uniform standard for teachers, including the training of teachers 
through high schools, normal schools, and departments of education, 
4, The education of the Negro, with a study of the Negro mind to get 
at the means for adapting the school to his particular needs. 
5. The organization and management of the library—town, city, and 
especially of a county system. 
III. Community Life and Development. 
1. Vocational education, club work, and correlation of school with 
home, farm, and industry. 
. 2. The school as a social center, cooperating in a recreational program 
and other enterprises. 
8. The school as a factor in the industrial and economic system of the 
community. 
The general sessions of the New Orleans meeting, April 16 to 20, 
1916, were devoted to the following subjects: (1) The church in the 
country; (2) the cooperation of forces in extension work; (3) the 
organization of education and industry in a community; (4) a com- 
munity conference on recreation, including the social center, the 
playground, special day celebrations, community music, discussions 
and debate, and the community fair.

THE SHAKESPEARE TERCENTENARY CELEBRATION. 
The year 1916 marked a revival and extension of dramatic art 
through the tercentenary memorial celebrations of the death of 
William Shakespeare. Colleges, universities, and State normal 
schools, Shakespeare societies, and thousands of elementary and high 
schools participated in the celebrations during the spring and sum- 
mer of 1916. 4 
The most extensive and successful Shakespeare tercentenary cele- 
bration was that by New York City, under the direction of the New 
York City Shakespeare Tercentenary Celebration Committee, of 
which Miss Mary Porter Beegle was chairman, and Mrs. Axel O. 
Thiseng was executive secretary. Among others active in the celebra- 
tion were Mayor Mitchel, President Butler, of Columbia University, 
David Belasco, Daniel Frohman, and many other persons of like 
prominence. It was a city-wide celebration. Some of the forms 
which it included were as follows: Play, masque, festival, pageant, 
music, dancing, chorus, ballads, lecture, sermon, art and handicraft 
exhibit, library exhibit, club program, study course, story-telling, 
tableaux, tree planting, Shakespeare garden. Among the musicians 
who assisted were Mr. Stransky, of the Philharmonic, and Dr. 
Damrosch, of the New York Symphony, who in their final perform- 
ances rendered music inspired by Shakespeare. There was great 
enthusiasm evident among organizations of many sorts—colleges, 
social settlements, churches, recreation centers, playgrounds, clubs, 
public schools, parochial schools, private schools, dancing schools, art 
schools, public school athletic league, gardens, Y. W. C. A.’s, Y. M. 
C. A.’s, Masonic lodges, continuation classes in department stores, 
and other kindred organizations and institutions. 
This celebration began in the autumn of 1915 and extended into 
the month of May, 1916. It included many thousands of people of 
all nationalities and classes in all parts of the greater city and the 
territory adjacent. All of these celebrations led up to the Shake- 
speare masque, written for the occasion by Percy MacKaye and pro- 
duced under his direction. The performances took place out-of- 
doors at night. In its purpose the masque was a communal effort 
to honor the poet by bodying forth some of the greatness of his art, 
and the art of the theater in its broadest sense. It was a symbolic 
drama setting forth the art of the theater in all ages and its power 
to purify and elevate the spirits of men. Its prologue, three acts, 
and epilogue were performed by eminent professional actors, and 
were separated by interludes in which community groups took part 
in pantomime, dance, and choral song. Magnificent pictures, gor- 
geous colors, the sweeping movements of the dance, supported by or- 
chestral music, the multitudinous detail of costumes and properties 
combined to produce a type of drama hitherto undreamed of.
-P-A-G-E-409
EXTENSION EDUCATION. 381 
All the high schools of Washington, D. C., united in presenting 
one of the greatest Shakespearean pagents of this memorable year. 
The University of Virginia scored a signal success by its Shakes- 
pearean pagent which was staged on the beautiful and historic cam- 
pus of this institution at the 1916 summer session in the presence of 
1,500 teachers from many States and thousands of citizens of Vir- 
ginia.* 
The Drama League of America—The Drama League of America 
now in the seventh year of its work, with a membership of about 
150,000, was founded on the belief, according to Richard Burton, its 
president in 1914, that the drama is fast becoming an appreciable 
and important part of American literature; that because of this com- 
ing of the drama once more into serious consideration the theater be- 
comes an institution to be reckoned with as a cultural opportunity ; 
that the right use of the playhouse will minister to civilization, if 
only the amusement it offers be rational, sound, and of value as art, 
and as an interpretation of life. Closely associated with the thought 
that the theater can and therefore should be an asset in national 
civilization, goes a democratic ideal, declares Mr. Burton, that the 
theater, in nature and origin, is a great people’s institution, a kind 
of forum of the emotions of mankind; that it is the most widely ap- 
pealing and influential of all the forms of story-telling and amuse- 
ment; that its democracy inheres in these facts; and, hence, anything 
done to make it clean, artistically attractive, mentally and emotion- 
ally stimulating in the best sense, is directly a service to the public 
which attends the various offerings of the stage in almost innumer- 
able numbers; that the stage is irresistible; therefore organize and 
reform the stage. 
To this end the league has a program: It refuses to censure or at- 
tack bad plays; it damns only by silence, believing it is better and 
more effective to call attention to that which is good. This is done 
by the bulletin system, inaugurated in Chicago, the birthplace of 
the league, and now in familiar use in many of the large cities where 
branch organizations have been established. A playgoing committee 
selects from the offerings of a given week the drama it deems most 
worthwhile, and a bulletin, giving succinctly the facts about the play 
and urging its patronage, is sent out to all local members. 
The extension service or circuit work of the league is explained by 
Martyn Johnson in The Nation of January 21,1915. Briefly stated, 
it is as follows: The league sends at least three plays a year to the 
“one-night stands.” This is made practicable by utilizing the idea 
of the lecture lyceum, securing an advance sale for a series of plays 
to be selected by the national playgoing committee. With an ad- 
  
1A list of school and college celebrations of the Tercentenary is given in the bulletin 
of the Drama League, September, 1916.

vance sale of $500 assured them the New York managers have been 
willing to book their first companies in such plays as have been 
chosen in a circuit of towns which otherwise would have no chance 
of witnessing plays of this class. Among the plays to be sent over 
the league circuit last season were: George Arliss’s company in 
“Disraeli,” Margaret Anglin’s company in “Lady Windermere’s 
Fan,” and a special revival of “The Yellow Jacket.” The revival 
of “ The Yellow Jacket” was one of the most ambitious undertakings 
in the history of the league. The tour opened March 1, 1915, and 
extended from New York to North Dakota and Kansas, covering 
a period of two months, and was made possible by the work of 
the league in organizing audiences in each of the towns booked. 
The league is self-supporting and refuses to put itself under any 
obligations to the managers of dramatic companies, even going to 
the extent of purchasing the tickets used by the playgoing committee. 
Probably the greatest work ever done by the league was in the 
Nation-wide revival in Shakespearean study and dramatic art which 
it promoted through its “Suggestions for School and College Cele- 
brations of the Tercentenary of Shakespeare’s Death in 1916,”* as 
prepared by its president for 1915-16, Percival Chubb, with the col- 
laboration of Miss Mary Porter Beegle, of Barnard College, New 
York, Miss Mary Wood Hinman, of the School of Dancing, Chicago, 
and Dr. William E. Bohn, of the Ethical Culture School, New York. 
At the request of the United States Commissioner of Education, the 
league had printed for the Bureau of Education a special edition of 
85,000 copies of the booklet by this title, and these were distributed 
by the Bureau of Education among the elementary and high schools, 
as well as the colleges, universities, and normal schools of the United 
States. The Commissioner of Education, in an official letter, urged 
upon teachers, principals, and others throughout the country to 
assist in making this celebration an occasion for creating among the 
school children and the people generally a new interest in literature 
and the drama. In this letter, dated January 17, 1916, he suggested 
that special programs be devoted to the subject throughout the 
remainder of the 1915-16 school year and again after the schools 
opened in the fall of the school year 1916-17. 
MOTION PICTURES. 
Much has been written during the past five years both for and 
against the motion picture as a factor in the education of the people, 
but whether its influence be for good or evil, its position as a factor 
of importance in education remains unassailed. The ultimate result 
rests with the public. If the public desires a low grade of pictures   
1Drama League of America, Marquette Building, Chicago, Ill., 10 cents,
-P-A-G-E-411
  
EXTENSION EDUCATION. 383 
to the extent of liberally patronizing them, the picture film com- 
panies will continue to manufacture a low rade of pictures ; but if 
the public demands a high grade of pictures and will give liberal 
patronage, the film companies will meet the demand. 
The University of Wisconsin is perhaps the pioneer among educa- 
tional institutions in establishing a school film exchange as one 
means of solving the motion-picture problem. The division of visual 
education of the extension service in this institution has 130 reels of 
films and 18,000 lantern slides. There are 285 schools cooperating 
with the division in various sections of the State. Each school re- 
ceives a set of 85 slides, and the 78 schools possessing motion-picture’ 
projectors receive a reel of film in addition. There is a weekly 
change of slides and films. The cost to each school is only about 
30 cents for express. The circuit is so arranged as to facilitate the 
distribution of films in the most expeditious manner possible. 
Recently attention has been directed to other problems in connec- 
tion with motion pictures aside from moral and educational problems. 
There is the health problem—the problem of pure air; the problem 
of eye strain; the problem of overstimulation of the nervous 
organism. 
That the motion picture can be put to a good use is evidenced by St. 
Bartholomew’s Parish House and Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, 
both of New York City. Both of-these churches show films on Sun- 
day afternoon, giving pictures of travel through Palestine, Biblical 
scenes, and events in the history of the church. At Grace Church 
over 700 children are reported in attendance every Sunday afternoon 
at the motion-picture entertainments, with a total of over 50,000 ad- 
missions for 1916. A card from the Sunday school gives free admis- 
sion; general admission without card is 3 cents.

CHAPTER XXIII. 
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. 
By J. D. Wotcorr, 
Ohief of the Library Division, Bureau of Education. 
LIBRARY PUBLICITY. 
In order to bring the reader and the book together, one of the 
chief functions of the modern public library, it is necessary to make 
known to the community the resources of the library and the sery- 
ices which it is prepared to render as a public institution. Library 
advertising is. usually carried on by each individual library for 
itself, although some general uniformity in methods has been at- 
tained. Recently a tendency is manifest toward cooperation in the 
work of library publicity, both in local districts and in the country 
at large. It is found that by cooperative buying the expense to each 
library for the necessary ‘publicity material may be materially re- 
duced and that better talent may be employed for its production. 
The American Library Association has given official attention to 
the subject of library publicity since 1906, when a committee on 
library publicity appointed by the association outlined a program 
for action. The committee has been renewed from time to time since 
that year, and has continued to study the problem. To the committee 
on publicity for 1916 the executive board of the American Library 
Association referred all previous American Library Association 
reports on the subject of publicity, and also instructed the committee 
to study out and report a comprehensive publicity plan for the 
American Library Association, the State library associations and 
commissions, and local libraries. The present committee, of which 
W. H. Kerr, of Emporia, Kans., is chairman, consists of eight mem- 
bers. Its report will be in the nature of a publicity survey. The 
committee plans to begin the publication of a quarterly, “American 
Library Press Bulletin,” for the use of newspapers in all parts of the 
country. 
The American Library Association, in conference at Asbury Park, 
June, 1916, sent a telegram of greeting to the Association of Adver- 
tising Clubs of the World, in convention in Philadelphia. A cordial 
385  
-P-A-G-E-414
  386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
reply to this telegram was received and a good understanding estab- 
lished between the two organizations. The Associated Advertising 
Clubs had a committee on libraries as a subcommittee of their Na- 
tional educational committee. This committee, under the chairman- 
ship of J. C. Dana, of Newark, N. J., worked actively and effectively 
to bring librarians into cooperation with the advertising men. 
A movement for the employment by the American Library Asso- 
ciation of a publicity expert for public libraries was recently 
started by the committee on publicity of the Pacific Northwest Li- 
brary Association. Representative libraries in 20 States were urged 
to support the proposal, which was submitted to the American 
Library Association for consideration. 
The conference on library work held by the Wisconsin library 
commission at Madison, Wis., in July, 1915, devoted one day of its 
program to the subject of publicity methods. The university school 
of journalism assisted in the presentation of the topic. 
A number of libraries have been conspicuous for effective publicity 
work during the past year. The library committee of the Toledo 
(Ohio) Commerce Club designated the period of seven days beginning 
March 1, 1916, as a library publicity week, during which the uses of 
the public library should be brought in every practicable way to the 
general notice of the citizens. The undertaking was officially recog- 
nized by proclamation of the mayor of Toledo. During the week 
articles and advertisements about the library appeared each day in 
the local newspapers. Appropriate cards and other library material 
were displayed in show windows in various parts of the city, and the 
street cars carried posters relating to the library. Similar posters 
were placed in many of the large factories. Other methods of adver- 
tising employed were the distribution of folders and the inclosure 
of slips regarding the library in 10,000 laundry packages. After 
listening to library talks at the schools, the pupils were taken on 
visits to the public library and its resources explained to them. A 
result of the campaign has been a marked increase in the number 
of registered borrowers and.of books lent from the public library. 
A similar campaign for the establishment of a business department 
in the public library was carried on in St. Paul in June, 1915, by the 
Town Criers, an association of local advertising men. On June 17, 
which was recognized by proclamation of the mayor as Town Criers’ 
library day, a special library edition of the St. Paul Daily News was 
issued and circulated. In July a business men’s library centrally 
located in a store was opened to the public by the city library, and 
means have since been taken by the Town Criers and other organiza- 
tions of business men to bring the services of this library to the 
attention of those interested.

accomplished by the public libraries are Seattle, Wash., St. Joseph, 
Mo., and Utica, N. Y. 
In Wisconsin during the past year public library books were fre- 
quently advertised through window displays. This method of pub- 
licity was first tried by the larger libraries of the State and is now 
being adopted by those of the smaller communities. For the most 
part, merchants’ windows on the main streets are borrowed for this 
purpose, since few libraries have suitable windows in their own 
buildings. It is reported that these window displays bring good 
results when made by libraries. 
LIBRARY SURVEYS. 
Most of the reports of school surveys recently published devote 
little or no space to the library as an educational factor. In surveys 
now in progress there are, however, indications of a tendency to 
give more attention to public and school libraries. 
Recent examples of surveys recognizing the work of libraries are 
the report of the Ohio State school survey commission, 1914, which 
has 74 pages on the subject of “ What public libraries do for schools ”; 
also the school surveys of South Bend, Ind.; Springfield, Il; 
Leavenworth, Kans.; and San Antonio, Tex., which deal briefly with 
the status of high-school libraries and with the relations of the public 
library to the schools in their respective communities. 
The report of the examination of the public-school system of the 
city of Buffalo by the education department of the State of New 
York, Albany, 1916 (pp. 79-80) , commends the working of the system 
by which the Buffalo public library supplies books for the pupils of 
the graded schools. It views as one of the greatest advantages of 
the system that the children are constantly reminded “ that the books 
come from a source which is available after the children have passed 
through the schools and that the public library is a means of educa- 
tion which is open to them during their life in the city.” The col- 
lections of historical reference books in the Buffalo high-school 
libraries also receive favorable mention in the report (p. 187). 
One section of the report of the education survey of Cleveland, 
conducted by the survey committee of the Cleveland Foundation in 
1915, deals with the relations of the public library and the public 
schools.? Although this report has to do primarily with conditions 
in Cleveland, much of its contents will be found informing and sug- 
gestive for other cities. The opening chapter contains an historical

388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
sketch of the always close connection in Cleveland between the pub- 
lic library and the public schools. The attainment of still more 
effective forms of cooperation is stated to be the aim of the present 
report. The field of operations is then surveyed under its various di- 
visions of libraries in elementary schools, branch libraries, classroom 
and home libraries, high-school libraries, and the normal-school 
library. The final chapter is a forecast of future development, with 
recommendations of policies and administrative readjustments tend- 
ing to the highest efficiency. 
The principal conclusion reached by this study of the library and 
the schools is that “in their relations to each other both schools and 
libraries should subordinate every other consideration to the single 
aim of implanting in every child an invincible love for reading.” 
To accomplish this end the children must be introduced at an early 
age to a great variety of well-chosen books and encouraged in every 
possible way to read them. This conclusion is based on the principle 
that reading is the most important thing the child can learn in school. 
The survey recommends that the library board advise with the 
board of education as to the possibility of erecting new branch 
libraries in connection with public school buildings. In this way 
one auditorium, one heating plant, one set of clubrooms, and one 
custodian would serve for both institutions. The following recom- 
mendations are also. presented: The establishment of a school library 
in each new school building reorganized on the platoon plan or any 
similar plan; well-equipped libraries and trained librarians for all 
junior high schools; expansion of the book collections of senior high 
schools so as to include-works of inspiration and recreation as well 
as reference books. To meet the proposed extensions, it is asserted, 
the number of school librarians in Cleveland may well be increased 
to approximately 50 in the near future. 
The salaries paid to school librarians are found insufficient to 
encourage any young woman in Cleveland to enter such work. The 
average of training and education among school librarians is higher 
than it is among the teachers of the public schools, but the salaries 
received by librarians are much lower than those of teachers—less 
than half the average high-school teacher’s salary, in the case of 
high-school librarians. The survey declares that school librarians 
should be at least as well paid as are the teachers among whom they 
work. This is desirable both in the interest of justice and of effi- 
ciency, in order that the librarians may be accepted by the teachers 
as their professional equals. 
The survey recommends the establishment of a corps of teacher 
librarians, certified by the library board as librarians, by the board 
of education as teachers, paid by both boards, and appointed to their 
positions by the board of education. A supervisor of school libraries  
-P-A-G-E-417

should also be appointed in charge of all library work with the 
public schools. 
A comprehensive survey of all State-supported library activities 
in Washington is to be undertaken in accordance with a decision of 
the library advisory board of that State, reached January 21, 1916, 
and unanimously approved by the State library commission. The 
State library advisory board consists of John B. Kaiser, Tacoma, 
president; James M. Hitt, State librarian ex officio, secretary; Mrs. 
Josephine Preston, State superintendent of public instruction; and 
three other members. The survey is to be under the direction of the 
members of the advisory board as chairmen of special committees. 
Experts in various lines will be invited to assist in the study. It is 
expected that the work will require a year or more, and the board 
will report the results to the commission. The survey is to cost only 
the expenses of the board members. 
The following subjects will come within the scope of the survey: 
The State library—is a legislative reference division desirable for the State 
library? 
Is a library organizer needed in the State? 
What aids can be rendered small town libraries? 
Traveling library department—can the advisory board help develop it? 
How can further cooperation between existing libraries and the public 
schools be fostered to the advantage of both? 
Can the county school circulating libraries be aided? 
The problem of instruction in normal schools in the use of libraries and a 
knowledge of children’s literature. 
The county library question. 
Can and should the State aid the libraries in the State charitable, penal, 
and reformatory institutions? 
What should be the relation of the State university library to the other 
libraries maintained by the State? 
Is a summer library school desirable under the auspices of the State library 
commission or the State university? 
How can the extension department of the State university aid in the solution 
of the State’s library problems? . 
What legislation, if any, is recommended by the advisory board? 
Work with foreigners. 
Henry E. Legler, librarian of the Chicago Public Library, is chair- 
man of a committee of 11 appointed by the Illinois Library Associa- 
tion to make a survey of library conditions in the State of Illinois. 
The work is divided among public, rural school, high school, normal 
school, college, and university libraries. Special attention is to be 
given to furnishing a constructive policy for high-school libraries. 
ADMINISTRATION OF HIGH-SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
One problem regarding high-school libraries which is under con- 
sideration at present is whether control of these libraries by the 
61355°—16——27  
-P-A-G-E-418
390 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
school authorities alone is preferable, or whether such control should 
be shared between the public-library board and the school board.* 
The former system is more prevalent, but there is a strong movement 
in favor of the latter plan, which naturally enlists the support of 
public-library workers, who desire to be recognized as the profes- 
sional coworkers of teachers in the educational field. It may be said 
at present that the question of form of high-school library control 
depends upon local conditions. No general plan has yet been formu- 
lated which can claim to be universally applicable. It is generally 
recognized, of course, that cooperation between the public library 
and school libraries is desirable, but this is often attained without 
placing the school libraries under a system of joint administration. 
Some school men seem to believe that the school authorities alone 
can so administer the library as to correlate it intelligently with the 
other activities of the school. It is also asserted that the problems 
of the high-school library.resemble those of libraries of colleges and 
of other educational institutions, rather than those of the public 
library; and that administration by the school authorities affords 
an opportunity to manage and develop the high-school library along 
the lines of libraries of educational institutions.. Another advantage 
is that, since the school board is usually able to pay the high-school 
librarian a teacher’s salary, with rank as a faculty member, it can 
set higher qualifications for the librarian than can the public library, 
which can rarely offer an adequate salary. 
When the high-school library is a branch of the public library, it 
is sometimes open to the public at large as well as to the students, 
but the majority of such branches are closed to the public. There is 
strong objection to opening the school library to the public, on the 
ground that with a divided constituency the library becomes less 
serviceable to the pupils. The following reasons are given for re- 
serving the school library exclusively for the school: (1) In order to 
preserve the atmosphere of the schoolroom, and proper discipline; 
(2) selection of books must be made with the pupils in view rather 
than the public, who require a collection of a character different from 
that which the school requires; (3) the school needs the whole time 
of the librarian, who can not be spared from her school duties in 
order to give attention to the public. If a public-library branch in   
17This question was discussed at the meeting of the library department of the National 
Education Association, at New York, July 3, 1916. A statement of points on both sides 
may be found in the report of the committee on high-school libraries of the library depart- 
ment in the Proceedings of the National Education Association for 1915, pp. 1068-69. 
See also “The High-School Library,” by Gilbert O. Ward (Chicago, American Library 
Association publishing board, 1915), pp. 17-20. In an article entitled ‘‘ The Efficient 
’ High-School Library,’ Emma J. Breck opposes the plan of combining school and public 
service in the same library (English journal, 5: 12-13, January, 1916). The.side of 
public-library supervision is presented in the Library Journal by the following authors: 
Harriet A. Wood, 39 : 659-62, September, 1914; Elizabeth White, 41: 524-26, July, 1916;

LIBRARY AOTIVITIES. 391 
a high-school building is open to the public, the students should 
have a separate reading room, and the adult patrons should not be 
allowed to interrupt the close relations demanded between librarian 
and pupils. 
On the other hand, the advocates of the affiliation of school and 
public libraries point out that the majority of high-school students 
will never enter college, and conclude from this that the college 
library is not the model which the high-school library should follow. 
They say that the mass of students should become acquainted with 
the public library, so that they may be encouraged to use it in con- 
tinuing their education after leaving the high school. When there 
is an organic connection between the public library and the school 
library the entire resources of the former are better available to the 
school and a ready interchange of books between the two libraries 
may be effected. The public library also will have many contem- 
porary pamphlets and pictures to turn over to the high-school 
library, which are valuable for its use. 
It is claimed that the public library, by reason of its experience 
and equipment, can purchase books and supplies more economically 
than can the school board. The public library is also more likely to 
secure the latest and best editions of books desired. Under public- 
library management the cataloging of school libraries is done at the 
central library, thus insuring uniformity of method and leaving the 
school librarian free for the direct assistance of pupils. The central 
library may also be called upon to take an inventory of the school 
library, prepare new books, attend to binding, bring other work up 
to date, or provide a substitute for the school librarian during her 
temporary absence. 
The high-school librarian, when provided by the public library, 
may be expected to have some technical skill and breadth of educa- 
tion. She will probably be a member of the public-library staff, and 
in that case is qualified by her experience to draw upon the resources 
of the central library to aid in school work. Such a librarian can 
bring the school faculty and the public-library staff into cooperation, 
especially if she attends both faculty and staff meetings. 
The division of responsibility and expense for the high-school 
library between the public library and the school board varies in 
different places. In Cleveland, Ohio, which may be taken as a typical 
example, the board of education supplies the library room with its 
furnishings, light, heat, janitor service, reference books, and some 
magazines. The public library selects the librarian and pays her 
salary; also that of any library assistants and pages needed. It buys 
the books for circulation, part of the magazines, all supplies, and car- 
ries on the administration of the libraries. 
The arrangement between the school and the public library may 
require the former to furnish certain kinds of books, such as reference

works, or to contribute a definite amount for the public library to 
spend for books; the school board may appoint the librarian on the 
recommendation of the public librarian, and the public library sup- 
ply the books. It may naturally be arranged that the school shall 
purchase all sets of books used for supplementary reading and books 
permanently assigned to classrooms, such as dictionaries. In other 
respects, to require the public library to supply circulating books, 
and the school to supply reference books, is likely to cause difficulty, 
since it is often hard to foresee which use a given book will have. 
The total number of cities in the United States now reporting 
public-library branches in high schools is 16, located in 14 different 
States, comprising a total of 32 branch libraries, as follows: Stam- 
ford, Conn.—High School; Chicago, Ill—Austin, Carter Harrison, 
Lake View, and Nicholas Senn High Schools; Gary, Ind—High 
School; Louisville, Ky.—Boys’ High School, Girls’ High School; 
Lynn, Mass.—Lincoln School; Somerville, Mass.—High School; 
Grand Rapids, Mich—South High School; Kansas City, Mo.—Cen- 
tral, Northeast, and Westport High Schools; Omaha, Nebr.—High 
School; Passaic, N. J—High School; Cleveland, Ohio—Central, 
East, East Technical, Glenville, Lincoln, South, West, and West 
Technical High Schools; Portland, Oreg.—Jefferson, Lincoln, and 
Washington High Schools; Salem, Oreg.—High School; Pawtucket, 
R. I—High School; Tacoma, Wash.—Lincoln Park High School, 
Stadium High School; Madison, Wis.——High School. : 
PROGRESS IN HIGH-SCHOOL LIBRARIES, 
The movement for better high-school libraries made steady ad- 
vances during the past year throughout the country. The following 
are some special features of importance in the progress recently 
accomplished : 
California—A. certificate from the California State Board of 
Education is now required of all high-school librarians. Applicants 
for special certificates must show that they have had at least four 
years’ instruction beyond that required for graduation from a high 
school maintaining a four years’ course in advance of the eighth 
grade, or an equivalent amount of training; that at least half of said 
four years’ instruction has been devoted to study of work in library 
craft, technique, and use, or to subjects strictly supplementary there- 
to; that at least two-fifths of a year has been devoted to pedagogical 
subjects suited to the training of a secondary-school teacher, includ- 
ing practice.teaching. Special work in library craft during the 
secondary period may be substituted at the rate of half time for simi- 
lar study in the collegiate period, providing it does not exceed half 
the total time required in library craft. One year of successful

teaching may be substituted for half of the pedagogical work, and 
two years for the entire pedagogical requirements. The State board 
of education may accept certain equivalents for any of the above 
requirements, each application being considered on its own merits. 
Connecticut.—In the will of the late Edward Hallen, former judge 
of probate and member of the board of education, $500 was left: to 
the city of Bridgeport to be used as a fund for a memorial, and it 
is suggested that this fund be used to establish a Hallen collection 
in the new high-school library. : 
Kentucky.—Libraries have been established in the boys’ high school 
and girls’ high school of Louisville, which will be conducted as high- 
school branches of the Louisville Free Public Library under joint 
control of the board of education and the library board. The libra- 
rians who have been appointed were chosen from the staff of the 
public library, and have also been elected members of the school 
faculties. 
Louisiana.—In accordance with a plan of the principal to build up 
the library of the Sophie B. Wright high school in New Orleans, 
the girls of the three classes have elected members of a library 
board. This board is to look after the interests of the school library, 
and also to collect 1 cent per week from each of the 830 girls. The 
money collected in this way will be used to buy new books. 
Minnesota.—The annual report on high schools of the State super- 
visor of school libraries shows that library service is rendered by 
teachers in 118 schools, by superintendent or high-school principal 
in 18, by normal training department in 4, students in 13, superin- 
tendent’s clerk in 9, and school librarians in 25. Of the latter, 10 give 
full time to the school library. Sixteen schools depend upon the public 
library for all but classroom reference books, and three have definite 
contracts with the public library for service. Eighty-two schools 
attempt to give some public-library service, and three house the 
books belonging to the public-library association. South High 
School, Minneapolis, maintains a deposit station of the public 
library, and Hastings‘and St. Louis Park have combination school 
and public libraries, jointly supported by the town and the school. 
Nebraska—At the opening of the school year, September, 1915, 
the Omaha Public Library opened its first high-school branch. The 
agreement provides that the board of education shall supply the 
library room, properly furnished, pay the salary of the librarian, and 
purchase all strictly reference books, and that the library board shall 
purchase books for circulation and attend to all the details of cata- 
loging and preparing the books for the shelves, also to the trans- 
portation of books to and from the school. 
New York.—According to the report of the committee on school 
libraries of the New York Library Club, the most important event
-P-A-G-E-422
  394 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
this past year in the development of school libraries in New York 
City has been the introduction of an elective course of 20 lessons in 
library methods for teachers in the Brooklyn Training School for 
Teachers. Thirty-five students elected the course during the year, 
and it proved so valuable to them in their work that a much larger 
class is expected for next year. The aim of the course is to prepare 
teachers for the efficient use of libraries and library tools in their 
school work. 
The school libraries division of the New York State education 
department and the New York State Library School cooperated in 
conducting a library institute for high-school librarians, July 6-16, 
1915. The entire time of the institute was devoted to the reference 
use of the high-school library. The intelligent interest of the teach- 
ers in attendance made it possible to obtain results far exceeding 
the expectations of those who had planned the course. The number 
of registrations for the course was 34, representing all parts of the 
State. 
Ohio.—The Scott, High School library of Toledo was opened for 
student and faculty use in November, 1915. There are 3,000 books 
on the shelves, of which 2,500 are new. Most of the funds for pur- 
chasing books were cleared in a post-card campaign, during which 
more than 28,000 post-card pictures of the building were sold by 
students and faculty at 5 cents apiece. Other sources of income were 
the receipts from a lecture and from the annual French play, and 
various donations. By the united effort of student body and faculty 
$2,600 for the library was raised in a single year. 
Rhode Island.—A bill was introduced in the legislature during its 
1916 session to promote the efficiency of library service, providing 
State aid for payment of school librarians whose qualifications are 
approved by the State board of education. ; 
Utah.—The State board of education is collecting a model school 
library, from the first grade to the last year of high school, which is 
to be housed in the State library at the capitol. The books will be 
available for loan to educators of the State. 
COOPERATION BY SPECIALIZATION. 
The American Library Institute, under the lead of its president, 
E. C. Richardson, librarian of Princeton University, has indorsed 
a proposition that certain libraries shall definitely adopt certain 
specialties and engage to undertake one or all of the following 
matters: 
1. To build up in these lines. 
2. To prepare and publish a joint list of each specialty adopted. 
3. To prepare or secure printed cards of all books in these lines which are 
likely to be found in many libraries and which are not to be had in the Library 
of Congress or other published cards.
-P-A-G-E-423
  LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. 895 
4. To analyze and publish a cumulated, short-title catalogue of all books in 
the collection which call for analysis. 
5. To be responsible for either— 
(a) Lending to other libraries, or 
(b) Indicating on request some library from which copy can be borrowed, or 
(c) In case of unique works, or works so rare as to forbid any lending 
copies, to provide or secure photostat copies for lending. 
6. To be responsible for having typewritten or photostat extracts made from 
these books, and, when practicable, for having researches made in the subject, 
for reasonable compensation, according to the sponsorship idea of the special 
librarians. 
7. To be responsible for an effort to organize the libraries having like spe- 
cialties so as to secure that there shall be at least one reference copy and one 
lending copy (either original or copy) of all books on the subject in each of 
seven localities of the United States. 
The headquarters office of the American Library Association at 
Chicago, Ill., has become a clearing house for those libraries and 
individuals which have expressed a willingness to be enrolled as 
authorities for information on certain topics, in accordance with the 
“sponsorship for knowledge” idea recently proposed by George W. 
Lee, librarian of Stone & Webster, Boston, Mass. The plan briefly 
expressed is this: 
Let libraries, institutions, librarians, and others register with a central 
bureau any specific topic upon which those persons or institutions are par- 
ticularly well qualified to furnish expert information; let the list of these 
sponsored topics be published and distributed widely; let additions be made 
and the cumulated list replenished from time to time; let it be understood 
that seekers after knowledge in the particular fields covered may communicate 
with sponsors on those subjects, either directly or through their local library. 
A number of libraries and individuals have already enrolled as 
sponsors for certain topics in accordance with this scheme. 
BOOK WAGONS. 
The use of book wagons, or rather automobiles, for the service 
of rural readers, is spreading into new territory through its adoption 
from time to time by additional libraries. Wherever this method is 
introduced, reports indicate that it is found an effective means for 
stimulating an interest in books among the rural population and for 
supplying the desires thus aroused. : 
About 10 years ago the Washington County Free Library, at 
Hagerstown, Md., put a book wagon into operation on routes in that 
county. In 1912 an automobile was purchased in place of the original 
horse-drawn vehicle, and since that date this automobile has con- 
tinued to make trips with great success. 
For some years past, the Connecticut Public Library committee 
has maintained a book wagon. The value of this service is proved 
by the eagerness of the patrons for its continuance, and by the high
-P-A-G-E-424
  396 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
standard of books circulated. The appropriation available for this 
purpose has been inadequate to meet the demand for the service. 
The State Library Commission of Delaware maintains book wagons 
which deliver books from house to house on country routes in Kent 
and Sussex Counties. This work, begun in the fall of 1912, has re- 
ceived such appreciation from the people of the districts reached as 
to show that a real need is met in this way. In actual operation, 
books to the number of 75 or more are placed in a wagon or auto- 
mobile in charge of an agent familiar with books, who also studies 
the tastes and needs of the people served. The patrons may select 
books on their own initiative, or on advice of the librarian in charge. 
The main purpose of these book wagons is to inspire a love of good 
books and to broaden the outlook of the readers. The book circula- 
tion is increasing, but the appropriation is inadequate to make more 
than a beginning in the work. 
The Narragansett Library, of Peace Dale, R. I., began during the 
year an educational missionary work in South Kingstown, by means 
of a book automobile. Homes of patrons in the country were to 
be used as deposit stations, and a house-to-house canvass of the dis- 
tricts to be covered was planned. 
The Plainfield (Ind.) Public Library has prepared a “book auto- 
mobile,” to be used for all its rural service. The library serves two 
townships, and a personal touch will now be given to its work for the 
rural community. 
A playground wagon has been evolved by the St. Louis Public 
Library, for use in cooperation with the summer playgrounds. It is 
a motor truck, carrying within a bookcase on wheels, with a capacity 
for 380 volumes. These books are lent to the children at the play- 
grounds.” 
NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS. 
The corner stone of the new Central Public Library building in 
Indianapolis, Ind., which is to cost over $500,000, was laid March 24, 
1916, with appropriate exercises. The program was largely in honor 
of James Whitcomb Riley, who donated the site for the building. 
- It is reported that sentiment is growing in favor of naming the 
building after Mr. Riley. A fund was recently raised by contribu- 
tions from the school children for equipping the building with mas- 
sive bronze doors. 
A site for a library building has been donated by a public-spirited 
citizen to the city of Wilmington, Del. In April, 1916, over $325,000 .

was raised by subscription for the erection of the new building on 
this site. 
St. Paul, Minn., has a new library building which is approaching 
completion, provided by J. J. Hill for housing both the public 
library and his gift of a reference library. San Francisco and De- 
troit have new library buildings well under way. Savannah, Ga., is 
also to have a new public library building. 
An appropriation of $350,000 has been made for the construction 
of a new library building at the University of Michigan. The 
capacity of the new structure will be 600,000 volumes, with reading 
rooms to accommodate 1,000 students. 
The new library building of the University of Missouri was opened 
in January, 1916. Amherst College also is to have a new library 
building, with a capacity of 240,000 volumes. 
The faculty and alumni of the University of Alabama have 
indorsed a plan to raise funds by popular subscription for the erec- 
tion of a library building, to be called the Amelia Gorgas Memorial 
Library, in memory of Mrs. Amelia Gorgas, who for many years was 
university librarian. 
MEETINGS OF ASSOCIATIONS. 
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. 
The conference of 1916, marking the fortieth anniversary of the 
American Library Association, was held at Asbury Park, N. J., June 
26 to July 1. The attendance reached nearly 1,500, the largest yet 
recorded at any meeting of the association. The general theme of the 
program was the library in a democracy. 
In the absence of the president, Mary W. Plummer, of New York, 
whose attendance was prevented by illness, the first vice president, 
Walter L. Brown, of Buffalo, N. Y., and the second vice president, 
Chalmers Hadley, of Denver, Colo., acted in turn as presiding officers. 
Miss Plummer’s presidential address, entitled “The public library 
and the pursuit of truth,” was read by George B. Utley, secretary of 
the association. Some important papers presented at the general 
sessions were the following: “How the community educates itself,” 
Arthur E. Bostwick; “ Children’s reading,” John Jay Chapman, read 
by Henry N. Sanborn; “ Democracy in modern fiction,” Mary Ogden 
White; “Leadership through learning,” W. W. Bishop; “ Modern 
drama as an expression of democracy,” Robert Gilbert Welsh; “ The 
new poetry and democracy,” Jessie B. Rittenhouse; “ How Ontario

The American Library Association was organized in October, 1876, 
at a meeting held in Philadelphia in accordance with a plan origi-

    398 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
nated by Melvil Dewey, R. R. Bowker, and Frederick Leypoldt. On 
the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of its founding, the associa- 
tion showed its appreciation of the services of these three men by 
the presentation of a loving cup to Mr. Bowker, and by sending 
telegrams of greeting to Mr. Dewey and to the widow of Mr. Ley- 
poldt. Telegrams of greeting were also sent to 14 other persons known 
to be surviving from the 67 charter members of the association. 
Besides the five general sessions, interesting and suggestive meet- 
ings were held by the various sections of the association and by the 
several affiliated organizations. Three of these sections are distinctly 
educational in character—the professional training section, the col- 
lege and reference section and the school libraries section. 
The school libraries section held two sessions, which were well 
attended. The papers and discussions centered about the national 
campaign for better school libraries. C. C. Certain, of the Cass 
Technical High School, Detroit, Mich., presented “The school 
library situation in the South,” giving data obtained by tabulating 
the replies to the questionnaire sent to high-school libraries in 16 
Southern States by the Bureau of Education early in 1916. A paper 
by James F. Hosic, of the Chicago Normal College, on “The place 
of the school library in modern education,” was read in the author’s 
absence by W. H. Kerr. The remainder of the meeting was a sym- 
posium on the subject: How can we promote the school library 
movement? The participants were Azariah S. Root, Oberlin Col- 
lege; Henry E. Legler, Chicago Public Library; Effie L. Power, 
Carnegie Library, Pittsburgh ; and Orpha M. Peters, Public Library, 
Gary, Ind. At the second session of the section, after a general dis- 
cussion of various subjects, round tables were held for high-school 
librarians and for normal-school librarians, respectively. 
An instructive exhibit illustrating the equipment and work of 
representative school libraries was on view during the conference. 
Tt consisted of scrapbooks, pictures, plans, charts, and pamphlets. 
On Thursday afternoon of the conference week about 650 librarians 
visited Princeton University by special train, where they were wel- 
comed by President Hibben and shown through the buildings and 
grounds, with particular attention to the university library. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, LIBRARY DEPARTMENT. 
During the meeting of the National Education Association in 
New York City, July 1-8, the library department of the association 
held three regular sessions and one joint meeting with the depart- 
ment of secondary education. Irene Warren, of Chicago, Ill., pre- 
sided over the regular sessions.

LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. 399 
The topic of the first meeting was the administration of the high- 
school library. The combined administration of high-school libraries 
by the public-library and public-school boards, as in operation in 
Cleveland, Ohio, was described by Bessie Sargeant Smith, supervisor 
of high-school libraries of that city, who pointed out the advantages 
of the plan. Arthur E. Bostwick, librarian of the public library, St. 
Louis, Mo., then. took up the general principles involved, supporting 
the control of school libraries by the public library on the ground of 
efficiency, but disclaiming for the public library any desire to direct 
educational policy. In the discussion which followed, the point of 
view of the public library was further developed by Henry BE. Legler, 
librarian of the Chicago Public Library. Purd B. Wright also 
commented on the system of branch libraries in high schools in 
Kansas City, Mo. The opposite position, that school libraries should 
be administered by the school authorities, was supported by Sherman 
Williams, chief of the school libraries division, New York State 
education department. William B. Owen, principal of the Chicago 
Normal College, then spoke on the importance of the early formation 
of the “library habit” by young people. In this connection, Sher- 
man Williams expressed the belief that the reading habit, if it is to 
be effective, must be acquired before the high-school age, perhaps 
even before the age of 10. 
O. S. Rice, supervisor of school libraries, Wisconsin, announced 
that a teacher-librarian course would be offered by the University 
of Wisconsin in the autumn of 1916, under the auspices of the State 
department of education. 
At the second session of the library department reports were made 
on recent progress in normal-school libraries, high-school libraries, 
and -rural-school libraries. The topic of the third session was 
“ Source material,” the subject being introduced by May Massee, of 
Chicago, editor of the A. L. A. Book List. 
The joint meeting of the department of secondary education and 
of the library department was held Wednesday forenoon. “The 
importance of the library in the modern high school” was presented 
by William M. Davidson, superintendent of schools, Pittsburgh, Pa. 
Other papers were “The need of an aggressive campaign for better 
high-school libraries,” by Charles Hughes Johnston, University of 
Illinois; “The value of the library to vocational and technical 
courses in high schools,” by Walter D. Hood, principal of the Gilbert 
School, Winsted, Conn.; “The administration and maintenance of 
the high-school library,” by Mary Sullivan, Pittsburgh, Pa.; report 
of library committee, by its chairman, C. C. Certain, Cass Technical 
High School, Detroit, Mich. The program ended with a symposium 
on the uses of the library in the teaching of various subjects in the 
high-school curriculum.

  400 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
In the Washington Irving High School, where the joint meeting 
took place, there was a comprehensive exhibit illustrating the work 
of a modern organized high-school library. The main library room 
of the high-school and the library classroom adjoining contained col- 
lections of books and other library aids for the different school 
courses, grouped according to subject, thus showing clearly and 
effectively the assistance which the library offers to students in each 
branch. Another room contained material illustrating plans and 
equipment for standard high-school libraries. 
An exhibit of library aids for teachers, prepared by a local New 
York City committee of the National Education Association, was 
placed in the children’s room of the New York Public Library, where 
it attracted much attention. The children’s room itself, with its 
books and equipment, was an interesting and suggestive exhibit for 
teachers in elementary schools.

CHAPTER XXIV. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 
By Paut MarsHatt Rea, 
Secretary of the American Association of Museums; Director of the Oharleston (8. 0.) 
Museum. 
INTRODUCTION. 
For the purpose of obtaining more complete and accurate sta- 
tistics regarding the educational work of museums in the United 
States, a special questionnaire was issued by the Commissioner of 
Education in May, 1916. The returns from this questionnaire have 
made possible a revision of the list of museums and their directors 
in the Educational Directory for 1916-17, in addition to yielding 
the general information which forms the basis of this chapter. 
Returns were received from 281 museums. Those which did not 
make returns, with a few exceptions, are small and inactive. Or- 
ganized educational work is reported by 51 museums. In addition, 
8 museums which failed to make returns are known to conduct 
active educational work. The reasons for the relatively small num- 
ber of museums engaged in organized educational work have been 
presented fully in previous reports. The significant fact is the 
success of this work wherever it is being done and the increase in its 
extent during the past 10 years. 
Of the 51 museums reporting organized educational work, 38 are 
public museums, i. e., they receive their financial support from the 
people in the form of appropriations of tax funds or in member- 
ships, or in both of these ways. Not only do the public museums en- 
gage in educational work more frequently than any other class of 
museums, but they develop it much more extensively than others. 
Broad educational service thus appears to be the significant product 
of this type of museum. There is evidence, however, of an increasing 
tendency for other types of museums to follow the lead of the ‘public 
museums. Three museums of a private nature—that is, maintained 
exclusively by endowments derived from one or two donors only—

are engaged in educational work. One of these owes its distinction 
chiefly to good fortune in obtaining curators who have appreciated 
the educational work of the public museums. The other two are 
recently organized museums, which likewise are inspired by the 
example of the public museums. 
As to college museums, which have been discussed at length in 
previous reports, no accurate estimate can be made of educational 
service. Some certainly are used extensively in college and uni- 
versity instruction, but it is equally certain that many are not closely 
related to the work of the colleges to which they belong. Reports 
showing some effort to extend educational facilities to public schools 
or to the general public have been received from 10 college or uni- 
versity museums. In no case is this work extensive; yet it indicates 
the influence of the newer idea of museum service. 
The position of college museums is best understood when it is 
remembered that, like all other institutions, museums owe their pri- 
mary obligation to the sources of their funds. The college museum 
is a college problem, and its status just at present is uncertain. It 
has definite teaching functions as administered at Harvard, Yale, 
Clark University, University of Chicago, etc. For this purpose it 
is a development of the illustrative teaching collections usually found 
in college departments. The point at which these teaching collec- 
tions acquire sufficient distinction to be termed “ museums ” is difficult 
to determine, as is also the extent to which it is advisable for a college 
or university to develop museums as adjuncts of courses of instruction. 
A second and important function of the college museum is to 
afford material for research. Neither the teaching nor the research 
function, however, brings the college museum into any direct relation 
with the public or with elementary or secondary schools. College 
museums of natural history usually fail to appeal to the general 
public for lack of expert installation. The expense of such installa- 
tion is of doubtful expediency unless the welfare of the college can 
be enhanced proportionately by it. The University of Iowa finds 
its large group exhibits of value in attracting public interest to 
the university. Perhaps the most promising field of public instruc- 
tion for college museums, however, is in connection with university 
extension. 
STATISTICS OF EDUCATIONAL WORK. 
The following statistics are compiled from information received 
this year. Further description of the work of many of these museums 
can be found in previous reports. The names of a few museums 
are included which did not make returns this year, but which are 
known to maintain extensive educational work, references being 
given to previous reports containing notices of their work.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 
The educational work of the museums listed above is, in the aggre- 
gate, impressive in variety and extent and remarkable for the rapid- 
ity of its development. In 1905 only three of these museums were 
doing conspicuous work of this character, while eight others had 
made small beginnings. 
There is every prospect that this first decade is but the prelude to 
a permanent service of increasing magnitude and that this service 
will be more and more widely appreciated. Two methods of acceler- 
ating this development seem desirable. The first is more serious 
consideration of museums and their work by school authorities and 
educators generally. The second is organized publicity to make 
more widely known to people throughout the country the nature 
and value of the service rendered by public museums. 
A step toward the fulfillment of the first need was taken in 
connection with the New York meeting of the National Education 
Association in July, 1916, when a special session was held at the Met- 
ropolitan Museum of Art for consideration of the educational value of 
museums. At the meeting of the science section, also, in the Ameri- 
can Museum of Natural History, a paper on “The value and impor- 
tance of the school museum” was read by Mr. C. G. Rathmann, 
director of the Educational Museum in St. Louis. In this paper Mr.
-P-A-G-E-439
  
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 411 
Rathmann described not only the work of a school museum, but its 
place in the educational system. Emphasizing the necessity of sup- 
plementing the textbook with object teaching, he showed the value of 
the museum in making children acquainted with the world in which 
they live. It is not the purpose of the museum to illustrate every part 
and feature in geography, history, nature study, and other subjects, 
he said. This is neither necessary nor desirable. What is necessary 
is to give the children vivid and concrete images in order to enable 
them to form adequate images of things and processes not illus- 
trated. The use of illustrative material is a means to this end. The 
child must be led from the concrete to the abstract, but there must 
be sufficient concrete experience from which to make abstractions. 
The possibilities of museums in illustrating and supplementing 
school work were especially well presented in a series of papers read 
at the Washington meeting of the American Association of Museums 
in May, 1916.1. These papers were part of a symposium reporting 
further progress in a concerted experiment of a number of museums 
in illustrating the history of nations and of civilization. The first 
symposium on this subject was reviewed in a previous report.? Not 
the least interesting feature of this work is that it has been conducted 
by both museum and school instructors. Closer cooperation between 
museum and school authorities must inevitably prove mutually 
advantageous in this field.

  CHAPTER XXV. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES. 
For several years past the Annual Report of the Commissioner of 
Education has contained a section on the educational work of the 
churches.1 The present chapter is not intended to be a complete 
statement ; it is intended rather to present brief notes of the work for 
the year of certain typical denominations, especially with respect to 
elementary schools. It is noteworthy that more attention has re- 
cently been given by churches to educational work than in previous 
years. It is not merely that the volume of work has increased; the 
denominations are examining carefully the work of the institutions 
in their charge; they are in many instances raising standards and 
placing the entire work of church education on a sounder basis. 
Charactesistic of the spirit of investigation in church educational 
work is the scholarly volume on “Church Ideals in Education,” pre- 
‘sented to the 1916 convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church. 
The following titles of the various sections of the report will indi- 
cate its scope: General policies; Parochial education in the church; 
Secondary education in the church; Collegiate education in the 
church; Theological education in the church; Education in the prov- 
ince; Education in the diocese; Education in the parish; Financing 
education; Special features in religious education. 
Of special interest in church education is the work of the Coun- 
cil of Church Boards of Education. At a meeting of the council held 
January 19-21 at Chicago, an interdenominational campaign was 
inaugurated. A temporary secretary to conduct the campaign was 
selected. The work to be done by the interdenominational campaign 
for the year 1916 was set forth as follows: 
1. The immediate objective is twofold: (1) To gather facts with which to im- 
press the fundamental importance of Christian education, and (2) to use such 
facts as a means of impressing upon selected communities the importance of 
Christian education as a means of demonstrating the wise and effective method 
of impressing these facts upon-the people. These two lines of activity should 
be carried forward at the same time, work in both directions proceeding at once. 
Your committee recommends that the effort to impress the fundamental im- 
portance of Christian education shall be understood to include: (1) Christian 
education through denominational schools and colleges, (2) religious work at 
State universities, (3) religious education through the home and local church

organizations, and (4) religious instruction in independent schools and colleges 
and in public schools. 
2. The temporary secretary shall gather from the various boards and agencies - 
and other sources such facts as are available and put them into form as printed 
matter, charts, pictures, and lantern slides. He shall also proceed to gather 
facts through surveys and investigations. 
3. The temporary secretary shall arrange for at least three demonstrations in 
three cities to be chosen later by the campaign committee. By means of exhib- 
its and addresses the facts calculated to interest those present in the whole 
eause of Christian education shall be presented and such follow-up methods 
adopted as shall seem desirable for the purpose of spreading interest and 
information. 
Denominational schools for Negroes have received special attention 
in the report of the Bureau of Education on Negro education, pub- 
lished in cooperation with the Phelps-Stokes Fund.* 
In previous reports the Lutheran schools have had large space. 
The Lutheran Churches have recently decided, however, to issue their 
statistics every three years, instead of every year; it is therefore im- 
possible to present a review of the Lutheran work until more direct 
means of acquiring statistics can be found. Prof. W. H. T. Dau, of 
Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, who has in the past generously pre- 
pared a statement for the bureau, has been unable to do so this year 
because of the change in the method in publishing statistics. 
ROMAN CATHOLIC PARISH SCHOOLS. 
By Rey. Patrick J. McCormick, Associate Professor of Education, Catholic University of 
America, Washingtoa, D. C. 
The statistics for the Catholic parish schools in 1915-16 show a 
gain of 100 schools and 41,743 pupils, when compared with the 
figures for the preceding year. In 1914-15 a gain of 85 schools and 
26,347 pupils was recorded. The large increase in total registra- 
tion during 1915-16 is partly accounted for by the fact that the 
Ruthenian-Greek schools have supplied their registration figures for 
this year, whereas in 1914-15 they were not recorded. Their schools 
remain the same in number, but the registration of 10,966 pupils 
makes an increase in the total registration which is out of proportion 
to that in the number of schools. : 
With the exception of the academies for girls, which increased 
five in number, the parish schools were the only institutions in the 
Catholic system to increase in number during the year reported. The 
Catholic population, which is 16,564,109, showed an increase of 
254,709 over that of 1914-15. 
The Catholic University of America, which has been affiliating 
high schools and academies since 1912, added 43 new high schools 
to its accredited list during 1915-16. There are now 132 high schools 
accredited, and many of these are parish high schools. An idea of

the significance and extent of this standardizing movement may be 
given by the distribution of these schools according to States, which 
is as follows: Alabama, 1; California, 3; Colorado 2; Connecticut, 3; 
Florida, 2; Georgia, 2; Illinois, 6; Indiana, 1; Iowa, 13; Kansas, 1; | 
Kentucky, 5; Maryland, 1; Massachusetts, 5; Michigan, 2; Minne- : 
sota, 2; Missouri, 10; Nebraska, 2; New Jersey, 1; New York, 3; | 
Ohio, 21; Oklahoma, 1; Oregon, 2; Pennsylvania, 19; Tennessee, 2; | 
Texas, 10; Virginia, 1; Washington, 3; Wisconsin, 8. 
The list of administrative and supervisory officers remains nearly 
the same as that of last year. Diocesan school boards are mentioned 
in the reports of some few dioceses for the first time. The Rev. 
Ralph Hunt, S. T. L., has been appointed superintendent of schools 
for the archdiocese of San Francisco, and the Rey. William F. Lawlor | 
has been appointed assistant superintendent of schools for the dio- 
cese of Newark, N. J. | 
During the year_an increased activity has been noted in providing 
extension and summer courses for teachers. A larger number of 
religious communities have conducted their own summer schools. 
The diocese of Albany inaugurated a summer school for primary 
teachers. In the diocese of Cleveland and in the archdioceses of San 
Francisco and Oregon City large teachers’ institutes were held dur- | 
ing the summer vacation. Summer schools were also conducted under | 
university auspices by De Paul University, Chicago, Ill.; Marquette 
University, Milwaukee Wis.; Creighton University, Omaha, Nebr.; 
and the Catholic University of America, Washington, D. C. In the 
last-named there was a total registration of 600; 320 attending at 
Washington, and 280 at Dubuque, the western extension. This en- 
rollment represented 31 religious communities, 28 States, and 43 dio- 
ceses of the United States and Canada. 
Tables 1 and 2 are based on data supplied by the Official Catholic 
Directory, published annually by P. J. Kennedy & Sons, New York

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
The educational activities of the Presbyterian Church in the 
United States of America are for the most part covered by the re- 
ports of (4) The woman’s board of home missions, (6) The board of 
missions for freedmen, and (¢). The college board. The following 
brief general statements will serve to indicate the character and scope 
of the contribution which the church is making to the cause of edu- 
cation throughout the United States, as well as in Alaska, Cuba, and. 
Porto Rico. Mention should be made of the fact that one boarding 
school, namely, the Polytechnic Institute of Porto Rico, is under the 
board of home missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United 
States of America. This project is being developed along inter- 
denominational lines somewhat after the plan followed at Park 
College, Missouri. 
The task of the woman’s board of home missions is primarily to 
establish and maintain grammar and secondary schools at strategic 
points throughout the United States, among communities deprived 
" by location, race prejudice, environment, or for some other reason of 
the advantages of public-school education or Christian influence and 
training of any kind. Through the mission schools established in 
such centers, appeal is made to the moral and spiritual sides of life, 
and the resulting tendency is almost invariably a general mental 
awakening and improved standards of living. The course of study 
followed in the mission schools is similar to that of the State public 
schools, with greater emphasis placed onthe industrial training, so 
that when boys and girls leave these schools they may be well 
equipped for the successful undertaking of life in a rural environ- 
ment, both as useful citizens and as home makers. 
Mention should also be made of Presbyterian schools in immi- 
grant communities. These are controlled on a different basis from

the others, the work being administered locally, although the funds 
pass through the hands of the board. The reports issued by the 
church show 21 boarding schools, with a total of 190 teachers and 
workers, an enrollment of 2,000, and an average attendance of 1,540. 
Two of these schools, Wasatch Academy, at Mount Pleasant, Utah, 
and the Normal and Collegiate Institute, at Asheville, N. C., have 
more than 200 students. The report for 1915 shows 18 day schools 
(9 in New Mexico, 2 in Colorado, 4 in Utah, 3.in Cuba) ; a total of 
51 workers; an enrollment of 1,357; and an average attendance of 657. 
In the same report 13 community stations are listed, with 44 workers 
and 510 pupils in special classes. There were also 5 hospitals and 
medical stations with 15 workers and 18 student nurses. The fol- 
lowing is a summary by fields:

The college board was organized by the General Assembly of the 
Presbyterian Church in 1883. It represents the church in its work 
and relations with educational institutions, including those of college 
and university rank as well as academies and special schools. Its 
function is to aid in the establishing and strengthening of such in- 
stitutions. In this it differs from the board of education of the 
Presbyterian Church, the function of which is to aid students and to 
carry on religious work among Presbyterian students in tax-supported 
institutions. 
Presbyterian coileges are so called for various reasons. Some are 
connected with the church by means of a charter provision requiring 
their trustees to be elected by an ecclesiastical body, such as a presby- 
tery or synod, or that all or a part of the trustees be members of 
the Presbyterian Church. Sometimes both of these charter require- 
ments exist. 
‘The relation thus established between the church and the institu- 
tion is commonly called the “organic” relation. Other colleges 
called Presbyterian are so by reason of historical associations and
-P-A-G-E-449

the fact that a majority of their students and friends have been 
members of this church. Among such institutions are Washington 
and Jefferson College, Hamilton College, Coe College, and others. 
The relation of the college board to a Presbyterian college is an 
administrative or financial relation, not an ecclesiastical relation. 
This board gives out of its treasury from time to time whatever funds 
may be available toward the endowment or current support of certain 
Presbyterian colleges needing such help. The number of such in- 
stitutions thus aided varies from year to year. With other col- 
leges not receiving such financial aid the board sustains an advisory 
relation, counseling from time to time with boards of trustees or with 
presidents on matters of policy or administration. 
During the year closing March 31, 1916, there were in the list of 
institutions sustaining the above relations with the college board 
1 university, 46 colleges, 7 special and technical schools, 4 junior col- 
leges, and 7 secondary schools. These institutions reported a total en- 
rollment of 24,558 students; a total income for current expenses 
during the year of $3,051,102; a total value of grounds, buildings, 
and equipment of $21,128,964; and endowment funds totaling 
$15,239,397. 
The board of missions for freedom has for its task the educational 
development of the Negro race in the South. This has been an im- 
portant problem for the church ever since the emancipation of the 
negro. The total number of schools is 658, of which 137 are day 
schools and 27 boarding schools. There were 494: teachers in the day 
schools, and the total enrollment reported in all the schools was 
17,794. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN THE 
UNITED STATES. 
By Henry H. Sweets, D. D., Secretary of Education, 
The Presbyterian Church in the United States (commonly called 
the Southern Presbyterian Church) began its separate existence in 
Augusta, Ga., in 1861. 
Following the traditions of the church, from its very inception it . 
turned its attention to the work of Christian education. There were 
almost insurmountable difficulties, however, to be overcome. The en- 
dowment funds of schools and colleges that had been accumulating 
for years were now of small value. The poverty of the people gave 
little hope for the immediate remedying of this condition. For many 
years the task was slow and uncertain.   
1¥or a detailed account of Negro educational work by the denominations, see Bull., 
1916, Nos. 38 and 39. 
~ 61355°—16——29 
 
-P-A-G-E-450
  422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
These difficulties have been in part overcome and the work of edu- 
cation is being placed on a firmer basis. Each one of the synods is 
now actively engaged in the work of correlating, standardizing, and 
unifying the appeal of all the institutions within its bounds. 
The General Assembly of the church is composed of 16 synods, 
which comprise the States of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Ten- 
nessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Okla- 
homa, Texas, and New Mexico. 
Under the control of these synods and the presbyteries which com- 
pose them are the following educational institutions: 
Six theological seminaries, with 43 in faculty, 326 students pre- 
paring for the work of the ministry, 48 buildings, property valued 
at $1,025,975, endowment funds of $1,840,488, and 122,455 books in 
the libraries. 
Seventeen colleges, with 263 in faculty, 2,858 students, 118 build- 
ings, property valued at $3,561,532, endowment funds of $1,867,913, 
and 121,117 books in the libraries. 
Twelve junior colleges, with 160 in faculty, 1,412 students, 44 
buildings, property valued at $1,260,500, endowment funds of $123,- 
709, and 15,880 books in the libraries. 
Twenty-two preparatory schools, with 135 in faculty, 2,032 stu- 
dents, 81 buildings, property valued at $538,138, endowment funds 
of $129,460, and 10,026 books in the libraries. , 
Two collegiate institutes, with 18 in faculty, 265 students, 6 build- 
ings, property valued at $25,000, no endowment funds, and 2,800 
books in the libraries. 
Sixteen elementary schools, with 33 in faculty, 830 students, 21 
buildings, property valued at $37,300, no endowment funds, and 990 
books in the libraries. 
Eleven orphans’ homes and schools, with 43 in faculty, 1,032 
children, 75 buildings, property valued at $873,000, endowment funds 
of $189,000, and 13,927 books in the libraries. 
This gives a total of 86 educational institutions, with 695 in the 
faculty, 8,755 students, 388 buildings, property valued at $7,321,445, 
endowment funds of $4,150,570, and 287,195 books in the libraries. 
Mountain schools—The Presbyterian Church in the United States 
conducts 34 schools of various grades in the Appalachian Mountains 
in the States of West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, 
Tennessee, and Kentucky, and 1 in the Ozark Mountains in Missouri. 
Every effort is being put forth to develop self-reliance and self- 
support in these mountain communities, and for this reason many of 
the schools of lower grade are not considered as permanent in- 
stitutions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-451
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES. 423 
Negro schools.—Four primary schools for the Negro population of 
the South are conducted, and a large college and theological seminary 
at Tuscaloosa, Ala., is maintained by the church. Every effort is 
being made to develop the Negro population into faithful, industri- 
ous, and moral citizens. 
Indians—For many years the church has maintained some schools 
among the Indians in what is now the State of Oklahoma. A well- 
equipped college for girls has been established at Durant, Okla. An 
orphanage is also maintained for these people to shelter homeless 
Indian children. 
Mewicans—The church is putting forth efforts in southeastern and 
southwestern Texas for the education of the thousands of Mexicans 
who have crossed the Rio Grande. Several primary schools have 
been erected and maintained, and an industrial training school of 
higher order has been established in Kingsville, Tex., to minister to 
this Mexican population.   
METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH, SOUTH. 
(From the 22d Annual Report of the.Corresponding Secretary, Stonewall Anderson.) 
The past year has been one of unusual activity on the part of the 
educational forces of the church. The enrollment of students is 
larger than in the previous year, and there has been an advance in 
the collections on the assessments for education. 
An educational conference was held April 4-6 at Birmingham. 
The conference was composed of representatives from the several 
annual conferences, representatives from the schools, colleges, and 
universities of the church, and others interested in educational work. 
These conferences furnish an opportunity for the educators and 
educational workers of the church to discuss in open conference and 
face to face the principles, methods, and problems of education. 
Religious education has come to mean vastly more than merely 
conducting schools owned and controlled by the church. Whatever 
-our schools may be able to do in the field of general education—and 
they are doing much and must continue to do so—religious education 
should be at the very heart and center of their work. Furthermore, 
it is of the highest importance that the four great agencies of reli- 
gious education—the home, the Sunday school, the young people’s 
societies, and the church schools—understand each other thoroughly, 
cooperate with each other fully, and coordinate and correlate their 
efforts in giving religious education to the childhood and youth of 
the church and country. 
The board at its last session appointed two committees to make 
investigations during the year of important phases of religious edu- 
cation and to present the results of their investigations, with recom-
-P-A-G-E-452

mendations, to the present session of the board. These committees 
are composed, respectively, of Dr. Andrew Sledd and Dr. R. P. 
Taylor. 
  
NORTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION. 
(Information from the Fifth Annual Report of the Board of Education, F, W. Padelford, Executive Secretary.) 
The 1916 report of the board of education of the Northern Baptist 
Convention lists 8 theological seminaries, 24 colleges, and 24 
academies. The colleges and theological seminaries have in all 6,316 
students of college rank, out of a total of 16,898 students and 1,109 
teachers. Land and buildings are valued at $23,248,814 and endow- 
ment at $32,543,541, with an annual income of $3,627,939. The 
academies enrolled 3,520 students and had 287 teachers. The re- 
ported income was $680, 346. 
The board of education was created for the purpose of stimulating 
a deeper interest in education within the Baptist churches, and of so 
developing our schools that we may make a larger contribution to 
the education of the world. Five years of service have now been 
completed by the board. The board was originally authorized by 
the Northern Baptist Convention in session at Chicago, in 1910. The 
year following, however, the board was without funds, and devoted 
itself largely to the question of the reorganization of our educational 
forces. At Des Moines, in 1912, the board was reorganized, fully 
correlated with the American Baptist Education Society, and began 
its active career. 
The board has determined to devote all the energy within its power 
to aid our schools and societies to secure at least the $6,000,000 in 
five years. During this first year our institutions at home have 
added $2,417,222 to their funds, of which $1,116,147 went to the 
University of Chicago and $1,301,075 to 35 other institutions. Our 
missionary societies have added $304,800 to their educational funds. 
This includes a gift of $300,000 from the estate of Mrs. Rockefeller 
to the Woman’s American Baptist Foreign Mission Society. 
The new Iowa College—The most important single event of the 
year has been the adjustment of the Baptist educational situation 
in Iowa. This situation is described in the annual réport as follows: 
The first Baptist school planted in Iowa was founded amid serious differences 
of opinion. These differences have marked the entire history of our work in 
that State and have militated against the development of our institutions. 
Central College was established at Pella, in 1853, and Des Moines College at 
Des Moines, in 1865. Between the friends of these institutions there has been 
a rivalry that has not benefited either. This fact has been universally recog- 
nized and deplored, and many efforts have been made toward readjustment. 
Two years ago, in the spring of 1914, the board of education ventured to 
suggest to the two colleges a possible method of adjustment. The suggestion
-P-A-G-E-453
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES. 425 
was received in a friendly spirit. We have been working on the proposition 
slowly, as the case demanded, with the friends of both colleges, and at last 
the solution has been reached. 
Central College is located in a strong center of the Reformed Church. There 
are three large churches of that denomination in the village of Pella alone, 
while there is only one Baptist Church. The students from the Reformed 
Churches have long outnumbered the Baptist students in the college. These 
people are prosperous and well to do. After studying the problem carefully it 
seemed to us that they were the natural ones to control this college in their 
midst, and we suggested that the trustees should turn the institution over 
to the Reformed Church, many of whose members have long been generous 
supporters of the institution, and several of whom have been members of the 
board. The Baptist members were at first a bit loath to take this step, but its 
reasonableness gradually appealed to them. On November 30, 1915, the board 
of trustees, without a dissenting voice, voted to turn over the entire property, 
including campus, buildings, and equipment, together with $14,000 endowment 
entailed for use at Pella, to the Reformed Church in America. The representa- 
tives of this church have heartily responded to this opportunity, and have gladly 
accepted this great gift. 
After passing this vote the trustees voted to turn over all the balance of 
their funds to the American Baptist Education Society, to be held in trust for 
the Baptist educational interests of Iowa. 
Following the action of the trustees of Central College the trustees of Des 
Moines College voted to transfer all their property and holdings to the Ameri- 
can Baptist Education Society for the same purpose. 
The way is now clear, therefore, to found a new institution upon the assets 
of both of the old colleges. Committees of conference have been appointed to 
find the proper location and to found the new school. 
PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL CHURCH. 
The General Board of Religious Education of the Protestant Epis- 
copal Church, “ canonically established on its present wide basis” in 
1913 for the purpose of unifying and coordinating the church’s edu- 
cational work, has presented a comprehensive report of its aims and 
organization and the plan and scope of its work and its general 
policies and ideals.t. The canon which established the board is as 
follows: 
I. There shall be a general board of religious education, the purpose of which 
shall be the unification and development of the educational work of the church 
under the constitution and canons of the General Convention. 
II. The board shall be composed of the presiding bishop, a general secretary, 
when chosen, and 20 other members who upon the passage of this canon shall 
be appointed by the presiding officers of both houses acting together during 
the meeting of the General Convention of 1913, of whom 12 shall be appointed 
to serve until their successors are appointed at the next General Convention, 
and 1 from each of the eight departments to serve until his successor is chosen 
by his department. Thereafter 12 shall be triennially appointed at the meet- 
  
+“ Church Ideals in Hducation,” issued from the headquarters of the board, 289 
Fourth Avenue, New York City.

ing of the General Convention by the presiding officers of both houses acting 
together. In the appointments, each of the three orders shall be represented. 
The 8 other members shall be elected, 1 by each of the provincial boards of 
religious education at its first regular meeting after the General Convention. 
Each member elected by a provincial board shall serve for three years, or until 
his successor is elected by his provincial board. In case of vacancies occurring 
in the number of members appointed by the presiding officers of the General 
Convention, the general board may elect members to hold office until the next 
meeting of the General Convention. The General Board may add not exceeding 
10 members to its number who shall serve until the next meeting of the General 
Convention. 
III. The presiding bishop shall be ex officio the president of the board. Nine 
members shall constitute a quorum. The board shall choose from within or 
without the board a general secretary, who shall be ex officio a member of the 
board and its executive officer. The board shall elect a secretary and a treas- 
urer. It shall have power to form committees with membership drawn from 
within, and when deemed desirable from without, the board, and shall create 
such agents as its work may demand. 
IV. The general board is authorized to receive gifts and to appeal to each 
diocese and missionary district within the church through its convention or 
council for the funds necessary for carrying on its work efficiently. 
VY. Hach provincial board shall make an annual report of its work to the 
general board, and the general board shall make a triennial report to the Gen- 
eral Convention. 
While the task of the board concerns itself chiefly with religious 
education, its effect upon general educational policy should be con- 
siderable. The report points out that: 
The greatest task in the teaching of religion to-day is to establish a con- 
tinuous interrelation between the home, the parish, the school, the college, and 
the seminary. Each is a stage in the progress of the individual into the fullness 
of religious life. But until each stage hands up a definite contribution to the 
next and builds upon a definite accomplishment of the preceding the process 
is balked, results are lost, and labor is wasted. 
To aviod this, the General Board has four departments devoted to 
Parochial Education, Secondary Education, Collegiate Education, 
and Theological Education. The work of each department is related 
to and developed by a unified plan determined by the action of the 
General Board. 
Regarding educational administration in the dioceses, the report 
says: 
The most pressing need of the church to-day is educational leadership. The 
church is not producing leaders in proportion to her need. In 25 years past the 
communicants of the church have increased by over 100 per cent. In 1890, 
there were 77 candidates for every 100,000 communicants. To-day there are only 
37. Not only are we deficient in general leadership, but the same is true of 
Sunday-school teachers who are also leaders in the parish. In 15 years the 
Sunday-school teachers of the diocese of New York have decreased by 300. 
While volunteer teachers are béing secured for missionary, philanthropic, and 
civic interests, the clergy in general would probably testify that it is more 
difficult than ever to obtain volunteer leaders for educational work.
-P-A-G-E-455
  EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CHURCHES. 427 
Leadership counts all along the line, but primarily in the educational 
processes. Clergy, seminary trained, are coming to the general board to be 
trained as headmasters in parochial education. Men who have caught the vision 
are starting schools for the training of teachers and of lay-workers. Women in 
missions are bestirring themselves.to produce leaders. But still the supply is so 
far behind the demand as almost to stifle effort. A more than average salary, 
writes a rector from Texas, is ready here for a curate who understands educa- 
tion. A bishop seeks in vain for a young man trained to grapple with a college 
situation. A diocese hunts for two years for a man competent to be its educa- 
tional secretary, and then contents itself with making one. The head of a large 
downtown parish asks for some one to make a critical educational valuation of 
his soeial-service work, but there is no available candidate. A parish wants a 
director of parochial education in religion. It takes four months to discover 
the right person—a young woman with training. 
REFORMED CHURCH IN AMERICA, WOMEN’S BOARD OF DOMESTIC 
MISSIONS. 
By Mrs. J. S. Allen, Corresponding Secretary. 
In Jackson County, Ky., the Women’s Board of Domestic Missions 
maintains three schools—at McKee, the county seat, at Gray Hawk, 
and at Annville. 
The academy at McKee has been in operation 10 years, though 
previous to that time some simple educational work had been main- 
tained for 3 years. The school aims to take all its pupils through 
the eighth grade, but the few who are desirous of high-school 
training or normal work are also provided for. A number of the 
graduates of the school are teaching in Jackson or adjacent counties. 
Industrial work is given to both girls and boys. The girls have a 
thorough course in domestic science and receive practical experience 
in the work of maintaining the dormitory and sharing in the cooking, 
bed-room, and laundry work. During the year 1915-16 there were 
150 pupils, with an average daily attendance of 130. Five regular 
teachers are employed. besides the matron and such helpers as are 
needed. The physical equipment consists of a good-sized school 
building, a small house, or dormitory, and a larger building just 
nearing completion. 
In response to the urgent request of parents at Gray Hawk, where 
the board has hitherto maintained a Christian social settlement and 
a hospital, a primary school was opened in the fall of 1915 in con- 
nection with the church. There were 41 pupils enrolled, in charge 
of one teacher, and the work covered four grades. The school has 
been enlarged for the 1916-17 session and another teacher employed. 
The most comprehensive educational work of the board in Jack- 
son County is conducted at Annville. Here there is a well-equipped 
experimental farm with a herd of cattle, a canning plant for fruit
-P-A-G-E-456
    
428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
and vegetables, a building for industrial work, a blacksmith and 
wagon-building shop for the use of students, an excellent dormitory 
for boys and also one for girls, and a large school building. There 
was a total enrollment of 347 in 1915-16, with a large waiting list. 
The regular academic course is through the eighth grade, and 20 
pupils graduated from that grade in 1916. Those desiring it as at 
McKee received the advanced course and are fitted to teach. Occa- 
sionally pupils are sent to some of the southern colleges. Eight regu- 
lar teachers are employed besides matrons, helpers, farm instructors, 
wagon makers, and head workers. 
Indian work.—Pending the building of a primary school and dor- 
mitories, which are under way on the Winnebago Indian reservation 
in Nebraska, the board last year provided for the education of 20 
children at Santee, Nebr. This year the primary children will be 
cared for at the board’s own station and scholarships will be pro- 
vided for the more advanced at the Santee school.

CHAPTER XXVI. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK IN THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRIS- 
TIAN ASSOCIATION. 
By Gro. B. Hoper, 
Educational Secretary, Young Men’s Christian Association, 
STATISTICS, 
While the Young Men’s Christian Associations have expended a 
total of $1,143,086, an increase of $72,186 over the year previous, 
the tuition fees paid by the students have amounted to $940,912, an 
increase of $126,888, in addition to the $250,000 paid by these men | 
in membership fees. Table 1 gives some data concerning this expense 
in the larger cities.

The number of students within the association buildings has in- 
creased by 5,470 over the previous year, to 66,588; reports show, how- 
ever, that the number of students in extension classes outside the 
building has decreased nearly 7,000, to 15,777. This makes a total 
of 82,358 different students, as against 83,771a year ago. Experience 
429  
-P-A-G-E-458
    430 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
shows that, other things being equal, the most substantial extension 
work can be done only when there is a strong, virile, and successful 
work overflowing from the association building. The tables and 
charts scattered through this report are self-explanatory. 
THE EDUCATIONAL SECRETARIES. 
There are 84 different Young Men’s Christian Associations in 
each of which there is a senior educational secretary giving his entire 
time to promoting appropriate educational facilities. In a few of 
these 84 associations there are from 2 to 15 additional men (51 in all) 
giving their full time as heads of departments, teachers, and leaders 
in the educational activities conducted by the associations. These 
135 men, 84 secretaries and 51 others, giving full time to this work 
in the association, received a total of $211,000 in salaries the past 
year, about the same amount for supervision as for each of the past 
two years. 
The majority of the educational secretaries in the United States, 
in their conference and correspondence, have seemed to stress their 
efforts on a few semiprofessional courses promoted largely by outside 
agencies for the more mature men and those able to pay high tuition 
fees. The fear has been expressed in several parts of the country 
that this special emphasis, while good in itself, has often been made 
at the expense of promoting the equally important, but more elemen- 
tary and far more needed, subjects and courses for the many times 
larger body of employed men and boys who are unable to pay large 
tuition fees. : 
The purpose of the Young Men’s Christian Association in promot- 
ing educational facilities is to help meet some of the vocational re- 
quirements of our present day civilization and at the same time 
develop Christian manhood. All forms of effort, whether by indi- 
viduals, by clubs, by the church, or by the Young Men’s Christian 
Association, find opportunity to encourage and supplement the work 
of the public schools. Experience shows that the association, with 
its distinct objective, can teach mechanical drawing or any other one 
of its 200 subjects or courses, to employed men and at the same time 
build that kind of character which makes nobler men and better 
citizens.

SCOPE OF ASSOCIATION ACTIVITIES. 
The scope of association educational activities includes reading 
rooms and libraries, lectures and talks, educational clubs, class-lecture 
series, evening classes, association day schools, boys summer schools, 
extension features, English for foreigners, special courses, boys’ de- 
partments, and annual examination in the fundamental subjects. 
Reading room and libraries—About a half million males took 
advantage of reading room and library privileges during the year.

Class lecture series—There is an increasing number of profes- 
sional and semiprofessional courses for mature men, forming a kind 
of university extension work. The sessions are closely related in a 
series under one leader, and include quizzes and often written exami- 
nations. They differ from the regular class work in that the instruc- 
tion is largely by the lecture method supplemented by quiz, the same 
as in college or university. The subjects include those of advertis- 
ing, salesmanship, credits, efliciency, memory training, and the like. 
Over 10,000 business and college men are students in such courses. 
It is thus seen that while the Young Men’s Christian Association has 
over 25,000 students in the elementary subjects, including the three 
R’s, it also has thousands of mature college men in these higher 
courses. Table 5 gives the places reporting such work where there 
are over 50 students each.

Evening classes.—Association evening classes include commercial, 
industrial, academic, language, technical, trade, and high-school sub- 
jects, in addition to the three R’s. The courses usually run during 
a term of from 25 sessions to 80 or 100 sessions, depending upon the 
length of the course and the number of sessions per week. - Students 
pay tuition fees varying from $1 to $50 or more per season, depend- 
ing upon the nature and length of the course and the expense of 
operation. In the elementary subjects and the three R’s, little or 
no charge is made. There is therefore a constant deficit to the asso- 
ciation in teaching these very necessary and much-needed subjects. 
The age of students ranges from about 14 to 56. There are many 
courses for men who earn from $1 a day down to nothing, and there 
are other courses for men earning from $5 to $25 or more per day. 
These latter men naturally pay the higher tuition fees. About 3,700 
teachers, 2,800 of whom are paid, are engaged in this teaching 
service for the 75,000 men in these evening classes, and nearly 3,000 
others are volunteer leaders serving in clubs, giving practical talks, 
or helping in the library, reading room, or classes. The total amount 
paid these teachers last year was about $430,000. Table 6 shows the 
associations reporting over 500 students each.

Association day schools—While the number of students in such 
association schools is no larger than a year ago, yet there has been a 
distinct improvement in the quality of work done. Experience shows 
that there is an increasing opportunity for the association to sup- 
plement wisely and appropriately the work of other institutions by 
conducting these day schools for boys. Table 7 shows the associa- 
tions reporting such work with 50 or more students. The students 
pay from $8 to $12 tuition fee per month, depending on the courses 
taken. The school hours run from 8.30 a. m. to either 2 or 4 p. m., 
with appropriate physical, recreational, and vocational training 
combined. From observation thus far it would seem that each 
association, in a building of its own and in a community of more 
than 5,000 males between 12 and 25 years of age, would have ample 
opportunity to conduct its own association day school. These day 
schools help serve employed men and boys who are not accommo- 
dated in the evening schools; they help meet a demand not yet sup- 
plied by public or other day schools which do not afford the addi- 
tional privileges offered by the association. They utilize more fully 
the association capital invested in space, equipment, and supervi- 
sion; they economize operation, supervision, the teaching force, ad- 
vertising, and the prestige of the evening educational work; they 
provide for more intensive and adaptable study of special subjects 
than is possible in many other places; they provide for those who 
have physically outgrown their grades, or who for other reasons 
are not successfully served in the public school. They meet the 
desire of parents who wish appropriate training for their boys under 
auspices which are permeated by the Christian spirit of the 
association.

The expense of these day schools last year, with their 7,283 stu- 
dents, was $235,663, covered by the tuition of students. Boys who 
have prepared for college and university in the association day 
schools are found doing creditable work in Harvard, Columbia, 
Yale, Chicago, and many of the western universities. At least two 
very promising day schools are now being organized in Greater New 
York, and the number of ‘associations entering this rare field of 
opportunity will steadily increase for the next few years. 
Boys’ summer schools—In many cities where public schools are 
closed during July and August the association finds a field of op- 
portunity. Table 8 gives the places conducting such schools during 
the summer of 1915.

Extension features—Over 100 associations conduct educational 
privileges in various centers of the city, more or less remote from 
the headquarters. These features include educational clubs, practical 
talks, and much elementary class work. While helpful to a large 
extent, this service can not receive that same kind of needed super- 
vision as the work conducted in the association building. Associa- 
tions therefore are urged first to make sure that the work conducted 
in the building is just as good as it can possibly be made in quality 
and service, before they spend much energy in the necessarily more 
superficial work conducted outside. Often, however, such privileges 
in a needy section of the city develop into a successful mission at which 
a branch of the association is later formed. To make such work 
effective and worthy the name of Young Men’s Christian Association, 
it must be given that same kind of careful thought, energy, time, and 
effort which is given similar work in the association building. 
English for foreigners—During recent years a larger number of 
the associations have been specializing on teaching of English and 
elementary citizenship to men and boys from foreign nations. 
~ About 18,000 men and boys the past year have been enrolled in these 
special classes. The method most successfully used is that of Dr. 
Peter Roberts, the secretary of the international committee for this 
special work. 
Special. courses—Dr. E, E. Brown, former United States Commis- 
sioner of Education, said: “ The Young Men’s Christian Association is 
one of the best pioneer educational agencies in America, blazing.the 
way for public schools and others to follow.” It strives to meet new 
needs with new and adapted courses. These new needs are forced 
upon the attention of the association every time a new vocation or 
eccupation is named, which is about every few months. The number 
of students in the 20 or more pioneer courses of this kind is steadily 
increasing. The first poultry school for boys was born in 1908.

  438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
“The first photoplay writing school and also the correlated school for 
operators of motion-picture machines was born in the association in 
1911; the first window-trimming school, in 1905; the first auto. 
school for men in 1900, and the first auto school for women in 1915. 
Boys’ departments——The definite attention given to meeting the 
needs of employed boys has not kept pace with the effort to provide 
special and semiprofessional courses for mature men. Two reasons 
have been given for this disparity of effort. First, the public schools 
are making heroic effort to help meet the fundamental demands in 
the three R’s among boys; and second, the associations can raise more 
money in tuition fees among men of means than they can among boys.

Examinations —The committee has conducted annual examinations 
in the fundamental subjects for many years. The past year about 
4,000 men took part in such tests. These examinations, while not 
compulsory on the part of either individuals or of the local associa- 
tions, materially help teachers and students to compare their work 
with that of students in similar work for the country. Friends of 
boys offer incentives to encourage such examinations. Table 10 
shows the roll of honor for 1916:

CHAPTER XXVII. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE BOY SCOUTS, GIRL 
SCOUTS, AND CAMPFIRE GIRLS. 
BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA. 
By James BE. West, Chief Scout Executive. 
The Boy Scout movement aims to reinforce all of the agencies 
which make for right living and character development in the youth 
of America. It does not seek to supersede the home, church, or 
school, but to supplement these institutions, largely in the leisure 
time of the boy; and to impart by means of its own programs and 
exercises the virtues of chivalry, honor, and good citizenship. The 
character-building work of the movement is presented to boys in 
what is meant to be an “attractive wrapping.” It is based largely 
on the method of learning by doing, in order that boys may be 
taught to be resourceful and self-reliant in all situations in which 
they may be placed. 
The movement is nonsectarian and nonpolitical. Its program 
offers to the boy a well-rounded mental, physical, and moral expe- 
rience, largely out-of-doors, and calculated to develop a love of 
country, God, and neighbor. For its success the movement depends 
upon the voluntary leadership of men of high ideals, who serve as 
scout masters and scout commissioners. The educational aspect of 
the work is emphasized by the fact that of the 7,067 men who held 
commissions as scout masters on December 31 last, about 65 per cent 
are college men and over 80 per cent have either a high-school or a 
college education; 1,655 give their occupation as clergymen and 790 
as public-school teachers; others ‘are professional men, journalists, 
students, or engaged in mechanical or mercantile pursuits. In prac- 
tically every one of the 350 chartered councils the public schools are 
definitely represented through the service of the school superintendent 
on the executive board, and in many cases the school superintendent 
serves as president of the council. 
A boy is first known as a “tenderfoot,” and then becomes a “ sec- 
ond-class,” and later a “first-class scout.” A first-class scout is 
eligible to merit badges in 58 different subjects, and may thus carry 
on his scout training under the supervision of this movement. From 
441
-P-A-G-E-470
  442 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
February, 1911, to September of the present year, 39,176 merit badges 
have been awarded. 
To obtain a merit badge for personal health a scout must: 
1. Write a statement on the care of the teeth and show that his teeth are in 
good condition as a result of proper care. 
2. State a principle to govern in eating, and state in the order of their im- 
.portance five rules to govern the care of his health. 
3. Present satisfactory evidence that he has not been absent from school or work 
for a period of at least six months as a result of his failure to observe these 
rules. 
4. Tell the difference in effect of a cold bath and a hot bath. 
5. Describe the effects of alcohol and tobacco on the growing boy. 
. Tell how to care for the feet on a march. 
Describe a good healthful game, and state its merits. 
. Describe the effects of walking as an exercise. 
9. Tell the dangers of overtraining in the various forms of athletics, and the 
advantages of specialization and an all-around development. No ~ 
Among other tests are: 
SCHOLARSHIP. 
To obtain a merit badge for scholarship, a scout must— 
1. Have been in attendance at one school—grammar, high, private, or night 
school—for a period of at least one year since becoming a first-class scout. 
2. Present a certificate from the teacher or principal covering the same period 
and showing— : 
(a) That his attendance has been satisfactory ; 
(bv) That his deportment has been above the average; 
(c) That during the school year he has secured a satisfactory average in 
all of his studies. 
PUBLIC HEALTH. 
To obtain a merit badge for public health, a scout must— 
1. State the chief Causes and modes of transmission of each of the following 
diseases: Tuberculosis, typhoid, malaria. 
2. Draw a diagram showing how the house fly carries disease. 
8. Tell what should be done to a house which has been occupied by a person 
who has had a contagious disease. 
4. Describe the method used in his community in disposing of garbage. 
5. Tell how a city should protect its milk, meat, and exposed foods. State 
what are the laws in his community covering this subject, and to what extent 
they are being enforced. 
6. Tell how he may cooperate with the health authorities in preventing 
disease. 
7. Tell how to plan the sanitary care of a camp. 
8. State the reason why school children should undergo a medical exami- 
nation. 
9. Produce satisfactory evidence that he has rendered service in some effort 
recommended by the public health authorities in the interest of public health. 
From September, 1915, to September, 1916, the following are the 
number of merit badges won in the various subjects: 
1Those marked with a star are considered especially educational.

During the year 1915, 11,978 merit badges were awarded. To Sep- 
tember 1 of this year, 9,189 have been awarded. 
The reading program of the Boy Scouts is a very large factor in the 
educational development of the work. It may be subdivided into two 
parts: (1) The magazine called “ Boys’ Life,” published monthly, and 
(2) the book department. 
Boys’ Life is designed to give to scouts the best possible in stirring 
fiction. It seeks to portray boy life as it is with its natural and 
proper problems, pleasures, and excitement, discreetly casting a 
romance about the little things that are called commonplace, inter- 
preting them in their powerful, but often forgotten relation to the 
boy and his destiny, and making boys happy; meanwhile keeping the 
stories clear of inaccuracies of fact, clear of those thrills that are 
degrading, and inspiring to higher aims and better effort. The 
“Lonesome Corner” of the magazine has developed a field whereby 
at the present time from three to five hundred letters are exchanged 
monthly through the editorial office between scouts in different States 
and countries, developing an educational benefit and the formation 
of friendships which is doing immeasurable good and bringing about 
a better international understanding, mutual appreciation, and good 
will. 
The book department was organized to guard against the presenta- 
tion to boys of stories too sensational, either because of gross exagger- 
ation, or because of low standards of moralities, not to speak of 
immoralities or heroes unworthy either because of their low ideals or 
 
-P-A-G-E-472
  444 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
because their life is not purposeful, not full of the right sort of 
ambition to make the most of themselves. The department is under

Last year the following resolutions were passed by the American 
Booksellers’ Association : : 
Resolved, That the association approve the suggestion of the Boy Scouts of 
America for a country-wide canvass for better books for children, both by the 
cooperation of a special week in November and by an offer on our part to 
raise the standard of children’s reading, as offered by our stores and by the 
publishers. 
and by the Council of the American Library Association : 
Resolved, That the Council of the American Library Association welcomes the 
aid of the library commission of the Boy Scouts of America in its efforts to 
improve the reading taste of the boys of the country; that the council of this 
association approves the plans of the library commission of the Boy Scouts for 
a week, when by vote of the American Booksellers’ Association, the retail book 
trade shall place special emphasis on juvenile books, and that the council of this 
association commends this plan, as announced by the Boy Scouts of America, to 
the favorable consideration of the public librarians of the country. 
From November 28 to December 4, 1915, the “ Safety First Juvenile 
Book Week” was nationally observed. That the propaganda might 
be constructive a list of “ Books boys like best” was prepared. The 
selection of 300 such books was made from over 1,000 volumes and 
divided into “ Stories of adventure,” “ What and how to do books,” 
and “ Books of information.” This list was first published October 
23, 1915, in the “ Publishers’ Weekly.” Thirteen thousand copies of 
the list were purchased by 31 booksellers, who represented by location 
every part of the country. Thirteen thousand copies were also pur- 
chased with special imprint by 42 librarians. 
Since the incorporation of the movement in 1911, 665,900 copies of 
the Boy Scout Handbook have been sold in this country, 115,000 
copies of them during the past year. Scout training courses have 
been developed at Columbia University, University of Virginia, 
University of California, University of Texas, University of Pitts- 
burgh, Boston University, University of Wisconsin, Culver Military 
Academy, and in various schools. The East Greenwich Academy, 
Rhode Island, and the Fleet School of North Carolina have at 
various times offered scholarships in scouting. An educational de- 
partment under the supervision of Dr. Jeremiah W. Jenks, New York

University, Dr. James E. Russell, dean of Teachers’ College, Colum- 
bia University, and Dr. Norman E. Richardson, of Boston Uni- 
versity, together with two or three other men to be appointed, who 
are actively connected with institutions of learning in the vicinity of 
New York, is in process of development. The activity and scope of 
this department as presented by the committee is as follows: 
(1) Keep constantly before ‘scoutmasters and others actively engaged in 
scouting helpful information and definite programs of practical assistance. 
(2) Prepare and secure publications of articles explaining the scout move- 
ment, with a view to encouraging formation of troops and of securing volun- 
teer service and financial support. : 
(3) Arrange for exhibits and personal appeals before various student bodies, 
educational and religious conventions and conferences, for men to serve as 
scoutmasters. 
(4) Arrange for a course of reading or training courses for men who, in 
this way, volunteer to take up scout work at some future time. 
(5) Develop plans, programs, and suggestions for boys’ camps, with the hope 
that if finances permit, a man should be appointed to give all his time as 
national camp director. 
A notable development in the recognition of scouting by educa- 
tional authorities is the raising of the Pingree Memorial Fund of 
$10,000 for the department of scout training in the Boston Uni- 
versity. This course is now in operation, with Prof. Norman E. 
Richardson and Scout Commissioner Ormond E. Loomis as the 
lecturers. 
The University of Texas grants annually two scholarships to 
“Eagle Scouts” in each community in the State which works under 
a local council of the Boy Scouts of America. Eagle Scouts are 
first-class scouts who have passed the merit badge tests in athletics 
or physical development, camping, civics, cooking, first aid, life 
saving, path finding, personal health, pioneering, public health, bird 
study, and any 10 others. 
It is significant to note the attitude of educators toward scouting. 
As the scout program and methods of work are becoming better 
known, teachers in the public-school system throughout the country 
are using it more and more in connection with school work. Numer- 
ous troops have been organized by school principals. The board of 
education at Paris, Ill., has provided for the organization of a troop 
of scouts in every grammar and high school. Arrangements have 
been made whereby boy scouts can be given school credits for scout 
achievements. In Waco, Tex., scouting was found so beneficial to 
school discipline’ and esprit de corps that the superintendent of 
schools requested all boy scouts to wear their uniforms at all sessions. 
Dr. Charles W. Eliot, president emeritus of Harvard, says: “'The 
Boy Scout Movement is setting an example that our whole public- 
school system ought to follow.” Dr. James E. Russell, dean of 
 
-P-A-G-E-474

Teachers’ College, Columbia University, says: “I regard the scout 
movement as one of the most valuable educational agencies of this 
generation.” 
GIRL SCOUTS. 
By Monracur Gammon, Haecutive Secretary. 
ORIGIN. 
The plan of the girl scouts had its origin when 6,000 English girls 
applied for admission to the ranks of the boy scouts in England. 
Sir Robert Baden-Powell requested his sister to found a similar 
organization for girls and the Girl Guides was the result. Mrs. 
Juliette Low, a native of Savannah, Ga., then living in England, be- 
came active in promoting the Girl Guides. She organized and 
directed her own troop. So delighted was Mrs. Low with the result 
of this work in England that she conceived the idea of transplanting 
the movement to her native America. Accordingly, troops were 
formed in Savannah, Ga., in March, 1912. 
The movement has grown in a wholesome and normal way from the 
small beginning in Savannah to a national organization with troops 
in 250 communities. In 1915 a national conventior. was held and the 
business put in the hands of a national council. The executive com- 
mittee is now composed of the following officers: National president, 
Mrs. Juliette Low; vice president, Mrs. Arthur Osgood Choate; 
national commissioner, Mrs. Theodore H. Price; deputy commis- 
sioner, Mrs. Snowden Marshall; treasurer, Edward H. Coy. The 
organization is incorporated, and national headquarters are main- 
tained at 17 West Forty-second Street, New York City. 
AIMS. 
The Girl Scout program, presenting all of its activities in group 
work, preeminently fills a distinct need in the equipment of women 
for modern life. 
In its requirements for the three grades of scouting and for the 
proficiency badges the organization is emphasizing the home-making 
occupations and virtues. Nursing and first aid occupy a prominent 
place in the training. 
The motto “Be prepared” summarizes the plan. This means that 
plans shall be made in advance and that Girl Scouts shall be equipped 
with the proper tools, materials, and abilities for all eventualities that 
can be foreseen. They are to keep themselves in trim with a trained 
and vigorous body, an active mind, a happy heart, and devotion to 
the right, ready to do their duty to themselves and to the world. It
-P-A-G-E-475
  
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CAMPFIRE GIRLS. 447 
means, further, a distinct mental attitude, a philosophy of life, a feel- 
ing that, having lived worthily, they are masters when they come to 
the hard places in life’s path. 
Scouting meets the demand of nature for play and playtime and 
seeks to convert the use of this part of man’s nature and time to 
character building and to sweetening the springs of life. The girl 
problem or the boy problem is inherently a leisure-time problem. 
Scouting has proved a powerful auxiliary to the church, school, and 
playground in meeting this difficulty. The ideals and activities of 
scouting capture the hearts of young people. It meets an appeal of 
their natures for companionship and for jolly times that contribute 
to the good of life. 
ORGANIZATION. 
There are three grades of scouts. To become a “tenderfoot,” the 
girl must be 10 years old, know the 10 scout laws, how to tie four 
specified knots, the name of the governor of her State and mayor of 
her city, the history of the flag and how to fly it. More difficult tests 
are applied for admission to the second and first class grades. 
After a girl is a “second-class scout,” she becomes eligible for pro- 
ficiency tests in one or more of the following subjects as she may elect: 
First aid, artist, athlete, attendance, automobile driver, aviator, bird 
study, boatswain, child nurse, clerk, civics, cook, invalid cook, dairy 
maid, electrician, farmer, gardener, personal health, public health, 
horsemanship, home nursing, housekeeper, interpreter, laundress, 
marksmanship, musician, naturalist, pathfinder, pioneer, photog- 
rapher, scribe, signaler, swimmer, telegrapher. 
The program of the weekly meetings consists of study and practice 
of the scout teachings and of recreation. The games and athletics 
are adapted to the physiological possibilities of women. At the pres- 
ent time there are 303 registered captains and troops, and approxi- 
mately 6,000 registered girl scouts. 
While the Girl Scouts organization is nonsectarian, it is distinctly 
religious. Each girl is expected to live up to the tenets of her par- 
ticular church. She can not be a good scout unless she is faithful to 
her own religion. 
CAMPFIRE GIRLS. 
By Mrs. Cecerta Farwe tt, Editor of “ Wohelo.” 
Camp Fire has a system of honor giving, based upon seven crafts: 
Home craft, health craft, camp craft, hand craft, nature lore, busi- 
ness, patriotism. Honors are given in the form of beads, a different 
color for each craft. These honors are conferred at the ceremonial 
meeting of the group, which is called a “council fire.” A girl re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
  448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
ports what she has done, and, whenever possible, submits for in- 
spection of the group the thing for which the honor is claimed. 
When the work has been done in the home and is of such nature that 
it can not be brought into the council fire, the girl presents a state- 
ment from her mother. (Thisis optional in some camps; some guard- 
ians prefer the mother’s statement, and others accept the detailed 
account from the girl). The beads which are won in this way are 
strung together in any fashion the fancy of the girl may dictate, and 
worn as a part of her ceremonial costume. Girls become very en- 
thusiastic in winning these beads, and their honor string is shown 
with pride at council meetings, and every addition to it is treasured. 
Mothers cooperate heartily in helping the girls to win the honor 
beads, and show special appreciation of new additions to their honor 
string. As in many cases honors are given for things which girls do 
not know how to do, and must first be taught, mothers are en- 
couraged to give special instruction, that the work for which the 
honor is won may be as well done as possible. 
Group teaching by mothers has been found to be the most effective 
way of working out this plan. For example, one mother who is 
especially good in making bread, will invite all the girls of a group 
to her home on Saturday and teach them how to make bread, while 
another, who excels in sewing, or some other form of home craft, will 
take them into her home for the next meeting. 
This not only interests the girls, but it teaches domestic science and 
home making more effectively than in many schools. It is an incen- 
tive and spur to the mothers, brings the, mothers and daughters into 
closer understanding and cooperation, and gives the girls a new re- 
spect and pride in their own mothers—a feature of the work of great 
importance, for it tends to community improvement in that each 
mother is spurred to have her own home and her own work appear 
to the best advantage. Girls also learn home arrangement and 
management by going into different homes and seeing how work is 
done. 
While mothers are encouraged to cooperate in the winning of 
honors, the honors are actually awarded in the council fire in the 
presence of the group. This is one of the secrets of the success of 
Camp Fire. Each girl knows how difficult it is to do simple home 
tasks which to an adult appear merely in the light of duty. The 
girl who “hates to wash dishes” appreciates the fact that the other 
girl who stands in her place and receives an honor bead for having 
“washed and wiped dishes and left the dining room in order after 
one meal a day for two months” has won her bead through real 
effort. The girl who receives the bead knows that her mates appre- 
ciate how hard it was to win it, and the bead has a very real value
-P-A-G-E-477
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE CAMPFIRE GIRLS. 449 
to her because of this fact. The honor is awarded not by an adult 
who feels that the girl has only done her duty, but by her mates, all 
of whom are in sympathy with her. 
Many letters are received from mothers showing how this affects 
the girl’s attitude toward her home work: 
Mary no longer needs suggestions about the work of her room. She airs 
and makes her bed and does many other things she would not have attempted 
except for the stimulus of earning a bead. 
The spirit of Camp Fire has been introduced into our home through Eliza- 
beth’s membership. She wants to do things which before were hateful and 
unpleasant to her, and does them not only carefully but cheerfully. 
Honors are given in Camp Fire for other things than home craft, 
but all of these honors work indirectly toward giving the girls 
interest in home making and fit them to be better wives and better 
mothers.

  CHAPTER XXVIII. 
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSO- 
CIATIONS. 
By Henry R. Evans, 
Editorial Division, Bureau of Education. 
I. EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 
GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD. 
Increased taxation for better schools, despite the financial depres- 
- sion in many districts of the South, and “ perceptible improvement” 
in the Negro rural schools are emphasized in the report of the Gen- 
eral Education Board for 1914-15. 
Despite differences in local conditions, —ecessitating more or less variety of 
effort in different States, the Southern States are consciously working toward a 
single goal—an adequately organized, financed, administered, supervised, and 
manned State system of education. 
The most important advance in State orgnaization during the past year was 
made in Tennessee, where a long stride has been taken toward freeing education 
from politics. Hardly less important is the recent Alabama statute reconstruct- 
ing the county board of education. 
Attention may be called to the favorable action of the General Education 
Board on a request from the State superintendent of Mi: ippi for funds with 
which to initiate a model organization in a single Mi ppi county. It was 
pointed out that if the present county appropriations were supplemented, great 
improvements capable of general introduction could be effected. The board ap- 
propriated $3,000 for the purpose. 
The year just passed has been a severe one on the financial side; yet in no 
State have backward steps been taken in the matter of taxation. The cam- 
paign for increased funds goes on, despite business depression.   
   
  The board has determined to enter the arena of educational re- 
search, and proposes, by means of agents— 
to aid promising workers in the investigation of problems in educational 
theory and practice. It will undertake, from time to time, to make possible 
the preparation of scientific monographs, dealing with questions of educational 
policy and experience. 
The board will prosecute to completion the experiments in the 
technique of handwriting and reading made by Dr. C. H. Judd, of 
the University of Chicago. A study of the schools of Gary, Ind., 
451 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
  452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
will be undertaken, and a handbook prepared to assist academic ac- 
countants to solve their difficulties. 
According to the report of the treasurer made to the Secretary of 
the Interior, the financial operations of the board for the year ending 
June 30, 1916, were as follows: 
The income of the Rockefeller fund for the year was $2,065,736.42; the bal- 
ance from the previous year was $6,213,055.99, making a total of $8,278,792.41 
available for disbursement. The sum of $1,012,368.75 was disbursed, leaving a 
balance of $7,266,423.66 divided as follows: Balance payable on appropriations, 
$6,511,006.52 ; amount available for appropriation $755,417.04. Between June 30 
and November 1, inclusive, the sum of $1,036,582.96 will be collected, making the 
amount available for the appropriation at the October meeting, $1,792,000. 
It should be noted that in all previous reports, income which had accrued but 
which was not receivable until later dates was included in the amount available 
for appropriation. The figures here given include only income actually col- 
Jected. Because of this change, income for the year was reduced by $502,480.54. 
The statement of appropriations of the Rockefeller fund for the 
year is as follows:

In addition to the foregoing, the sum of $8,637.51 was appropriated 
from the income of the Anna T. Jeanes fund and $50,000 from the 
principal of the Laura S. Rockefeller fund. 
CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING. 
The tenth annual report of the president and treasurer of the 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching presents a 
statement of the usual current business for the year ending Sep- 
tember 30, 1915, a discussion of problems relating to professional 
education, pensions for teachers, and the treasurer’s report of income, 
expenditure, and endowment. The report shows a total endowment
-P-A-G-E-481
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 453 
of $14,250,000, an accumulated surplus of $1,255,000, and an annual 
expenditure of $766,000. Of this, $37,000 was spent in administra- 
tion, $55,000 in educational inquiry, and $674,000 in retiring allow- 
ances and pensions. During the year 23 retiring allowances and 
20 widows’ pensions were granted, the average grant being $1,550. 
The total number of allowances now in force is 327, the total number 
of widows’ pensions 118, the general average being $1,552. The 
total number of allowances granted since the beginning of the foun- 
dation is 639, the total expenditure for this purpose having been 
$4,225,000. 
The division of educational inquiry announces that 10 reports and 
8 bulletins, a total of approximately 3,000 pages, have been pub- 
lished. Of these publications, some 200,000 copies have been dis- 
tributed free of charge. Progress has been made in the three com- 
prehensive studies undertaken by the foundation, viz, legal education, 
engineering education, and the training of teachers. The principal 
event of the past year in the study of legal education was the publi- 
cation of the special report by Prof. Redlich, of Vienna, entitled 
“The common law and the case method in American university law 
schools.” The report presents a carefully compiled list of law schools 
in the United States.* 
An attempt is made to correlate legal education with the conditions 
that it has to meet and with the general trend in the United States, 
extending over a long term of years, to better both the schools and 
these fundamental conditions. Detailed information has been col- 
lected regarding requirements for admission to the bar in all the 
States. 
The study of engineering education, undertaken at the request of 
a joint committee representing the six national engineering societies 
and which has heen carried on with the cooperation of these organi- 
zations, is nearing completion.2 The report further presents a 
résumé of the legislative results of the foundation’s investigation 
of education in Vermont and a study of the training of teachers in 
Missouri, undertaken at the request of the educational authorities 
of that State. An educational census of 18,000 teachers of Missouri 
was made. College charges for tuition by representative universi- 
ties and colleges of the United States is another topic treated. In 
summarizing the data collected the report states that the tuition 
charges of representative institutions have increased during the last 
10 years from about $80 to about $100 a year, and that the tendency 
to advance fees is increasing, along with the tendency to group all

of the charges of whatever kind in an inclusive fee based upon the 
amount of instruction that is taken. 
The development of pensions for public-school teachers and univer- 
sity professors is discussed at length; also industrial and institutional 
pensions. An elaborate tabular statement of teachers’ pension 
systems is presented. 
“A comprehensive plan of insurance and annuities for college 
teachers,” issued originally as a confidential document and after- 
wards given to the public, expresses the opinion that the present 
pension system of the foundation, together with other teachers’ pen- 
sion systems in the country, is unsound.* 
RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION. 
During the past year the efforts of the division of education of 
the Russell Sage Foundation have been mainly devoted to the con- 
duct of the educational survey of Cleveland, Ohio. This survey was 
conducted under the auspices of the Cleveland Foundation, which 
financed the work, and it was carried through under the direction 
of Dr. Ayres. In four significant characteristics the Cleveland 
Educational Survey departed from the methods that have been fol- 
lowed in previous studies of city school systems. The first of these 
is the extent and thoroughness to which it applied tests and meas- 
urements; the second, its method of submitting its findings to the 
local school authorities before publication; the third, the printing of 
its reports in a series of small monographs instead of in one large 
volume; and the fourth, the unusual efforts that were made to inform 
the public of the progress of the work while the investigations were 
under way. | 
In some respects the Cleveland survey is the most costly and ex- 
tensive study of this character that has been carried through. The 
work began in the spring of 1915 and continued for some 14 months. 
The cost was more than $40,000, and 25 specialists were engaged in 
the work. Several of these specialists were members of the regular 
staff of the Russell Sage Foundation. 
In the application of tests and measurements to the study of edu- 
cational processes and products, the Cleveland inquiries have been 
more extensive than those previously conducted elsewhere. The 
number of printed forms and blanks used exceeded 250,000. The 
number of individual spellings in the spelling tests exceeded 
2,000,000; in the measurements of arithmetical ability the children 
of the Cleveland classes solved more than 3,000,000 problems; the 
tests of oral and silent reading were nearly 200,000 in number; and 
careful measurements were made of the speed and quality of some   
1See Ch. VIII, Higher Education.
-P-A-G-E-483
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS. 455 
30,000 samples of handwriting. Other studies were carried through 
on a similarly extensive scale. Progress records were secured for 
75,000 children, and in connection with the study of immigration 
individual information was secured from 84,000 pupils. All the 
schools in the city were visited and written reports were made on 
more than 1,500 classroom exercises. 
During the conduct of the work persistent efforts were made to 
cooperate with the school authorities and to inform the public con- 
cerning the progress of the studies. As reports were prepared on 
each phase of the educational problems of the city, they were mimeo- 
graphed and submitted to the superintendent of schools and the 
other educational officials most directly concerned, to members of 
the board of education, and to members of the local advisory com- 
mittees. After sufficient time had elapsed to permit of a careful 
study of these reports, they were considered and discussed at a series 
of private meetings. These conferences resulted in clearing up 
many questions of fact and form in the tentative drafts of the 
reports and brought about many changes and corrections. 
The division of education of the Russell Sage Foundation exists 
for the purpose of carrying on educational research on behalf of the 
children of the public schools. The work of the division is largely 
devoted to the study and development of scientific tests and measure- 
ments, to problems of school hygiene, and to problems of educa- 
tional administration. The division publishes a series of reports in 
monograph form and sells them at prices sufficient to cover the cost 
of publication. It also has sets of lantern slides which it lends for 
use at lectures. 
II. EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS.* 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The fifty-fourth annual convention of the National Education 
Association was held in New York City July 1-8, 1916. The larger 
and less technical subjects were discussed in the general sessions 
which took place in the afternoon and evening in the Madison Square 
Garden; the more special problems of education were treated in 
department meetings held in the various schools and educational 
institutions of the city. In addition, meetings of several associations 
more or less affiliated with the work of the association were held, such 
as the American School Peace League, the Association for the Wider 
Use of Schoolhouses, the Modern Language Conference, the Ameri- 
can School Hygiene. Association, etc. Particular emphasis was laid   
1 Accounts of other educational meetings are given in special chapters. A complete list 
of educational associations, National and State, will be found in the Hducational Directory 
for 1916-17.
-P-A-G-E-484
  
  456 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
on social questions connected with education. David B. Johnson, in 
his presidential address on “'The rural home and the farm woman,” 
declared that the rural educational problem is wrapped up with the 
rural home and community problem. 
Dr. P. P. Claxton, United States Commissioner of Education, 
delivered an address on “A national program of education,” in which 
he declared that the time is fast approaching when stock should be 
taken of the multiplied and diversified educational agencies in the 
United States, so that some comprehensive policy can be adopted that 
will govern the administration of schools and colleges and univer- 
sities. He expressed the desire that it might be possible to conduct a 
sort of educational experiment station where the new things in 
teaching might be examined and tested and the results given to the 
world. He also urged the establishment of a national university. 
James W. Crabtree, president of the State Normal School of Wis- 
consin, emphasized the necessity for a teachers’ training department 
in connection with a national university. 
A Federal University of Commerce was advocated by Dr. Glen 
Levin Swiggett, assistant secretary general of the Second Pan-Ameri- 
can Scientific Congress, at Washington, in his talk on “ Educational 
preparation for foreign service.” 
Military training was advocated by Dr. Woods Hutchinson, in 
a paper on “ First aid to the uninjured.” He said: 
Military training in the schools may prove the great emancipator that we 
have been waiting for to free our system of education from the clerical 
shackles and classical absurdities of the past and place it upon a hygienic, 
rational, and scientific basis. 
Alvin E. Dodd, secretary of the National Society for the Promo- 
tion of Industrial Education, spoke of the need for vocational school- 
ing and urged the passage of the Smith-Hughes bill by Congress. 
Mr. Joyner, State superintendent of schools of North Carolina, dis- 
cussing the same topic, said that vocational preparation of the great 
industrial masses for more efficient and profitable work is not only 
an economic necessity in a democracy, but also a democratic right 
and obligation. Representative Simeon D. Fess, of Ohio, expressed 
his conviction that Federal aid for vocational education would pass 
both Houses of Congress in the very near future. He predicted 
eventual success, likewise, for the movement to establish a national 
university. 
The departmental meetings varied widely in attendance and in- 
terest. Some were unusually good. The emphasis seemed to be less 
on the vocational aim in education and rather more on the adjust- 
ment of the elemetary course of study to the changes going on in 
educational administration. The elementary section, for example, 
appears to have accepted the six-six plan of organization as definitely
-P-A-G-E-485
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 457 
assured; accordingly, the leaders were considering plans to modify 
the work of the first six years to make it accord with the junior 
high school. The kindergarten section broadened its discussions to ° 
include recent educational experiments, particularly those aiming 
to apply kindergarten principles to the other grades. 
The following resolutions were adopted by the association: 
Resolved, That the president of this association be authorized to name a com- 
mittee of five active members, of which committee the president of the associa- 
tion shall be a member, to request the President of the United States to appoint 
a commission to investigate and report upon the condition of the women on the 
farm and of the rural home of the United States. 
Resolved, That the National Education Association indorse the cooperative 
movement for the promotion of citizenship education inaugurated by the Bureau 
of Naturalization of the Department of Labor. 
Resowed, That the National Education Association urge upon the Congress of 
the United States the appropriation of $50,000, to be administered through the 
United States Bureau of Education for the purpose of disseminating informa- 
tion as to the methods, standards, and established practices in the education of 
immigrants, and in stimulating the extension of the necessary educational 
facilities looking to the Americanization of the foreign-born or alien residents of 
this country. 
Resolwed, That the National Education Association call the attention of the 
American people to the fact that teaching is a profession demanding for its suc- 
cessful practice a technical training that will put the teacher in possession of 
professional standards; that these professional standards can be maintained 
only by the employment of superintendents, supervisors, and teachers who have 
unquestioned professional qualifications for their work; that the members of 
the teaching profession can have and serve but one client—the public; that the 
public, therefore, owes a duty to itself and the members of the profession to see 
to it that only professional considerations enter into the employment, retention, 
and dismissal of teachers, The association believes that the public can elevate 
and strengthen the professional status of teachers and thereby serve itself by 
securing legislation that shall embody the following provisions: 
1. The powers and duties of superintendents of schools should receive defini- 
tion by legislative enactment. Definite professional qualifications should be 
required of all appointees to office. The term of the superintendent of schools 
should be not less than three years; the power of nominating all teachers and 
members of the educational staff should be given the superintendent. 
2. The tenure of office of teachers should, after a probationary period, be 
permanent. Removal should be possible only for inefficiency, immorality, or 
grievous neglect of duty. Salaries should be fixed so as to insure to teachers a 
standard of living in keeping with the professional demands made upon them. 
Retiring allowances or pensions should be provided either by State or local 
action. 
Resolved, That the National Education Association give expression again to 
the consciousness that the school is an institution developed by society to con- 
serve the well-being of humanity, and that on this solid foundation all sub- 
ordinate aims and uses of the school should be made to rest. Assembled as it 
is in a time of world-wide disturbance, doubt, and uncertainty, and of consequent 
national concern, the association affirms its unswerving adherence to the un- 
changing principles of justice between persons and between nations; it affirms 
its belief that the instruction in the school should tend to furnish the mind with
-P-A-G-E-486
  
  458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
the knowledge of the arts and sciences on which the prosperity of the nations 
rests and to incline the will of men and nations toward acts of peace; it 
declares its devotion to America and American ideals and recognizes the priority 
of the claims of our beloved country on our property, our minds, our hearts, 
and our lives. It records its conviction that the true policy to be followed both 
by the school and by the nation which it serves is to keep the American public 
school free from sectarian interference, partisan politics, and disputed public 
policies that it may remain unimpaired in its power to serve the whole people. 
While it recognizes that the community or the State may introduce such ele- 
ments of military training into the schools as may seem wise and prudent, yet 
it believes that such training should be strictly educational in its aim and 
organization and that military ends should not be permitted to pervert the 
educational purposes and practices of the school. 
DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE. 
The Department of Superintendence met in Detroit, Mich., Feb- 
ruary 21-26, 1916, with an attendance that broke all previous rec- 
ords. The principal feature of the opening session was the schol- 
arly address by Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, who touched upon 
the present world war and its social, political, and pedagogical 
significance to America. He said: . 
It seems to me that the American Nation, with all its imperfections, has 
at this time a contribution to make to the world that will be epochal in its 
effect. We have learned, as the world may learn, that one nation may be 
made out of 48 nations. We have learned, as the world may learn, that 
people of divers languages, customs, and religions may dwell together under 
one flag, providing each is given its due rights. 
In the debate on the junior high school Dr. C. H. Judd, of the 
University of Chicago, expressed the opinion that the eight-year 
grammar school was a device of the English aristocracy to limit 
the education of the common people. President C. G. Pearse, of the 
Milwaukee Normal School, argued against the six-and-six plan, 
holding that the present school organization can be made the instru- 
ment of any readjustment which may be necessary in the present 
course of study. Prof. Bagley contended that a liberal education 
is more needed by those who enter the everyday occupations of life 
than by those who pursue professional careers. 
Dr. J. George Becht, of the Pennsylvania State Board of Educa- 
tion, made an urgent plea for the Americanization of foreigners 
through the medium of the schools. He was followed by Dr. Cubber- 
ley, of Leland Stanford University, who urged the limiting of 
school-board activities to the control of schools rather than to their 
actual administration and supervision. A. E. Winship declared 
that he had little sympathy with “the preponderance of criticism 
leveled at school boards. For honesty, right intentions, and desire 
to conscientiously serve, there is no set of legislative bodies in 
America that compares with our school boards.”

  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS. 459 
In the sessions for cities with a population over 250,000 and cities 
of the middle size, many interesting papers were presented for 
consideration, followed by animated discussions. W. S. Deffenbaugh, 
of the United States Bureau of Education, and Supt. W. E. Hoover 
suggested means of economical supervision in cities with a popula- 
tion under 25,000. O. G. Wilson, of Fairmount, W. Va., made a 
plea for the introduction of definite objective tests for measuring 
the products of school instruction. 
In the round table for compulsory education and school census, 
John W. Davis, of New York City, urged the consolidation of the 
truancy and census departments. He thought industrial officers 
should not be local politicians but well-trained educational agents. 
The convention was distinguished by the presence of three goy- 
ernors who have made notable successes as teachers, namely, W. N. 
Ferris, of Michigan; Martin G. Brumbaugh, of Pennsylvania; and 
F. B. Willis, of Ohio. Gov. Brumbaugh dwelt on the necessity of 
continuation schools and vocational education. 3 
A report on “ department activities,” prepared by a committee of 
which Dr. C. E. Chadsey was chairman, was adopted. The committee 
urged that problems of school organization, curriculum making, and 
supervision shall form the principal subjects for discussion hereafter. 
To bring about greater continuity and concentration it was decided 
to appoint a committee each year to study some distinct phase of 
school work and make a report at the following annual meeting, the 
report to form the basis of discussion for a session or a day’s sessions. 
Resolutions were passed affirming the principles of democracy in 
education and the preparation of immigrant children and adults for 
the rights and duties of American citizenship. It was recommended 
that the president of the department be authorized to appoint a 
special committee to cooperate with the United States Bureau of 
Education and all other agencies in realizing this goal. The activities 
of the Federal Bureau of Education were heartily commended. 
Dr. P. P. Claxton, United States Commissioner of Education, em- 
phasized the need of practical education. He thought that the De- 
treit convention was the most important in the annals of the National 
Education Association. 
He said: 
In it three big ideas have made themselves dominant : 
First. The idea that the high schools must shake off the grip of the college 
standard. We are realizing that of the 1,500,000 pupils in high schools, less than 
850,000 ever get into the colleges, universities, or professional schools. 
Second. The idea that high-school courses must be rearranged so that students 
can choose the subjects most helpful to the vocations they will follow. The 
“ six-three-three ” principle is fast winning favor in this connection, because the 
children begin to reason and exercise initiative at least two years before our
-P-A-G-E-488

modern eight-grade system gives them the opportunity of choice and self-ex- 
pression. 
Third. The idea that our schools must do the lion’s share of fitting the boys 
and girls for citizenship, training them to do their share in civic life, and to 
know the practical things of government and individual rights. 
COUNCIL, 
The subject of thrift teaching was discussed at length at the open- 
ing session of the council by S. W. Strauss and A. H. Chamberlain. 
Mr. Chamberlain said that the idea of thrift will make it possible 
to inject into the teaching of arithmetic, geography, and spelling 
many practical elements which have been lacking in the past. Other 
speakers treated the problem from the viewpoint of the committee 
which has been appointed to study the subject of thrift teaching in 
the public schools. 
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 
The following is the report of the secretary of the National Edu- 
cation Association, submitted according to law: 
Aww Arpor, MicH., August 22, 1916. 
Sir: Complying with the provisions of section 4 of the act of incorporation 
of the National Education Association by Congress, approved June 80, 1906, 
the following is submitted as an annual report: 
An office is maintained in the city of Washington at 662 E Street NE. in 
accordance with section 8 of the act of incorporation, but the association owns 
no property, real or personal, in the city of Washington. 
The personal property of the association is largely in the form of volumes 
of proceedings, pamphlets, reprints, and office furniture, worth about $12,000, 
all of which is in the custody of the secretary in Ann Arbor, Mich., where the 
business of the association is transacted. 
The association has a permanent invested fund, referred to in section 7 of 
the act of incorporation, which is in charge of the board of trustees. This 
fund at the close of the fiscal year, June 30, 1916, amounted to $188,500. The 
net revenue from this fund amounted to $7,178.85, which was transferred to 
the treasury of the association for current expenses. 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1916, the total receipts from all sources, 
including balance at the beginning, were $42,529.55; the total expenses were 
$37,157.67 ; the balance in the treasury June 30, 1916, was $5,371.88. 
The chief sources of revenue are membership fees, proceeds of sale of volumes 
and reports, and income from the invested fund. 
The chief items of expense are the printing and distribution of the annual 
volumes, the maintenance of the secretary’s office, and the expense of pre- 
paring for and conducting the annual convention. 
The usual appropriations for educational investigations were made at the 
time of the convention, which was held in New York City July 1 to 8, 1916. 
The following general officers were elected for the ensuing year: President, 
Robert J. Aley, of Orono, Me.; vice president, David B. Johnson, of Rock Hill, 
S. C.; treasurer, Thomas E, Finegan, of Albany, N. Y. 
The executive committee for the ensuing year will be constituted as follows: 
President, Robert J. Aley, president University of Maine, Orono, Me.; first vice 
president, David B. Johnson, president Winthrop Normal and Industrial Col-

Washington, D. 0. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES, 
The seventeenth annual conference of the Association of Ameri- 
can Universities was held at Berkeley, Cal., August 27-28, 1915. A 
paper on “ Faculty share in university control,” prepared on behalf 
of Columbia University by Dr. Dewey, was read by ©. J. Keyser. 
The writer suggested some of the reasons for giving the teaching 
body in universities a greater share in the control of university 
policies and then formulated a method by which this might be 
brought about. 
If the legislative prerogatives of faculties were extended, there might well 
be an elected administrative committee (subject to recall), which should have 
large discretionary powers in administrative details. * * * In all matters 
relating to the progress of students the faculty might well confine itself to 
legislation on broad principles and leave to its administrative commission 
the working out of specific details. 
Dr. Dewey’s paper evoked considerable discussion. A. O. Leusch- 
ner, on behalf of the University of California, presented a paper 
on “The organization and budget of the graduate school and its 
relation to the other schools of the university,” in which he drew 
the conclusion that the complete separation of the graduate school 
in organization and budget is not desirable in American universities 
and that it is most advantageously organized as a horizontal sec- 
tion of the university, including all schools as far as matters of 
graduate study and research and higher degrees are concerned. 
A paper on “Questions relating to outside remunerative work by 
professors” was presented on behalf of Leland Stanford Junior 
University by Charles D. Marx. 
The report of the committee on bibliography of university and 
college publications was adopted and $500 was appropriated to 
carry out the plans formulated. The method of the proposed cata- 
logue is that of the Publishers’ Trade-List Annual, each institution 
 
-P-A-G-E-490
    462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
cooperating furnishing 500 copies of the list of its own publications 
printed in a uniform size suitable for binding together. 
The report of the representative of the association to cooperate 
with the United States Bureau of Education regarding the question 
of the classification of American colleges was received and filed. 
Two sessions of the Conference of Deans and Other Adminis- 
trative Officers of the Graduate Schools were held in connection with 
the meetings of the association. Resolutions were adopted regard- 
ing the master’s degree, which were afterwards amended by the 
association as follows: 
Whereas the Association of American Universities in its twelfth annual con- 
ference tended to favor the idea that the master’s degree should be granted 
only for work of graduate character ; 
Whereas discussion among the deans of the graduate faculties reveals wide 
variation of practice on this point as well as with reference to residence re- 
quirements for this degree: Therefore 
Resolved, first, That it is the sense of the meeting that the association shall 
reaffirm its belief that the master’s degree should stand for at least one year of 
bona fide graduate study ; second, That all institutions in this association should 
maintain a minimum residence requirement of one year; and third, That when 
candidacy for the master’s degree is conducted through summer sessions the 
required work should be the full equivalent of that otherwise required for the 
degree sought. The resident work in such candidacy should be in amount not 
less than five summer sessions of six weeks’ duration. 
' The deans’ conference recommended that a committee be appointed 
to report to the association on the subject of academic and profes- 
sional higher degrees, which was adopted. 
NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The twenty-first annual meeting of the North Central Association 
of Colleges and Secondary Schools was held in Chicago, Ill., March 
24-25, 1916. The association has two subsidiary bodies—the com- 
mittee of high-school inspectors, and the commission on accredited 
schools and colleges. The first works for the institutions and for the 
State departments of education in the States which are covered by 
the association. The commission presented a report dealing with 
1,139 schools, 927 of which had its unqualified approval; 89 were 
warned “to mend their ways”; 13 were recommended to be dropped; 
and 92 new schools were placed upon the approved list. The report 
of the commission was not received with entire approval by the as- 
sociation, for several schools that had been refused membership 
appealed, and in a number of cases the appeal was sustained. 
Dean Thomas A. Clark, of the University of Tlinois, delivered an 
address in which he emphasized the importance of the personal touch 
between the instructors and the students, particularly between the 
instructors and the freshmen students. President David Felmley, of
-P-A-G-E-491
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS. 463 
Illinois Normal University, spoke on “ What is the reasonable limit 
to which an institution may go in enrolling students in the first and 
second years and yet retain the right to be classified as a senior col- 
lege?” 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF THE SOUTHERN 
: STATES, 
The twenty-first annual meeting of the Association of Colleges 
and Secondary Schools of the Southern States was held at Nash- 
ville, Tenn., October 28-29, 1915. Dr. S. P. Capen, specialist in 
higher education, United States Bureau of Education, presented a 
paper on “Measuring college standards and efficiency,” in which 
he discussed the work of the committee on higher educational 
statistics, composed of delegates of national and sectional asso- 
ciations representing higher educational institutions. This com- 
mittee, which is cooperating with the Federal bureau, met in Wash- 
ington, in May, 1915, and decided to undertake a critical survey of 
colleges and universities without attempting to divide institutions 
into classes such as Class I, Class II, Class A, Class B, etc. Dr. 
Capen emphasized the point that this study was not intended to 
be a classification; it would merely furnish the data for classifica- 
tions which any agency might choose to make. 
Miss Emily H. Dutton, speaking on the same subject, dwelt on 
conditions in southern colleges. J. D. Elliff read a paper on “The 
junior college: The Missouri plan,” in which he discussed the efforts 
of the University of Missouri to standardize the work of a junior 
college and to accredit such institutions as met the requirements. 
The subject of “Quality credits” was treated by H. C. Tolman. 
Charles G. Maphis read a paper on “A plan for the definite rating 
of secondary schools,” in which he contended that the schools should 
take the initiative in the matter, and then seek the cooperation of 
the colleges. “College credit for school work” was discussed by 
William H. Hand, who dwelt on the advisability of giving freshmen 
credits for work distinctly within the four-year high-school course 
or by giving such credits for courses extending beyond the high- 
school course. 
The report cf the commission on accredited schools was presented 
by the chairman, J. S. Stewart. 
The recommendation of the executive committee regarding the 
membership of the association was adopted. This recommendation, 
which is an amendment to the constitution, makes the membership 
consist of four classes: (1) Colleges and universities, (2) junior col- 
leges, (3) schools, (4) individuals.

LAND-GRANT COLLEGE ENGINEERING ASSOCIATION. 
The fourth annual convention of the Land-Grant College En- 
gineering Association was held at Berkeley, Cal., August 11-13, 1915. 
The presidential address was delivered by H. W. Tyler, who empha- 
sized the importance of concentrating attention on the engineering 
experiment stations. The special committee on fees for professional 
(engineering) services in land-grant colleges called attention to the 
entire absence of uniformity in methods for handling commercial 
work at land-grant institutions. At one extreme is the advocate of 
free service for the citizens of a State, similar to that rendered by the 
agricultural and extension departments; at the other is the professor 
who thinks that private practice is purely a personal affair and that 
the laboratory management should be similar to that of a commercial 
testing laboratory. 
A. W. Richter read a paper on the “Adaptation of engineering to 
local needs,” in which he said that no engineering college can afford 
to maintain courses covering all of the various specialties. In ad- 
dition to the general courses of civil, electrical, and mechanical en- 
gineering, each institution should endeavor “to meet only its special 
needs by offering such additional courses as will tend to produce men 
most capable of leading in the development of the special resources 
of its own State.” 
A paper by O. V. P. Stout on “ Lessons to be drawn from the ex- 
perience of the agricultural experiment stations ” considered the func- 
tions, relations, organization, policy, and procedure of the agricul- 
tural experiment stations of this country, and how far such activi- 
ties applied to the work of engineering experiment stations already 
organized or to be organized in the land-grant colleges. 
Other papers were presented by G. A. Covell and F. E. Turneaure. 
The paper by O. L. Waller took the form of a proposed bill, estab- 
lishing engineering experiment stations, using throughout the phrase- 
ology of the Hatch Act, substituting the words “ mechanic arts” for 
“agriculture” and stating the proposed objects and duties in some- 
what different language. The executive committee was authorized 
to take steps to promote the campaign to secure Federal aid in the 
interests of engineering experiment stations. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE MIDDLE 
STATES AND MARYLAND. 
The twenty-ninth annual convention of the Association of Col- 
leges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland 
was held in Philadelphia, Pa., November 26-27, 1915. President 
Isaac Sharpless, of Haverford College, deprecated military training
-P-A-G-E-493
  
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 465 
in schools and colleges. In the general discussion that followed his 
address, President Thomas Fell, of St. John’s College, Annapolis, 
Md., spoke in. favor of such training. The subject of “ Athletics in 
schools and colleges” was treated by Dr. D. A. Sargent. Prof. 
Roger B. Merriman, discussing the “ Use of the comprehensive ex- 
amination in college education,” said there were two basic ideas 
closely related to one another, which underlie the plan of a com- 
prehensive examination, the main feature being that it is an examina- 
tion, not of a course, but in a field of knowledge. 
The report of the committee appointed to investigate the com- 
parative records made by students admitted to college on examina- 
tion and on certificate, respectively, was submitted, accompanied by 
elaborate statistical charts. A number of colleges for women, in 
addition to several colleges for men, were examined. In particular 
Mount Holyoke, Smith, Vassar, and Wellesley, at a very considerable 
expenditure of time and labor, furnished the desired data. In 
giving the results of its work, the committee decided not to indicate 
the identity of the several colleges. 
NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMMIGRATION AND AMERICANIZATION. 
The first National Conference on Immigration and Americaniza- 
tion was held in Philadelphia, January 19-20, 1916. It was organ- 
ized by the national Americanization committee for the purpose of 
discussing economic, social, and educational work among immigrants. 
Letters were sent to the governors and mayors of towns with a large 
immigrant population and to various associations inviting them to 
send delegates to the conference. The first session consisted of the 
opening of an art exhibit, showing the contribution of foreign-born 
races to art in America, held in Memorial Hall. 
Addresses were made by Gov. Brumbaugh, 8S. Stanwood Menken, 
Felix M. Warburg, Mary Antin, Dr. P. P. Claxton, Louis F. Post, 
Mrs. P. V. Pennypacker, Edmund von Mach, Grace Abbott, Dr. 
Corrigan, Stephen 8S. Wise, Theodore Roosevelt, and others. 
The Immigrants in America Review, the official organ of the 
committee for immigrants in America, New York City, in summing 
up the work of the congress, says: 
The most significant results of the conference are that for the first time 
philanthropic, business, civil, and educational organizations were brought to- 
gether to discuss Americanization as it affects them all; that Americanization 
was recognized as a national movement and responded, requiring national 
standards; and that one and all organizations governmental and private, of all 
kinds and all creeds, and of varying methods of work, pledged themselves to coop- 
erate in carrying out Americanization as a national work.’

AMERICAN FEDERATION OF ARTS. 
The seventh annual convention of the American Federation of 
Arts was held in Washington, D. C., May 16-18, 1916. Dr. Charles 
D. Wolcott, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, delivered the 
address of welcome. Senator Newlands, of Nevada, who spoke on 
“Art and the people,” strongly urged all art organizations of the 
country to assist in the formation of public sentiment regarding art 
matters. He dwelt on the development of art as one of the highest 
functions of the Government, involving not only education in art but 
its practical application to all material things with which the Gov- 
ernment has any concern. He advocated the creation of an art com- 
mission with “some real power connected with the National 
Government.” 
Robert W. De Forest, of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New 
York City, president of the federation, discussed the best means of 
promoting the introduction of art into the home, and the part to be 
played by the federation in furthering the means of supplying the 
ever increasing cravings for objects of art of the American people. 
He tentatively recommended traveling exhibits of artistic photo- 
graphs, prints, casts, ceramics, etc., which could not only be seen but 
purchased for reasonable amounts. 
Miss Leila Mechlin, secretary, emphasized the national character 
of the organization and told of its existing traveling exhibits, its 
circulation of illustrated art lectures especially adapted to general 
audiences. 
Among the services of an extraordinary character performed by 
the federation within the past year she mentioned its work in obtain- 
ing the lowering of the prohibitive rates charged for the transporta- 
tion of paintings under the Cummins bill, etc. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN LAW SCHOOLS, 
The fifteenth annual meeting of the Association of American Law 
Schools was held at Chicago, Ill., December 28-30, 1915. H. S. 
Richards, in his presidential address on “ Progress in legal educa- 
tion,” advocated an aggressive policy on the part of the association 
to bring about a uniform standard for admission to the bar through- 
out the United States, and the securing of an efficient administration 
of that standard. He urged the adequate study of the history of 
American law, and a comparative study of the basic juristic prin- 
ciples of all the great systems of law. 
There was an extended discussion by H. F. Stone and F. C. Wood- 
ward of the report made by Prof. Redlich, for the Carnegie Founda- 
tion, as one of the features incident to the investigation of legal 
education in this country by the Foundation. ‘The third session of
-P-A-G-E-495
  
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 467 
the association was given over to a discussion of the extent to which 
contemporary legislative problems should be dealt with in law 
schools, and the method of presenting those problems. J. H. Wig- 
more, of Northwestern University, presented the matter in the form 
of an actual demonstration-of the operation of a class conducted in 
accordance with his views. He was assisted by Mr. Hoffman, a 
student at the Northwestern University law school, class of 1916. At 
the close of the demonstration Prof. Wigmore called upon George F. 
Wells, of the University of North Dakota, to explain the course in 
legislation offered in his institution. Prof. Freund, who was not 
present at the meeting, submitted a memorandum of the course at 
the University of Chicago, which was read by the secretary. 
Various round-table conferences were held, at which were dis- 
cussed the following topics: Evidence, contracts, property, and 
procedure. 
The following resolution was passed by the association: 
Whereas there is a recognized demand for greater attention to the scientific 
and constructive work in jurisprudence in addition to the fundamental work 
of training men for the bar; 
Whereas the recommendation of the president of this Association of American 
Law Schools that a center be established in Washington, or elsewhere, for 
‘the constructive advanced work in jurisprudence brings this purely juristic 
purpose of legal education directly before this association ; and 
Whereas it is advisable to bring together for analysis and discussion the 
various plans and ideas relating to this recommendation: Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That this association cooperate with those suggesting these plans 
and bring into focus the various ideas for advanced work in jurisprudence 
for formal consideration, and to this end it is moved that the association shall 
now appoint a committee of three on the plan for a juristic center, the chair- 
man to be the retiring president, Mr. Richards, which committee shall investi- 
gate this project of an independent center for constructive and advance work 
in jurisprudence, collect the data, invite plans, suggestions, and criticism, 
and digest the result in a report, with its own recommendations, which report 
and recommendations shall be presented at the next regular meeting of this 
arene: 
HARVARD TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The Harvard Teachers’ Association met in Boston, March 11, 1916. 
Charles A. Prosser delivered an address on “ Education as prepared- 
ness,” in which he laid emphasis on the necessity of securing a 
system of education adapted to the genius of the American people. 
He remarked that two phases of the use of education as preparation 
for a stronger and safer country appealed to him, viz: (1) The use 
of the schools to develop the latent possibilities of all our future 
citizens; (2) the use of the schools to develop a better patriotism 
among our future citizens. W. C. Bagley treated the subject of 
“Some handicaps to education in a democracy,” in which he ex-
-P-A-G-E-496
    
468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
pressed the conviction that education in this country can not serve 
the people with “a maximal measure of efficiency until the people 
themselves decree that effective sanctions, recognitions, and rewards 
shall accrue to unusual success in teaching as such.” “Our national 
shortcomings in education” was discussed by David Snedden. 
CATHOLIC EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The thirteenth annual convention of the Catholic Educational 
Association was held at Baltimore during the week of June 26, 1916. 
A paper read by the Rev. J. W. Maguire, of St. Viator College, 
urged that sociology should become a part of the curricula of Cath- 
olic colleges. Other topics were: “The Gary plan; ” “Some ends in 
elementary education;” and “Education from a Catholic stand- 
point.” Cardinal Gibbons was a guest on the last day of the con- 
vention. In speaking of the instruction of children as the most 
important thing to attract leaders of thought, the cardinal said: 
Knowledge is power, but that. power is only beneficial when it is directed to- 
ward righteous ends. The progress and prosperity of the church in America 
is to be gained not only by the increase of its adherents, but still more by the 
improvement and the growth of our Catholic schools. 
At a meeting of the parish school department, papers were read 
upon “The lesson plan”; and “The problem of feeble-mindedness.” 
SOUTHERN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE WOMEN. 
The thirteenth annual meeting of the Southern Association of Col- 
lege Women was held in Montgomery, Ala., April 18-15, 1916. 
Elizabeth Avery Colton, in her presidential address, said that a 
college, according to President Wilson, should “ subject its students 
to general intellectual training—narrowed to no one point of view, 
to no one vocation or calling”; consequently the association is 
making every effort not so much to change the present tendency 
to emphasize vocational training for women as to differentiate tech- 
nical training of all kinds from college training. She remarked: 
We realize fully that the South needs more industrial and general finishing 
schools for women than liberal-arts colleges; and for that reason we urge our 
nominal colleges to give up their false claims, and try to become good pre- 
paratory, or trade schools. We need especially institutions like Pratt and 
Drexel, whose distinctive object is to give thorough professional and technical 
training. But we also need more colleges like Vassar and Wellesley, whose 
distinctive object is to give a liberal education—to inculcate the spirit of 
scholarship. We are therefore encouraging our six standard colleges to leave 
to normal schools, to State universities, and to conservatories of music tech- 
nical training in vocational subjects and in fine arts, and to devote themselves 
to the distinctive work of liberal education as set forth in President Wilson’s 
ideal of what a college is for.

EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 469 
Dr. W. W. Guth, president of Goucher College, delivered an ad- 
dress on “ First things first,” which was a plea for individual train- 
ing. The report of the committee on standards of colleges was pre- 
sented by the chairman, Emily H. Dutton. 
NORTH CENTRAL COUNCIL OF STATE NORMAL SCHOOL PRESIDENTS. 
The North Central Council of State Normal School Presidents 
met in Chicago, Ill, February 18-19, 1916. The general theme of 
the meeting was “Greater educational leadership for State normal 
schools.” Carroll G. Pearse spoke of the growth of the council as 
a most helpful sign, and thought that a national organization should 
be formed to meet annually to consider important educational prob- 
lems relating to normal schools. Dr. Charles H. Judd urged the 
classification of higher institutions of learning, and W. 8S. Dear- 
mont discussed the work of normal schools in the field of productive 
scholarship. The address by Dr. Linus W. Kline on “ What phases 
of psychology should be taught in normal schools and what amount 
of time should be devoted to the subject?” was an able presentation 
of a difficult problem. He cited the following reasons for the unfa- 
vorable attitude toward psychology: 
1. The advantages of a knowledge of psychology to the art of teaching have 
been urged in extravagant language and the claims set forth have unduly 
raised the hopes and expectations of prospective teachers and the uncritical 
public. ~ 
2. Psychologists are too disputatious and often allow their zeal and par- 
tisanship for secondary matters to becloud- or:set aside problems of primary 
importance. 
* 8. The limited time usually devoted to psychology in normal schools necessi- 
tates the presentation of its laws in a more or less dogmatic fashion. Undue 
emphasis is placed upon structure and the corresponding neglect of the func- 
tional and relational aspect of mind. 
4, The fourth factor that tends to disappoint our expectations in the benefits 
of psychology consists in certain intrinsic difficulties of the science itself and 
in the age and limited preparation of the student for grappling with it. 
NATIONAL FEDERATION OF STATE EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS. 
The National Federation of State Education Associations met in 
connection with the Department of Superintendence at Detroit. 
Over 30 States were represented. : 
President Foos delivered the address of welcome, in which he out- 
lined the scope and work of the federation, stating that the federation 
was a clearing house for the various State associations, and urged 
that there be a free interchange of opinion on the paramount prob- 
lems of the several State associations. He argued that the function 
of the federation was to disseminate helpful information for the use

470 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
of the State bodies. He advocated a simpler constitution and recom- 
mended that a committee be appointed to draw up a constitution. 
A. H. Chamberlain, of California, urged that the organization 
of the federation be simplified and made more democratic; and 
Dr. Alfred C. Thompson, of New York, suggested State delegate 
memberships to make the membership more permanent. 
Dr. M. Bates Stephens, State superintendent of Maryland, reported 
for the Maryland association and suggested that all State associations 
be made branches of the federation. He urged that the federation be 
made a clearing house for the State associations, and that the work 
of the federation be reported back to the various State bodies by 
members present. 
G. W. Briles, president of the State Education Association, Ada, 
Okla., thought there should be a concerted effort in the various State 
associations and advised that each State association do some specific 
thing each year. 
W. W. Thomas, president of the State Teachers’ Association, Co- 
lumbia, Mo., spoke of the importance of getting suggestions at this 
meeting which would help the various State association officers. He 
told of the association work of Missouri, plans of raising money, and 
the efforts of the Missouri association to secure a constitutional con- 
vention. 
M. A. Bursewitz, secretary of the State Teachers’ Association, Mil- 
waukee, Wis., reported on the work of the Wisconsin Teachers’ As- 
sociation, saying that his association had attempted the work of 
writing the educational history of the State. 
Dr. W. B. Owen, of Chicago, Ill., discussed the question as to how 
the State association may be an integral part of the National Educa- 
tion Association. He thought the work of the National Education As- 
sociation should be conducted by delegates selected by the various 
State associations and that they should be responsible to the State 
associations. ‘ 
A. H. Chamberlain, secretary of the California Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, San Francisco, Cal., discussed the plan of State association 
work, suggesting that States be divided into general working units 
or centers, and that each of these centers be made a division of the 
State association. He said that each of these centers in California 
elected delegates to a State council and that this State council had 
in charge the general business of the teachers’ association of Cali- 
fornia. He stated that the council meets annually and that it has 
general charge of financial and legislative matters. He gave a full 
report of the work that the California association had done in legis- 
lative matters, mentioning the teachers’ fund and the longer tenure 
of office, the teachers’ registration bureau, to take the place of the 
teachers’ agency, and other things helpful to the teachers that had  
-P-A-G-E-499
  
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 471 
been secured. He Said that the council unified the programs of all 
the various sectional associations. The budget of the California as- 
sociation, he remarked, amounted to about $25,000. 
CONFERENCE ON RURAL EDUCATION. 
The fourth annual Conference on Rural Education was held at 
Worcester, Mass., June, 1916. William B. Aspinwall opened the 
conference with a discussion of the rural school as the community 
center, in which he stated that the community center was one of the 
best means of revealing to a community not only its wealth of 
’ educational and socializing resources, but also its splendid oppor- 
tunity of vitalizing and invigorating the work of the school. Mason 
S. Stone, commissioner of education of Vermont, in his address on 
“The restoration of country life in New England,” cited three 
main causes which have produced the exodus from the countryside 
and the resultant conditions: (1) Financial opportunities, (2) isola- 
tion, and (8) schooling. Interesting papers on the rural school as 
the community center were read by G. A. Works, David Snedden, 
Kenyon L. Butterfield, and Edward J. Ward. H. O. Clough dis- 
cussed “ Community activities and supervision of country schools 
in Connecticut.” 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL ACCOUNTING OFFICERS. 
The fifth annual convention of the National Association of School 
Accounting Officers was held at Des Moines, Iowa, May 16-18, 1916. 
The report of a committee on the standardization of school build- 
ing measurements and cubical contents was presented, which sug- 
gested a plan for classifying school edifices according to use and 
construction, for classifying cost units on the basis of pupil capacity 
and cubic contents, and for classifying building costs. It pre- 
cipitated much discussion. Objection was made to the classifica- 
tion of grading, fences, etc., as a part of the cost of a school site. 
The report and a graphic chart prepared by E. C. Baldwin were 
adopted by unanimous vote. The data will be submitted to promi- 
nent architectural, engineering, and building associations for con- 
currence. 
Some of the questions discussed by the convention were the fol- 
lowing: Can educational service be measured, and can the results 
of this service as expressed in the lives of the children and of the 
communities be stated definitely? The general opinion was ex- 
pressed that values and costs are closely related, but that there are, 
at the present time, no known means of fixing such values, inasmuch 
as they involve factors—spiritual, moral, and intellectual—which
-P-A-G-E-500
  472 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
do not bear definite quantitive measurement frorh a utilitarian and 
material standpoint. Dr. George Gerwig, however, thought that 
the school will pay dividends in proportion to its function and use. 
He advocated the possibility of the final evolution of a scheme of 
evaluating and separating the elements of service. He held the need 
of going beyond mere costs to be vitally necessary. 
August Hiller discussed the subject of school surveys and finance. 
Charles O. Case presented a detailed outline and blank forms of 
a system of accounting devised by the New York State Education 
Department for the school boards of New York, which will be com- 
pulsory throughout the State after August, 1916. Lewis E. Larson 
delivered an address on the “ Functions of the business department of 
the school board as an aid to the education department.” William 
Dick read a paper on “ Constructive economy.” 
_ NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF CHARITIES AND CORRECTION, 
The forty-third annual meeting of the National Conference of 
Charities and Correction was held in Indianapolis, Ind., May 10-17, 
1916, with a record-breaking attendance. Federal aid to education 
was urged by Mrs. Florence Kelley, general secretary of the National 
Consumers’ League. She said: “For want of Federal aid in vast 
areas, larger than the territory of whole European nations, schools 
are lacking or are held in cabins and hovels for a few weeks in the 
year, taught by incompetents and giving the children the least possi- 
ble education.” 
EASTERN ARTS ASSOCIATION. 
The Eastern Arts Association convened in Springfield, Mass., on 
April 20-22, 1916, with a large attendance. Papers on the decorative 
arts predominated at the general sessions. Dr. David Snedden made 
a plea for clearer definitions for our terminology in the arts. Vesper 
L. George presented a paper on “ Problems in interior decoration.” 
Arthur Allen discussed the problem of bridging the gap between 
the modern art school and the business world; and Miss Sarah Louise 
Arnold spoke of the necessity of teaching household arts practically. 
The need and opportunity for more color printing as art problems in 
the schools was emphasized by Arthur W. Dow. 
Round-table meetings were organized for technical, mechanical 
arts, and industrial art high-school teachers, manual-training teach- 
ers, household-arts teachers, art teachers, vocational-school teachers, 
and industrial-training teachers for special teachers. 
At the second meeting of the college and normal-school section, 
established a year ago by Miss Mabel Soper, of Bridgewater Normal 
School, Mass., Dr. Snedden said that the modern tendency in art.
-P-A-G-E-501

education is away from drawing and representation as the objective 
and toward the training of all-in appreciation. He declared: 
Appreciation is to be gained in some measure by drawing, designing, and con- 
struction in order to establish intelligent understanding of beauty, but much 
more by the handling of real objects of beauty, for purposes of choosing and 
estimating between good and not so good, between the well designed and the 
poorly designed. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PRINCIPALS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The National Association of Principals of Secondary Schools was 
organized at Chicago, Ill., on April 15, 1916, the purpose being to 
provide a time and place where the high-school principals might 
discuss and confer about their common interests, especially the pe- 
culiar problems relating to supervision and management in secondary 
schools—problems which, as the American School (May, 1916) states, 
have “never received consistent, methodical, and thoroughgoing con- 
sideration.” 
NATIONAL LEAGUE OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION OFFICIALS. 
The fifth annual convention of the National League of Compulsory 
Education Officials was held at Milwaukee, Wis., November 18-20, 
1915. Many interesting papers were read, among them being the 
following: “How compulsory education laws could be strengthened,” 
by W. S. Deffenbaugh, of the United States Bureau of Education; 
“The delinquent girl question,” by Mary Bartelme; “Should shoes 
and clothing be furnished indigent school children by public or 
private funds? ” by C. A. McCall; “ The child at school and the child 
at work,” by Anne Davis; “The widening scope of attendance pro- 
motion,” by J. B. Quinn; “ Constructive agencies of education,” by 
John D. Shoop; and “ Mothers’ pensions,” by Joel D. Hunter. 
The following resolutions were among those adopted: 
Resolwed, That we favor special rooms or classes, parental schools, con- 
tinuation, trade, and technical schools for incorrigible children. 
Resolwed, That the experience and advice of attendance officers should be 
utilized in securing to children that vocational. guidance which is essential to 
the safe transit from school to industry. 
Resolved, That each attendance department should have charge of the per- 
manent school census and the issuance of age and schooling certificates or 
work permits. 
Resolved, That we favor a-more liberal provision for parks, playgrounds, and 
social and recreation centers for the youths engaged in daily occupation, as 
a substitute for unwholesome places of amusement. 
Resolved, That we favor the compulsory attendance at school of children up 
to 16 years of age, and the granting of age and schooling certificates to 
children of 14 years of age who have completed six yearly grades, and com- 
pulsory attendance of such certificated children at continuation schools for 
at least five hours a week during the days the public schools in the district are 
 
-P-A-G-E-502
474 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
in session until they have completed the eighth yearly grade or have attained 
18 years of age; and that continuation schools be under the control of the board 
of education of the school district. 
Resolved, That free transportation of crippled and blind children to our 
public schools be accorded. 
Resolved, That we favor a transfer system to trace children who leave one 
school to attend another. ? 
Resolved, That the plan of the Bureau of Immigration of notifying the school 
authorities of the arrival of the children of immigrants meets with our ap- 
proval, and we recommend the tracing of all children who transfer between 
schools in the same or different cities. 
Resolved, That we favor the dropping of the child’s name from the school 
register only upon the recommendation of the attendance department, or if it 
shall be shown to the satisfaction of the board of education of the school dis- 
trict that the mental or bodily condition of the child is such as to prevent his 
or her attendance at school, or unless such child shall have been granted an 
age and schooling certificate or work permit. 
Resolved, That we again favor uniform marriage and divorce laws to protect 
childhood. : 
MUSIC TEACHERS’ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-seventh annual meeting of the Music Teachers’ National 
Association was held in Buffalo, N. Y., December 28-30, 1915. The 
presidential address, delivered by J. Lawrence Erb, emphasized the 
fact that while music as an art is firmly established in a large propor- 
tion of the educational institutions of the United States, music as an 
educational force—as a mental discipline, for instance—is grudg- 
ingly admitted in only a few. He said: 
In other words, while educators are ready to admit—what they can not fail 
to realize—the value of music as an accomplishment, as a social entertainment, 
as a community asset, they are skeptical of its worth in the processes of edu- 
cation, of drawing out by disciplinary process what is in a student and school- 
ing the faculties for use in the everyday world. 
Prof. Erb dwelt on the lack of coordination between the music 
teacher and his work and the other educational forces, public and 
private. 
In the public-school conference Karl W. Gehrkens presented a 
paper on “Training the music supervisor,” and Will Earhart dis- 
cussed “Some present usages in accrediting music in high schools.” 
The report of the standardization conference revealed the fact that 
the evolution of standardization seems— 
to follow a somewhat fixed formula, beginning always with attempts to line up 
the teachers of the State (or smaller district) with examinations and certifica- 
tions. Several States have attempted to bring this about by legislation, but 
have found the lawmakers rather unresponsive. In States like Kansas, Illi- 
nois, Missouri, and Minnesota, where the State associations conduct the exami- 
nations and issue the certificates, results seem to appear, though slowly. Much 
more is being accomplished by ignoring the teacher’s credentials, but keeping 
close scrutiny upon his work. This seems to be the logical manner of solving 
the problem.

EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 475 
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The Religious Education Association, which met in Chicago, IIL, 
February 28 to March 1, 1916, discussed the general subject of re- 
ligious instruction and public education. To better correlate these 
interests, preparatory studies had been inaugurated in different parts 
of the country. Four problems were considered by the conference: 
(1) Is such correlation desirable? (2) What should be the curric- 
ulum of religious instruction? (8) How can week-day religious in- 
struction be organized? (4) Where may teachers be obtained? It 
was generally recognized that religious instruction belongs to the 
home and the church, and not to the public school. Religious educa- 
tion is the indubitable right of every child, and it is proper for 
parents and school officials to reach such agreement as may make it 
possible for the children to attend schools of religion at certain 
periods of the day. But this should be an agreement between the 
citizens and the public school authorities, and not between the school 
and the church. The church as an institution should not interfere. 
The fact was developed at the conference that there is much to be 
accomplished among Protestant bodies in formulating a curriculum 
of religious education. The following declaration of principles was 
announced : 
1. The church and state are to be regarded as distinct institutions, which, as 
far as possible, cooperate through the agency of their common constituents in 
their capacity as individual citizens. 
2. All children are entitled to an organic program of education which shall 
include adequate facilities, not only for general, but for religious instruction 
and training. 
8. Such a division of the child’s time as will allow opportunity and strength 
for religious education should be reached by consultation between parents and 
public school authorities without formal agreement between the state and the 
churches as institutions. 
4. The work of religious instruction and training should be done by such 
institutions as the home, the church, and the private school, and not by the 
public school nor in official connection with the public school. 
5. The work of religious education must depend for dignity, interest, and 
stimulus upon the recognition of its worth, not merely by public school authori- 
ties, but by the people themselves as represented in the homes, the churches, 
private schools and colleges, and industries. 
6. The success of a program of religious education depends— 
(a) Upon the adoption of a schedule which shall include the systematic use 
of week days as well as Sundays for religious instruction and training. 
(b) Upon more adequate provision for training in the experience of public 
and private worship, and for the use of worship as an educational force. 
(c) Upon the degree to which the materials and methods employed express 
both sound educational theory and the ideals of the religious community in a 
systematic plan for instruction and training, which shall include all the educa- 
tional work of the local church, whether such church works independently or 
in cooperation with other churches.  
-P-A-G-E-504
  476 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
(d) Upon the degree to which professional standards and a comprehensive 
plan are made the basis of the preparation of teachers for work in religious 
education. 
(e) Upon the degree to which parents awake to the unparalleled oppor- 
tunity for the religious education of our children and youth, the profound need 
for sympathetic cooperation among all citizens of whatever faith, and the call 
for sacrifice in time and thought, in effort and money, consecrated to the chil- 
dren of the kingdom. ti 
(f) Upon the degree to which the churches awake to their responsibility for 
che instruction and training of the world’s children in the religious life, and 
cake up with intelligence and devotion their common task. 
PAN AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC CONGRESS. 
GENERAL SESSIONS. 
The second Pan American Scientific Congress was held in Wash- 
ington, D. C., December 27, 1915-January 9, 1916. It marked the 
advent of a new epoch in the relations of the American republics— 
scientific, diplomatic, social, and educational. Among the 1,000 dele- 
gates were many notable scientists who considered not only subjects 
of scientific interest, but important problems of statecraft, such as 
arbitration and international unity between all the Americas. 
Section IV was devoted exclusively to education. Dr. P. P. Clax- 
ton, U. 8. Commissioner of Education, presided at the opening of the 
general session on education, on December 28. In his address he 
dwelt on the subject of education and democracy. 
He maintained that the ideals of the United States and those of 
Latin America are similar, the political and educational trend of all 
the countries of the western world being toward democracy and 
general public instruction. The speaker stood for still closer rela- 
tion between the United States and the Republics of Latin America, 
and advocated an educational congress of all the Americas, to meet 
at stated intervals in connection with the scientific congresses for the 
realization of the common aims of democracy and general educa- 
tion. 
His excellency, Carlos Maria de Pefia, minister from Uruguay 
to the United States, read a thoughtful paper on educational con- 
ditions in his native country. He stated that Uruguay, in formu- 
lating its educational system, had followed for the most part that 
of the United States. The minister’s paper, which was in English, 
was well received. 
Dr. José Ingenieros, professor of philosophy of the University 
of Buenos Aires, who spoke in Spanish, took for the subject of his 
paper, “A new organization of universities according to scientific 
philosophy.” He emphasized the importance of scientific education 
and research work; for science, he asserted, had changed the views 
of humanity. The old classical education (“the humanities”) no 
longer expresses completely the viewpoint of modern human life;
-P-A-G-E-505
  
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 477 
therefore it becomes necessary to formulate educational aims along 
more scientific lines. 
A thoughtful paper by Dr. Charles Eliot, president emeritus of 
Harvard University, on “ The changes needed in American secondary 
education,” was read by Dr. S. P. Capen, of the Bureau of Education. 
Dr. Eliot urged the training of the senses as the most important 
part of education, because such training, in addition to forming the 
facility for accurate observation, creates the habit of careful reflec- 
tion and measured reasoning. The writer maintained that little 
attention is paid in schools to the training of the senses, the sec- 
ondary schools giving only from one-tenth to one-sixth of their 
energies to sense training. To correct this deficiency he urged the 
introduction of more hand, ear, and eye work, such as drawing, 
carpentry, turning, music, and cooking, and the dedication of more 
time to the sciences and to observation, to chemistry, physics, biology, 
and geography, geological, and ethnological, but not political. 
In order to allow space for these additional subjects in the already 
crowded secondary-school programs, memory subjects should be some- 
what curtailed, afternoon hours utilized, and the long summer vaca- 
tion reduced. 
Sections 4 and 9 (commerce, finance, and taxation) met in joint 
session to consider the subject of “ Commercial education,” under the 
presidency of Dr. Antonio Fontecha, commissioner from Honduras 
to the Panama-Pacific Exposition. 
Hon. William C. Redfield, Secretary of Commerce, gave a résumé 
of the scientific activities of the United States Department of Com- 
merce. “The modern conqueror of commerce,” he said, “leaves no 
ruins in his path; he builds up wherever he goes; and in this respect 
he differs from the warlike conqueror of the past.” 
The paper deplored the lack of properly trained men in the United 
States fitted to represent the Government as commercial agents to 
foreign countries and asserted that the lack of a practical knowledge 
of languages on the part of those who present themselves for exami- 
nation forms a serious stumbling block in their path of progress and 
success. 
Hon. Andrew J. Peters, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, made 
an appeal for technical education of business men, and in this he was 
supported by John H. Fahey, president of the United States Cham- 
ber of Commerce. Mr. Fahey dwelt on the remarkable work accom- 
plished by the Boston School of Commerce and the consequent 
demand for its graduates on the part of business men. He also cited 
the work of the New York High School of Commerce and similar 
institutions in other places. 
The scholarly paper by Dr. Edmund J. James, president of the 
State University of Illinois, on the “ Development of business educa-
-P-A-G-E-506
    478 EDUCATION REPORT. 1916. 
tion in the United States” was the feature of the session. He gave 
an interesting sketch of the history of commercial education in this 
country and related his experience as a professor in the Wharton 
School, Philadelphia. He said that the highest type of business 
education should be sought for in the universities, and he prophesied 
that commercial training as an integral part of the university cur- 
riculum would eventually surpass that of the commercial technical 
schools of Germany. The address was a presentation of the philos- 
ophy of commercial training. i 
Dr. Edwin F. Gray closed the afternoon with a paper on the 
difficulty of introducing technical subjects into the schools, which 
were forced to take up the burden of vocational education. He 
therefore made a strong plea for the introduction of business high 
schools throughout the country. 
The second general session of Section IV was presided over by 
Dr. Ernesto Nelson, national inspector of higher education of 
Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
The address by Dr. Nelson on “ What should be the primary and 
what the secondary purpose of secondary education ” created a pro- 
found impression. He dealt with fundamentals in pedagogy and 
attacked the entire system of organized education as consisting 
largely of memoriter work. He declared that the university is 
largely responsible for the ills of the present system. 
* Said the speaker: 
In the school of to-day, and, to a certain extent, even in the primary school, 
knowledge getting is throwing into the shade all other activities more vitally 
concerned with the character-forming end of education. This is due to the fact 
that the university, being the educational institution which first gave education 
a tangible social value, has forced its own standards down through the whole 
educational system to such an extent that even to-day the amount of infor- 
mation supplied is the universally accepted test of the amount of knowledge 
given or received.* 
Dr. Nelson was followed by Prof. Dario E. Salas, of Chile, who 
discussed the subject of primary education and taxation for the same 
as applicable to conditions in Chile. Dr. K. G. Matheson, president 
of the Georgia School of Technology, Atlanta, Ga., was introduced 
to the assemblage. He dwelt briefly on the advantages to be derived 
from scholarships for enterprising Latin-American students in 
American technical schools and emphasized the good results that 
would flow therefrom, commercial as well as friendly social inter- 
course between North and South America. 
Prof. Juan Monteverde, of Uruguay, read a paper on the “ Purposes 
of secondary education in the American Republics,” in which he

EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 479 
emphasized the fact that the main purpose of secondary education 
should be to create in the people a consciousness of their social obli- 
gations. It should, secondly, prepare the mind for higher studies. 
Prof. Monteverde was followed by Dr. T. Muhm, of Chis, who 
delivered an able address on medical education. 
The piéce de résistance of the meeting was the able and scholarly 
address by Dr. Luis A. Baralt, professor of the Institute of Habana, 
Cuba, on “ What remains to be done for education. Wanted: A 
thoroughgoing reform in Pan American education.” Dr. Baralt’s 
discourse was characterized by its highly idealistic tone. He said: 
Much has been done for our education, but much also remains to be done. 
Radical reforms ought to be introduced in all the important parts of educa- 
tion—the end, the ideal, the spirit, the matter taught, the methods, and the 
extent of education. 
He deplored the fact that much of the teaching lacks universal 
solidarity, spirituality, and consecration. It is largely selfish and 
utilitarian, while it ought to be social and altruistic. “Most teach- 
ers,” he declared, “ are deficient in the missionary spirit, which alone 
can produce the enthusiasm their sacred and sublime calling should 
awaken.” He said a solution must be found for the great problem 
of spiritual or religious knowledge in the schools without any dog- 
matic or sectarian teaching. 
Dr. Baralt was followed by Prof. John Driscoll Fitz-Gerald, of 
the University of Illinois, who set forth briefly the principal interests 
of university students in the United States, meaning thereby the 
“extra curricular” interests, such as journalism, music, drama, ath- 
letics, fraternity and sorority life, graduate clubs, foreign-language 
clubs, and religious work. 
Dr. R. E. Duran, of Honduras, discussed the subject of the inter- 
change of students and teachers; also the recognition of degrees 
and technical diplomas in the different American Republics. 
He thought an agreement among all the American Republics would 
be the most efficacious method for organizing a systematic interchange 
of students and teachers in their universities as well as for obtaining 
a mutual recognition of the technical and professional degrees 
granted by high-grade institutions of the said Republics, the Pan 
American Union being commissioned with both purposes. 
Dr. Augustus S. Downing, first assistant commissioner in higher 
education, Albany, N. Y., presented a plan for securing a mutual 
recognition of technical and professional degrees granted by insti- 
tutions of the first rank in the several American Republics. 
The last general session of Section IV was opened with an interest- 
ing paper on the Pan American Bibliographic Union, by Dr. Carlos 
S. Cruz, of Chile, which was read by Dr. Dario E. Salas. The  
-P-A-G-E-508
  480 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
writer maintained that a bibliographic union would bring intel- 
lectual advantages similar to the political and commercial advantages 
of the Pan American Union at Washington, and he advocated the 
establishment by each national library of a central office for biblio- 
graphic information. : 
The address by Prof. Narciso Garay, director of the National 
Conservatory of Music and Declamation of the Republic of Panama, 
was a scholarly presentation, of the influence of the State in pro- 
moting the study of music in the Americas. According to the 
writer the Spanish-American culture has been derived from Euro- 
pean sources, and the result has been the centralization of govern- 
ment and the cultivation of the fine arts and their encouragement 
by the State. The ideals of North America, on the contrary, find 
their origin for the most part in the intense individualism of Eng- 
land, which left to the individual the pursuit of the arts. 
Dr. José M. Galvez, of the University of Chile, read a paper on 
“ A scheme for modern education,” in which he emphasized the 
growing bulk of human knowledge and the difficulty of acquiring 
more than a segment of it. He summarized his conclusions as fol- 
lows: (1) Professional training should be highly specialized from 
the beginning; (2) secondary professional arts and sciences should 
be abridged; and (8) time spent in reading and writing should be 
shortened in every way possible. 
Dr. Carlos M. Macedo, of Peru, presented a paper in Spanish on 
“Medical relations in the Americas.” 
Alvin S. Pope spoke on “ Education at the Panama-Pacific Expo- 
sition” and John A. Brashear on the “ Educational fund commission 
of Pittsburgh, Pa.” 
In an ably written paper on “Industrial education in Latin 
America” Harold E. Everley told about the growth of industrial 
education in Latin-American countries, emphasizing the desirability 
of extending this form of education in primary schools. 
Among other desiderata suggested by Mr. Everley were the Gov- 
ernment control of industrial schools and the establishment of a 
closer relationship between the schools and the industries. 
Upon the suggestion of the chairman, Dr. José M. Galvez, the 
topic of Mr. Everley’s paper was made the subject of an interesting 
discussion. Dr. E. Nelson explained the status of industrial educa- 
tion in Argentina. Dr. Galvez said that the general characteristics of 
Latin-American nations were responsible for the theoretical character 
of their education. Especially in regard to industrial schools, the 
still prevailing scorn of manual labor presents an important ob- 
stacle to the introduction of a more practical training. Dr. Milton 
Fairchild emphasized the idealistic attitude of South American edu- 
cators, and expressed hopes that both North and South America
-P-A-G-E-509
    
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 481 
will be ripe soon for the introduction of moral education in their 
educational systems. : 
The question of language teaching was given considerable atten- 
tion in this prolonged discussion. All speakers agreed upon the 
necessity of the obligatory teaching of Spanish in public schools of 
the United States and English in Latin America. 
The discussion gradually became an informal round-table affair. 
Among other topics discussed was the question of popular feeling 
in Latin-American countries toward this country. Dr. Galvez as- 
sured the United States delegates of a perfect feeling of friendship 
on the part of South American nations. The old distrust and mis- 
conceptions are rapidly melting away as the peaceful and friendly 
intentions of this country become more generally known among 
Latin-American peoples. 
Resolutions were passed emphasizing the importance of promoting a knowl- 
edge of the achievements and influence of the founders of the independence of 
the American Republics among the peoples thereof, and suggesting that the 
principal details of the lives of the liberators and statesmen of the continent 
be included in courses of study in schools of the American Republics. 
That there be established in the universities of the United States chairs of 
the history, development, and ideals of the Latin American peoples, and in the 
universities of Latin America chairs of the history, development, and ideals 
of the people of the United States. 
That Spanish be taught more generally in the schools, colleges, and univer- 
sities of the United States and that English be taught more generally in the edu- 
cational institutions of the Latin American Republics, and that both languages 
be taught from the point of view of American life, literature, history, and social 
institutions. 
That the study of sociology in American universities where it is not at pres- 
ent taught be inaugurated. 
That the Governments of the American Republics be petitioned to further the 
interchange of educators of all grades and of students of university, normal, and 
technical training, and to encourage both to make visits of instruction to other 
American countries. 
That there be published a series of volumes, entitled the “Pan American 
Library,” with the object of popularizing, in the several languages spoken on 
the continent, the best scientific, literary, and artistic works of American 
authors. 
Confirming the resolution adopted at the First Pan American Scientific 
Congress of 1908-9, the congress recommended the organization in connection 
with the Pan American Union of a department of education, which should— 
(a) Be intrusted with the publication, in Spanish, Portuguese, French, and 
English, of such works on education as are of importance to the American 
countries ; 
(b) Keep the different Republics in touch with educational progress; 
(c) Promote in each country the scientific study of educational problems 
from both national and American standpoints ; 
(d) Facilitate the interchange of ideas and information among the teachers 
of the continent, and in general, to serve the educational interests of the 
Americas.

SUBSECTIONS, 
Subsections were held on agricultural education, education of 
women, elementary education, engineering education, university edu- 
cation, commercial education, medical education, etc. 
An enthusiastic conference on “ Training for foreign service” was 
held in connection with the section on commercial education. 
Commissioner Claxton inspired the meeting with his faith in the 
possibilities of training for commercial service, both public and 
private. 
John Barrett, director general of the Pan American Union, spoke 
eloquently of the opportunities for political and social relations be- 
tween the American Republics. : 
Mr. W. J. Carr, director of the consular service, then presented a 
clear and frank statement of the duties and qualifications of the 
service. He made it clear that the demand for trained men is not 
extensive enough to warrant the establishment of a school for special 
training in the consular service, but pointed out the fact that training 
for foreign-trade service furnished a preparation quite adequate to 
meet the requirements for service abroad, either public or private. 
This need for men trained for foreign trade was emphasized by 
the next speaker, Mr. James A. Farrell, chairman of the National. 
Foreign Trade Council. In a concise manner he outlined the elements 
essential for effective training for this service. 
These papers called forth many pertinent comments. An interest- 
ing side light was thrown upon the problem of language training, 
especially in English, by Dr. Edgar Ewing Brandon, of Miami 
University. 
A joint session of the sections on university education and ex- 
change of professors was characterized by an endeavor to base Pan 
American relations on the ground of common development of educa- 
tion and science. 
The session was presided over by Dr. F. P. Keppel, of Columbia 
University. 
Prof. John Bassett Moore presented a paper entitled “The or- 
ganization and development of a plan for the systematic exchange of 
university students and university professors between the several 
American Republics.” In this paper Prof. Moore emphasized the 
necessity of systematic organization of exchange of professors. The 
practical organization of this plan should be in the form of estab- 
lishing in different universities chairs on history, institutions, civili- 
zation, and ideals of nations, represented by the respective foreign 
professors. Regarding the exchange of students, Prof. Moore offered 
a suggestion that youths should not be sent abroad at a very imma-
-P-A-G-E-511
  
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS, 483 
ture age, for it has been shown by actual experience that they become 
completely estranged from their home country. 
Prof. Narcisco Garay read a paper, “ On the road toward the Pan 
American University,” proposing to establish an educational institu- 
tion in Panama that would serve as an intellectual link to all Amer- 
ican Republics. 
Sefiorita Graciela Mandujano pictured the status of instruction in 
modern languages in Chile, the difficulties with which it was con- 
fronted at the beginning, and how these difficulties were overcome by 
application of modern methods. The people of Chile feel the neces- . 
sity of learning English; the American people have no compelling 
need of learning Spanish. A mutual recognition of languages of 
their prospective allies on the part of all American Republics would 
constitute a powerful factor in making for a Pan American unity. 
Dr. Clyde Furst, of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching, presented a paper on the status of university profes- 
sors in the United States. The closing statement of Dr. Furst’s paper 
gave an eloquent summary of its contents: “ There is no better status 
in the land than that of university professors.” 
Prof. L. S. Rowe’s paper, “The desirability of affording reciprocal 
opportunities to teachers in secondary schools in the United States 
and the countries of Central and South America,” struck the keynote 
of the whole session. 
“The strengthening of ties binding this country and South Amer- 
ica can not be accomplished by merely intensifying our commercial 
relations with them” was the statement of Prof. Rowe. It is by 
maintaining permanent contact in cultural development of all the 
countries concerned that the real understanding will be achieved. 
This cooperation must come through the efforts of the peoples as well 
as the Governments. The following measures were proposed by Prof. 
Rowe for this purpose: 
(1) The appointment of groups of teachers of primary and secondary schools 
to become acquainted with conditions throughout the continent. 
(2) Interchange of university students between the United States and Latin- 
American countries. 
(8) Interchange of professors. 
(4) Creation of opportunities for Latin-American technical students to re- 
ceive training in great industrial establishments in this country. 
One of the meetings of the subsection on university education was 
devoted to university-extension work in its various phases, but more 
particularly to the relation of the university to public service and 
the work of governmental administration. Dr. F. L. McVey, presi- 
dent of the University of North Dakota, emphasized the importance 
of trained men for the functions of government. He said: 
The part the universities must play in this new movement for efficiency in 
public service is important and not altogether clear as to procedure. The State
-P-A-G-E-512
  484 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
authorities are not fully in sympathy with such a move. Consequently the 
university must build up a background of opinion through extension lectures 
and classroom instruction from which will proceed two results—(1) a con- 
stantly enlarging public opinion and (2) a growing group of young men looking 
for opportunities in the new field of professional government. 
In the discussion of extramural services of State and endowed uni- 
versities, etc., Dr. Edward K: Graham, president of the University of 
North Carolina, dwelt on the humanistic side of the question and Dr. 
John A. Fairlie, of the University of Illinois, on the governmental. 
The paper by Prof. Herman G. James, of the University of Texas, 
on the governmental phase of the theme, was read by Prof. Manning. 
Dr. Fairlie made an historical résumé of extension work in the 
United States. He thought the formal organization of university 
extension was more highly developed in State universities, but 
endowed institutions were also active. 
Dr. James emphasized the fact that it is natural and right that— 
The State university should compensate the State’s service by rendering 
expert decisions on problems that the latter is called on to solve and con- 
cerning which it must legislate. 
High governmental posts, such as those of the 10 departments—State, 
Treasury, War, Navy, Post Office, Interior, Justice, Agriculture, Commerce, 
and Labor—are not filled by special competition in the frequently technical 
problems they have to solve; nevertheless the President frequently calls the 
incumbents of said posts to solve questions of government. This would be 
an opportunity to consult the opinion of university professors. We can, of 
course, make an exception of the Departments of War, Navy, and Post Office. 
The Secretary of State, the President, and the Senators are also not in- 
cumbents by special competition in the affairs with which they must deal, 
and as said affairs are often of the very highest social or economic importance 
the university professors could be consulted as higher authorities. 
Would it not be right to intrust matters of the importance of such as go to 
the Nation’s Attorney General for judgment to a body of savants, such as 
university professors? ; 
It is needless to add that the affairs of other departments would benefit 
if directed by more learned and broader judgment. Our university professors 
could lend such service to the Nation by dividing their year’s work and devot- 
ing one-half to university work, the other to questions of government. 
Still more important would be the services of our professors in the legisla- 
tion of the several States. 
They might also render excellent services as examiners of candidates for 
the numerous and varied technical positions in the administration. The neces- 
sary periodic amendment of the Constitution would also be better advised if 
intrusted to our professors. 
The services of our professors would be extended even to cooperation in 
the improvement of municipal administration. Our universities could main- 
tain a special department to deal with professional and technical matters in 
their respective communities, especially matters of valuation, others of engi- 
neering, hygiene, administration of properties, and city surveys and maps. 
Our universities could also organize an intermunicipal association to bring 
the respective officials together in conventions and by means of publications.
-P-A-G-E-513
    
EDUCATIONAL BOARDS, FOUNDATIONS, AND ASSOCIATIONS. 485 
By establishing correspondence they could also contribute to the instruction 
of municipal employees; for example, the appraisers, a very necessary matter 
in our municipalities. 
The discussion that followed the papers was animated. Dr. P. P. 
Claxton, United States Commissioner of Education, precipitated 
matters by asking if it were not inadvisable for the university, in its 
State relations, to have any police functions added thereto. It were 
better for the university to confine itself to preparing efficient men 
for the public service and acting in an advisory capacity to the State 
only. The general trend of the discussion was toward the dissevera- 
tion of such relations between the State universities and the State, 
as outlined by Dr. Claxton; for example, making the university 
responsible for enforcing the law on food standards. The inspec- 
tion of foods might well be undertaken in the laboratories of the 
universities, but the enforcing of the law on the subject should be 
left wholly to the proper police department of the State. And so 
with factory inspection, ete. Giving such executive powers to the 
universities, he maintained, precipitated partisan feeling and 
brought the institutions of higher education into politics.

CHAPTER XXIX. 
EDUCATION IN THE TERRITORIES AND 
DEPENDENCIES. 
ALASKA. 
By Wu1am Hamitton, Alaska Division, Bureau of Education. 
During the year the field force of the Bureau of Education in 
Alaska consisted of 4 superintendents, 1 assistant superintendent, 102 
teachers, 6 physicians, and 7 nurses. Seventy schools were main- 
tained, with an enrollment of about 3,600. Complete reports have not 
yet been received from the remote schools in the interior and in the 
Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean regions. 
Conspicuous among the activities of the Bureau of Education in 
Alaska during the year has been the endeavor to aid the unique colony 
at Metlakahtla, on Annette Island. 
In August, 1887, William Duncan, an independent missionary 
working among the Tsimpsean Indians of British Columbia, brought 
to the Annette Islands, in the southeastern part of Alaska, a colony 
of between 800 and 1,000 of these Indians from the old town of 
Metlakahtla, in British Columbia. By act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat., 
1101), Congress set apart Annette Islands for the use and occupancy 
ofthese Indians under such rules and regulations and subject to such 
restrictions as might be prescribed from time to time by the Secretary 
of the Interior. 7“ 
Under the leadership of Mr. Duncan, this: colony made rapid 
progress. The heads of families of the colony built good homes on 
lots set apart for them; a large church, a schoolhouse, and other 
public buildings were erected. A salmon cannery and a sawmill 
were established, first through the cooperation of Mr. Duncan, the 
Indians, and philanthropic persons in the United States; later, Mr. 
Duncan bought the interests of these persons and of the natives and 
operated the cannery and the sawmill as his personal property, em- 
ploying native labor. 
During recent years the cannery and sawmill have not been oper- 
ated. Since these industries closed, the Indians have no means of 
making a living on the island and have had to go elsewhere for em- 
487  
-P-A-G-E-516
    488 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
ployment, and the colony was rapidly deteriorating. Three years 
ago the Government established in the village of Metlakahtla a 
school which it now maintains with five teachers. In order to give 
the Metlakahtlans an opportunity for self-support on the island, 
it was decided last winter to put the cannery and the sawmill again 
in operation. To this end the cannery building was leased for a 
term of five years, beginning April 1, 1916, to a cannery operator 
of Seattle, Wash., on terms which it was estimated would produce 
an annual income of $7,500 for the village, give employment to a 
large percentage of the inhabitants, and enable the natives at the 
end of the period of the lease to purchase all of the lessee’s interests 
and to operate the cannery themselves under the direction of the 
Federal Government. 
On May 17, while necessary repairs on the building were being 
made by the lessee and while he was awaiting the arrival of new 
machinery, the cannery building was completely destroyed by fire, 
as were also the warehouse and a portion of the wharf. Because of 
this loss by fire the lease is rendered ineffective. The natives are 
again without any means of support on the island, nor is there any 
way of providing for such support until the cannery can be replaced. 
and the sawmill repaired. There is also pressing need for the repair 
of the pipe line which brings water from a mountain lake to the 
village and without which there is no adequate supply of water either 
for drinking or for protection against fire. 
In this emergency an earnest, but unsuccessful, effort was made to 
secure from Congress a reimbursable fund of $25,000 for the en- 
couragement of industries among the natives of Alaska, which would 
have been used first for the rebuilding of the cannery, the repairing 
of the sawmill and the pipe line at Metlakahtla, and for assisting the 
natives in the operation of these industries. 
In addition to rendering possible the rehabilitation of the Metla- 
* kahtla colony, the granting of this reimbursable fund would enable 
the bureau to repeat in many parts of Alaska the success which has 
attended the industrial enterprises at Hydaburg in southeast Alaska. 
In 1911 the natives of two villages in southeast Alaska migrated 
to a site selected on account of its advantages with regard to hunting 
and fishing, where they founded a village named Hydaburg. Under 
the supervision of the teacher of the United States public school, 
a cooperative company of the natives was organized to transact the 
mercantile business of the settlement and to operate a sawmill, the 
machinery for which was sent them by the Bureau of Education at 
a cost of $2,200. The Hydaburg people have turned a dense forest 
into a thriving town with a busy wharf, a sawmill that turns out 
good lumber for them at a cost of $10 a thousand, neat single-family
-P-A-G-E-517
EDUCATION IN ALASKA, 489 
homes instead of the communal houses of their old villages, a long 
boarded street of which they are proud as the finest in Alaska, and 
a cooperative store which the first year made a clear profit of 125 
per cent, paying a cash dividend of 50 per cent and adding-75 per 
cent to the capital stock. The cooperative company was started with 
a capital of about $2,000, and within four years it has distributed 
$12,727.53 in dividends. The Hydaburg people have been able to 
keep their money in the village, which is prosperous and independent. 
The cooperative company has repaid to the Government $2,200, the 
cost of the machinery in the sawmill, which has been covered into 
the United States Treasury. Had this amount been expended from 
a reimbursable fund instead of from the annual appropriation, it 
could have been used by the bureau in creating industries in other 
villages. 
In order to protect the natives from those traders who charge 
exorbitant prices for food and clothing and pay as little as possible 
for native products, the bureau fosters cooperative stores owned and 
managed by the natives, under the supervision of the teachers. The 
most successful of these stores is the one at Hydaburg; other stores 
are in operation at Klawock and Klukwan, in southeastern Alaska, 
on Atka Island, in the Aleutian Chain, and on St. Lawrence Island, 
in Bering Sea. These enterprises have been aided by the policy 
of securing by Executive order reservation for the exclusive use of 
the natives of tracts of land within which they are conducted. 
Eskimos on the shores of Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean have 
until within recent years had to dispose of their furs and other 
valuable commodities to the local trader. Now many packages of 
valuable furs, ivory, and whalebone are sent by parcels post to the 
Alaska Division of the Bureau of Education at Seattle, which sells 
the furs for the natives at auction to the highest bidder. The total 
of such sales since July 1, 1918, is $25,070.51. With this money 
the Seattle office of the Alaska Division purchases at wholesale rates, 
in accordance with the requests of the natives, food supplies, clothing, 
lumber, and household goods, which are carried to their destination 
by the vessel making annual delivery of supplies to the settlements 
along the Arctic coast. : 
As the result of efforts continued during several years, Congress 
granted $25,000 to provide for the medical relief of the natives of 
Alaska during the fiscal year 1915-16; in addition, $18,733.98 of the 
appropriation for education of natives of Alaska was used for that 
purpose, making a total of $43,733.98 for medical relief during the 
year. A hospital in which indigent natives receive free treatment 
was established in Juneau at a cost of $14,215 for erection and equip- 
ment; six physicians and seven nurses were employed; the small
-P-A-G-E-518
  490 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
hospitals at Nulato, Kotzebue, and Kanakanak were continued; 
payments were made for the treatment of natives in hospitals and 
by physicians in several of the Alaskan towns upon the request of 
superintendents or teachers; and, as heretofore, all teachers were 
supplied with medicines for use in relieving minor ailments. 
The reports from the reindeer stations for the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 1915, the latest complete information received, show a total 
of 70,248 reindeer, distributed among 76 herds. Of the 70,248 rein- 
deer, 46,683, or 66 per cent, were owned by 1,140 natives; 3,408, or 5 
per cent, were owned by the United States; 6,890, or 10 per cent, were 
owned by missions; and 13,262, or 19 per cent, were owned by Lapps. 
The total income of the natives from the reindeer industry during 
the fiscal year, exclusive of the meat and hides used by the natives 
themselves, was $81,997. The total, 70,248, is a net increase of 21 
per cent during the fiscal year, notwithstanding the fact that about 
8,500 reindeer were killed for meat and skins during the year. 
Within less than a generation the Eskimos throughout northern 
and western Alaska have been advanced through one entire stage of 
civilization, from making their living by the precarious method of 
hunting and fishing to the pastoral stage in which by their own in- 
dustry they provide against want. However, there is still need for 
the extension of the industry on the Aleutian Islands, and especially 
in the delta country between the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers, 
where hundreds of natives are living in abject poverty, unreached by 
civilizing influences. 
A recent feature of the reindeer enterprise is the holding of fairs 
or conventions, the object of which is, by the interchange of expe- 
riences and by competition, to increase the interest and efficiency of 
those engaged in the industry. Great enthusiasm was shown by the 
large delegations attending the four conventions which were held 
during the past winter. Activities in connection with the reindeer 
industry, such as lassoing, driving, herding, pasturing, and butcher- 
ing were discussed. There were also races of various descriptions 
and target contests. Prizes were given for the best exhibits of har- 
ness, sleds, fur clothing, snow shoes, and other paraphernalia con- 
nected with the industry. 
HAWAII 
By Henry W. Kinney, Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
The variety of nationalities represented by the children in the pub- 
lic as well as the private schools of Hawaii is illustrated by the fol- 
lowing statistics gathered during the term ending June 30, 1916:

The public-school authorities, however, take no official cognizance 
of the racial differences mentioned ; teachers and pupils of the various 
nationalities are treated on exactly the same plane. Any attempt to 
draw a color or national line would be fraught with widespread 
trouble to the department. 
The increase in school population was, during the past year, 1,378. 
Special efforts have been made to secure as perfect a record for 
attendance as possible. The mild climate which prevails throughout 
the year gives Hawaii an opportunity in this respect, which the 
schools have managed to take advantage of, with the result that the 
figure of attendance for the public schools during the past year was

The examination system which was instituted a few years ago is 
working out exceedingly well and has produced welcome results, 
not only by correcting much faulty grading and by compelling closer 
attention to the course of study than it was possible to exact formerly, 
but also by working constantly toward increasing the standard of 
efficiency. Thus, the examinations of eighth-grade pupils during the 
past three years show the following results:

While the construction of schoolhouses is a function which has 
been placed in the control of the various counties, the department 
has been successful in securing the adoption of certain standard 
plans, covering particularly ventilation, lighting, and other features 
 
-P-A-G-E-520
    492 ’ EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
of importance. Because of the climate, schoolhouse construction in 
Hawaii escapes largely the complications which make it a difficult 
problem elsewhere. Three or four types of plans, each adapted to the 
particular conditions, have been found sufficient. These have been 
adopted by the various communities, and much waste of time and 
expense in making plans and specifications has been eliminated. The 
cost of construction has also been materially reduced. 
The number of teachers applying each year for positions in the 
Hawaiian Islands is out of all proportion to the number of vacancies 
existing there. The Honolulu Normal School has, in the past, sent 
out each year between 35 and 40 graduates. This number does not 
nearly meet the need of the department for new instructors. Efforts 
have therefore been made to increase the attendance in the normal 
school, in order that as many teachers as possible may be obtained in 
Hawaii. The department has found, generally speaking, that 
Hawaii-trained teachers do quite as satisfactory work as do those 
who have been trained elsewhere. Furthermore, they remain in the 
service longer than do those coming from the mainland, who often 
remain only one year, having then satisfied the motives of curiosity 
which inspired their seeking employment. The Hawaii-trained 
teacher also possesses the advantage of acquaintance with the vari- 
ous local conditions which a teacher should know in order to carry 
on work successfully. The efforts of the department appear to be 
sure of success, as the freshman class of the normal school last year 
was twice as large as it had been formerly, while the freshman class of 
the coming year will probably count over 100 members. In the mean- 
time, the department has for years past secured a large proportion 
of its teachers from the mainland. During the past two years. 
practically all of these have been secured from the State normal 
schools of California, largely because the proximity of California has 
made them more easily available than those from more distant places. 
The nationalities of the teachers in the public and private schools of 
Hawaii are as follows:

EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. ~ 493 
The four high schools located respectively on the Islands of Oahu, 
Maui, Kauai, and Hawaii, were during the past year placed on a 
basis of uniformity through the adoption of a uniform schedule of 
studies and points. The department is, however, planning to exer- 
cise a more complete control over these schools than has been the 
case in the past. 
Industrial training and home economics continue to receive em- 
phasis. School kitchens now exist in practically all the large schools, 
where cocking is taught the girls in the upper grades. The material 
prepared is disposed of by sale to the pupils, who are furnished 
with wholesome and satisfying luncheons at a cost of from 24 cents 
to 5 cents, an additional 5 cents being added when desert is fur- 
nished. The results have been gratifying in the extreme. Not only 
have the girls of the various races learned the principles involved in 
the preparation of food, which were in the case of some of the na- 
tionalities, if not unknown, at least unobserved, but the children 
who eat the lunches are securing a very practical knowledge of food 
values, which, particularly in the case of these races which have a 
tendency toward suffering physical deterioration through improper 
nourishment, is of a very considerable importance. The sociological® 
importance of equalizing the standard of living of the various races 
of the coming generation can not be overlooked. 
Practically all the large schools have also been furnished with 
shops, in which training is given in- carpentry and the allied arts. 
This is only prevocational in character, but as many of the pupils, 
particularly the Hawaiians, show considerable adaptability, some 
very gratifying results have already been obtained. Furniture has 
been built, schoolhouses repaired and, in a few instances, the pupils 
have built schoolhouses of the simple type of construction. 
The work along agricultural lines has not been developed in as 
great a measure as is desirable. School gardens are maintained in 
most of the large schools in the country, but only in one district, 
namely, the windward side of the Island of Hawaii, have home 
gardens been carried on on a large scale. This feature of the work 
has, however, been found to be exceedingly successful where it has 
been tried, and, during the coming year, the department plans to 
extend its activities in this regard throughout all the islands of the 
group. 
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 
[From the Sixteenth Annual Report of the Director of Education, covering the calendar 
year 1915.] 
GENERAL STATEMENT. 
The substantial educational progress which has been reported for 
several years past has continued, and the work of the public schools
-P-A-G-E-522
    494 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
is proceeding systematically along the general lines determined upon 
‘during the past decade and a half. f 
One branch in which there has been rapid progress is the exten- 
sion of public school work into the field of social economy. The year 
has witnessed the extension of public-welfare work, including the 
playground movement, social activities, care of children, health and 
sanitation, athletics, public amusements and entertainments, the im- 
provement of home conditions through various lines of school indus- 
trial work, and the use of the schools as the social and civic centers 
of their communities. 
For a number of years it had been felt by some that the academic 
branches were being somewhat neglected in favor of the newer and 
more striking undertakings in industrial and physical training. Ina 
number of ways there has been opportunity in the past year to. give 
a new impetus to academic instruction. 
The rapid progress made during the past six years in school indus- 
trial work has brought this feature to its full development as a 
branch of public instruction, and brings the authorities face to face 
with a problem entirely new in public school affairs—that of taking 
®p the industrial work at the point where it ceases to be simply 
instruction and becomes a commercial proposition. 
With respect to school enrollment and attendance, the number of 
schools in operation during the year reached a total of 4,386. For 
the previous school year, 1914-15, they numbered 4,187; for 1913-14, 
4,235; and for the preceding year 2,934. The total annual enroll- 
ment through December, 1915, reached 606,597; the annual enroll- 
ment for this fraction of a school year is greater than for any 
previous similar period. For the entire school year 1914-15 the 
figures were 610,519, and for 1913-14, 621,030. The average monthly 
enrollment for the present school year through December, 1915, was 
526,095, as compared with 493,763 for 1914-15, and 489,070 for the 
preceding year. In average daily attendance, most important of all, 
the figure for the present school year through December, 1915, 
reached 473,218; for 1914-15 it was 441,742, and 428,552 for the 
preceding year. It is very significant that in average monthly en- 
rollment and average daily attendance the proportion of increase 
during the past two years is greater than for the total annual enroll- 
ment; in consequence, the percentage of attendance increased from 
88 for the school year 1913-14 to 89 for 1914-15, and at the present 
rate there will be further improvement in percentage of attendance 
for the present year. 
In number of teachers actually on duty at the close of December, 
1915, there were 488 Americans and 10,214 Filipinos. At the close 
of schools in March, 1915, these numbers were 538 Americans and - 
 
-P-A-G-E-523
  
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 495 
9,307 Filipinos, while for the preceding year the figures were, re- 
spectively, 612 and 8,850. 
Considerable progress has been made during the year in the pro- 
gram for adequate school buildings and sites. At the close of De- 
cember, 1915, for the 4,386 schools in operation, the number of per- 
manent buildings reached 723 and the semipermanent and temporary 
buildings numbered 1,338. Of the permanent buildings, 344 were of 
standard bureau of education plan; at the same time there were 109 
standard-plan permanent buildings under construction. It is esti- 
mated that in June, 1913, there were less than 600 buildings that 
would be classed as permanent and adequate structures, 180 of which 
were of standard bureau of education plan. By December, 1914, 
the permanent buildings numbered nearly 700, of which less than 300 
were of standard plan. The number of adequate school sites—that 
is, sites which reach the standard of at least one-half a hectare for 
rural schools and one hectare for central schools—continues to be 
about one-third of the total number of sites belonging to the school 
authorities. 
TEACHERS. 
In the past 12 or 15 years Filipino teachers have taken over all the 
primary work and practically all the intermediate work; still more 
recently they have taken over the greater part of the supervising 
and industrial work, and they are now entering largely into the 
secondary teaching service. In this connection it must be recalled 
that the years of their tuition have been short, and that these young 
men and women are only now coming to the years of maturity and 
judgment which are essential to their success in this field. The 
latest step has been the placing of all the affairs of one school 
division entirely in their hands. 
It was thought best that the change should be made in the division 
of Bataan, and Mr. Camilo Osias, the first Filipino division super- 
intendent of schools to be appointed, took over the affairs of that 
division at the opening of the school year in June, 1915. Mr. Osias 
spent several years as a Government student in the United States, 
following a course in teaching and school administration. Upon 
his return to the islands he was for several years a supervising 
teacher in the Province of Union. Later he was assigned to Manila 
as academic supervisor. From this position he was promoted to the 
division superintendency of the division of Bataan. The success of 
the experiment in the Province of Bataan seems assured; the Fili- 
pinos have entered upon school work among their own people with 
enthusiasm and seriousness. 
In line with this discussion it may be well to set down some 
figures as to the number of American teachers who have been  
-P-A-G-E-524
    496 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
employed in the bureau of education during past years. The earliest 
period for which there is reliable record is the school year 1901-2, 
when 790 American teachers were on duty. This number continued 
about the same until the year 1908-9, when 825 teachers were em- 
ployed. Since that time the number has been a constantly decreas- 
ing one, as follows: 782, 683, 664, 658, 612, 538; until in December, 
1915, there were only 488 American teachers on duty. In the mean- 
time the number of Filipino teachers has grown from 7,949 in 1908-9 
to 10,214 in December, 1915. The total number of teachers has in- 
creased from 8,774 in 1908-9 to 10,702 at the close of this calendar 
year. During the earlier years of the administration American 
teachers were employed in all branches of the school work, assisted 
by Filipino teachers in the primary grades only. By the school 
year 1906-7 there were 82 Filipinos teaching in the intermediate 
grades and 34 teaching in the high schools. At that time began their 
assignment to supervising work, and a few years later, with the 
development of industrial work, as industrial teachers and super- 
visors. For the school year 1914-15 the figures were: Primary. 
7,556 Filipinos, 14 Americans; intermediate, 833 Filipinos, 104 
Americans; secondary, 17 Filipinos, 175 Americans; industrial, 726 
Filipinos, 106 Americans; supervising, 175 Filipinos, 189 Americans. 
By December, 1915, there were teaching in the intermediate grades 
92 Americans, as compared with 1,004 Filipinos; in the secondary 
work the number of Filipinos had increased to 61, as compared with 
173 Americans; in the supervising work the number of Filipinos 
had come to exceed the number of Americans by 200 to 120; in 
industrial work the ratio had become 718 to 87. 
The salaries paid to Filipino teachers have risen steadily, though 
not in proportion to the increase in attainments. They are still not 
so high as in other lines of work requiring no higher attainments 
and no more energy or ability. The number of teachers is so great, 
however, that any considerable increase in salaries would involve 
an expenditure of funds that is at present beyond the means of the 
government. Since 1910 the average salary paid to Filipino in- 
sular teachers has increased from #44.66 per month to 56.32, and 
that paid to municipal teachers from 18.29 to ®22.05. The average 
_ salary paid to all Filipino teachers, insular and municipal, has in- 
creased from 21.56 to 26.35. 
The total number of Filipino teachers on duty in December, 1915, 
was 10,214, of whom 1,270 were insular, 8,891 municipal, and 53 
apprentice teachers serving without pay. Of these, 6,997 were male 
and 3,217 female. From an inauspicious beginning about 15 years 
ago, the Filipino teachers have been steadily developing into a corps 
of efficient and well-trained young men and women.

PORTO RICO. 
By P. G. Mritter, Commissioner of Education for Porto Rico. 
ENROLLMENT AND SCHOOL POPULATION, 
Porto Rico has an estimated population of 1,200,000, of. whom 
419,282 are of legal school age, i. e., between 5 and 18 years, and 
211,588 of compulsory school age, i. e., between 8 and 14 years. For 
1915-16 the total enrollment in all public schools, excluding dupli- 
cates, was 151,562. Of these, 1,050 were enrolled in the University of 
Porto Rico and 526 in charitable and correctional schools. Of the 
149,986 pupils enrolled in schools under the department, 84,399 were 
males and 65,587 females; 117,208 were white and 32,780 colored. 
The total enrollment was 35.8 per cent of the total population of 
school age and 70.9 per cent of the population of compulsory school 
age, but of the population of compulsory school age only 53.5 per 
cent were enrolled. 
In addition to the pupils enrolled in the public schools, 5,832 
children attended private schools, and more than 400 Porto Rican 
students attended schools in the United States. The average number 
belonging in all schools was 128,840, the average daily attendance 
120,099, or 93.2 per cent. Of the 149,986 pupils enrolled, 2.1 per cent 
 
-P-A-G-E-526
  498 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
were found in secondary schools, 40.4 per cent in elementary urban 
schools, and 57.5 per cent in rural schools. No night schools were 
maintained. 
There were 2,468 teachers—964 men and 1,504 women. American 
teachers number 172; Porto Ricans, 2,296. Of the total number, 2,085 
are white and 383 are colored. 
Of elementary pupils, 59.2 per cent were promoted to the next 
higher grade as against 57.4 per cent the preceding year; but, of those 
who were not absent more than 22 days out of the 162 days in the 
school year, 72.3 per cent were promoted. 
Eighth-grade diplomas were awarded to 2,028 pupils completing 
the elementary school course, and 182 high-school pupils received 
diplomas. : 
There were 14 new graded teachers added to the profession by 
means of departmental examinations, and 106 candidates received 
licenses based on normal diplomas and certificates. 
The schools of Porto Rico were conducted in 1,506 different school 
buildings, representing 2,546 different classrooms. Of these build- 
ings, 486 are public property and 1,020 are rented ; 310 are situated in 
urban centers and 1,196 in rural barrios. The school buildings range 
all the way from the straw-covered shack in remote rural barrios to 
thoroughly modern concrete structures in the larger towns and cities. 
During the past year 59 new sites for school buildings have been ac- 
quired, 13 in urban centers and 46 in rural districts; 36 school build- 
ings have been completed and 47 are in the course of construction. 
The total assessed valuation of property is $183,016,311, or $152.51 
per capita of population. 
The expenditure for educational purposes is $1,348,306 from in- 
sular appropriation and $491,710 from school-board funds, making a 
total of $1,840,016. 
The total per capita expenditure per pupil is $10.40 for elementary 
education and $54.11 for secondary instruction. The per capita 
expenditure per inhabitant is $1.53. 
Special attention has been devoted to rural education, and em- 
phasis has been placed on securing proficiency in the common ele- 
mentary branches in all schools. 
RURAL EDUCATION. 
Of the 419,282 children of school age, 331,233 live in rural barrios. 
Of this number, but 86,152, or 26 per cent, were enrolled in rural 
schools at any time during the year, whereas of the 88,049 children 
of school age in urban centers, 63,834, or 72.5 per cent, were enrolled. 
It is evident from these figures that the greatest educational need 
in Porto Rico is rural education.
-P-A-G-E-527
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 499 
For the purpose of arousing public interest and of extending the 
functions of the rural schools, the department inaugurated a rural 
campaign. The purposes of the campaign were: To reduce illit- 
eracy; to arouse the interest of the rural population in rural educa- 
tion; to help the peasantry improve living conditions; to put these ~ 
people in touch with the world beyond their huts, giving them the 
taste of the things that make life more pleasant; to make the rural 
school the social center of the barrio; to improve rural home and 
community sanitation. 
The campaign developed in various ways: Evening classes for 
adults; parent organizations and meetings; rural conferences; read- 
ing and library facilities; instruction in gardening and rural indus- 
tries; visits to home of parents. The most salient feature of the rural 
campaign was the gathering of parents for the purpose of hearing 
simple addresses and lectures relating to the rural school and com- 
munity life. These meetings were usually held on Sundays, the only 
day in the week when the workingmen could gather together. In- 
vitations were extended through the children to the parents by the 
teacher, who arranged for the meeting. The supervisor, accom- 
panied generally by the president or another member of the school 
board, a physician, and other prominent citizens would present them- 
selves at the appointed hour for the purpose of giving instruction 
by means of lectures. About 700 meetings of this character were 
conducted in rural barrios. To-day the peasant of Porto Rico has 
come to realize that the public school belongs to him as much as it 
does to the planter or merchant. The rural teacher has ceased to be 
a teacher of the school and has become a teacher of the community. 
The visits to homes of the illiterate peasantry have done much to 
stimulate the interest of the parents in schools, and the result is bet- 
ter attendance and greater cooperation with the teacher. The rural 
school is reaching out to the home and assuming a leadership in local 
affairs. It is improving home and communal living conditions with- 
out trespassing into the field of politics. 
PROFESSIONAL READING COURSES FOR GRADED TEACHERS. 
In order to help teachers in their efforts to improve professionally, 
the department prescribed a reading course and sent out carefully 
selected books, giving teachers some of the best and latest ideas 
available on education. This course was not obligatory, the depart- 
ment not making it a requirement for renewing certificates or secur- 
ing positions. 
Supervisors reported that all of the teachers with but few excep- 
tions pursued the course willingly, cheerfully, and faithfully, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-528
    500 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
welcomed the opportunity given them to grow professionally as well 
as to improve their use of the English language. 
The work was conducted by the supervisors of schools or by com- 
petent teachers; the teachers met weekly and the chapters assigned 
were fully discussed. A special effort was made to apply theory to 
local conditions. 
Of the total number of teachers in urban centers, 924 did the 
prescribed reading and 57 failed to do so for various reasons. There 
were 138 rural teachers who also took the reading course voluntarily, 
without the suggestion or requirement of the department. 
Practically all high-school teachers in the service have read Par- 
ker’s Methods of Teaching in High Schools, in addition to other 
works selected by themselves. All high-school teachers and prin- 
cipals were required to submit a written statement at the end of the 
year of their reading and other activities outside of the classroom. 
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS. 
Teachers’ meetings have been held in all districts. Many of these 
took place in rural schools and were given exclusively for the pur- 
pose of instructing rural teachers in rural-school work. 
These meetings may be classified as follows: General meetings, for 
all teachers of the district; graded teachers’ meetings; special meet- 
ings for rural teachers. The graded teachers’ meetings were largely 
devoted to a discussion of the books assigned for the professional 
reading courses. Of general meetings for teachers, 167 were re- 
ported. Educational questions of life interest for all schools were 
discussed. The following subjects are illustrative of the practical 
nature of the topics taken up: Teaching children how to study; how 
to conduct a recitation; how to conduct parents’ meetings; betterment 
of rural conditions; moral and civic training; educational tests; 
seat work; the teaching of Spanish in primary grades; story telling; 
manual work in rural schools; interest in community life; the super- 
vised study plan. 
PARENTS’ MEETINGS. 
Parent organizations are now regularly established in a number 
of districts, and parents’ meetings have been held in every district. 
Parents have been thus attracted to the school and shown what the 
school is doing. Special days were set aside when parents were in- 
vited to visit schools, not only for the purpose of seeing regular work, 
but also to inspect school exhibits. These were not prepared for the 
special occasion, but consisted of regular daily work, in order to 
enable the parents to note and appreciate the progress of their 
children.

EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 501 
EDUCATIONAL TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS, 
Education in Porto Rico presents many and varied problems, and 
a more interesting field for the trained investigator who will come 
with the research spirit can not be found. There are many weak 
points in the system, but the facts as brought out by careful investi- 
gations, tests, and measurements, would be helpful in attacking under- 
lying causes and applying remedies. 
The fact that there is a problem of teaching English well and 
Spanish well to the people of Porto Rico should not prevent making 
other investigations with the unfit and misfit. There is a need for 
a careful study of physical defects as related to school progress, for 
without doubt there are thousands of pupils in Porto Rico with de- 
fective eyesight and hearing, enlarged glands, defective breathing, 
adenoids, and defective teeth. The results of an investigation con- 
ducted during the year in San Germaéu by Drs. Ramirez and Rivera 
Porrata seem to be indicative of what might be found in other places. 
Out of 395 pupils examined, 90 per cent were found with defective 
teeth and 90 per cent had never visited a dentist. 
There is room for the dentist, the physician, and the school nurse, 
and it is to be regretted that ale are not available to carry on these 
important adjuncts of school administration. 
Tests given from the central office in both English and Spanish . 
to measure reasoning ability, accuracy in the fundamental operations, 
spelling in both languages, and in translating the idiomatic expres- 
sions have revealed weaknesses in content and adaptation of the 
course of study, which will be remedied the coming year. 
The Ayres scale for measuring ability in spelling was used as the 
basis for the English spelling tests, and an effort is being made to 
work out a similar scale in Spanish. The Ayres scale for measuring 
the handwriting of children has been used also with excellent results. 
These tests have brought out the need for more efficient teaching 
of fundamentals; of emphasizing minimum essentials; of thorough 
teaching in the lower grades; closer grading to be based on oral ex- 
aminations rather than written; textbooks adapted to the environ- 
ment; and a rearrangement of the language requirements in the lower 
grades. 
Experiments with the hour or supervised study plan were con- 
ducted in the upper grades of San Juan, Ponce, and Mayaguez. The 
results obtained justify a continuance of the plan, especially when 
teachers skilled in teaching pupils how to study can be secured. 
PREVOCATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
The excellent program of prevocational education laid down by 
the preceding commissioner of education for Porto Rico has been de- 
61355°—16——34 
 
-P-A-G-E-530
  502 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
veloped during the year, and the sentiment of the people seems to be 
strongly in favor of this feature of the school curriculum. There is 
a demand for other forms of prevocational education in the ele- 
mentary and secondary schools, besides woodworking and cooking 
and sewing. 
It is hoped that as soon as the funds will permit, a beginning can 
be made in establishing several trade schools, organized at first, per- 
haps, on the half-time plan. Porto Rico is an agricultural country; 
there are few large industrial manufacturing industries, but there 
is a demand for skilled labor; and unless industrial education is 
emphasized for the express purpose of training artisans skilled in 
various trades, serious labor troubles will probably ensue. Although 
trade schools established years ago failed, due no doubt to lack of 
favorable public sentiment, the time is probably now ripe when 
schools of this type can be placed on a successful basis. The initial 
attempt should probably be limited in scope after a careful analysis 
of local needs and abilities and subsequent growth should come from 
the inside. Conservative procedure, if public funds are to be prop- 
erly administered and results obtained commensurate with expenses 
incurred, can not be too highly emphasized. 
Although woodworking for boys and cooking and sewing for 
girls have been incorporated in the urban courses of study of 49 
municipalities, no organized attempt has been made to include this 
phase of instruction in the rural schools. The need is recognized 
and in time it will come. The first consolidated rural school to offer 
prevocational work was organized this year in Barrio Hato Tejas. of 
Bayamé6n. 
RURAL INDUSTRIES. 
There are several very excellent fiber plants growing wild in 
Porto Rico, and these have been utilized by a number of rural teach- 
ers for making rope, baskets, brooms, bridles, and hammocks. These 
articles find ready sale. Considerable interest has been aroused in 
some rural communities, especially in the districts of Yabucoa, Yauco, 
Utuado, and Rio Piedras. Exhibitions of agricultural produce and 
handwork made by the pupils of the rural schools of Yauco and Rio 
Piedras were very praiseworthy and indicate the possibilities of this 
field, especially under efficient guidance. These sporadic attempts 
to suggest industries even on a small scale for “ barrios” will even- 
tually bear fruit, especially if competent instructors can be secured. 
Lace making, drawn work, and embroidery, for which certain sec- 
tions are noted, should be encouraged through the schools, so that 
progress and improvement in the arts can be secured. 
The supervisor of home economics made arrangements with a large 
commercial house in the United States to ship underwear to be hand

embroidered. The experiment was tried in connection with the 
classes in home economics in eight towns, and the girls did very 
creditable work. The underwear was returned and the girls received 
compensation commensurate with the quality and complexity of the 
work done. This attempt to suggest and provide employment for 
the large numbers of unemployed women in Porto Rico has special 
interest. 
SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
School libraries were maintained in 58 municipalities, with a total 
of 26,195 volumes in urban schools and 3,451 in rural schools. At 
present very few of these libraries can properly be called school 
libraries, as most of the books found in them are not at all adequate 
for the needs and interests of pupils. Relatively very few of these 
books were selected and purchased for library purposes. 
In order that school libraries may serve in a more effective manner 
the purpose for which they were established, the department has 
undertaken the preparation of an official library list of English and 
Spanish books. The list has been carefully prepared by selecting 
books and periodicals that are of help to teachers and pupils in 
connection with their work. 
This list will serve as the official guide to school boards in making 
future purchases of library books. 
DOUBLE ENROLLMENT. 
The greatest weakness in the organization at the present time is 
the system of double enrollment, whereby a teacher is placed in 
charge of a group of 40 pupils in the morning and another group in 
the afternoon. This system obtains in the first and second grades of 
the urban schools and in nearly all rural schools. It was introduced 
for the purpose of reducing illiteracy as fast as possible. Whereas 
in the United States this system is in vogue as a matter of economy 
in the school buildings and each group of children has its own 
teacher, in Porto Rico an attempt was made to secure like results 
with one teacher, and herein lies the fallacy. The percentage of 
pupils in-the first grade of urban schools promoted to the second in 
1914-15 was only 45.9 per cent and in rural schools 49 per cent. It 
is readily observed that in the system of double enrollment pupils 
require twice the length of time or more to complete the work of a 
given grade, leading to discouragement on part of both teacher and 
pupil rather than to economy in the expenditure of school funds. 
During 1914-15 the per capita cost of elementary education for 
instruction and maintenance was $10; for buildings and sites, $1.75; 
making a total of $11.75. The education of a given child in the  
-P-A-G-E-532
  504 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
lower grades where the system of double enrollment prevails costs 
this sum multiplied by the number of years spent in that grade. 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND SITES. 
Because of the continued increase in the cost of building materials 
on account of war conditions, the department did not consider it ad- 
visable to encourage the erection of school buildings on an extensive 
scale. On the other hand, in view of the great difficulty of securing 
adequate sites with proper titles, considerable attention has been de- 
voted to this feature of educational work. It is hard to make people 
realize that a school site should be large enough to afford room for 
the children to play, and in the country for carrying on work in 
school gardening. A definite policy has been established not to 
approve sites of less than an acre for rural schools. 
The greatest advancement in the matter of securing sites was 
made by the San Juan school board. Not only have they been 
favored through legislative enactment with three valuable sites, but 
they have also acquired by direct purchase three others for ele- 
mentary schools. After 17 years of American occupation, the capital 
city at last has an appropriate site for erecting a high-school build- 
ing. The San Juan school board purchased the Latimer property in 
Santurce, with an area of 12,580 square meters, at a cost of $30,000. 
An admirable example has been set by Dr. Santiago Veve, of 
Fajardo, who has offered to construct three completely equipped con- 
crete buildings, containing two classrooms, kitchen, and library, one 
in Luquillo, one in Ceiba, and the other in Barrio Sardinera of 
Fajardo, at a total cost of $25,000. So far as known Dr. Veve is the 
first Port Rican to make a gift of this nature to the cause of educa- 
tion. Fifteen sites have been donated by other persons. 
It is a matter of regret that there are still 11 towns where no school 
buildings of any kind have been erected in urban centers. 
SCHOOL BOARD ACTIVITIES. 
From the time of their organization until June 30, 1904, the school 
boards had no organized system of keeping their accounts: Begin- 
ning with July 1, 1904, the present system of accounting was organ- 
‘ized, the commissioner of education promulgating rules and regula- 
tions to govern the same. This system with a few modifications has 
peieanind 3 in force since that time. 
When the present system was introduced, very oa school boards 
had money in the bank, $8,831.93 being the total sum. The other 
school boards were in debt, the indebtedness totaling $51,368.65 on 
 
-P-A-G-E-533
  
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 505 
June 30, 1904. Four years later this debt was wiped out and the 
school boards had $116,438.16 to their credit over and above all ex- 
penses. At the close of the present fiscal year the school boards had 
a total of $260,069.21 to credit over and above expenses, notwith- 
standing the fact that large sums have been spent in the construction 
of school buildings and the purchase of modern equipment. 
RULES AND REGULATIONS. 
The commissioner has issued two new departmental regulations in 
accordance with powers conferred by law. The first refers to school 
strikes and provides that any pupil who participates in a school 
strike expels himself by his own act. This regulation became neces- 
sary because of the recurrence of school strikes in the past and was 
published after the six weeks’ strike of the pupils of the Arecibo 
High School. 
The second regulation deals with the nomination and approval of 
rural, graded, and principal teachers. Where school boards and the 
commissioner fail to come to an agreement as to the appointment 
of teachers after a reasonable length of time has elapsed and the 
time for opening schools approaches, the commissioner appoints 
teachers directly. This regulation was promulgated with the aim of 
insuring a longer tenure of position to all good teachers and to 
protect teachers against political influence in making nominations 
and against loss of position for failure to make money contributions 
to political committees.

REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY 
OF PORTO RICO, FISCAL YEAR 1915-16. 
The work done in the departments at Rio Piedras during the year 
1915-16 has been reduced, due to the fact that the budget for this year 
is about $23,000 less than it was for the year 1914-15. At the begin- 
ning of this year the faculty was reduced, for economic reasons, by 
six teachers. Later, another instructor was provided in the college 
of law, as well as an instructor in agriculture and an assistant in the 
practice school. 
In order to avoid the overcrowding of the classes that took place 
last year, the enrollment was limited to the number that could be 
handled with success. There were 405 fewer students this year than 
last. The increased entrance requirements in the normal department 
and in the colleges of law and pharmacy account to a certain extent 
for this decrease.
-P-A-G-E-536
    
508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
In the college of liberal arts the work follows two different lines, 
that of preparing students for professional courses in the States, 
such as medicine and engineering, and that of preparing teachers for 
high and continuation schools. There is a small group of students 
here who are doing special work for this purpose, and who have had 
practice teaching in the university high school. This is a feature 
that can and should be developed. This year there were no first- 
“year high-school classes. 
The college of law graduated its first class this year. The work 
done is very satisfactory, though there is need of another instructor, 
more room, and a good reference library. The college of pharmacy 
graduated its first class last year, and though several of the members 
failed to pass the first examination given by the insular board of 
pharmacy, all who took the examination the second time passed. 
The need of another instructor is imperative, and at least one more 
laboratory should be provided and equipped. 
In the normal department a smaller class was graduated this year 
than last because of the raised entrance requirements and new require- 
ments for graduation, compelling high-school graduates to stay two 
years instead of one for their diplomas. The course of study has 
been revised. Students carried too much work, and much of it was 
too formal and not sufficiently related to their future work as 
teachers. 
‘A special course for the preparation of rural teachers has been 
adopted and will become effective next year. Special features of this 
course are work in agriculture, manual training or home economics, 
elementary science, rural-school management, rural-school methods, 
and rural hygiene and sanitation. ' 
COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND MECHANIC ARTS, 
The year 1915-16 has been for the college of agriculture and 
mechanic arts of Mayaguez one of steady progress, in spite of the 
fact that the amount of money available, the lowest in the history 
of the school, has rendered the strictest economy necessary. The 
enrollment, 217, has been about the same as the year before. A new 
building and a dairy laboratory have been completed during the 
year. The standard of work has been raised and the general atti- 
tude toward thorough study has been very satisfactory. The system 
of scholarships has been done away with. The proceeds of the dairy 
and of the college farm were made available by the trustees for stu- 
dent labor; 125 students, about 60 per cent, took advantage of this 
means to pay needed expenses.
-P-A-G-E-537
  
EDUCATION IN THE CANAL ZONE. 509 
A notable feature of the course as revised provides for a diploma 
in agricultural or polytechnic science to a student who has completed 
the first four years of study. A student who has received this 
diploma can finish the rest of the course in three years, while grad- 
uates of high schools, because of the-lack of technical work, will need 
the usual four years. This subcollegiate diploma provides for peda- 
gogical instruction, thus preparing the students for teaching in rural 
schools. The college can accommodate some 300 students with its 
organization for the coming year.

ITEMS OF PROGRESS. 
A full four-year commercial course was provided in the high school 
effective October 1,1915. The subjects taught are bookkeeping, busi- 
ness law, commercial geography, commercial history, spelling, writ- 
ing, commercial correspondence, business arithmetic, typewriting, and 
the Gregg system of shorthand. There were 45 pupils enrolled in one 
or another commercial subject. 
To obviate the necessity of providing additional rooms at the Gatun 
colored school, the “double session” plan was adopted, by which one  
-P-A-G-E-538
  
  510 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
room serves for two teachers with their respective pupils. Under 
this plan one section attended school from 7.30 to 10 a. m. and 
from 12.30 to 2.80 p. m., and the other from 10 to 12.30 p. m. and 
from 2.30 to 5 p. m. This plan was also put into effect in the 
colored schools at Paraiso, Empire, and Cristobal when conditions 
at these schools became such that it was not possible to provide room 
for all the pupils at the same time. It has proved quite satisfactory, 
resulting in considerable saving in new buildings, equipment, and 
janitor service. 
Monthly inspections of schools, both white and colored, were made 
by the district physicians. The usual physical examination of 
pupils in the white grade schools was made during the week begin- 
ning October 18, 1915. The results of these examinations are shown 
herewith.

CHAPTER XXX. 
CANADA. 
By Anna ToLMAN SMITH, 
Specialist in Foreign Educational Systems, Bureau of Education. 
- ADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES. 
The development of public education in the Canadian Provinces 
follows in the main the same course as in the United States, but 
the Canadian systems present a much more compact organization than 
those of the United States, with a stronger tendency to centralized 
control. This feature is particularly marked in Ontario. The min- 
ister of public instruction in this Province is not only the executive 
head of the system, but as a member of the legislature he initiates 
and largely directs school legislation, while his judiciary functions 
and powers of appointment give great weight to the measures he 
advocates. No other Province has reposed equal authority in the 
chief officer of education, but all have sought to secure uniformity of 
school provision and educational standards through Government 
action. 
In Quebec the schools are either Roman Catholic or Protestant, and 
are controlled by two separate committees, one composed of Roman 
Catholic members and the other of Protestant members. The 
former deals with all school questions in the Province affecting the 
schools of the same faith and the latter with questions affecting 
Protestant schools. The two committees form the council of public 
instruction and in their joint capacity decide questions of common 
interest. The superintendent of public instruction, appointed by the 
lieutenant governor, is president of this council. 
In Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan provision is made for sepa- 
rate schools for Protestants and for Catholics, and the supporters of 
these separate schools are exempted from the payment of local taxes 
tor the support of the public schools. The separate schools are under   
1As in previous years, the chapters in this report dealing with education in foreign 
countries have been prepared under the general direction of the specialist in foreign edu- 
cational systems from official reports and correspondence, and with the assistance of 
yarious collaborators. Special articles in the section are attributed to their respective 
authors. 5

Government inspection and follow the same general regulations as 
the public schools. In all other Provinces the schools are non- 
sectarian. The public elementary schools are free, excepting in 
Quebec, where fees are charged, which must not, however, exceed 50 
cents a month nor be less than 5 cents a month. In the model schools 
and academies of this Province, which correspond to the grammar 
and high schools of our own States, the fees may be higher. In the 
high schools of Ontario fees are also charged. With these excep- 
tions, the public schools of the several Provinces are free, their sup- 
port being derived from provincial grants, local (municipal) appro- 
priations, and school taxes.

classical colleges. 
The system of public instruction in Ontario includes, besides the 
elementary and high schools tabulated above, public kindergartens 
which enrolled 25,554 pupils in 1914 and employed 396 teachers; con- 
tinuation schools with 6,069 pupils and 237 teachers; and night 
schools classified as public and high, the former having 2,155 pupils 
with 67 teachers, and the latter 2,374 pupils with 84 teachers. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
In all the Canadian Provinces provision is made for the training 
of teachers, and the extension of this provision and the adaptation of 
the training to local needs are recognized as of first importance to the 
efficiency and completeness of the systems of elementary education. 
In the eastern Provinces the normal schools are well organized, and 
new conditions are met by their extension or modification. In the 
newer Provinces of the west liberal appropriations are made for nor- 
mal schools, and their establishment and organization are among the 
chief concerns of the education authorities; temporary provision is 
also made for training teachers for the service of the rapidly in- 
creasing rural schools. The newer Provinces necessarily depend upon 
outside supplies for the full complement of teachers, and the com-
-P-A-G-E-543
CANADA. 515 
plaint is made by the eastern Provinces of the loss of many compe- 
tent teachers who are drawn to the west by the large salaries offered. 
On account of the different stages of advancement in respect to 
organization, the term normal school is applied somewhat differently 
in the different Provinces, signifying in some cases a highly- or- 
ganized institution, in others local schools or classes of temporary 
character. For convenience of reference, however, the schools thus 
recognized in the different Provinces are brought together in the 
following tabulation:

In addition to the normal school for Nova Scotia included in the 
table, the Rural Service School, which holds a session each summer, 
was attended by 144 teachers in 1915. 
The Prince of Wales College and normal school of Prince Edward 
Island comprises, besides the normal department and academic course, 
an agricultural department. Presumably, however, the larger pro- 
portion of the students intend to engage in teaching in the schools 
of the island. The college received $4,000 from the fund appropri- 
ated to the island from the Federal grant in aid of agriculture. The 
total amount of the island’s share was $26,529, and in addition to the 
sum appropriated directly to the college, a large part of the re- 
mainder was applied to work carried on under the auspices of the 
college. For the promotion of nature study in the schools, including 
office work, $6,529 was allowed: from the fund. The summer school 
of science, which held its third session in 1915, reported an enroll- 
ment of 357 teachers. 
EXPENDITURES. 
‘The expenditures for public schools in Canada are tabulated in the 
comparative table presented in the statistical survey of education in 
foreign countries, chapter 87. The total expenditures for public 
education in several of the Canadian Provinces exceeds the amount 
there given, as it includes expenditures for higher schools and

auxiliary agencies not comprised in the table. For the comprehen- 
sive system of public instruction in Ontario, the total expenditure 
in 1914-15 was $18,590,000, an excess of $3,500,000 above the amount 
required for the ordinary schools. In Nova Scotia the total ex- 
penuiture, amounting to $1,642,113, included $49,087 for aid to local 
technical schools. The total expenditure for New Brunswick in- 
cluded $20,000 for the university and $12,677 for schools for the de- 
fective classes. The total expenditures for Quebec, amounting to 
$7,992,542, includes $100,000 for superior education. For the re- 
maining Provinces, the total expenditure agrees with that given in 
the comparative table and the explanatory notes. 
CURRENT MOVEMENTS, 
The latest official reports issue] by the provincial departments of 
education cover either the calendar year 1915 or the scholastic year 
ending June 30, 1915. In every case they show some effect of the 
war upon the schools, although up to the close of the period indicated 
this effect was felt chiefly in the universities and higher secondary 
schools. At the same time many teachers had left positions in the 
elementary schools to enlist in the service. Almost without excep- 
tion the reports indicate a high degree of popular interest in public 
schools, increased attendance as regards both number and regularity, 
and larger proportions of teachers holding high-grade certificates. 
Although the Provinces differ from each other in their industrial 
demands and economic conditions, they are dealing with certain 
common problems in education. 
RURAL SCHOOLS. 
The great problem in all the Provinces is that of raising the level 
of the rural schools, which provide for more than half the school 
population of the entire country. The measures employed for the 
uplift of these schools are similar to those that have been engaging 
attention in the United States for the last decade. They pertain 
chiefly to the improvement of school buildings, the means of securing 
qualified teachers, of prolonging the period of school attendance, 
and of relating the work of the schools to the immediate environ- 
ment and living interests of the children. These are the essential 
problems of city schools also, but they are much more easily’ dealt 
with in concentrated populations. 
Ontario has been very successful in securing teachers for rural 
schools who have been trained for the work. More than 50 per cent 
of rural school teachers in 1914 held teachers’ certificates of the 
second grade, which can be secured only by those who have attended 
a normal school and passed the examination at the close of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-545
CANADA, 517 
session. In addition to this test, a favorable report from the prin- 
cipal of the normal school is required. Above 20 per cent of the 
rural teachers had third-class certificates, which are valid for three 
years only, during which time the holder very frequently prepares 
for the higher certificate. 
The increase of salaries in rural schools has also had an excellent 
effect. In 1908 men teachers in rural schools received $462 a year 
and women $382. In 1913 the salaries were, respectively, $591 
and $524. 
As a result of the recent interest in rural uplift, the school grounds 
and buildings throughout the Province have been greatly improved. 
The majority of rural inspectors report the teaching of agriculture 
through the medium of school gardens or home gardens, which are 
rapidly multiplying by reason of the liberal grant made through the 
department of agriculture, in which grant all Provinces share on the 
same terms.’ 
In Quebec, educational campaigns have been in progress very 
similar in character to those conducted in the southern section of the 
United States. The committee in charge of the Protestant schools 
reports 33 such meetings during 1914, and a special grant accorded 
by the Government for rural Protestant schools, which are generally 
in the poorest districts. The same year congresses of Catholic school 
commissioners were held in 19 sections of the Province, and great in- 
terest was shown in the promotion of subjects related to rural indus- 
tries. It has been comparatively easy to secure teachers in the rural 
Catholic schools, on account of the numerous orders of the church de- 
voted to teaching. The Christian Brothers are particularly success- 
ful in promoting the practical teaching of farming. As regards 
school gardens, it was reported in 1915 that this form of instruction 
in horticulture was given at 284 schools in 54 counties of the Province. 
The superintendent of education for New Brunswick reports an 
increase in the number of consolidated schools, and suggests that since 
the board of education gives special grants to these schools, it should 
have the right to approve the nomination of teachers by the local 
school boards, since with an inferior teacher a consolidated school is 
less successful than the small district school. Parent-teacher associa- 
tions have been formed in this Province, which work with good effect 
for the improvement of the rural schools. 
In Nova Scotia the uplift of rural schools rests upon the director 
of rural science, who works directly with the teachers and the schools 
and excites the cooperaton of churches and citizens in his endeavors. 
In February, 1915, the publication of a rural science bulletin was 
begun and copies were mailed to all teachers of rural science who

expressed any interest in the work. In addition, the Agricultural 
Gazette, published at Ottawa, and a number of other Government 
reports and bulletins are distributed to all the teachers of the Province. 
The summer school is held under the joint direction of the normal 
schools and agricultural colleges, and between 150 and 200 teachers 
are in attendance every summer. In the session of 1915, diplomas 
showing the completion of the full course were awarded to 34 
teachers, and 80 certificates indicating preparation for teaching 
science studies. The director reports that during the school year 
1915, the number of home gardens cared for by school children was 
2,000, which was nearly three times the number reported in 1914. 
The chief superintendent of education for Prince Edward Island 
states that great progress has recently been made in the study of 
rural science and agriculture. In order to foster this interest the 
department of agriculture inaugurated a two weeks’ summer course 
for teachers at the Prince of Wales College in 1913. In 1915 this 
school was attended by 357 teachers. 
The superintendent calls attention to the fact that nearly one- 
third of the schools have each less than 15 pupils, and urges that 
an endeavor be made to reduce the number of small schools by con- 
solidation. It is hoped that the interest excited in agriculture and 
in rural science through the united efforts of the department of agri- 
culture and the department of education will induce districts to com- 
bine for the purpose of having larger and more efficient schools. 
In British Columbia the director of elementary agricultural edu- 
cation has conducted a vigorous campaign in the interests of his 
specialty, in which effort he has been ably seconded by the minister 
of agriculture and his aids. The work in the schools is developed 
on a basis of nature study. In connection with this.subject, use is 
made of the school garden, which serves at once to excite the bodily 
activity and the mental alertness of the child. The interest of teach- 
ers is sustained by the special courses offered in the summer school 
of rural science, which draws a large part of its teaching force from 
the University of British Columbia. In the session of 1914 a system- 
atic course in rural science was carried out, and it was proposed 
to continue the instruction on the same lines in 1915. 
The provincial government offers special grants for the improve- 
ment of school grounds and agricultural instruction conditioned 
upon the expenditure of equal amounts by the local school boards. 
Tn Manitoba 400 school gardens were reported in 1915, and in con- 
nection with the general work of rural education 63 boys’ and girls’ 
clubs were formed, with a membership of over 5,500. These clubs 
are conducted under the general supervision of the Manitoba Agri- 
cultural College, which excites competition by the offer of prizes.
-P-A-G-E-547

The awards are made at public gatherings and by this means the in- 
terests of parents as well as those of children are stimulated.* 
In Alberta and Saskatchewan peculiar problems of rural educa- 
tion arise from the constant stream of immigrants, comprising many 
nationalities, for whom the first essentials of public education, 
namely, schoolhouses and teachers, must be supplied. While the edu- 
cation authorities advocate the most advanced methods for rural 
schools, their adoption is necessarily slow in the new settlements, 
where it is difficult to excite the community spirit. 
Recent legislation in Alberta obliges every school district to main- 
tain its school in active operation during the whole session unless au- 
thorized to close it by the minister of education. This requirement, 
combined with more rigid enforcement of the compulsory school at- 
tendance law, has resulted in a marked increase in the attendance at 
rural schools and greater interest in their work. With this advance 
the disposition to establish consolidated schools has increased, and 
several communities have combined for this purpose during the past 
two years. 
The staff of the education department includes a supervisor of 
schools among foreigners, who must use great judgment in his recom- 
mendations as to methods of administering the affairs of school dis- 
tricts in non-English settlements. Under “the paternal method” 
an official trustee is appointed by the department, with or without the 
consent of the ratepayers, and is given the full powers of a school 
board. Wherever possible, however, the ratepayers of the district 
are allowed to elect their school boards in the usual way. If the 
elected board fails to meet the requirements of the school law, the 
department interferes and appoints an official trustee, usually the 
supervisor, who is thoroughly familiar with the conditions. By this 
means the rural schools in the foreign districts are maintained 
throughout the school year under competent teachers. In his latest 
report the supervisor notes the progress in the establishment of school 
libraries and the very prevalent use of the English language in all 
the foreign settlements. 
The official inspectors in all sections of the Province note increased 
interest in the teaching of agriculture and in the improvement of 
grounds and buildings. 
In Saskatchewan the policy of consolidated schools for rural dis- 
tricts is strongly supported by the education authorities. In 1914 
nine consolidated districts were organized and other districts were 
planning to unite in the same manner. 
In the Weyburn circuit the Government inspector has excited 
much interest in school gardens and has succeeded in maintaining a 
community farm in connection with the school garden in one dis- 
  
1See also chapter on School and Home Gardening, p. 259.

  520 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
trict. He purposes to form a community center club in every dis- 
trict under his direction, and during the present year organized 
three such centers and six rural education associations. In the latter, 
parents combined with teachers to excite public sentiment for the 
improvement of their school buildings and the lengthening of the 
school terms. With respect to the centers already organized, the 
inspector states that school exhibitions were arranged to be held 
in each and a program of subsequent exercises as follows: A day 
for games, athletics, and physical training for October; concert in 
December; seed and stock show planned for February; oratorio to 
be presented at Easter; a festival of literature and music for June. 
The plan adopted by the Saskatchewan government for the imme- 
diate disposition of the Dominion subsidy for agricultural educa- 
tion provides for a broad policy in respect to all the special interests 
of rural education.t_ It was decided that the portion of this subsidy 
payable to Saskatchewan should be assigned for expenditure to the 
department of education until the agricultural college, the depart- 
ment of education, and the department of agriculture should each 
receive one-third of the total grant. In accordance with this decision 
the department of education secures an annual sum, amounting in 
1914 to $6,500, to be expended in agricultural education directly 
under its auspices. The scheme of work outlined for 1915 on the 
basis of this appropriation comprised— 
the appointment of directors of school agriculture, the appointment of a di- 
rector of household science, the formulating of a policy respecting school 
affairs, teacher training in agriculture at normal schools, extension work by 
directors at teachers’ institutes, conventions and public meetings of rate- 
payers, publication of bulletins, and short courses in agriculture and domestic 
science at the university and the normal schools. The organization of the 
work in household science, particularly in the rural districts, was determined 
upon and the department took measures to obtain the services of a director of 
household science. 
It was also decided to appoint a director of school agriculture, but 
pending the choice of an incumbent for the position a short course 
in agriculture was given for teachers at the University of Saskatche- 
wan in the summer of 1914. This course proved so successful, and 
the enthusiasm of the teachers was so great, that the department de- 
cided to arrange for two distinct courses in 1915, one for elementary 
teachers and the other for inspectors of schools and science teachers 
in the high schools. : 
CITY ACTIVITIES. 
The cities of Canada are noted for the excellence of their schools 
and for their rapid adaptation to modern demands. Naturally the

-P-A-G-E-549
  CANADA, 521 
cities of the older Provinces have been in a better condition to meet 
new requirements than those of the newer western Provinces. The 
phenomenal growth of the cities in the latter has necessitated great 
effort to supply the buildings and equipments and to secure compe- 
tent teachers. At the same time they have been unhampered by set- 
tled traditions, while the requirements of new settlements have 
emphasized the importance of such subjects as manual training, 
hygiene, domestic science, etc., for which it is difficult to find place 
in the fixed and overcrowded programs of long-established schools. 
As a result of the MacDonald fund, experiments in the introdue- 
tion of manual training in the city schools have now been in progress 
for about 15 years, and the current reports abound with interesting 
accounts of the success of this feature. It forms the elementary 
stage in a system of vocational training the need of which is recog- 
nized throughout the Dominion. In view of the large results already 
achieved by the appropriation for the promotion of agriculture, a 
general demand has arisen for a similar appropriation in the inter- 
ests of vocational education, and while the efforts in this direction 
have been interrupted by the more pressing demands of the war, this 
event itself is furnishing new motives for renewing the demand 
upon the public treasury at the earliest possible moment. 
The most interesting event of the past year pertaining to this 
general movement was the opening of the new Central Technical 
School building at Toronto. This ceremony took place on August 
31, the lieutenant governor of the Province presiding. The build- 
ing occupies two city squares, about one-fourth of which is devoted 
to lawns and garden plats. Including ground and equipment, the 
city of Toronto has invested about $2,000,000 in this structure, 
which is said to be the finest of its kind in America. The courses 
of study for day pupils began on September 2, and those for evening 
pupils on October 1. They provide scientific, artistic, and practical 
training in a wide range of industrial and commercial subjects for 
persons engaged during the day, and equip students for important 
positions in many technical callings. Special provision has been 
made for women students who seek to fit themselves for feminine 
industries, including costume designers, housekeepers, embroidery 
and lace makers, ete. This institution completes a series of graded 
schools which provide for every degree of technical education leading 
up to the engineering department of the University of Toronto. 
BILINGUAL QUESTION. 
The agitation over the bilingual question, to which attention was 
called in the previous report, increased in intensity during the present 
year. Although the question affects the courts and public admin- 
 
-P-A-G-E-550
  
522 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
istration in various ways, its relation to the schools is paramount. 
In the older Provinces of Ontario and Quebec it is purely a question 
between the French and the English languages, but in the Provinces 
farther west it involves many racial distinctions, and becomes prac- 
tically a polylingual question. 
In Ontario a peculiar difficulty arises in this matter from the 
stand taken by the population of Irish origin. Although the ma- 
jority of the Irish belong to the Roman Catholic Church, they do 
not want the French language to be given prominence in the sepa- 
rate schools maintained for children of that faith. On the other 
hand, the French population insists upon this course not only be- 
cause French was the pioneer tongue of Canada and is dear to them 
from its association with their motherland, but also because of its 
influence in keeping up the sacred ‘atte of their own faith. 
From this difference of opinion between the Irish and the French 
minorities, both equally interested in the maintenance of the sepa- 
rate schools for Roman Catholics, the Government of Ontario has 
had great difficulty in the way of any endeavor to adjust or improve 
or alter the teaching of the two languages, English and French, in 
the separate schools. 
From a careful analysis of the population of the different Provinces 
as given in the census of 1911 the following conclusions have been 
reached : E 
(1) That the margin of difference as to nominal education amongst the 
Provinces at that time was small. The percentage of the population able to 
read and write ranged from 85.10 in New Brunswick to 93.17 in Ontario. 
(2) That in Ontario and Quebec the minorities were about the same in 
number though opposite in race and creed. 
(8) That assuming half the Irish population to be Roman Catholics, and the 
proportion was probably much greater, their view of bilingualism would be ae 
important one politically. 
(4) That Canadians were a well-educated people so far as this test of 
reading and writing constituted education, and that race or religion did not 
affect the net result. 
The difficulty in Ontario turns upon the Government’s policy as 
detailed in the regulations issued in 1912 for the purpose of improv- 
ing and insuring the use and efficient teaching of the English lan- 
guage in the public and separate schools of the Province. 
The dissatisfaction of the French with the regulations led to a 
bitter attack upon the Government, and as a consequence various 
minorities in the Provinces farther west began to agitate for larger 
recognition of their respective languages. These claims threatened 
such disaster to the unity of the school work that a strong support 
developed in favor of the action of the Ontario Government, and thus 
the bilingual difficulty became the outstanding educational problem
-P-A-G-E-551

of the year. In an address delivered January 12, 1916, before the 
Legislature of Manitoba the Hon. R. S. Thornton, minister of edu- 
cation, presented the following summary of the requirements then 
in force with respect to bilingual teaching in the different Provinces: 
The public schools act of Manitoba required that— 
When 10 of the pupils in any school speak the French language, or any lan- 
guage other than English as their native language, the teaching of such pupils 
shall be conducted in French, or such other language and English upon the 
bilingual system. 
This clause was repealed by the Manitoba Legislature in March, 
1916. 
_ No similar clause appears in the school act of any other Province 
of the Dominion. In British Columbia, in Prince Edward Island, 
in New Brunswick, no provision concerning the language to be used 
in the public schools is noted, and the teaching of any language other 
than English is not provided for. 
In Ontario the act (section 84) provides that it is the duty of the 
teacher to use the English language in instruction and in all com- 
munications with the pupils, except where it is impracticable to do so 
by reason of the pupils not understanding English. This is further 
modified by regulation of the department. Regulation No. 12 (3) 
provides: 
In school sections where the French or German language prevails the board 
may, in addition to the course of study prescribed herein, require instruction to 
be given in French or German, reading, grammar, and composition to such pupils 
as are directed by their parents or guardians to study either of these languages. 
Regulation No. 17 provides that: 
Where necessary in the case of French-speaking pupils, French may be used 
as the language of instruction and communication, but such use of French shall 
not be continued beyond Form One, excepting that on the approval of the chief 
inspector it may also be used as the language of instruction and communication 
in the case of pupils beyond Form One, who are unable to speak and understand 
the English language. 
In Quebec the French and English systems are entirely separate, 
and in each case the medium of instruction is the mother tongue, but 
no provision is made for any other language. 
In Nova Scotia there is no statutory provision governing the teach- 
ing language, but in the regulations of the board of public instruction 
the Acadian school regulations authorize the appointment of a bi- 
lingual visitor of schools in French-speaking districts, a bilingual 
normal training course for French-speaking teachers, the use of 
authorized French readers in certain districts, but no language 
except English shall be imperative on any pupil. Nova Scotia is the 
only Province in which the word “bilingual” is used in the statutes 
or regulations outside of Manitoba. 
 
-P-A-G-E-552
  524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
In Alberta and Saskatchewan the provisions are identical, having 
been continued from the old Northwest Territories days. The section 
is as follows:* 
All schools shall be taught in the English language, but it shall be permissible 
for the board of any district to cause a primary course to be taught in the 
French language. 
The board of any district may, subject to the regulations of the department, 
employ one or more competent persons to give instruction in any language other 
than English in the school of the district to all pupils whose parents or guar- 
dians have signified a willingness that they should receive the same, but such 
course of instruction shall not supersede, or in any way interfere with, the 
instruction by the teacher in charge of the school as required by the regulations 
of the department and this ordinance. 
The board shall have power to raise such sums of money as may be necessary 
to pay the salary of such instructor, and all costs, charges, and expenses of 
such course of instruction shall be collected by the board by a special rate to be 
imposed upon the parents or guardians of such pupils as take advantage of the 
same. 
From these extracts it will be seen that some of the Provinces rec- 
ognize no other language than English, and others give a partial 
recognition to the French language. Ontario gives limited recog- 
nition to German and French, but in Manitoba equal standing was 
formerly given to any other language. 
Complications that arise in Provinces where several different na- 
tionalities are concerned in preserving their languages are illus- 
trated by the following report of conditions in the Province of 
Manitoba before the repeal of the clause of the public-schools act per- 
mitting bilingual teaching in the schools: 
There are altogether 126 French bilingual schools in operation, employing 
234 teachers, with an enrollment of 7,393 pupils and an average attendance of 
3,465. Sixty-one districts operate German bilingual schools. These employ 
73 teachers, with an enrollment of 2,814 and an average attendance of 1,841. 
One hundred and eleven districts operate Ruthenian or Polish bilingual 
schools, employing 114 teachers, with an enrollment of 6,513 pupils and -an 
average attendance of 3,885. Thus there are altogether 16,720 pupils in the 
three groups of bilingual schools, which means, roughly speaking, that of all 
the children enrolled in Manitoba 1 out of every 6 receives his education in a 
school of this type. 
It is further stated that— 
The right to bilingual teaching led to a demand for the training of bilingual 
teachers. As a result there are at the present time the regular teachers’ 
certificates, third, second, and first class professional, granted after the regular 
norma! training, and, in addition, the following, all authorized by the advisory 
board: 
French bilingual certificates, good only in French-English schools. 
German bilingual certificates, good only in German-English schools. 
Polish bilingual certificates, good only in Polish-English schools. 
Ruthenian bilingual certificates, good only in Ruthenian-English schools. 
  
1Sec. 136, p. 45 (Alberta).
-P-A-G-E-553
CANADA. 525 
These certificates should represent the regular English standing plus the 
additionai language. In reality they represent the regular standing minus, 
being short either on the academic or on the professional side. 
Candidates for French bilingual certificates study the English language, 
but do not write any examination on English grammar, English composition, 
or English literature. 
Candidates for German bilingual certificates write English grammar and 
English composition at the entrance examination for promotion to the high 
school, but may omit the examinations in these subjects for a third-class 
certificate. S 
The Polish and Ruthenian students must take the regular examinations along 
with the English-speaking pupils in the schools, but are admitted to normal 
school after completing one year of high-school work (Grade IX), instead of 
two years (Grade X). 
So far no demand has been made by the other nationalities for bilingual 
teacher training, but they have the same right under the act as those who have 
already received it. 
In summing up the results of a special inquiry into the effect of 
the bilingual teaching, the minister says: 
There should be one common-school teaching the things which are common 
to all, and leaving to individual effort those matters which are of private con- 
cern. There should be one standard of teacher eligible to teach in all schools 
of the Province. There should be a normal training to which all teachers 
should measure up. There should be a school inspector eligible to inspect every 
school under the Government. That is the ideal which, during all these years, 
seems to have been lost sight of. * * * 
In an English-speaking country, as this is, a knowledge of English is more 
necessary than a knowledge of arithmetic. No matter what a man’s attainments 
may be, the doors of opportunity are closed to him if he has not a knowledge 
of English, the common tongue. ‘The teachers of non-English birth, many of 
whom have been bravely and conscientiously contending against adverse con- 
ditions will, with better educational standing, no longer be stamped sectionally, 
but will have a wider opportunity and a broader field in which to labor. 
F A grave injustice is being done to the children who do not receive a satisfac- 
tory education in English. Without that knowledge they grow up under a 
continuous handicap. We wish to give them the same consideration as is ac- 
corded to our own children, to fit them to earn their way through life, and to take 
their places as citizens in our Canadian nationality. 
This question must be dealt with looking forward, not backward. Each 
generation must take its responsibility, and act in the spirit of its own times, 
yet ever watchful of the result to succeeding generations. We are building 
to-day for the Canada of to-morrow, and our common school is one of the most 
important factors in the work. 
THE STRATHCONA TRUST AND MILITARY TRAINING. 
The war has naturally increased the number of cadet corps which 
are formed in the several Provinces of Canada under the terms of 
the Strathcona Trust. The term is applied to the committee in 
charge of a fund given by Lord Strathcona for the encouragement 
of physical and military training in public schools. In accordance 
with the policy adopted, the interest on the invested money is an-   
 
-P-A-G-E-554
526 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
nually divided between the Provinces in proportion to the respective 
population. Of the entire income 50 per cent is allotted for physical 
training in the schools under the department of education, 35 per 
cent for military drill, and 15 per cent for rifle shooting. Every 
Province in the Dominion has accepted the terms of the trust and 
issued corresponding instructions. The military training is organized 
under the auspices of the executive council of the trust and effected 
jointly through the officers of the militia and the teachers and physi- 
cal-training instructors in the schools. Cadet corps are formed for 
the purposes of the training. The following data relative to these 
activities were supplied by the secretary of the executive council of 
the trust:

UNIVERSITIES. 
SPECIAL ACTIVITIES. 
The universities of Canada, in common with those of all countries 
involved in the war, have made great sacrifices in this crisis. The 
strain of war falls heavily upon these institutions. The ideals for 
which they stand, ideals of the ethical and intellectual solidarity of 
nations, are obscured and their internal life disorganized. It is too 
early as yet to give any fair estimate of the new services rendered 
by the universities under these circumstances. They are illustrated 
by the partial record here given, pertaining to the leading universi- 
ties of Canada. An impressive feature of the record is the scientific 
activity deyeloped, and the promise which it holds of larger service 
in that period of reorganization which must follow the conflict and 
which will tax to the uttermost the scientific resources of the higher 
institutions in all countries. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. 
In the previous report of this series’ attention was called to the 
responsibilities suddenly forced upon the universities of Canada 
by the war. Reference was also made to incidents growing out of 
the endeavor of the University of Toronto to maintain its character 
as a center of rational judgments and moral ideals in the midst of 
personal controversies having no direct effect upon the national 
welfare. 
At the opening of the session of 1914-15 Dr. Falconer, the presi- 
dent of the University of Toronto, addressed a general assembly of 
the students in Convocation Hall, setting before them the views of 
the entente allies as to the immediate causes of the present war and 
urging them to consider carefully what their duty was in respect 
to these issues and to join the officers’ training corps, which would 
prepare them for enlisting in active service when the call should 
come. 
During the month of September, 1914, before the university 
opened, a group of the younger members of the staff undertook drill 
and were ready at the opening of the session to become officers of an 
officers’ training corps, which was immediately established. The 
students enthusiastically joined this corps, and it was soon recruited 
far over the required strength. 
In his report for the year ending June 30, 1915, the president 
notes that while the session of that year opened with about the same 
attendance as usual, as the weeks passed a steady stream of students 
to whom the conviction came that it was their duty to enlist for 
active service left the university. At the close of the session there   
1See Rept. of Commis. of Educ., 1915, vol. 1.
-P-A-G-E-556

were nearly 500 undergraduates serving in the ranks. These num- 
bers steadily increased, and in April of the current year fully 2,500 
graduates and undergraduates of the university were in active serv- 
ice, some 75 having fallen. Over 80 of the teaching staff were absent 
on military duty. In April, 1916, the militia department authorized 
the formation of two new units—a University of Toronto artillery 
battery, from which in July two drafts of 60 men each had gone 
overseas, and a University of Toronto officers’ training unit for 
active duty. 
Among special contributions made by the University of Toronto 
Dr. Falconer mentions the supply of skilled assistants from the body 
of medical students to staff a “casualty clearing station.” The 
students taken from the fifth year of the course in medicine were 
granted degrees according-to their standing in the class. 
The university also made an offer to the Dominion Government of 
a “base hospital” of 1,040 beds, to be officered by members of the 
university staff and to be under the control of the university. The 
Dominion Government and the British war office accepted the offer, 
and the hospital was manned and equipped and sailed for England 
in May, 1915. It has been stationed in Saloniki since November, 
1915, and has been strongly commended as one of the best equipped 
hospitals of the district. 
The antitoxin laboratory cooperated with the Militia Department 
and the Canadian Red Cross Society in securing at greatly reduced 
rates a large supply of tetanus antitoxin. The demand was so 
great and the available supply so small, that it was resolved to begin 
the manufacture in the university laboratory, and for this purpose 
the Dominion Government made a grant to the university of $5,000. 
The testing of shells has also been conducted in the test laboratory 
of the university. The physics department also conducted re- 
searches for the British war office. 
The university extension department has maintained courses of 
lectures on the principles involved in the war and the various phases 
of the struggle, organized patriotic meetings to promote enlistment, 
and in cooperation with the Speaker’s Patriotic League has raised 
over $300,000 for this purpose. 
McGill University, which is second only to Toronto in the number 
of its students, had for several years before the war been giving a 
certain amount of attention to military studies. As stated in the 
annual report— 
this work was undertaken originally in the conviction that, aside from any 
incidental advantages of training in drill and discipline, the study of military 
Science was deserving of being accorded some place in an academic curriculum, 
and that a Canadian university might offer, without impropriety, to assist in 
providing what was felt, even before the war, to be the most urgent need 
of the service—the supply of a body of trained officers.
-P-A-G-E-557
  CANADA. 529 
At the commencement of the session 1912-13 steps had been taken 
by the university for the organization of an “ officers’ training corps,” 
and at the commencement of the following session (1913-14) the 
McGill Graduate Society took action for recruiting what was to 
be known as a provisional battalion. This effort was generously 
supported by private subscriptions and stimulated by the leader- 
ship of a highly experienced officer. 
As a result of the attention given to military affairs, the university 
was able to respond immediately to the call for troops for over-seas 
service. Five companies, which were sent forward in a period of 14 
months ending in August, 1916, to reenforce the Princess Patricia’s 
Canadian Light Infantry, were trained successively on the university 
grounds, the men being quartered for the most part in the university 
buildings and officered by university men. Other universities in 
Canada contributed to the composition of these companies, but the 
general control was centered at McGill. The work of organizing 
and drilling continued after these companies had departed. The 
university was also authorized to raise a battery composed solely of 
McGill men. The full strength of the battery, which comprised 
four guns, was obtained, including 7 officers, 1 warrant officer, and 
151 noncommissioned officers and men. The total enlistment from 
the university included 73 members of the staff, 892 graduates, 547 
undergraduates, and 176 past students. 
The university also contributed a general hospital the personnel 
of which, comprising 21 officers, was chosen from the teaching staff 
of the medical faculty holding hospital appointments, and an equip- 
ment for a field hospital, comprising 520 beds, and a force of 200 
trained doctors, nurses, officers, and soldiers. 
Laval University, Montreal, equipped and recruited a general hos- 
pital similar to that of McGill, with a total of 300 in all ranks and 
1,040 beds. Of the university staff six French professors and two 
English were on active service at the end of 1915, while a battalion 
of 600 students was in training with organization practically com- 
pleted. 
The smaller universities and the technical colleges have been 
equally active. In several instances, notably that of the University 
of Alberta, the entire student body has been organized into a battalion 
and kept up a constant drill. All the universities have made special 
arrangements with respect to the scholastic standing and the award 
of diplomas to students engaging in the service. 
A UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE. 
Upon the invitation of the University of Toronto, in June, 1915, a 
conference was held of representatives of higher education. in the Do-
-P-A-G-E-558
  530 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
minion. At this conference, which was largely attended, matters of 
great interest to the welfare of the university and the future of higher 
education in the Dominion were discussed. It was particularly urged 
that the time had come when the professional schools must be main- 
tained at a high standard in order to retain the most promising 
students who, without unusual inducements, would be drawn to the 
leading universities of the United States and other foreign countries. 
For the same reason the importance of larger development and liberal 
support for graduate departments was emphasized, and it was agreed 
that measures should be taken for enriching the older universities 
in these directions in order that they might offer adequate opportu- 
nities for their own students to do graduate work at home, and also 
to draw to themselves the graduates of the smaller colleges of the 
east and the newer universities of the western Provinces. The sen- 
ate of the University of Toronto had already taken steps to meet 
these increasing requirements by a resolution asking the board of 
governors to create a new board of graduate studies which should 
have under its charge the advance work of the existing faculties of 
arts and medicine, and which should be prepared, by the offer of 
scholarships and by the possession of ample equipments, to meet. the 
requirements of ambitious students in all parts of the Dominion. 
The normal strength of the Canadian universities, like that of all 
universities in the warring countries, has been reduced during the 
current year. The statistics which follow relate to the scholastic 
year 1914-15, which opened with the usual complement of university 
students, but suffered great reductions before the season closed.

CHAPTER XXXTI. 
EDUCATION IN THE LATIN-AMERICAN STATES. 
THE SECOND PAN AMERICAN CONGRESS. 
The most important event in the records of the Latin-American 
countries for the current year was the meeting of the Second Pan 
American Scientific Congress, which convened at Washington De- 
cember 28, 1915,.and held daily sessions for two weeks. The pro- 
gram of the educational section of the congress was exceptionally 
strong; not only were problems effectively treated, but those peculiar 
to the Latin-American countries were very fully presented by their 
respective delegates. Prominent among these problems was that of 
extending the systems of primary or popular education. 
‘At the time when the several States referred to achieved their in- 
dependence and were organizing their institutions there were strong 
pleas on the part of their political leaders for the liberal support of 
primary schools accessible to all the people. French influences were 
then dominant, but there were wanting in the newly organized States 
the conditions and the resources for carrying this purpose into effect,’ 
and as time passed the educational activities were directed toward 
secondary and higher education, following the inherited customs 
and ideals of the leading classes. The present renewal of interest in 
this subject is due rather to industrial and commercial interests than 
to the indulgence of political doctrines, and consequently there is a 
general turning to the United States for guidance in the endeavor 
to develop effective systems of primary education. This disposition 
was not only manifested in the sessions of the congress, but in a more 
significant manner by the educational itineraries throughout the 
United States which followed after the congress adjourned. 
The increased consciousness of the importance of primary educa- 
tion is accompanied in all the States here considered by an equal 
recognition of the need of bringing secondary schools into closer rela- 
tion with the interests of modern industrial requirements. Indeed, 
the extension of primary education and the reform of secondary edu- 
cation are simply two aspects of one problem. Although on the part 
of delegates from sister Republics there was a candid admission of   
+See also Ch. XXVIII, p. 476 of this report. 
531
-P-A-G-E-560
532 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
the superiority of the United States in respect to this problem, 
emphasis was also placed upon those elements of public education 
which have been more highly developed in the former countries. 
This advantage is justly claimed in respect to the fine arts, music, 
painting, and the plastic arts, for which provision is made at public 
expense in nearly all the Latin-American States. 
From the want of similar development in the countries partici- 
pating the discussion of topics before the congress was, naturally, 
somewhat one sided. It was noticeable, however, that rural educa- 
tion offered common ground. It is true that the United States has 
gone further in special provision for this part of the community 
than any one of the States of Central or South America; at the 
same time the work is in a formative stage in the United States, and, 
therefore, the means of equalizing opportunities between the children 
of urban and rural communities excites the same attention as 
in other countries which have large rural populations not ade- 
quately provided with the means of primary instruction. A second 
problem of vital interest in all the Americas is that of the adaptations 
desirable in respect to schools that continue the education of the 
young after the elementary stage is passed. In treating these topics 
delegates representing the different stages of educational develop- 
ment in the United States and in Latin America were equally sug- 
gestive. The promotion of cordial relations between all the Ameri- 
cas, through the agency of the schools, was also urged with great 
‘ earnestness by several of the visiting delegates. 
The following statements and citations from addresses delivered 
before the congress illustrate the spirit that prevailed throughout 
the proceedings. 
Dr. Luis A. Baralt, delegate from Cuba, in an address on the re- 
form needed in “ Pan American education,” said: 
Popular instruction and culture must not only be extended to all men and 
women but also intensified, modernized, and, above all, directed to the end of 
making free and noble citizens, conscious of their rights and duties. This can 
not be accomplished without proper attention to an aim generally ignored, or 
at least neglected, almost everywhere, and which yet constitutes the supreme 
object of education, namely, the building of a harmonious world in the minds of 
the scholars. A department for general culture and civic instruction should 
be added to all schools for manual work and technical training established for 
the education of the working classes—a necessary addition to all the institu- 
tions for a similar purpose now existing in the world.” 
Dr. Ernesto Nelson, delegate from Argentina, in a paper on the 
secondary school and the university which has been widely circulated,’ 
cited Dr. John Dewey in the support of his declaration that while

  SECOND PAN AMERICAN CONGRESS. 533 
“the curriculum may have been enriched by the progress of science, 
it still remains the official catalogue of facts the student has to ac- 
quire.” With regard to the relations of the lower schools to the uni- 
versity, Dr. Nelson said: 
Had the secondary school disconnected itself from the university, had it been 
obliged to respond, as it is beginning to respond to-day, to the demands of 
modern life, its conservative methods would have long ago been superseded by 
more liberal principles of education. To create and keep its patronage, the 
secondary school would have appealed to the practical sense of the community, 
eatered to the needs of modern life, somewhat in the way the modern public 
library is doing to-day. * * * 
The overwhelming cultural prestige of the university has made education 
retain much of its character as a system of organized restriction, just 
as when education had no meaning save as that of a preparation to a privileged 
position in an aristocratic society. * * * 
The salvation of the secondary school, therefore, lies in abandoning univer- 
sity standards in the valuation of primary and secondary education, in assert- 
ing positively its own standards of culture, founded in the perfection of those 
activities whose operation makes man attain his full spiritual stature. 
Peculiar weight was added to this opinion from the fact of Dr. 
Nelson’s well-known success in giving new ideals to the modern sec- 
ondary school which is organically related to the University of La 
Plata. 
One of the most impressive addresses delivered before the congress 
was that of Dr. Jose M. Galvez, professor of English in the University 
of Chile and vice president of the National Educational Association 
of Chile, who discussed the subject of Pan American understanding. 
In his introduction Dr. Galvez characterized the two groups of 
European culture in America, corresponding on the one side to the 
insular or individual part, and on the other to the continental or col- 
lective part, which have developed in Europe since the times of Eliza- 
beth and Philip II. In this connection he-said: 
You of the United States have, an essential feature of your culture, the in- 
heritance of British individualism which you have made to flourish on the 
American soil of the north, where it has borne wonderful results through the 
splendid activities of great individuals. 
We of Latin America have the collectivism of continental Europe as an 
essential feature of our cultural inheritance, which we have developed in the 
southern lands of America. Whatever has been achieved there—and there has 
been much—has been done mainly by the Governments. People look up gener- 
ally to the Governments for whatever is yet to be achieved—and that is still 
a great deal more. 
According to Dr. Galvez the problem of Pan American understand- 
ing involves the union of these two currents in a common “ideal of 
continental solidarity, within the bounds of liberty and mutual re- 
spect.” For the promotion of this common ideal the Pan American 
Scientific Congresses seek to give common direction to the general 
cultivation of the sciences throughout the continent. In considering 
61355°—16—36 
 
-P-A-G-E-562
    
534 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
the specific means of accomplishing this purpose, Dr. Galvez em- 
phasized first, language. On this subject he said: 
The first aspect of understanding between individuals and between peoples 
is the idiomatic one. In every understanding language is not an end in itself, 
but it is an indispensable means for reaching that end. It is the door through 
which the foreigner must pass if he would enter the building of a strange 
culture. 
For this reason Dr. Galvez recommended the extension and deepen- 
ing of the study of English in Latin America and of Spanish in 
Anglo-Saxon America. 
The second means, noted for the promotion of Pan American 
understanding, was the study of science, taking the term in the 
broadest sense as philosophy. To this end Dr. Galvez urged the 
establishment of “chairs of scientific philosophy that shall be inde- 
pendent of all professionalism and whose object may be to dis- 
seminate knowledge of philosophy in general, and especially as to 
the development of philosophic ideas in America.” In this con- 
ception of the subject were included scientific chairs of the history 
of religions, with the special object of disseminating knowledge in 
regard to the development and cultural influence of Christianity on 
the American continent. 
Great interest was manifested in the auxiliary conferences of 
women, in which many delegates from the South American countries 
participated. The discussions before this section related chiefly to 
the social welfare of women and children and the educational means 
for its promotion. Prof. Eduardo Monteverde, professor of the 
National University of Montevideo, in an important paper discussed 
the subject from the standpoint of woman’s influence as mother and 
head of the home. In order that her influence exerted through 
this medium may be intensified, he recommended that the curriculum 
of higher studies should be extended to include human anatomy and 
physiology, hygiene, physical education, psychology, social atmos- 
phere, chemistry, domestic economy, civics, religion, social problems, 
and moral problems. 2 MEXICO. 
The de facto Government of Mexico is developing plans for vigor- 
ous support of public instruction in the capital city and the national 
territory, and as a basis for future action has recently published a 
very complete educational census of the Federal district and terri- 
tory, which shows. the situation in 1912. At that time there were, 
under the charge of the minister of public instruction, 649 primary 
schools, with a total enrollment of 110,661 and a teaching force 
numbering 3,839. These schools were maintained at an expenditure 
of $1,636,406. There were also 19 institutions for special or higher 
education, with an enrollment of 9,634 students and a teaching per-
-P-A-G-E-563
CENTRAL AMERICA. 535 
sonnel numbering 1,425. The expenditure of these more advanced 
institutions exceeded that for the primary schools, amounting in all 
to $3,993,977. Under the head of higher education are included the 
professional faculties which were legally transformed into the Uni- 
versity of Mexico in 1910, but have not yet fully realized the organic 
union authorized. 
Two features of the university organization deserve special men- 
tion. It includes a preparatory section, which registered 1,263 stu- 
dents in 1912, of whom 48 were women, and also a graduate school 
(Escuela de Altos Estudios) which prepares candidates for the 
doctorate in sciences and letters. This institution registered 98 
students in 1912, of whom 11 were women. Since these statistics 
were published, the Government has established a school of domestic 
science for women in the city of Mexico. 
The secretary of public instruction has recently issued a circular 
calling the attention of all heads of families to the compulsory 
school-attendance law and their obligations under penalty to secure 
the instruction of their children. 
Recent advices from Mexico show promising activity in respect to 
education in States removed from the zone of internal disorder. 
This is particularly true of Yucatan, in which several agricultural 
schools have been established under expert management. <A school 
for teaching theoretical and practical surveying in connection with 
the land department was also established during the year, opening 
with an attendance of 50 pupils. 
In the State of Coahuila a decree has been issued forbidding the 
employment of children under 14 in factories, establishing compul- 
sory education, and authorizing provision for the industrial training 
of men and women. 
CENTRAL AMERICA. 
MOVEMENT FOR EDUCATIONAL UNION. 
The movement for a closer union of the five States in Central 
America, which has been the chief subject of discussion in six inter- 
state conferences, has been promoted during the present year by the 
International Central American Office, which, in its organ, the 
Centro America,! proposes a plan for a uniform system of public 
instruction in the several States. The plan is elaborated for the pur- 
pose of exciting general discussion, which, it is hoped, will lead to 
an agreement as to the main features of a common system. 
The proposed program is extremely comprehensive, covering six 
years for primary schools, of which three are called “complemen- 
tary,” or higher grades.   
1See issue for “Enero, Febrero y Marzo de 1916,” pp. 1-11. 
 
-P-A-G-E-564
  536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
The program of secondary education covers five years; four years 
are assigned for the normal schools. 
Attention is directed particularly to the means of extending and 
improving the rural schools and for increasing practical training 
as a correction of the excessive tendency to philosophical and literary 
subjects. Among the practical courses provided for in the program 
are those in arts and trade for both men and women—telegraphy, 
electricity, commerce, agriculture, mechanics, and engineering. To 
the usual courses in mining and civil engineering a course in munici- 
pal engineering is added. 
Directly in line with this effort is the action of the Government of 
Salvador in giving official approval through the minister of public 
instruction to a society recently organized in Santa Ana for the pro- 
tection and material assistance of needy students. The statutes of 
the new organization provide that in addition to the organizing 
and contributing members there shall be active and corresponding 
members composed of teachers in Salvador and other Central Ameri- 
can countries. 
Educational activities in the several States are stimulated by the 
improved commercial prospects and the growing intercourse with 
the United States, and also directly by observation of the working 
of the school system established in the Canal Zone. The importance 
of an annual educational census is generally admitted not only as a 
means of giving each State knowledge of its own condition, but of 
promoting common standards and the interchange of students. Va- 
rious propositions have been made looking to the adoption of a com- 
mon statistical scheme, but circumstances have not yet been favorable 
to the realization of such a plan. 
A basis for closer educational union between the States is found 
in the interests that are at the present time paramount in all. Ex- 
periments in rural education, following the example set by Costa 
Rica, as noted in previous reports of this series, are multiplied+ 
The demand for better-trained teachers has led to preliminary meas- 
ures looking to the establishment of a central normal school and a 
system of student exchange which can not fail to increase fraternal 
relations and the adoption of common educational standards. For 
example, the Government of Salvador has accepted the offer of 
two scholarships in the Heredia Normal College, made by the Gov- 
ernment of Costa Rica to Salvadorean students. 
In each one of the States provision for technical and industrial 
education is increasing, accompanied by a tendency to send selected 
students to foreign technical schools. In 1914 nine students from 
Salvador were maintained in foreign technical schools. Of these,

three were sent to the United States; two additional students were 
also assisted in attending a school of engineering in this country.

America are given in the university table in this chapter. For sta- 
tistics pertaining to elementary education, see Table 1, chapter 37. 
SOUTH AMERICA. 
CURRENT ACTIVITIES AND DISCUSSIONS. 
South America comprises 10 independent Republics which, as 
regards education, present many common characteristics and also 
great diversity. In all the States higher education has received 
more attention in the past than primary schools for the common 
people, but in this respect a marked change has taken place within a 
few years, and in the majority of the States at present the latter 
interest is paramount both in general discussions and in legislative 
measures. The importance of a periodical survey of educational con- 
ditions is everywhere recognized, but has only been attempted in a 
few States and not upon a uniform plan in these; in other States 
partial surveys have been carried out. At present, therefore, it is 
impossible to niake a comprehensive survey of education excepting in 
the case of a very few States. 
From a careful study of the statistics available, it appears that 
four States of South America have made decided progress in the 
effort to provide adequately for the elementary education of all the 
people. Argentina excels in the proportion of the population under. 
instruction, viz, 11.9 per cent; Chile follows with 10.7 per cent en- 
rolled; Paraguay reports 8.4 per cent; and Uruguay, which has made 
very careful distinction between public and private schools, had 7.2 
per cent of the population in the former schools in 1914; the propor- 
tion was raised to 8.8 per cent by the addition of the enrollment in 
private primary schools. 
Chile, which has the advantage of a system of primary instruc- 
tion, well organized for a longer period than that of the neighbor- 
ing States, has recently taken active measures for improving school 
buildings throughout the State. By a law passed during the current 
year Congress has authorized the President to invest 10,000,000 pesos 
($3,650,000) in the construction of schoolhouses on sites now held 
’ by the Government. The funds will be raised by bonds, which will 
be issued in specific amounts for four successive years. Of the entire 
fund the sum of 30,000 pesos ($1,095) is to be allowed as prizes for 
designs and estimates offered for the proposed buildings. 
The Venezuelan Bureau of Statistics has carried out the purpose of 
publishing an annual yearbook presenting a survey of the activities 
of the Government. The work has excited favorable comment in

critical journals of Europe, and is cited in a list of model annuals of 
this character in an article on the subject published by La Statistique 
General de la France. This work illustrates the thorough manner in 
which Venezuela has set about the endeavor to achieve full knowledge 
of social conditions in the State, including in this scheme the survey 
of schools and other educational agencies. 
The advantage of periodical censuses is plainly indicated by the 
results in Paraguay. The director general of the statistical depart- 
ment of this State includes in his annual report for 1914 statistics of 
education, which, as compared with the similar particulars for 1911, 
show a gain inethe three years of 50 primary schools and 21,497 
pupils. This is convincing proof that the recent efforts of the Gov- 
ernment in behalf of the education of the people have been fruit- 
ful. The determination of the authorities in this State to improve 
the quality, while increasing the number, of the rural schools is indi- 
cated by the establishment in 1914 of a rural normal school at Villa 
Rica. At the close of 1915 more than 80 students graduated, and for 
the current year the graduating class numbered 120. Thus, a force of 
trained teachers, a large part of whom will be employed in the rural 
schools, enters upon the service just at the moment when new pro- 
grams for primary schools have been issued with specific directions as 
to the means of adapting the instruction directly to the needs and 
vital interests of the children. These programs provide for a graded 
course of primary instruction covering six years, although it is recog- 
nized that in the rural districts pupils can hardly be expected to ad- 
vance beyond the fourth grade. Because of this limitation, lessons in 
useful knowledge are begun in the first grade and continued through 
the third, after which they are replaced by more formal lessons in 
natural science, and in civic and moral instruction. Thus, the fourth 
year is made particularly informing, while at the same time a new 
element is introduced by the addition of geometry and drawing at 
this stage. 
The report for Uruguay shows a decided increase in the public 
elementary schools in 1914, as compared with 1913. This result is 
due chiefly to the increased number of public schools in the rural 
districts which have been the chief subject of attention in recent 
years. Experience shows that these schools are the chief factors in 
the development of the country people, since they not only benefit 
the children, but also entire families because of the influence which 
the schoolmaster exercises in the neighborhood and the respect that 
he inspires by reason of his superior knowledge. In 1906 there were 
only 400 public primary schools, as against 991 in 1914, so that within 
a decade the number more than doubled. 
Recent reports received from several States of South America 
abound in discussions of primary education, its administration and
-P-A-G-E-567
  SOUTH AMERICA. 539 
purposes, not unlike those which appear in State and city reports of 
the Union. As an example may be cited a memorial addressed 
during the year to the minister of public instruction and agriculture 
in Argentina by the educational council of the Province of Santa Fe, 
the second in population in the State. The memorial criticizes the 
present school law as antiquated in principles, and even absurd, in 
the light of modern requirements. Complaint is made that the fail- 
ure of the law to confer autonomy upon the council has resulted in 
uncertainty as to the relative rights of that body and the director 
general. Although the school law does not recognize the supreme 
authority of the council, in practice this is admitted, and it is there- 
fore desirable to legalize the actual situation. 
The same memorial dwells upon the importance of the pedagogical 
conferences which are promoted by all the authorities concerned in 
school management. A program cited in the memorial which was 
prepared for a conference held at Santa Fe during the year is ex- 
tremely suggestive as regards topics and their assignments. The 
program is as follows: 
. Methods of teaching orthography (the inspector general). 
. School discipline (the sectional inspector). 
. Sensation and perception (Dr. José Oliva). 
. Association of ideas (Dr. José Oliva). 
. Methodology of arithmetic (the vice director of the Belgrano school). 
. Methodology of reading (the director of the Sarmiento school). 
. Methodology of the national language (the subinspectors of the first sec- 
tion). 
8. Process of thinking (assigned to a teacher). 
AQMARWNH 
In Uruguay the system of public instruction has developed beyond 
the legal requirements, and at the request of the minister the well- 
known inspector of primary instruction, Sr. Abel Perez, has formu- 
lated the project of a new law which was submitted to the legislature 
in the fall of 1915. This project provides for a still higher develop- 
ment of the rural schools, a more perfectly organized inspection 
service, and large extension of medical school inspection. 
The independence of municipalities, which is characteristic of the 
South American States, has two effects upon the progress of public 
education. On the one side it often stands in the way of the enforce- 
ment of a general school law, but again individual municipalities 
enact orders far in advance of the legal provisions. An example is 
afforded by the action of the mayor of Santiago de Chile who has 
recently issued an order relative to the compulsory instruction of 
children from 6 to 14 years of age, which is particularly explicit in 
regard to the obligation of the fathers or guardians of children in 
this respect. Violations of this law are punishable by fines amount- 
ing in the first case to 10 pesos ($1.80 United States currency), and 
increased to 20 pesos in the case of a second infraction. If the  
-P-A-G-E-568
    540 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
father or other responsible guardian fails to pay the fine incurred, 
he is subject to imprisonment for one day for each 5 pesos of the fine. 
The duration of this arrest, however, may not exceed five days in 
any case. 
In the majority of the South American States secondary eduea- 
tion is provided in schools under private management, often denomi- 
national in character. They are subsidized, as a rule, by their re- 
spective Governments, but the complaint is general that they follow 
traditional methods of instruction. For this reason, probably, the 
tendency to establish public secondary schools is increasing. At the 
same time the effort is made to infuse a new spirit into the private 
secondary schools in order that they may meet more fully the re- 
quirements of the developing industrial life. 
Peru, which has made several unsuccessful efforts to reorganize — 
the system of education during the last decade, is gradually modern- 
izing the system and the work of different departments. Recent 
attention has been concentrated upon the secondary schools (colegios) 
which provide for a four years’ course of study much too elaborate 
for thorough work in the limited period. The colegios include 27 
maintained by the Government, which offer a promising field for 
improvement. The private schools of the same grade of necessity 
follow the official programs, since they all prepare for the same 
examinations. The completion of the course is required for admis- 
sion to the university faculties of letters and philosophy and of 
natural sciences. In these faculties students complete their prepara- 
tion for the more highly specialized professional faculties. 
The arrangement by which students of medicine have the oppor- 
tunity of completing their preliminary studies in the university fac- 
ulty of natural sciences tends somewhat to obscure the importance of 
these subjects in the scheme of secondary instruction. The latest pro- 
grams, however, are intended to provide a better-balanced course by 
increasing the time assigned to the natural sciences and general 
history. ‘ 
One of the most flourishing secondary schools in South America is 
the national college, Vicente Rocafuerte at Guayaquil, Ecuador. It 
comprises, as is frequently the case with the so-called secondary 
schools, primary and higher sections to which are added special de- 
partments. The programs of the higher section, it is recognized, 
present a scheme of work that can not be accomplished in three years. 
The special sections of the college are commercial and agricultural in 
character. The latter has recently been provided with laboratories 
for the practical study of agriculture, physics, chemistry, and vege- 
table physiology. ~ 
It is a matter of interest that the demand for the English language 
has greatly increased in this college during the past-three years, as
-P-A-G-E-569
  
SOUTH AMERICA. 541 
appears from the fact that the proportion of students taking this 
language increased from one-third of the total number in 1913 to 
eleven-twelfths during the present year. The French language suf- 
fered corresponding decrease. This change is attributed to the 
growing interest in the question of Ecuador’s foreign trade, largely 
with English-speaking countries, and the popularity of the pro- 
fessor, who is a graduate of Dartmouth College. 
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION VERSUS INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL WELFARE. 
As a result of the awakened interest in economic conditions 
throughout South America, there is a rising demand for various 
forms of specialized education. Little provision has thus far been 
made for the higher orders of technical training, but schools of arts 
and trades have long existed in the chief cities and their number is 
at present increasing. The interests of women are considered in this 
activity and either separate departments for feminine industries are 
organized in existing schools or new schools created. 
A law pertaining to industrial education has recently been passed 
in Uruguay which provides for a graded system of industrial schools, 
including normal schools to prepare teachers for this service. The 
school of domestic arts authorized by a decree of August, 1914, has 
been opened at Montevideo, and it is proposed to establish several 
centers for similar instruction in different parts of the country. 
In Venezuela provision has recently been made for a school of 
arts and crafts for women at the national capital. 
One of the most important agencies for promoting industrial edu- 
cation is the Sociedad de Fomento Fabril in Chile. This society, 
with the aid of the Government, maintains 12 industrial schools and 
also an industrial library at Santiago, which is open to the public 
every day and is freely consulted. 
Agricultural education excites more and more attention every 
year. The Colombian Government provided for a school of seri- 
culture by decree of December 15, 1915, and appropriated money for 
the purchase of the needed equipment. The school will be adequate 
for 30 pupils, who will be selected from the applicants by the di- 
rector, preference being given to needy and deserving women who 
show some aptitude for the work. The silk spun at the school will 
be classified and sold for the benefit of the Government silk-culture 
fund. 
An agricultural and veterinary school is to be established in the 
hot lands of Colombia, and it is reported that contracts have been 
made by the Colombian Government with foreign experts to assist 
in organizing this institution and in promoting general interest in 
the subject of agricultural education, :

  542 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
With respect to commercial education, South America has been 
stimulated by the example of France and the southern countries of 
Europe in which this subject has always been one of especial interest. 
At present the increasing opportunities of trade have given a new 
impulse to this subject, which has resulted in several very important 
measures of general interest. 
In Argentina a committee of six specialists was appointed in 1912 
to report on courses of instruction for the Superior National School 
of Commerce at Buenos Aires. As a result elaborate courses in ac- 
countancy, business management, and salesmanship have been adopted 
and laboratories provided for the students prepared for practical 
work in chemistry and micrography as applied to processes and 
material. 
There are also in Buenos Aires a university faculty of economic 
sciences and a commercial school for women. The public provision 
for commercial training includes commercial schools at La Plata, 
Bahia-Blanca, Tucuman, and Concordia. In 1913 the whole number 
of graduates from these schools was 140, the total enrollment 2,856, 
and the annual cost of the schools $1,398,770. 
In Chile a “general commission of commercial education” has 
been created by law to advise the Government in respect to the admin- 
istration of institutions for mercantile instruction. The minister of 
public instruction is appointed as chairman of this commission, and 
the five remaining members appointed by the president of the Repub- 
lic must include one merchant, one professor of financial education, 
the inspector of institutions for special education, and the president 
of the board of the well-known commercial institute of Santiago. 
In 1914 there were altogether 11 commercial institutes in Chile, 
with 3,691 matriculates. The total expense for these was $967,912.04. 
The scope of the school of commerce at Caracas, Venezuela, has 
recently been expanded by the addition of a school of modern lan- 
gauges. There are commercial schools also at Bolivar and Mara- 
caibo, in this State. 
At Montevideo, Uruguay, there is a national school of commerce, 
under the administration of a council and director appointed by the 
executive. The course of instruction is arranged for four years, lead- 
ing to the diploma of expert mercantile accountant. “The equipment 
of the institution includes a valuable museum. In 1913 the number 
of students was 116. 
Social science has long been a favorite subject of discussion on 
the part of leading men in South America, many of whom are gradu- 
ates of the university law faculties, which generally comprise this 
subject in their curricula. This interest is having a practical out- 
come in endeavors for relating public instruction to other branches 
of public administration. Among evidences of this tendency may
-P-A-G-E-571
  
SOUTH AMERICA, ; 543 
be noted the measure for creating a bureau or institute of labor 
which was introduced in the Congress of Uruguay during the present 
year. It is proposed that the work of this bureau should be divided 
into three sections, under the ministry of the interior, the ministry 
of justice and public instruction, and the ministry of industries, 
respectively. 
The movement for social improvement in Chile has led to the 
appointment of a commissioner on criminology to be under the 
general direction of the minister of justice. The instructions to 
the new official call for an annual report on the subject, accompanied 
by recommendations of measures for the prevention of crime, the 
reform of delinquents, and the intelligent management of prisoners. 
As an aid to this service, a laboratory of experimental psychology 
will be established in the penitentiary at Santiago. It is predicted 
that the researches there conducted will have a value for education 
as well as for reformatory activities. } 
The Argentine Republic has celebrated during the year the jubilee 
of its independence. The program of ceremonies is marked by the 
number of congresses included which bear directly upon the educa- 
tional and social welfare of the people. A congress on social sciences, 
organized under the auspices of the Argentine Government, was 
held at the city of Tucuman in July, all the American States, north 
and south, having been invited to participate. The committee or 
organization in charge of the affair was selected by the minister of 
justice and public instruction of the Republic. 
The first Pan American Child’s Congress was also announced as 
a feature of the celebration, and its sessions took place in August in 
the city of Buenos Aires. 
The Bolivian Government, which in it recent measures for improv- 
ing the entire system of education has emphasized the importance of 
studying the aptitudes and individual condition of children, was 
well represented in the child’s congress held at Buenos Aires, and 
furnished for the accompanying exhibit several collections illus- 
trating improved methods of teaching and also of promoting the 
general welfare of the young. Arrangements have been made for 
a national education exhibition to be held at La Paz, Bolivia, for 
the purpose of interesting the people in the work of schools and 
colleges. 
BRAZIL. 
Within an area exceeding that of the United States exclusive of 
Alaska, the Republic of Brazil comprises a population of twenty-one 
and one-half millions, which is equivalent to about 43 per cent of 
the entire population of South America. It is organized in 20 States 
and the Federal District. Beyond the limits of this district the Cen-
-P-A-G-E-572
  544 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
tral Government has no control of elementary schools, but is respon- 
sible for university and secondary education throughout the country. 
The individual States not only are independent in the management of 
their school affairs, but municipalities enjoy large freedom in this 
matter. These conditions indicate the great obstacles that must be 
overcome in the effort to establish universal education. Viewing the 
country as a whole, it would seem that little progress has been made 
in this respect, since the percentage of illiteracy is estimated at over 
80 per cent of the entire population. On the other hand, it is 
well known that Brazilians of the ruling class are highly cultured, 
have a passion for the arts and sciences, and a truly cosmopolitan 
spirit. Speaking and writing French is an invariable accomplish- 
ment, promoted undoubtedly by the fact that the native language, 
Portuguese, is generally unfamiliar to other people. 
The Federal District has an admirable system of schools, and Rio 
de Janeiro has long enjoyed distinction as a center of culture and 
refinement. In this city are several schools of renown, among them 
a technical school which probably has no superior in South America, 
and a higher school of agriculture and veterinary medicine. 
The awakened interest with respect to popular education is indicated 
by a decree of April 5, 1911, creating a Federal board of education, 
with authority to establish schools in the States which neglect their 
duty in this particular. An interesting evidence of the tendency 
toward centralized control, and also of the determination to preserve 
intact the language and institutions characteristic of Brazil, is af- 
forded by an animated discussion which took place during the current 
year in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. The exciting subject 
was a bill providing for modifications of a draft law amending the 
present law governing secondary and superior instruction. The pur- 
pose of the draft law was to prevent the maintenance of any schools 
in Brazil in which any foreign language should be used to the exclu- 
sion of Portuguese. It provided that the Brazilian language shall 
be taught in all schools of any grade whatsoever maintained by pri- 
vate individuals or foreign associations, and subsidized or not, directly 
or indirectly, by any European Government, whether their purpose 
should be the diffusion of primary instruction, religion, technical 
tuition, or some other object not specified. 
The discussion of the bill turned on the authority of the Federal 
Government to intervene in this matter in States having independent 
control of their own schools, and, while there was general agree- 
ment as to the importance of such a requirement, it was eventually 
ruled that its enforcement was not within the competency of the 
Central Government. It was therefore decided that the desired 
regulation should be embodied in the provisions of law of the 
various States rather than enacted as a Federal law.
-P-A-G-E-573
  
  SOUTH AMERICA, 545 
Notwithstanding the independence of the individual States, and 
the wide difference between them in respect to educational progress, 
it is noticeable that as the States become more and more active in 
this matter they tend to approach uniformity in respect to their 
school systems. For this reason the more advanced States may be 
said to represent an ideal toward which the whole country is moving. 
The State of Sao Paulo, which ranks ninth in the Republic in 
respect to area and second in population, having in 1900 two and 
one-quarter million inhabitants, has recently published complete 
school statistics for 1912, which are here summarized:

The budget of Sao Paulo for 1914 carried a total of $1,175,784 for. 
education, of which amount $935,177 was actually expended for the 
maintenance of 1,108 grammar schools, 963 subsidized private schools, 
29 grammar schools operating in special buildings and graded, and 
1 normal school. The expenditure exceeded that for 1913 by $81,143. 
As industries develop, schools multiply. This is true of elementary 
schools and also of schools for industrial and technical training. 
For instance, the State of Minas Geraes has recently assumed charge 
of the cotton industry, and to further its development the services 
of an expert have been engaged for the practical teaching of cotton 
culture. It is proposed to establish demonstration fields in suitable 
zones where the processes of planting and cultivation, the prepara- 
tion of the product, and the use of implements and machines will be 
taught. Machines are provided by the Government at cost price. 
In like manner the State of Sao Paulo, which has recently made 
great effort to diversify its resources, has established at central points 
State agricultural colleges and institutes where farming and cattle

  raising are scientifically studied. Technical instructors have been 
brought from abroad, and the advantages of this policy are proved 
by the rapid advance in agricultural productions. Between 1900 and 
1912 the area planted very nearly doubled, and the production, meas- 
ured by tons, increased by 60 per cent.

BRAZIL, 
Higher education in Brazil is provided by separate professional 
faculties or schools which up to the present time have not been organ- 
ized as universities. These independent institutions are situated in

the principal State capitals and are either national—that is, sup- 
ported by the national treasury—or free from Government control 
and maintained by fees, subscriptions, etc.; the latter have practi- 
cally the same curricula as the national institutions, since all are 
preparing for like professional careers. The education law of 1911 
provided for the university form of organization, toward which 
important influences are now tending. Technical education of a high 
order, which in other States of South America is represented by 
university faculties. as well as by technical schools, is the province 
of special schools in Brazil. The faculties and schools for which 
recent statistics have been reported are as follows, the date of report 
in each case being 1913: 
Bahia:1 
Faculdade de Medicina, Cirurgia, e Pharmacia (1808); 44 professors, 
1,850 students; annual expenditures, $300,000.

Faculdade de Direito de Sao Paulo (1827) ; 28 professors ; 550 students.* 
Escola de Pharmacia e Odontologia, etc. (1898); 12 professors; 240 
students.’ 
An analysis of the statistics of 11 of the universities tabulated 
shows that the faculties of law and medicine attract the largest pro- 
portion of students. In the universities referred to, the law faculties 
comprise 23.6 per cent of the total students and the medical faculties 
42.3 per cent. 
The titles given to the law faculties indicate their broad scope and 
dual functions. They are intended not only to prepare men for   
1 Information derived from Minerva,  
-P-A-G-E-576
  548 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
professional practice, but also for the administration of public 
affairs. In every State applicants for admission to the legal faculties 
must have a diploma showing the completion of a secondary course of 
study, covering a period of six or seven years; or, if the period 
be shorter, additional preparation in the university faculty of letters. 
Hence the student of law comes to his professional studies with apti- 
tudes developed under literary influences, and these are strengthened 
by the course of professional study. It is not surprising, therefore, 
that a large proportion of the men of letters in Latin America are 
graduates in law, the interests cultivated during the student period 
having been further stimulated by relation with the academies or 
societies of learned men which flourish in the university centers. 
The combination of legal, political, and sociological studies explains 
the large place which men of affairs hold in the literary annals of 
the South American States. A striking example is afforded by the 
former President of Chile, Don Pedro Montt, who is a graduate of 
the law course of the University of Santiago, and widely known as 
an authority on international law. 
The scientific spirit of the modern era has penetrated the Latin- 
American universities by way of the faculties of medicine, many 
of which are well equipped with laboratories, have large hospital 
facilities, and draw to their service professors who have pursued 
their studies in Europe and are familiar with the modern develop- 
ments of medical science. As one of the practical results of progress 
in this respect may be mentioned the admirable systems of school 
medical inspection in the principal cities of South America, and in 
the case of Uruguay its extension to the entire country. 
The proportion of students in the scientific faculties, strictly so 
called, is small. The University of La Plata, which was established 
in 1905, is an exception in this respect, particular attention having 
been bestowed upon the faculty of science, which has been recruited 
in part from Europe, and numbers several men of special eminence. 
The University of Havana has recently extended the scope of the 
scientific faculties without detriment to the humanities. Prof. Aris- 
tides Agramonte, who holds the chair of bacteriology and experi- 
mental pathology in this university, is well known in the United 
States as the discoverer jointly with Reed and Carroll of mosquito 
transmission of yellow fever. 
Scientific activities are also promoted by the agency of institutes, 
museums, and observatories, which, if not directly adjuncts of the 
universities, are available for their students. 
Astronomical science owes much to observations conducted at the 
observatories of Rio de Janeiro and Santiago de Chile; the ethno- 
logical museums, which form a marked feature of university equip- 
ment throughout the Latin-American States, are the outcome of
-P-A-G-E-577
  SOUTH AMERICA, 549 
researches which have added greatly to the world’s knowledge of 
primitive races. 
The national university of Chile offers in its pedagogic institute 
an illustration of cosmopolitan influences which have borne an im- 
portant part in shaping the work of many of the higher institutions 
of South America. The faculty of the pedagogic institute comprises 
at present 14 professors, all of whom have been chosen with regard 
to their success in combining research and authorship with their 
formal duties as instructors. It is interesting to note that the 
diplomas held by the members of this faculty represent the prin- 
cipal universities of Europe. 
REGARD FOR PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS, 
In connection with the tabulated data respecting the universities 
of Central and South America, attention may properly be called to 
the care taken by the various Governments to maintain the stand- 
ards of professional education in their respective States. The fol- 
lowing statements from recent official communications on the sub- 
ject fairly illustrate the value placed upon foreign diplomas and 
the proofs of qualification required on the part of foreigners seeking 
to practice professions in all the States considered : 
The Congress of Bolivia passed a law concerning licenses required 
for the practice of the medical and allied professions which was 
promulgated by President Montes, September 15, 1915. With regard 
to doctors from foreign countries which have not concluded conven- 
tions with Bolivia for the practice of the liberal professions, the 
law requires that they must pass an examination (art. 2 of the law 
of Nov. 21, 1907) and pay specified fees. Foreign applicants for 
licenses coming from countries which have conventions with Bolivia 
providing for the free exercise of the liberal professions are required 
to submit their diplomas, prove their personal identity, and pay 
specified sums into the national treasury. 
The minister of justice and foreign affairs for the Province of 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in reply to an inquiry on the subject of medi- 
eal diplomas, states that the diplomas conferred by the faculties of 
the medical departments of universities of the United States do not 
confer the right to practice in the city of Rio de Janeiro without a 
previous examination to show that the individual holders of diplomas 
have fulfilled the regulations authorized by the latest decrees on that 
subject (bearing date Mar. 18, 1914) issued in the Province. Den- 
tists desiring to practice in Chile must present their diplomas to 
the University of Chile, with application for examination, accom- 
panied by a fee of $70, according to a recent law published in the 
Diario Oficial. If the applicant presents a diploma from a university

-P-A-G-E-578
  550 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
recognized by the Chilean University, he will be given a practical 
and theoretical examination and issued a certificate if successful. 
If his diploma is from an unrecognized university, he must take a 
complete third-year course in the Chilean School of Dentistry and 
pay a fee of $140. 
By a law of 1914 the Congress of Colombia decreed as follows 
regarding medical diplomas for foreigners: 
An individual having a diploma issued by a foreign faculty can not exercise 
the practice of medicine in Colombia without fulfilling the following require- 
ments: 
(1) He must present to the government of his department his diploma, 
properly legalized (certified) by a Colombian diplomatic or consular officer 
resident in the country where the diploma was issued. 
(2) He must prove his identity, for which purpose the diploma should carry 
a photograph of the holder affixed and stamped with the seal of the legation 
or consulate where legalized. 
(3) He must pass an examination in clinics during an hour in a hospital 
and before a council of four examiners named by the board of hygiene or by 
the medical faculties, where such exist. 
All persons having diplomas issued in foreign countries and who may have 
practiced the medical profession in Colombia for more than a year before the 
adoption of this law shall present their diplomas to the governor of the re- 
spective department within 120 days, who will then concede the legal right to 
practice. After that period they will be subject to the dispositions of the 
present article, except in case of Colombians who are graduates of a well-known 
medical institution the solidity of whose teachings are recognized and whose 
diplomas carry the certificate of a consular or diplomatic officer of Colombia 
stationed abroad. These may exercise their profession freely, the same as 
graduates of Colombian medical schools. 
The following provisions relative to the recognition in Ecuador 
of academic grades or degrees conferred by foreign institutions are 
comprised in the organic law of public instruction passed in 1912: 
Examination certificates issued by foreign institutions shall have the same 
value as those of the national institutions, provided they are properly legalized. 
Those who wish to select an academical title or degree shall present their 
certificates of the studies pursued before the respective faculty or the admin- 
istrative council. ; 
If the council finds that the corresponding courses have been sufficiently 
_ Studied, the documents being authentic, the candidate shall be certified as com- 
petent, and he will then take the general examination. 
The academic grades or degrees received in foreign institutions shall be 
recognized in Ecuador, after having taken the respective general examination 
before the authority competent to confer the corresponding degree. 
The dispositions of the previous articles shall govern in all cases except 
where treaties have been made providing for the question of professional 
liberty. 
After the degree which was obtained in the exterior has been recognized, the 
respective authority shall confer a corresponding one in conformity with the 
dispositions of this law.

CHAPTER XXXII. 
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. 
EFFECTS OF THE WAR. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Among the great disasters entailed by the European war must 
be counted the check to plans for developing public education. On 
the eve of the outbreak of the war such plans were uppermost in 
all the countries since involved in that struggle. Propositions had 
been submitted to their legislatures or were under advisement, and 
vigorous agitation was maintained in behalf of needed reforms in 
the schools, large extension of the provision for the instruction of 
the masses, and their better preparation for industrial life and civic 
duties. These efforts have ceased not only in the countries engaged 
in the struggle, but also in neighboring countries, which, although 
neutral, are threatened with unknown emergencies, and by reason 
of the increased costs of living and the disturbance of trade and 
industry are unable to apply their resources to works of internal 
development. At the same time, the usual sources of educational 
information are wanting. Official reports have not been published 
or their scope has been greatly restricted; many of the educational 
journals have suspended, and those that have continued deal almost 
exclusively with conditions growing out of the war. Consequently the 
present survey of education in Europe will be limited, in the main, 
to the different phases of the same subject. 
With respect to many disturbances that the war has caused 
throughout the whole range of education, a general statement would 
apply alike to all the countries directly affected: Retrenchments, 
reduction and disorganization of the teaching force by the call of 
men to arms, temporary expedients to supply this loss by combining 
schools, substituting women, doubling the work of professors past 
the military age, deserted universities—these are features of the 
common record. They pertain, however, solely to the internal affairs 
of schools and higher institutions. At the same time the war makes 
heavy demands upon the teaching fraternity for services in behalf 
of children bereft of parental care, for soldiers in the field, the 
wounded in hospitals, and for the maimed and mutilated who must 
551
-P-A-G-E-580
    552 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
be prepared for some forms of industrial activity through tedious 
and novel processes of training possible only to teachers skilled in 
the arts of stimulating and instructing. No reference is here made 
to efforts which teachers and students share with all other social 
groups, including time and money contributed through various 
organizations working for the national cause. 
Apart from the effects of the war common to the different coun- 
tries, it is obvious that each will present special conditions of great 
significance. This would necessarily be the case in Great Britain, 
whose activities have suddenly been turned in new directions, and 
in a country invaded as France has been. From the political or- 
ganizations of these two nations it follows also that every meas- 
ure proposed for present amelioration or future security becomes 
the subject of public discussion and report; hence the immediate 
effects of the war upon educational activities as well as in respect 
to opinions and purposes are prominent features of the current 
record, social and political. 
The central powers of Europe show similar disturbances in the 
school conditions, but so far their bearing upon prevailing educa- 
tional policies is less pronounced. 
At this time no summary of the effects here referred to is possible, 
but their partial rehearsal is essential to the year’s survey. 
ENGLAND. 
RETRENCHMENTS FORCED BY THE WAR. 
At the opening of the British Parliament in 1914 the outline of 
a scheme for the development of a national system of education was 
presented to the House of Commons by the president of the board of 
education. The proposals included larger grants for technical and 
secondary education, for the training of teachers, and for other 
extensions, involving, according to the subsequent statement by the 
chancellor of the exchequer, an additional sum of £3,892,000, very 
nearly $20,000,000, if they were to be carried into effect. 
The latest report of the board (issued in 1916) states that prog- 
ress in this matter, at least as regards financial aid, was arrested by 
the outbreak of the war. Meanwhile the plans of reform are not 
wholly abandoned, but, so far as circumstances permit, are under 
formal inquiry and preliminary consultations. The events of the 
war have deepened the conviction that the national system of educa- 
tion must be developed on the lines laid down. 
The necessity for retrenchment in expenditure on all branches of 
the civil service was emphasized by the appointment in July, 1915, 
of a treasury committee on the subject. The final report of this 
_committee, which was submitted in February, 1916, dwelt in par-
-P-A-G-E-581
  ENGLAND. 553 
ticular upon the education services. The difficulty of economy in 
this direction was distinctly recognized in view of the prevalent 
feeling that such “economies are dangerous and may in the long run 
be unremunerative.” The opinion was expressed by the committee, 
however, that no material loss of efficiency would result from post- 
poning or reducing the capital expenditures on new buildings, equip- 
ments, etc., which under normal conditions amount to about 
£3,000,000 a year. 
Further retrenchments, it was pointed out, could be made “with- 
out a loss of efficiency, by altering the present school ages so as to 
reduce the number of children in the schools,” and for this purpose 
the committee advised that measures should be adopted “for exclud- 
ing from school all children under 5 years of age, except in very 
poor town areas, and for withdrawing all grants in respect of such 
children, legislation being obtained for this purpose so far as is 
necessary.” It was suggested further that the age for admission 
might be raised to 6 or 7 years, corresponding to the usual require- 
ments on the Continent. 
The local education authorities had already been subject to great 
pressure from various sources in regard to the exercise of economy 
in the matter of education, and the work of building was generally 
suspended before the committee on retrenchment reported. 
The committee on retrenchment concluded that saving was pos- 
sible in the administrative and inspection services. With regard to 
the former, they advised that the official forms which local authorities 
and teachers are obliged to fill out and return to the board of educa- 
tion should be simplified and their number reduced. The opinion 
was also expressed that there was unnecessary duplication in the 
inspection service by the appointment of specialists and as a conse- 
quence of the dual system of central and local inspectors. 
EXCLUSION OF CHILDREN UNDER 5 YEARS OF AGE. 
The exclusion from school of children under 5 years of age has 
been authorized in many places, but is strongly opposed for social 
reasons. The action of the London authorities in this matter was 
brought before the House of Commons by the member from North 
Somerset, who stated that when the matter was before the education 
committee of the metropolis, it was at once pointed out that there 
were a large number of children already excluded and that those who 
were in school could not be kept out in order to make room for 
others, nor their numbers restricted without great social difficulties 
and suffering. On this point he said: 
A number of the mothers of these children go out to work, and they send 
their younger children to the infant school, very often in charge of the older  
-P-A-G-E-582
  554 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
children who go to the upper standards, and unless they had these facilities 
these women would not be able to carry on their usual employment. At the 
present time the number of women working in this way taking advantage of 
the infant schools, and their elder children attending the school together, is 
largely increasing. I am told that in certain munition areas the number is 
very large indeed, and to begin at this time excluding those children from school 
is cruelty, bad policy from the point of view of making munitions, and bad 
policy from the point of view of the welfare of those young children. 
Referring to a compromise order to the effect that children under 5 
should only be excluded when the social circumstances made it advis- 
able, the speaker declared that this had led to a sort of inquisition 
which had proved grievous to parents and which appeared “to be an 
infringement of the liberty and rights of the people.” He expressed 
the hope that the board of education might be instructed to interfere 
and force local authorities to keep the schools open to children with- 
out regard to social circumstances. In reply to this suggestion it was 
pointed out by the Parliamentary secretary to the board that these 
were matters outside its competence and jurisdiction, as they had been 
left by the law entirely to the local authorities. 
The importance of the example of London arises from the large 
proportion of the very young children that are in its schools. They 
are estimated to form one-eighth the total number for the Kingdom. 
It may be noted here that in 1915 there were on the registers of 
the schools of England and Wales 283,366 children below 5 years of 
age. These, with the children between 5 and 6 years of age, made 
a total of 893,000. In other words, 14.6 per cent of the pupils en- 
rolled in the elementary schools in that year, viz, 6,108,648, were 
below the age generally required for admission to the elementary 
schools of the Continent. 
EXEMPTION OF CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE. 
More serious than the exclusion of very young children from 
school is the demand for the exemption of children of school age 
to make up for the loss of labor. Every industry is represented in 
this requirement, the textile industry, commercial business, and 
above all, agriculture. As to the actual number of children released 
from school attendance in response to these demands, exact state- 
ments are wanting. It appears that up to January 31, 1915, accord- 
ing to statistics presented in Parliament, 1,400 children subject to 
school attendance were employed in agriculture. In May of the same 
year the number had increased to 3,800, and in July, 1916, to 15,750. 
In the Parliamentary debate on this subject Sir J. Yoxall, long 
identified with movements for the welfare of children, said: 
There are two ways of exempting children from school for farm labor. There 
is the open and unblushing method adopted when returns have to be made to 
the board of education, and there is the indirect method, far more effective,
-P-A-G-E-583
  ENGLAND. 555 
which consists in not prosecuting parents or employers who make use of child 
Jabor in an illicit way, and I am very much afraid that inquiries into the real 
circumstances will show that 15,000 is very much beneath the mark. * * * 
I would like to see the president of the board empowered ty say to a local 
education authority, if necessary: “Very well, if you yield to the popular 
clamor of the farmers in your locality and rob from those children what ought 
to be their birthright of, at any rate, a modicum of education from the age of 
11 to the age of 13, we will fine you by withdrawing the whole grant or a large 
portion of it.” There is the remedy. It is again money that lies at the bot- 
tom of the whole matter. The demand for these children is a money ree 
sordid motive—and a sordid motive requires sordid punishment. 
The unwise policy of depending upon child abide tie this crisis 
excited protests from individuals and organized associations through- 
out the Kingdom. The grounds of this opposition are set forth in 
a powerful appeal by one of the most determined champions of the 
rights of children in England, as follows: 
The war is laying its hand heavily upon the youth of the nation. * * * 
The wrong to the youngest children may possibly be redeemed, if it does not 
continue too long. The problem of the few years of adolescence is more fateful 
and more urgent. 
Even in peace time one of our few statesmen said that one of the most urgent 
national problems was how to check the evils by which “too many of our 
bright, clean, clever boys leaving school at 18 or 14 had become ignorant and 
worthless hooligans at 17 or 18.” 
Much has been done in recent years by patient, skilled endeavor to staunch 
this wound in the body politic; but now all is reversed and the hooligan harvest 
promises to be truly plenteous. 
In view of the rapid increase in the demand for the work of boys 
and girls, the writer emphasizes the evils as follows: 
Long hours and unsuitable conditions are crippling health; high wages and 
lack of supervision are disastrously affecting character; an abnormal fire of 
enthusiasm, patriotism, or mere commonplace excitement is consuming both the 
nervous and moral fiber. The boy and girl of the industrial classes are often 
at the top of their power during the years of adolescence; at piecework wages 
they can earn more than their elders as nimbly as the smart newspaper boy 
runs his elderly rival off the streets. But it is not a few short months or years 
that are thus used up, it is their lives. 
All the great education societies and many other associations joined 
in the protest against the reduction of the school life of the children. 
It was the chief subject of consideration in the meeting for the cur- 
rent year of the National Teachers’ Union; the National Education 
Association, which is of more comprehensive character, devoted the 
annual conference to the same matter; the Association of Education 
Committees, representing all the local authorities in England, took 
firm stand against the reduction of the school life of the young; and 
the smaller, although not less influential associations, joined in the 
protest. The spirit which animated all these bodies was voiced by
-P-A-G-E-584
  556 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
the president of the National Association of Head Teachers. In an 
address before the annual meeting held at Nottingham June 22-23, 
which aroused great enthusiasm, he said: 
By voluntary enlistment we have raised fighting forces of some 5,000,000 men. 
The nation in countless forms has expressed its pride in this magnificent 
achievement ; it is the outward manifestation of a living patriotism which re- 
ceived its early stimulus within the four walls of our schools. Men, and women 
too, of every shade of thought and of every grade of society have written of the 
sterling qualities and admirable characteristics of our citizen soldiers. Their 
unflinching courage, their instinctive discipline, their patient endurance, their 
unfailing cheerfulness, their- self-respect, and, above all, their humanity and 
their underlying religious feeling—these are the qualities which confer distinc- 
tion upon our soldiers of to-day; these are the qualities which have so well 
merited the statement that our army is, in essentials, an army of gentlemen. 
The bulk of this army, and their fathers and mothers before them, passed 
through our primary schools. Under present conditions, teachers are fully 
alive to the duty which confronts them. They are determined, so far as it may 
lie within their power, that no child shall suffer permanent handicap in the 
race of life through the temporary dislocation of the education service. The 
schools must make sacrifices in common with every public service, both national 
and local, to meet the urgent needs of the country; but this obligation must 
not include essentials. School prizes may for the time be withheld, but the 
prizes of life must be safeguarded. Therein lies the explanation of the attitude 
teachers have assumed toward war economies in education. * * * We may 
safely conclude that the paramount right of the child, under all circumstances, 
to be educated in an efficient school is so firmly embedded in the conscience of 
the nation that it has even withstood the shock and strain of war. Our duty 
remains to widen the narrow conception of education which still exists. 
At a conference of the Workers’ Educational Association held in 
May of the current year the following resolution was unanimously 
carried : 
That this conference, having regard to the interests of children, strongly pro- 
tests against the recommendations of the committee for the retrenchment in 
the public expenditure concerning (@) the exclusion from school of all children 
under 5 years of age, and (0) the raising of the minimum age of compulsion 
from 5 to 6 years of age. Further, we view with alarm the suggested amalga- 
mation of the health services of the board of education with the local govern- 
ment board and the transference to the labor exchange department of the 
responsibility for juvenile committees. Such proposals are not, in the opinion 
of this conference, conducive to educational or administrative efficiency. 
That this conference strongly recommends all bodies represented to associate 
themselves with the Workers’ Educational Association, and in order to create 
an enlightened public opinion on educational problems urges upon the associa- 
tion the need of the organization of local conferences of all bodies and indi- 
viduals interested in education. 
Early in 1915 the board of education issued a circular urging the 
local authorities to use the utmost care in excusing children from 
school attendance for agricultural purposes. In view of the increase 
in the number of exemptions, a second circular dealing with the
-P-A-G-E-585
  
ENGLAND. 557 
subject was issued in February, 1916. This circular stated emphati- 
cally that— 
Children under 12 years of age should never be excused unless the circum- 
stances are entirely exceptional and then only for very short periods. 
Persons desiring to employ in agriculture children liable to attend school 
should be asked to furnish particulars of the character of the employment con- 
templated, the wages offered, and the period for which the labor is required. 
They should also be required to satisfy the authority that they have made 
adequate efforts, supported by the offer of reasonable wages, to secure the 
labor required in other directions, and more particularly by employing women. 
It was further suggested that the urgency of the need for the 
labor of school children might be tested by the amount of wages 
offered, and the general rule was laid down that if the labor of a boy 
of school age was not worth at least 6 shillings a week to the farmer 
the employment would not compensate for the loss entailed by the 
interruption of the boy’s schooling. The importance of strict con- 
trol over this matter was urged upon the attention of the local 
authorities. 
In all the discussions of the withdrawal of school children under 
the plea of pressing necessity there was manifested the determination 
to limit this action by every safeguard possible, and at the same 
time to excite an overwhelming public sentiment in support of 
measures for increasing the period and the efficiency of school train- 
ing upon the close of the war. As an immediate result of the 
opposition to the policy that was depriving thousands of young 
people between the ages of 12 and 14 of preparation for the condi- 
tions of normal industry, a departmental committee was appointed 
to consider the future of the boys and girls now engaged in munition 
and other work after that work shall be finished. 
INCREASE IN JUVENILE OFFENSES. 
Inquiries addressed to the police of 17 of the largest towns of 
England brought out the fact that comparing three months, Decem- 
ber, 1914, to February, 1915, with the corresponding months, Decem- 
ber, 1915, to February, 1916, the total number of children and young 
persons charged with punishable offenses had grown from 2,686 
to 3,596, or very nearly an increase of 1,000 for the 17 towns to 
which everyone contributed. This increase was attributed to the 
absence of parents and the weakening of parental control consequent 
upon the war, and to the fact that the work of boys’ clubs, which 
have been helpful in curbing the wild impulses of youth, had been 
crippled by the withdrawal of men of character who usually give 
time to these clubs, but who are now serving with the forces or 
engaged in munition work.
-P-A-G-E-586
    558 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
A circular addressed by the Home Office to the clerks of justices, 
calling their attention to these evils, adds to the above causes that 
of the effect of the indiscriminate display of moving pictures. On 
this subject the circular says: 
Many chief constables of large towns, and other persons interested in the 
welfare of the young, have represented that children are led to commit offenses 
by witnessing cinematograph films depicting crimes, the use of firearms, etc. ; 
and that children often steal money in order to obtain admission to cinemas. 
It was announced that the secretary of state had under considera- 
tion the whole question of the censorship of films, but the opinion 
was expressed that, where the local justices are the licensing authori- 
ties under the cinematograph act of 1909, special attention should be 
given to the nature of the films which it is proposed to show at chil- 
dren’s performances. The education committees of many cities have 
been aroused by the reports of increase in crime, the causes of which 
it is agreed are substantially those recognized in the circular cited 
above. The education committee of Bristol, by a unanimous vote, 
adopted the following resolution: 
That the Bristol education committee has had under consideration the effect 
which the frequent attendance of children at cinematograph exhibitions has 
upon the moral and physical health of such children. The members have had 
evidence before them of the injurious results which sometimes follow from such 
attendances, and they desire to urge upon the Government the necessity for 
careful investigation and further legislation; they also request that the chair- 
man bring the matter before the association of education committees. 
Commenting upon this action, the School Government Chronicle 
says: 
For the courage and initiative of the member who raised the problem of the 
cinema show with reference to the welfare of children at the last meeting of 
the Bristol education committee there will surely be a widespread movement of 
responsive gratitude. 
This journal urges “that this wonderful invention of the living 
picture should be taken vigorously in hand by agencies competent to 
put it to worthier uses than those to which it is largely turned as a 
subject of self-seeking business exploitation.” 
MILITARY OCCUPATION OF SCHOOLS. 
At the request of the army council, measures were taken by the 
board of education early in 1915 to provide for the occupation of 
schoolhouses for military purposes, and as a result of this action a 
total of 1,023 public elementary schools in England and Wales had 
been thus appropriated up to the end of August, 1915. The build- 
ings were required for hospital purposes, for the billeting of troops 
engaged in garrison duty, and in several areas for the accommodation
-P-A-G-E-587
    
ENGLAND. 559 
of the great influx of munition workers where the ordinary housing 
accommodation of the district proved insufficient for the purpose. 
In many cases prolonged occupation resulted, but in general inter- 
ruption of the schools was for short periods only, as appears from 
the fact that on the 31st of August, 1915, only 169 schools were in 
the possession of the military, of which number 92 were used as 
hospitals. Altogether the number of children displaced was 109,335, 
but. temporary provision was made for their accommodation with 
very few exceptions. The official report gives the following par- 
ticulars respecting the arrangements made in three large urban areas 
which were seriously affected by the changes: 
In the first of these areas the buildings of the whole or part of 13 public 
elementary schools were taken by the military, and children representing an 
average attendance of 11,200 (more than half the total average attendance of 
the borough) were displaced. For the children of a few of the occupied schools, 
other buildings, such as mission halls and Sunday schools, were secured, and it 
was possible to continue the education of these children full-time; but for the 
majority of the children other arrangements had to be made, and a “double 
shift” system was adopted. 
Under this system the children of School A (not occupied by the military) 
met for their morning session from 8.30 to 10.85 and for their afternoon session. 
from 12.50 to 2.55; while the children of School B (occupied by the military) 
met under their own teachers at School A from 10.40 to 12.45 and from 3 to 5.05. 
Thus the buildings of School A did double duty. 
In the second area the problem to be faced was of equal magnitude. Seven 
large schools, with an average attendance of 9,000 out of a total average at- 
tendance for the whole borough of 26,000, were taken for the use of troops. 
Substantially the same “ double-shift” system as that described above was 
adopted, except that the infants attended school once a day only for a session 
of three hours; this arrangement was made in order to avoid an unusually long 
walk four times a day for the young children. 
In the third area a half-time or single-shift system, with one meeting a day 
only, was adopted. This plan allows of each meeting being longer than the 
ordinary meeting of a school. In March, 1915, the military were occupying 
schools which usually accommodate about 17,000 children out of a total average 
attendance in the area of about 41,000. In the case of one only of these schools, 
with an average attendance of about 270, was it found impossible to make 
immediate arrangements for the teaching of the children. In some cases 
temporary premises were found; but in most of the schools arrangements were 
made whereby the children of one school met in the morning only and those of 
another school in the afternoon only. 
The half-time system has had some interesting results which are 
brought out in the official report. It is noted that in one area it has 
resulted in the organization of home work under the direction of the 
school-teachers, and in this way several schools have been more than 
compensated for the loss of the half day’s instruction. The system 
has also had the effect of concentrating the efforts of teachers and 
scholars on essential matters which give promise of some lasting 
 
-P-A-G-E-588
  
560. EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
improvements in the school programs. In many places the half 
day out of school has been used with good results for— 
games, physical exercises, swimming, open-air work, excursions, visits to 
museums and galleries, needlework parties, and the like. In a large town 
where both open-air expeditions and visits to galleries have been particularly 
well organized the inspector mentions that one head master in a school favor- 
ably situated is so convinced of the advantage of open-air work that he would 
not object to continuing the half-time plan when the war is over. The effect 
on the health of the children has also been good. A head mistress reports that 
her girls have noticeably improved in endurance in walking. The only com- 
plaints came from parents in poorer districts at the increased wear and tear 
of children’s boot and clothes and the trouble involved in looking after the 
younger children when kept at home on wet days. 
REFUGEE CHILDREN. 
The loss of school buildings and of teachers has been aggravated 
by the necessity of providing for Belgian refugee children, of whom 
not less than 30,000 have found asylum in England. The children 
have been taken into the schools without special difficulty, and in some 
cases the local authorities have issued circulars in, French and 
Flemish, notifying the Belgian parents to send their children to 
school. As a rule, preference is shown for schools of the Roman 
Catholic denomination, but in a few cases separate schools or de- 
partments have been provided for the refugees. Where only a few 
such children have been admitted to school, they have been taught 
together with the other children by an English teacher, but where 
there were enough to form a class by themselves. a Belgian teacher, 
herself a refugee, has often been employed. 
In the case of a few Belgian children in a large school, both teach- 
ers and pupils help in the instruction, as illustrated by the following 
incidents: 
At a certain school there was one Belgian boy at first. He was placed with 
a teacher who spoke French, and who taught him in that language. No definite 
attempt was made to teach him English, but when he began picking up words 
and phrases the other boys entered keenly into the task of teaching him all they 
could. In less than three months it was possible to teach him in English; in- 
deed, he became so proficient that he referred to the handicraft instructor as 
the “professor of carpentry.” A second Belgian boy was then admitted, who 
spoke only Flemish. The staff were helpless, and for a fortnight the Flemish 
boy merely looked at pictures in all the schoolbooks and helped to distribute 
and collect materials. But then there arrived another Belgian, who could speak 
both French and Flemish. The last comer must clearly be taught English at 
all speed, and then he can teach the little Fleming. The latter had enjoyed his 
picture books so much that he confided to his instructor that “ he did not want 
to learn English, for then he would have to work.” However, it-is satisfac- 
tory to know that all three could understand and use English before they were 
withdrawn from the school.

CALL FOR MEN, 
The first year of the war was marked by a depletion of the teach- 
ing staffs of schools and of both the teaching and student bodies of 
higher institutions, caused by the call of men for military and naval 
service. This depletion increases as the war continues. According 
to the report of the board of education issued in 1916, it was esti- 
mated that by October 15, 1915, not less than 20,000 teachers em- 
ployed by the local education authorities alone had joined the colors, 
5,000 full-time students in university institutions aided by the board, 
and 3,000 training-college students. The official staff of the board 
had lost 557 members from the same cause and, as a consequence of 
these losses, the whole education service was engaged in adapting its 
methods and arrangements to changing conditions 
While deploring the injury suffered by the service from these 
losses, the opinion was expressed by the board that the repute and 
status of the profession had been raised by its ready and cheerful re- 
sponse to the nation’s call; thus the cause of education itself had 
been strengthened. 
The withdrawal of men from the ordinary pursuits of life to serve 
in the army weakens all the restraining influences of society. This 
effect has been referred to in connection with the increase in the 
number of youthful offenders against the law. An evil scarcely less 
serious results from the loss of men most competent to serve the civic 
interests of the State, foster science, and’ direct enterprises requiring 
technical knowledge. This latter aspect of the matter is emphasized 
by a circular (952) issued by the board of education to the local edu- 
cation authorities in response to a very wide and insistent demand 
that measures be taken for preserving to their educational duties and 
interests certain classes of teachers, students, and officers. The cir- 
cular promises— 
sympathetic consideration, by the army council, of applications, if indorsed by 
the board of education, for postponement of the active service of a strictly 
limited number of research or postgraduate students of science or technology 
or undergraduates or full-time students and bona fide candidates for admis- 
sion, who are certified as likely to attain a high standard of merit equal to 
first or second class honors. 
This action is taken “on grounds of public interest” connected 
indirectly at least with the war services, or with the industrial reac- 
tions of the war. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. - 
In the preceding statements reference has been made almost ex- 
clusively to the effect of war upon the elementary schools, the schools 
in which 90 per cent of the children of the nation receive their entire 
 
-P-A-G-E-590
  
  562 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
education, and which are supported by public funds and under the 
control of public authorities. The disturbing conditions are felt 
equally in the secondary schools; indeed the internal work of this 
class of institutions has been more seriously affected by the war than 
that of the elementary schools. In the secondary schools exclusively 
for boys the reduction of the teaching force has been proportionately 
greater, which is natural since it consists almost entirely of men. 
The highest grade secondary schools have suffered also great loss 
of students on account of the large panes of the boys of military 
age who have joined the army. 
To some extent the places of the masters who have joined the army 
have been filled by women; more generally, however, the schools for 
boys are working with reduced staff; in the coeducation schools of 
this grade the proportion of women teachers has noticeably increased ; 
a few Belgian refugees of suitable qualifications have been appointed 
to fill the vacant posts. 
Secondary schools equipped with workshops have given great help 
in munitions work. For instance, during the summer vacation of 
1915 workshops in three of the municipal secondary schools of 
Leeds were in daily use by the staff and older pupils for the manu- 
facture of dummy cartridges to be used in the training of troops. 
Afterwards the work was continued by the boys of the various sec- 
ondary schools in the district, and reinforced by Saturday squads 
of teachers. Work on shells is also carried on by the same organiza- 
tion. This is not an isolated case. 
The usual routine of the schools has also been interrupted to give 
time for drilling cadet corps and junior officers’ training corps, 
which have been organized in practically all the secondary schools 
for boys, public and private. ; 
On account of the independent organization of the secondary 
schools of England, no exact estimate can be given at the present 
time of the extent or the varied forms in which the effects of war 
have been manifested. The number of secondary schools which are 
borne on the Government list and which were in military occupation 
in July, 1915, is reported as follows:

  ENGLAND. 563 
In all these cases emergency arrangements were made for con- 
tinuing the school work in temporary premises. 
Attention has already been called to the loss of students in higher 
institutions receiving Government grants. In this category are 
included the technical, art, and evening schools which have been the 
special subject of Government aid and direction. The proportion of 
men students in these institutions who have enlisted or have been 
called off by other services arising from the war is very great. At 
the same time the number of women students in many areas has 
increased, particularly those desiring instruction in subjects and in 
practical work relating to the war, such, for instance, as ambulance 
service. The technical schools have been called upon for large service 
in helping to meet the demand for munitions of war. Many of the 
technical schools are engaged in actual munitions work, including 
the testing of materials, the making of gauges, aeroplane parts, and 
other engineering details. On account, also, of the great demand for 
munition workers, experimental courses for training unskilled per- 
sons have been established in many of the technical schools, while 
others whose equipment was insuflicient for training classes have 
transferred their machines to munition works. 
On account of the rapidly increasing demand for assistance, the 
ministry of munitions arranged with the board of education of Eng- 
land, the Scotch education department, and the labor exchanges for 
a large extension of the provisions for training munition workers 
in technical schools and for close cooperation with munition firms 
and labor exchanges with a view to placing the trained workers in 
employment. A large proportion of the persons trained in these 
experimental classes were at once employed in factories. The report 
from South Wales states that all the students in the temporary 
classes— 
are women of good type (mostly ex-secondary school or university college), 
now chosen by the woman inspector of the labor exchange. They have no 
previous experience. * * * All students who prove satisfactory (and phys- 
ically able to stand the work) will be immediately absorbed in the factory 
to which the class is closely allied. 
The evening schools, included among the special agencies receiving 
grants from the Government, have been largely devoted to classes 
for men serving with the colors. It is noted that the instruction 
falls under one or the other of two types, the first consisting of in- 
struction in subjects which are likely to be of practical use to the 
soldiers, such as French, German, map reading, telegraphy, or field 
cooking ; the second including more recreative work, singing, popular 
lectures, etc. The most common subject of instruction in these 
classes has been French.

  564 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
AWAKENED INTEREST IN NATIONAL EDUCATION. 
The outstanding fact in the year’s record is the awakened con- 
sciousness of England in regard to national education and its relation 
to national industry. The first action of Government in this direc- 
tion was the creation July, 1915, of a new department of scientific 
and industrial research. This department was the outcome of the 
proposition for an advisory council on industrial research which was 
presented to the House of Commons by Mr. Pease just before his 
resignation from the presidency of the board of education. The 
measure was expanded in the House and, as finally adopted, provides 
for a committee of council that will be directly “responsible for the 
expenditure of any new moneys provided by Parliament for scien- 
tific and industrial research.” In carrying out this purpose the com- 
mittee will have the assistance of a small advisory committee. The 
titular head of the new department is the lord president of the 
council, but its active chief is the vice president, and this place is 
filled by the president of the board of education, who answers for 
the committee in the House of Commons. The other ministers asso- 
ciated with the chiefs in the constitution of the committee are the 
chancellor of the exchequer, the secretary for Scotland, the president 
of the board of trade, and the chief secretary for Ireland, though 
other ministers may at any time be added. Nonministerial members 
may also be added, in which capacity three well-known leaders, 
namely, Lord Haldane, Mr. Arthur Acland, at one time chief of the 
education department, and Mr. Pease, the recent chief, are already 
included. 
The most important distinction between the advisory council pro- 
posed by Mr. Pease and the committee of the privy council is tho 
fact that the province of the latter extends to the entire Empire. 
The official regulation sets forth that: 
It is clearly desirable that the scheme should operate over the Kingdom as 
a whole with as little regard as possible to the Tweed snd the Irish Channel. 
The research done should be for the Kingdom as a whole, and there should be 
complete liberty to utilize the most effective institutions and investigators 
available, irrespective of their location in England, Wales, Scotland, or Ire- 
jand, There must therefore be a single fund for the assistance of research, 
under a single responsible body. 
The small advisory council is responsible to the department or 
committee of council and is composed mainly of eminent scientific 
men and men actually engaged in industries dependent upon scien- 
tific research. For the immediate use of the committee an appro- 
priation of £30,000 was made. 
While these measures were developing, constant. pressure was 
exerted upon the Government for a reform of the educational sys-
-P-A-G-E-593
  
  ENGLAND. 565 
tem. The conviction spread that the work must be broadened, 
deepened, and unified, and while it was everywhere recognized that 
its main dependence must be the vigorous action of local authorities, 
nevertheless the demand was insistent that the Central Government 
should exercise larger power for insuring the cooperation of local 
authorities in respect to measures for increasing the educational 
provision of the country. In response to this irresistible demand 
several committees were formed and each assigned to a special field 
of investigation. The first of these committees, appointed to in- 
quire into the education of young persons after the war, has already 
been mentioned; the second committee was formed to inquire into 
the teaching of science, especially in universities and secondary 
schools, and the application of science to industry; to the third com- 
mittee was committed an inquiry on modern languages. The com- 
mittees pertain, it will be seen, to three conditions that have been 
thrust into prominence by the changed relations of internal and 
international affairs consequent upon the war. 
The new department at once made direct appeal to the universities 
and technical institutions, as well as to existing scientific and pro- 
fessional societies and institutions by which “research is or can be 
efficiently conducted.” This effort met with hearty response from all 
quarters, as illustrated by the action of the chemical society which, 
before the department was formed, had constituted itself “a con- 
sultative body which should meet at frequent intervals to consider, 
organize, and utilize for the benefit of the country all suggestions, 
inventions, and offers of assistance it might receive.” The president 
of this society addressed a circular letter to all members, urging them 
to every exertion in their power for making the scheme a success. 
Because of the national bearings of science and scientific teaching 
the special committee on this subject comprises in its membership— 
the names of scientific men in whom the country would have confidence; also 
names of some of those who appreciate the application of science to commerce 
and industry, and of course including those who are able from general 
experience to correlate scientific teaching with education as a whole. 
Among proofs that educational reform is imminent is the reference 
of the subject to the “prime minister’s reconstruction committee.” 
This committee will serve as an ultimate clearing house to which 
will be referred for final decision changes that may be advised by 
bodies of experts that have been formed in all departments of public 
affairs. The advice of these bodies, including the special committees 
on education, will thus be coordinated in the final plans of recon- 
struction. 
The new spirit evoked by the war is shown by the debate in the 
House of Lords on the training of the nation and the necessity of 
61355°—16——38
-P-A-G-E-594
    566 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
preparing for the future. The subject was proposed by Viscount 
Haldane, who, in the speech opening the first session devoted to the 
subject, pointed out certain marked defects in English education as 
contrasted with that of other countries. In this connection he said: 
It is sufficient for me to take the case of two neutral nations, one a small one, 
the other a very large one—Switzerland and America. Switzerland puts us to 
shame in respect of her national system of education and in the training which 
she gives to the mind of the young, particularly of those who are engaged in 
the great industries, and there is a keenness and an activity at this moment 
everywhere present in the United States which shows the sort of rivalry we 
shall have to meet if we are to preserve our great industrial and commercial 
position. Our problem, therefore, is to make education, which is a tiresome 
word to most people in this country, interesting by showing its concrete nature 
and by showing what it means, not only theoretically but practically. It means 
not mere examinations, not the mere putting of science into the test to which 
people who are aspiring as candidates for office are subjected. It means some- 
thing far more than that. It means the training of the mind in the widest and 
most comprehensive sense, so that the youth of the country may be able when 
the time comes to turn, it may be to science, it may be to the humanities, it 
may be to any of the thousand and one subjects which are covered by the field 
of knowledge in this twentieth century. 
Lord Haldane noted as.an “ appalling reflection” that in England 
90 per cent of the young persons—that is, 9 out of 10—get no further 
education after the age of 14. 
Our greatest mistake in this country has been in concentrating upon the 
education and training of the well-to-do. We do not recognize that a bifurca- 
tion takes place about the age of 13. At that time compulsory elementary 
education ceases, and for the child of the workman what provision is there 
unless he has a very exceptional and keen father? Why, none whatever. 
Whereas it is the custom and invariable practice among the middle and upper 
classes to send their sons and daughters to schools where they will get further 
training, in the case of the working classes there is no such provision, with the 
result, as I say, that 90 per cent of our population have not that education 
which is required if we are to make the best use of our available talent. 
This neglect was contrasted with “the system which has been set 
up in Germany especially for the purpose of providing the army of 
trained workmen who may overcome usin the neutral markets which 
we have dominated to so large an extent in the past.” 
At the close of his speech Lord Haldane NS warned his 
hearers that: 
The old order is passing away, and we are face to face with a new order. 
Our old methods will not avail us any longer. That is why one hopes that the 
Government will take the lead in preparing the nation for the struggle which 
lies before us as soon as this war is over—a struggle not less deadly and not 
less terrible, because, as I have said, it will not be obvious and it will be slow. 
The debate thus opened by a critical but stimulating address was 
continued during two subsequent sessions by men of commanding 
influence in English affairs who dwelt particularly upon the evidences
-P-A-G-E-595
_ ENGLAND. 567 
of efficiency in English education, although acknowledging that the 
system does not provide adequately for the great body of young peo- 
ple between the ages of 13 and 18. At the same time it was urged that 
great development has taken place even in this respect during the 
past decade. This more favorable aspect was emphasized by Mr. 
Bryce, whose intimate familiarity with all the conditions gives great 
weight to his words. Mr. Bryce declared that the greatest obstacle 
to be overcome is the mental attitude of the business men of England 
and the indifference to education on the part both of boys and their 
parents. In regard to the former he said: 
I am quite sure, from the observations I have been able to make of the 
heads of the business community, that the fault lies very largely with them. 
The truth is that our business men have not, like the business men of America 
and of Germany, yet come to believe in science; they do not know what sery- 
ices science can render; they do not understand that a scientific discovery 
may have the most important effect on their business in enabling them to in- 
crease their output and their profits and far more than repay any sum that 
they might spend in getting the best scientific opinion to help and direct them. 
The Americans and the Germans have learned that, and both practice it with 
extraordinary success; but our people have not learned it yet. I am glad to 
say that there are signs of improvement. I believe that the advisory com- 
mittee which has now been formed by the Government, and on which they 
have some very eminent scientific men, is already beginning to find that the 
large employers of labor, the heads of large industrial concerns, are respond- 
ing and beginning to understand how much they can learn by endeavoring to 
obtain scientific guidance in their work. * * * 
I believe there are only two ways in which we can deal with the problem; 
at least I can not think of any others. One is to make the employer of labor 
realize how much it is to his interest to get the most intelligent, most educated, 
as well as the most active boy; and to make the teaching so much better and so 
much more stimulating that it will awaken those intellectual faculties in the 
boy which are so often at present deficient. 
In concluding the debate, Lord Haldane expressed gratification 
that as regards the wide meaning of education there had been gen- 
eral agreement and that the debate had been “of use in bringing to 
the mind of the public subjects in which the Government are de- 
sirous they should be interested, and with which the Government 
themselves wish to deal in a practical fashion.” 
THE OUTLOOK. 
In this widespread agitation’ one question rises above all others. 
Will the nation bear the cost of the reforms demanded? The im- 
portance of this question gives special interest to the budget estimates 
for the coming year as presented by the president of the board of 
education. It is noticeable that while fully recognizing the enor- 
mous burdens already resting upon the nation, Mr. Henderson took 
a hopeful view of the financial outlook for education. The esti- 
mated expenditure of the board of education, which he submitted,  
-P-A-G-E-596
  568 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
amounts for the year 1916-17 to £15,186,732 ($73,807,517.52). This 
is a decrease of nearly £300,000 below the amount of last year’s esti- 
mates, but it is not less than the actual expenditure for the past year 
and exceeds the expenditure for several successive years as appears 
from the following statement: 
  
      1911-12 -- £14, 302, 859 
1912-13 14, 332, 018 
1913-14 14, 368, 794 
1914-15 15, 096, 285 
1915-16 _ 15, 174, 300 
folonli(s (estimate) =- 2k. Se eee 15, 186, 732 
Mr. Henderson noted that: 
The first year of the war, 1914-15, saw our expenditure on education greater 
than in the previous year. In the second year of the war this level was main- 
tained, and in the third, as the figures show, we expect to do likewise. 
Of the total amount required for 1916-17, the greater part, 
£12,640,528 ($61,432,966.08) would be credited to elementary educa- 
tion. But the appropriation to the central board provides less than 
one-half the total cost of the elementary schools, the remainder being 
met from local sources. Hence for the elementary education alone at 
least $125,000,000 would be required to maintain the work at its pres- 
ent level. An addition of $15,000,000 would be needed to carry out 
reforms that were planned before the conflict. Already this estimate 
has’ been increased by the recommendations of special committees 
that have been appointed to work out plans for the proposed recon- 
struction of the system of education. Thus the interim committee 
on scholarships recommends the increase of existing scholarship 
funds, national and local, by at least one and two-thirds million dol- 
lars. Although a single item in the large plans for reform, it is im- 
portant, since in the English system of education scholarships afford 
the only means of opening up the province of higher education to 
students of limited resources. 
The unanimous opinion as to the needed reforms is remarkable, 
but the vital factor in their accomplishment is money. As expressed 
by Mr. Henderson in his budget address, “ What is wanted is money, 
and more money.” It is confidently predicted that this demand will 
be met. In a pointed review of the situation the Times declares: 
If the year passes without the publication of a clear-cut scheme of reform, a 
storm of indignation will arise through the country. * * * The Government 
has to deal not only with a stubborn, but with a very powerful reform party, 
which is determined to release the nation from its educational disabili- 
ties. * * * We shall see leading local education authorities on their own 
initiative, under the ample powers contained in the education act of 1902, putting 
these schemes of practical reform into operation. These education authorities 
have great power. By a few strokes of the pen they can * * *_ substi- 
tute for the present system such a new grading as will carry school life out

of the upas shadow of the act of 1870. They can do more than this; they can 
so organize opinion among the great manufacturers as to make continuation 
schools an integral part of every factory and every workshop. A great yol- 
untary movement of this type is at hand. ‘The manufacturers of England have 
learned at last that intelligent service will be the only service which will 
serve their purpose in the great days that lie beyond the war. P 
The change in the executive head of the board of education when 
the coalition government was formed was a significant event growing 
directly out of the war. The post was given to Hon. Arthur Hender- 
son, the recognized leader of the labor party in England and for 
some time its representative in Parliament; hence his appointment as 
chief officer of education, his firm stand for reform measures, and his 
confident call for liberal appropriations, were taken as a pledge of 
the purposes of the Government on the one side and of the support of 
his party for those purposes on the other. This view is strengthened 
by the passage of the fee grant bill August 2, which extends the 
upper age limit for the payment of the ‘grant above 15 years of age, 
a measure distinctly in the interests of the children of the laboring 
masses. 
Mr. Henderson’s resignation as minister of education, as soon as 
the new policies were clearly defined, had been anticipated, since the 
interests of labor demanded all his energies in this crisis. His suc- 
cessor is the Marquis of Crewe, whose identification with the cause of 
scientific and technical education gives assurance that this interest 
will be supreme in the: measures upon which the Government is 
already engaged, and in which, to quote an expressive utterance, 
“commerce, industry, and education have ranged themselves with 
science to fight inactivity and inefficiency.” 
SCOTLAND. 
The effects of the war upon the schools of Scotland have been simi- 
lar to those in England, but on a smaller scale, except as regards the 
loss of men teachers, which has been proportionally as great. Dur- 
ing the first months of the war the work on school buildings pro- 
ceeded as usual, but in March, 1915, a circular was issued by the 
Government, stating that on account of the need of labor and capital 
for use in the directions in which they should best further the na- 
tional interests, it would be necessary to avoid undertaking any new 
building operations except those of pressing necessity either for 
reasons of public health or on account of war requirements. Soon 
after, the education department was notified that the approval of 
the treasury in respect to proposals for loans for building purposes 
would be strictly restricted to cases of extreme necessity. 
Regarding the exemption of children of school age on account of 
the scarcity of labor, the education department expressed the opin-  
-P-A-G-E-598
    
570 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
ion that the school boards might be trusted to deal wisely and care- 
fully with the problem. On account of the strong public opinion in 
Scotland in support of extended education for the young, little 
apprehension was felt that the temporary interruptions would result 
in any lasting evils. 
Those special features of the Scottish system, by means of which 
it gave promise of solving pressing problems pertaining to the con- 
tinued education of the masses of children, have been seriously affected 
by the war. The attendance upon the continuation classes has no- 
ticeably declined, and the training centers established to increase 
the provision of teachers have suffered from the interruption of 
building schemes, and more seriously from the almost entire disap- 
pearance of the male students. The medical inspection of schools 
and medical treatment for needy children have also received a check 
by the depletion of the medical staffs. The loss of men teachers 
affects the secondary schools even more than the elementary. At 
the same time the usual routine of schools of this order has been 
interrupted to give time for drilling cadet corps, and in various ways, 
especially by the use of the laboratories and workshops, promoting 
the military interests. The devotion of the teachers to the national 
cause is indicated by their large contribution to the fund for war 
relief, amounting in August, 1916, to nearly $180,000. 
It will be recalled that the committees appointed by the Govern- 
ment to consider the question of educational reform included Scot- 
land in their investigations, but there is a strong feeling that Scottish 
education should have a special and separate committee. This course 
is urged on account of the distinctions between the Scotch and Eng- 
lish systems and the consequent problems peculiar to Scotland which 
are in danger of being overlooked in the preliminary investigation 
and final recommendations of the several committees. Satisfaction 
is expressed that the chairman of the advisory council on science 
and industry represents Scotland. The choice for this post fell upon 
Sir William McCormick, secretary of the Carnegie Trust for the 
universities of Scotland. By reason of his relation to the universi- 
ties, he will be able to give effect to the recommendations of this 
council that relate particularly to the northern division of the King- 
dom. The first report of this body, which has just been issued, 
recommends the cooperation of all the agencies engaged in technical 
and scientific education and in industries that depend upon trained 
workers. This recommendation accords with efforts that have been 
made in Scotland to bring about such coordinations. 
THE UNIVERSITIES OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 
The report of the universities of Great Britain and Ireland for the 
past two years is chiefly a record of losses. The majority of the men

students and a large proportion of the professors of the British uni- 
versities are with the forces or engaged in other branches of the 
war service, and the financial resources have been proportionately 
diminished. It was estimated in October, 1915, that 5,000 full-time 
students in university institutions aided by the board of education 
had joined the army. Since that time the number has greatly 
increased. The loss has been partly made up by women students, 
who in larger numbers than ever are seeking university opportunities, 
The report for Cambridge and Oxford, which are not included in 
the former estimate, shows that at least 80 per cent of the under- 
graduates had joined the army ; the remainder consists almost entirely 
of students from India and the Orient and those physically unfit- 
for service. Oxford University started its second year of the war 
with between 500 and 600 undergraduates, of whom 250 were fresh- 
men. Of the entire number, about 150 were members of the officers’ 
training corps. Most of these, being too young to take a commission 
immediately, are combining military training and academic study for 
a term before they apply for a commission. 
As regards instruction, it was reported that in many of the schools 
there were not enough tutors to do the little work that remained. 
One Cambridge college which had 114 residents in 1913 had in 
all 9 in March, 1916. Trinity, the largest college in any English 
university, fell from 748 to 71. An advanced class in science at Cam- 
bridge, in charge of a well-known professor, fell from about 20 in 
1913 to 8—a girl, a Chinaman, and a Hindoo—in 1915, and 1 only of 
the 3 remained in 1916. The chief men students that are physically . 
fit for the war comprise at Oxford the Rhodes scholars and at Cam- 
bridge a number of senior men in the great medical school who are 
rapidly getting ready for the service. Over 11,000 Cambridge men 
in all were serving in the forces in 1916. Everything has been done 
by Cambridge University to prevent those who have entered the 
service from losing all benefits from their university relations. 
The measures for this purpose include as many as four terms 
for absence, counting the time spent in active service as the equiva- 
lent of the special examination in military subjects. Through these 
concessions more than 100 degrees were conferred by proxy on men 
at the front in the early part of 1916. Besides the students, dons 
and tutors of the university have offered their services freely in the 
war or in some form of Government work, and, owing to the financial 
losses of the university, many dons have for the time accepted posi- 
tions as schoolmasters. 
The celebrated scientific school at Cambridge has been placed at the 
service of the Government, and notable instances are reported of 
valuable results of researches that have been carried on in this insti-

tution which have served to relieve the horrors of war. Among these 
are means of relieving the effects of the poisonous gases, supply of 
four-fifths of one of the most vital munitions of war, to say nothing 
of several inventions which are of use to the wounded. Cambridge 
and Oxford have both maintained great hospitals for wounded sol- 
diers, and have also welcomed academic students and professors exiled 
from Belgium. 
From the annual report of University College, University of 
London, it appears that the revenue from fees declined in the ses- 
sion 1914-15 by £24,000, as compared with the receipts for the pre- 
vious session. The number of students fell from 2,206 to 1,416, the 
-latter including 123 refugee students. It has been found necessary 
to encourage cooperation between the London colleges affiliated to 
the university on account of the depletion of staffs and classes. 
The reports from the Scotch universities are similar in character. 
Edinburgh lost 55 per cent of men students in the second year of 
the war, and the losses continue. As in England, the number of 
women students increases, and there is a record attendance at the 
Women’s Medical School. i 
Out of 1,800 members of the officers’ training corps, Glasgow Uni- 
versity, 1,121 have received commissions and 160 have enlisted as 
privates. The two smaller universities, St. Andrews and Aberdeen, 
show equal reductions in the student body. 
The activity of the universities of Ireland in the national cause is 
illustrated by the following statements: 
The senate of Dublin University met September 24, 1915, to confer 
degrees on candidates who had passed the special final examinations 
held for those volunteering for active service with the royal army. 
In an address delivered on that occasion the vice chancellor, Mr. 
Justice Madden, said: ; 
The Trinity Medical School has sent 650 men, past and present students, to 
the navy, the R. A. M. ©., the military hospitals, and the fighting units. Of 
these, 24 have fallen, 26 have been wounded, and 10 taken prisoners; 28 have 
been mentioned in dispatches, 5 have received the Military Cross, 3 the Com- 
panionship of the Bath, 3 the Distinguished Service Order, 2 the Order of St. 
Michael and St. George, and 1 the Cross of the Legion of Honor. 
The vice chancellor also dwelt at some length on the researches 
of Sir Almroth Wright, a former student and a graduate of Trinity - 
College, Dublin, and referred further to the work done by the women 
students’ voluntary aid detachment, who have received 61 wounded 
soldiers in their hospital up to the present. The total number of 
Trinity College men who have joined the colors since the outbreak 
of the war is 970, of whom 74 have fallen. 
Belfast University, up to May, 1915, had issued two lists, of which 
the first alone contained over 200 names of men commissioned in the

army, in addition to a large numler of medical graduates attached 
to hospitals at home. The university has also held schools for offi- . 
cers conducted, as in Trinity College, by the staff of the officers’ 
training corps, which is largely drawn from the teaching staff of the 
university. The National University does not possess, in any of its 
three constituents, University College, Dublin, Cork, or Galway, an 
officers’ training corps. Nevertheless, Cork alone has recorded above 
200 past or present students now serving in the army. The Royal 
College of Surgeons in Dublin has a large contingent with the forces. 
DEGREE IN EDUCATION. 
Among many indications of the increased importance that educa- 
tion has:assumed in the scheme of national affairs should be men- 
tioned the final sanction given by the King to the ordinance for the 
degree of bachelor of education to be conferred by Edinburgh Uni- 
versity. The ordinance had already been approved by the university 
authorities and therefore came into force at the beginning of the 
academic year 1916-17. 
Following this action on the part of Edinburgh University is the 
announcement of the adoption of a report of a committee of the 
Aberdeen University council on the proposal to give a degree or 
honors in education. 
At a meeting of the Glasgow University general council, held in 
November, 1915, measures were considered for creating a professional 
degree on the lines of the B. Educ. (Edinburgh). 
FRANCE. 
SERVICES OF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. 
The educational system of France, the université, which in normal 
times is impressive by its complete organization and apparent de- 
tachment from ordinary affairs, has become instinct with the na- 
tional spirit in the present crisis. This change is reflected in the 
Bulletin Administratif, the official organ of the system, which before 
the war was a mere repository of orders, decrees, results of exami- 
nations, etc., but which has become a transcript of living inter- 
ests. Each issue of the bulletin opens with the “ Livre d’Or de ?’'Uni- 
versité,” comprising the names of the teacher-soldiers killed or 
wounded, followed in every case by a citation from the honor roll of 
the army, the record of high courage and heroic sacrifice. 
The devotion of teachers who remained at their tasks or responded 
to the call for substitutes is not overlooked; the official announce- 
ments pledge the Government to substantial recognition of these in- 
valuable services, and the sincerity of these promises is proved by  
-P-A-G-E-602
  574 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
practical measures. For example, a decree of February 15 confers 
new dignity upon the service of primary education by opening up the 
office of academic inspector to the head teachers of normal schools and 
to primary inspectors: Formerly the position referred to was filled 
from the corps of secondary teachers, but since primary inspectors 
are chosen from the primary teaching force, the new order brings 
the office within the reach of ordinary teachers. It also increases the 
bonds between primary and secondary education. 
The requirements for the office of academic inspector have always 
been high as regards both scholarship and professional fitness. The 
new decree maintains this high standard. It provides that a candi- 
date from primary education, aspiring to the office of inspector, must 
have the certificate (license) that would enable him to teach in a 
secondary school. A candidate who belongs to higher or secondary 
education must familiarize himself during a probationary period 
with the business of primary education. If he belongs to the latter 
department, he must become familiar with the affairs of secondary 
education by visiting the lycées and colleges. In order to secure 
full appointment from the minister, the candidate must obtain a 
certificate of aptitude from his superiors who report upon his work 
during his probationary term. 
From a summary of conditions in October, 1915, as reported by 
the minister of public instruction, it appears that up to that time 
30,000 teachers had been enrolled in the active fighting forces of 
France. Of this number 2,057 had fallen on the field of battle; 
nearly 8,000 had been wounded or taken prisoners; 700 had been 
mentioned in dispatches; 45 had been decorated with the Legion 
of Honor, 52 with the Medaille Militaire, 9 with the Order of St. 
George. 
In the invaded districts teachers remained at their posts to safe- 
guard the civil population in the absence of all other civil authori- 
ties. In the country districts the schoolhouses became the rallying 
centers; the school-teacher in every district received the official com- 
munications, and often copied them in his own handwriting to be 
distributed, or read them aloud to the assembled villagers. He read 
and wrote the letters for illiterates, and, in general, became the 
medium of communication between the district, the Government, and 
the army. 
Under the direction of the school-teachers, during the first winter 
of the war, over 500,000 woolen mufilers, pairs of socks, mittens, etc., 
were made and forwarded to the troops in the field. Many school- 
houses were turned into “ garderies” (playrooms) where the smaller 
children of the community were kept while their mothers and elder

sisters were at work in the field or factory. The children, whose 
ages ranged from 10 months to 6 years, were cared for from early 
morning until nightfall, fed, and often provided with clothing col- 
lected by the teachers. This work received no subvention’ from the 
State, but was supported entirely by funds collected by teachers. They 
instituted the “Noel du soldat,” to provide Christmas presents for 
the troops in the field, each child giving a penny, which netted over 
$100,000, while the teachers themselves, all over France, agreed to 
give at least 2 per cent of their monthly salary for Red Cross and 
similar purposes, and their contributions provided a monthly reve- 
nue of another $100,000. 
In schools upon the very line of battle the teachers, it is said, 
“carry on their classes stoically and pass in companies over the 
ruined roads to the pedagogical conferences.” At Rheims, in the - 
midst of the bombardment, schools were installed in the cellars of 
country houses under the charge of the primary inspector, seconded 
by the mayor of the town. Out of 715 pupils, 498 were instructed 
in these subterranean schools, as they were called. The course of 
study was successfully maintained, and 28 pupils, of whom 15 were 
boys, passed the examination for the leaving certificate. The greater 
part of the schoolmasters having entered the service, all these 
efforts fell upon the women teachers. In this invaded district four 
times every day they risked their lives in the streets where few 
houses remained to offer shelter in the moment of danger. They 
bravely faced extreme peril in order to reach the post of duty and 
of their devotions—the subterranean school. When the session was 
finished the instructresses voluntarily combined at Rheims to work 
for the soldiers. 
By this ingenious expedient, due to the determination of the in- 
spector and mayor, hundreds of children were kept off the streets 
and opportunity given them to continue their simple studies. This 
was a great service also for the sorely tried families. Fourteen 
women and four men maintained this brave service of the subter- 
ranean schools. 
At the beginning of the current year the primary schools were 
returning gradually to their normal state, taking possession of build- 
ings temporarily required for the war, and resuming the usual ex- 
ercises. In the immediate zone of conflict, in the neighborhood of 
the trenches where the troops are continually passing and the ad- 
ministrative services of the Red Cross and the military staff re- 
quire only temporary occupation of the school buildings, the country 
children are, as a rule, quickly brought back to the schools with as 
little interruption of the regular work as possible.

SAFEGUARDING THE CHILDREN. 
‘At the final session of the educational conference of the allies held 
during the current year the minister of public instruction dwelt 
upon the unusual burdens that have fallen upon the teachers of 
France. This is an experience common to all the warring nations, 
but intensified in France by the larger body of refugee children to 
be cared for. Thousands of children from Serbia and from Belgium 
have found their place in the schools, and although welcome, they 
greatly complicate the social difficulties that have to be met. 
In this same address the minister gave pointed expression to 
purposes which demand immediate action. Chief of these are care 
for the welfare of children and the large extension of school pro- 
vision for the masses. He urged a continuance of all the efforts in 
behalf of children, the mutual aid societies managed by pupils them- 
selves, the antialcoholic leagues, and the establishment of dispen- 
saries and vacation colonies for the elimination of tuberculosis. 
These and similar works, he declared, have become an imperative 
duty for the salvation of the nation. Above all the care of children 
orphaned by the war is a sacred duty to which the schools are 
pledged. These children are accepted as the wards of the nation, 
and the Government will cooperate in every undertaking for their 
support and education. 
In France, as in England, protests have been raised against the 
withdrawal of children from school to take the place, in fields and 
shops, of men called to the army. In a public appeal against this 
action Prof. Petit, long identified with the movement for adult edu- 
cation, insists that every effort should be made to supply the neces- 
sary labor from other sources, the aged and those incapable of bear-
-P-A-G-E-605
  FRANCE. BqT 
ing arms, and where this fails that a system of half-time schools be 
adopted and the school programs strictly adjusted to the arrange- 
ment. 
DEMAND FOR CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The realization of hopes for the future depends not only upon 
safeguarding the young, but also upon the increase of their training 
and opportunities. The minister reminded his hearers that obliga- 
tory primary education was an outcome of the war of 1870. In like 
manner it is necessary that obligatory continued education (enseigne- 
ment postscolaire) should follow the present conflict. Of all propo- 
sitions now entertained, this was declared to be “the most important 
and the most difficult.” It can not be accomplished by the Govern- 
ment alone, in a nation like France, where individualism and local 
authority are encouraged. The minister expressed confidence, how- 
ever, that just as after the disaster of 1870 obligatory primary in- 
struction was universally demanded, so at the present time the 
Government will command an immense majority in favor of extend- 
ing this obligation to include higher primary and continuation 
schools. 
The purposes emphasized by the minister have already commanded 
wide and varied support from citizens and organizations. In par- 
ticular the fight on alcoholism is vigorously waged. In this cause 
a society has been organized under the leadership of eminent men 
which at the initial meeting adopted the following resolution: 
This conference calls upon the public authorities to suppress immediately 
and entirely the privileges granted to distillers of spirits and to apply strictly 
all laws and decrees relative to alcoholism. To this end the conference, with- 
out entering into details as to the financial projects under consideration by the 
minister of finances, demands that the legislative decisions respecting the 
privileges granted to distillers of spirits should be included among the financial 
provisions. 
On every side the demand is heard that the provision of higher 
primary schools, which the law leaves to the action of local authori- 
ties, should be made obligatory. The higher primary schools that 
exist are models, but even in Paris their number is far below the 
requirements. During the year the teachers’ association of the Seine 
Department called upon the civil authorities to take vigorous action 
in this matter. Their resolution on this subject is as follows: 
Whereas considering the importance of the number of social values alone 
destroyed by the war which covers Europe with blood, it is indispensable to 
.prepare for the future by providing that the best part of our school children 
shall continue their studies in order that they may be prepared for the work 
of social reconstruction ; 
Whereas the students accepted at different entrance examinations, especially 
those for admission to the higher primary schools and vocational schools of 
the city of Paris, are the most promising of our young people;
-P-A-G-E-606
  578 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
Whereas fearing to displease the voters, certain municipalities of suburban 
districts of Paris have refused to pass appropriations to meet the cost of the 
instruction of pupils accepted into these schools ; 
The association of public teachers of the Seine demands: 
That the honorable preféct of the Seine recommend to the mayors to invite 
their municipal councils to reconsider their resolutions ; 
That, in case of refusal, the general council adopt the financial measures 
that are necessary ; 
That, moreover, the general council study in the future the question of 
higher elementary schools and solve it in a manner that best corresponds to 
the interests of the children as well as those of the department. 
The work of popular education long maintained under the direct- 
tion of M. Edouard Petit has continued, although with declining 
numbers and decided changes in the subjects of the lessons and 
lectures given for the benefit of adults. The report of the work for 
1918-14 showed a total of 54,351 courses of instruction, of which 
9,200 were in the Departments of France at present invaded, leaving 
45,151 for the remaining Departments. The latter declined by 26 
per cent in 1914-15; the subjects of the lessons were suggested chiefly 
by the war. They comprise the history and geography of the belli- 
gerent countries, the systematic study of bulletins, war maps, etc. 
The popular lectures, which reached a total of 125,000 a few years 
ago, numbered only 58,654 in 1918-14, and since then have been 
almost entirely replaced by what are termed “popular evenings.” 
On these occasions letters from the front are read or the poems 
of Victor Hugo, Deroulede, and Coppee recited. : 
The mutualites scolaires (mutual aid societies), fostered by the 
societies for popular education, numbered 871,000 members in 1913-14. 
For the following year there were reported 683,400 in the Depart- 
ments not invaded. In brief, while the work of all agencies com- 
plementary to the State schools has been seriously affected by the 
war, they have continued their operations and promise to play an 
important part in the ultimate work of social readjustment. 
RATIONAL USE OF THE CINEMATOGRAPH. 
A ministerial circular issued during the year calls attention to the 
need of “ vivifying instruction at all stages and of utilizing for this 
purpose the new resources that science has supplied.” Reference is 
made to the cinematograph, which “satisfies the natural delight of 
the young in images and places the object before the eye, while the 
idea is presented to the mind, excites mental action, and extends the. 
bounds of experience.” The value of this agent is proved by its 
effects in the popular illustrated lectures and courses of instruction 
and by its introduction into many primary schools at the expense of 
the teachers themselves. In view of this opinion and experience a
-P-A-G-E-607
  
FRANCE. 579 
commission extra parlementaire has been appointed to consider and 
report as to the means of employing the cinematograph in the differ- 
ent branches of instruction. The commission includes the minister 
of public instruction, M. Paul Painlevé, as president, Senator M. T. 
Steeg as vice president, and 40 additional members, all men of dis- 
tinction in public affairs, in education, or in science. 
UNIFYING INFLUENCE. 
The sense of unity between the different orders of education is 
increased by the participation of all in the relief services necessi- 
tated by the war. It was expressed in the address delivered by the 
minister of public instruction on the occasion of a“ gala” perform- 
ance given on the 4th of March at the Comédie Francaise for the 
benefit of the wounded in the hospital at the Ecole Normale Supé- 
rieure. At the beginning of August, 1914, the halls of this noted 
school were empty; its students were at the front. There remained 
of this great body only the young women and professors too old to 
enter the army, but everyone desired to bear a part in the struggle. 
They sought advice from the Society of the Women of France (Union 
des Femmes de France), and in accordance therewith the halls of 
the school became a model hospital, comprising the necessary mate- 
rial, a trained personnel, automobiles, and all the details of a com- 
plete organization. As the number of the wounded increased and 
the work expanded, larger contributions were made, and to the pres- 
ent time this hospital in the normal school has maintained 150 beds 
without recourse to the Red Cross Society. 
In concluding his eulogy of this effort the minister said: 
‘What has been done in Paris at the normal school has taken place throughout 
France in the lycées, colleges, and schools. Everywhere the lively collaboration 
of the Union des Femmes de France and the teaching corps has accomplished 
miracles. The task was enormous; the effort has been equal to the task, 
What eulogy could surpass that? The tribute that we pay to-day to the work 
of the Ecole Normale Supérieure extends to hundreds of similar works of 
which this is the impressive symbol. As minister of public instruction I am 
proud to associate in this expression of national recognition the noble union of 
the women of France and the entire universitié. 
THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The statistical survey of education in foreign countries, chapter 
87, includes a section on secondary schools which shows their status 
on the eve of the outbreak of the war. By reference to Table 2 it 
will be seen that the statistics there given for French secondary 
schools pertain to the year 1913. At that time the lycées for boys 
had 62,879 pupils, and the communal colleges 37,324. According to 
statistics since obtained by the ministry of public instruction, on
-P-A-G-E-608
    
580 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
October 15, 1914, the pupils in the lycées had fallen to 41,631, and in 
the colleges to 20,498. This was a total loss of above 35,000 students. 
The statistics for October 15, 1915, show a decided improvement over 
the conditions in 1914. The students in the lycées for boys had risen 
to 50,316 and in the colleges to 23,902, which was an increase of 12,000 
above the number reported the previous year. : 
In the secondary schools for girls there were 21,901 students in 
October, 1914, as against 29,693 the following year. 
Presumably these statistics are not complete for the Departments 
invaded, although from occasional reports it appears that the schools 
of all grades, secondary as well as primary, in these areas are 
endeavoring to maintain their work. 
Practically all the male teachers in the secondary schools capable 
of bearing arms have joined the forces. Their places meanwhile 
are supplied in various ways. Retired professors are called back; 
the few university students who remain assist in some measure in 
the secondary classes; and the women professors of the girls’ lycées 
have been called in considerable numbers to take classes in the boys’ 
schools. é 
The secondary schools have been particularly affected by the efforts 
to reconcile military demands with the interests of the service of 
public instruction. One article of the law of August 17, 1915 (law 
Dalbiez), authorized men not subject to military obligation to enter 
the military service for the period of the war with assignment to 
special duties. The men who take advantage of this opportunity, 
if they do not receive military compensation, are promised their full 
salaries as civil officers during the time of the engagement. A cer- 
tain proportion of the teaching fraternity have responded to this 
offer on account of particular aptitudes, and as a consequence the 
service of public instruction, which has already been greatly depleted 
by the ordinary process of recruiting, is in danger of losing its entire 
force of men; hence new regulations are required in order to reconcile 
the demand for these special services with the equally pressing needs 
of public instruction. Secondary schools are particularly affected 
by the special call, which is chiefly for professors of the living lan- 
gauges to act as interpreters in the war zone and in the camps of 
prisoners and the depots of supplies. 
THE UNIVERSITIES, 
The universities of France are State institutions, and, therefore, 
are all equally affected by the war. Their condition was expressed 
in a few brief sentences by M. Liard in an address before the Musée 
sociale. University incomes, he explained, are derived from three 
sources: Student fees, State appropriations, and private benefac-
-P-A-G-E-609
  FRANCE. 581 
tions. The fees supply thousands of francs annually to the univer- 
sity treasuries, but since all the students of military age have gone 
to the front, this source of income has largely failed. At the same 
time private benefactions will be lessened because of the demand 
made upon the wealthy for the relief of miseries caused by the war. 
The State appropriations, which have furnished the greater part 
of the incomes, are also threatened by reason of the enormous 
expenditure incurred by the struggle. 
Notwithstanding these disasters, M. Liard looks hopefully toward 
the future in the belief that new demands will arise for university 
services and that France will also draw larger contingents of foreign 
students. 
The losses suffered by other higher institutions are illustrated 
by the following examples: The Ecole des Hautes Etudes enrolled 
in 1918-14 a total of 473 students, of whom 187 were foreigners; 
in 1914-15 the enrollment was 202, including 57 foreigners; for the 
present year the enrollment has been about 100, the foreign repre- 
sentation remaining about the same as the previous year. 
At the opening of the Catholic Institute of Paris for the fall 
term 1915, it was recalled by the rector that the session for the pre- 
vious year had been opened with much hesitation. At that time 20 
professors belonging to the institute were in the army and another, 
an Alsatian, was a prisoner in Germany. The librarian and three 
of his assistants and the assistant of two scientific professors were 
mobilized and for a moment it seemed as if it would be impossible 
to reorganize the work. It was accomplished, however, the officers 
and teachers willingly doubled and even tripled their ordinary work, 
although their salaries were decreased by reason of the diminished 
resources of the institution. Moreover, a large proportion of stu- 
dents of the classes of 1915 and 1916 had been called to arms. Not- 
withstanding these conditions, however, the classes were organized, 
and at the close of the year the results of the examinations proved 
that excellent work had been accomplished. The number of diplo- 
mas conferred was as follows: In the faculty of theology, 32; in 
the faculty of law, 2 doctorates, 86 licentiates; in the faculty of 
letters, 16 licentiates and 2 higher diplomas; in the school of science, 
11 certificates. The opening ceremonies of 1915 were marked by 
memorial services for 112 students and graduates of the institute 
who had fallen in battle. Among those who have been highly honored 
for their bravery were comprised 13 who had received the Legion 
of Honor; 6, military medals; 52, the Order of the Army, including 
two bishops who had been both students and supervisors of the 
institute.

NEW DEMANDS. 
The conviction that the universities of France must bear a large 
part in the endeavor to restore prosperity to the nation led to the 
introduction of a bill in the senate during the current session, pro- 
viding for the creation of faculties of applied sciences in the uni- 
versities. The author of this bill, Dr. Goy, explained its purposes as 
follow: 
The necessity which has been imposed upon us, during the actual course of 
the war and which will be still more generally realized when victory has been 
achieved, of completing and increasing our industrial products, obliges us from 
this moment to seek the best means of forming a corps of engineers, managers of 
great industrial enterprises, etc., which will be necessary for our economic 
reorganization. Thus the question of technical education, its development, and 
its better adaptation presents itself at this moment with a new, practical inter- 
est and a marked urgency. In a circular issued September last the minister of 
public instruction defined the obligation which will rest upon the universities 
in this matter as follows: “To insure the renaissance of the national economic 
activity by means of the sciences, and to take the direction of the vast move- 
ment for the revival of the chemical and physical industries which will of neces- 
sity follow peace.” 
The importance of provision for applied science as the complement 
of pure science in the scheme of university instruction is clearly 
shown by the results where the relation has been established. The 
Pasteur Institute was cited by Dr. Goy as a celebrated center of 
higher education which not only forms savants who contribute to the 
progress of science, but is also a veritable industrial establishment. 
Among the universities that have made special provision for the 
applied sciences he noted the Paris Faculty of Sciences, which main- 
tains an institute of applied chemistry, the faculty of sciences at 
Grenoble, with its electrochemical institute, and corresponding in- 
stitutes at Lille, Nancy, and Toulouse. At the same time in all 
these centers there is a lack of the means of specialization. For in- 
stance, the institute of applied chemistry in the Paris faculty is in 
need of chairs for the study of fermentations, for the combination of 
dyes, for the manufacture of artificial perfumes, and for the produc- 
tion of nitric acid by chemical electricity, etc. Attention was also 
called by Dr. Goy to the inferior position accorded to the courses of 
instruction in these institutes and to the diplomas which are accorded. 
as the sanction of the studies. Hence they fail to attract the ablest 
students. 
For the development of this department of education it is pro- 
posed that a faculty of applied sciences shall be created in every 
university, specialized according to the industries of their respective 
regions. In this way there would be established in France centers 
of the higher technical education, including altogether the totality 
of the applied sciences. The admission requirements would bring 
 
-P-A-G-E-611
  
FRANCE. , 583 
a new class of students into these faculties, young men who are 
drawn by natural inclination to technical pursuits, but by reason of 
their profound study of general science would be interested, after 
leaving the university, in the continued exercise of research. Thus, 
having full sympathy with the discoveries and the instruction of 
savants, they would aid them in turn by their experiences. and the 
manufactories would thus become laboratories. 
The bill presented by Dr. Goy has been under discussion in all the 
university centers of France during the year and, although many 
modifications of its provisions have been suggested, its main purpose 
has been everywhere approved. The text of the bill is as follows: 
ARTICLE 1. 
There shall be created by decree, in each university, a faculty of applied 
sciences devoted to higher education in the technical arts and the industrial 
applications of science. In the smaller university centers the faculties of 
science shall be transformed into faculties of the applied sciences. 
ARTICLE 2. 
The new faculties shall be integral parts of the respective. universities in the 
several centers in which they are established. They shall be subject to the 
same regulations, possess the same rights and prerogatives as the other facul- 
ties so far as these agree with the provisions of the present law. They shall 
award the diploma of doctor in applied sciences. This diploma shall carry 
mention of the branch of science for which it is awarded. 
ARTICLE 3. 
A regulation of the public administration, established upon the advice of the 
superior council of public instruction, shall determine the conditions or the 
creation and the functioning of these faculties with the express reservation that 
the new faculties shall recruit their regular pupils from those who have secured 
the “licensié és sciences,” or the “certificat d’études supérieures;” that their 
courses of instruction shall be adapted to the industries of the region in which 
they are established; that the professors shall be chosen without other condi- . 
tion as to their diplomas, excepting as regards their scientific sanctions and 
industrial values, and that they shall only be obliged to teach during a limited 
time. 
ARTICLE 4, 
The existing institutes of applied sciences pertaining to the faculties of 
science shall be transferred to the new faculties of which they shall form 
integral parts. 
In this connection interest attaches to the bill introduced into the 
senate in July, 1914, by M. Astier, seconded by 178 colleagues, rela- 
tive to the organization of technical, industrial, and commercial edu- 
cation. This project was first submitted to the senate in 1918, the 
chamber of deputies having before it at the same time several bills 
relating to the organization of industrial and commercial education 
as a means of replacing the former system of apprenticeship. At  
-P-A-G-E-612

its origin, therefore, the senate bill was prompted by an industrial 
crisis; but it has received new impetus from the war, and while its 
ultimate passage must await the restoration of peace its provisions 
give direction to councils, which are shaping the educational policies 
of the future. The bill, which comprises five sections, is exhaustive. 
The first four sections codify existing laws and provide further for 
State aid for “ écoles de métiers,” which may be established by cham- 
bers of commerce, and to private schools of the same character which 
comply with official requirements. 
Provision is also made in the bill for the establishment of free 
obligatory continuation courses for boys and girls under 18 years 
of age employed in commerce or industry. These courses may be 
arranged by civil authorities, by private committees, or by employers, 
but as a rule the lessons would be given during the legal working 
day, and employers would be required to arrange for the attendance 
of their juvenile workers. The emphasis placed upon commercial 
training by this measure has already led to the establishment of new 
schools, many of them in the interests of girls. Among the latter is 
reported a special school for the higher commercial training of girls, 
which has just been organized at Paris. 
The legislative measures here considered disclose the same need 
that is felt in England. Science and education have both been too 
far divorced from industry. The condition was dwelt upon by Dr. 
Goy in the address already cited. He said: 
In France the savants and the manufacturers trained in different schools 
have no contact with each other. In the past our savants would have regarded 
it as a humiliation to enter into industry, while, on the other hand, the French 
manufacturer has thought only of maintaining without change his methods of 
production, * * * Hence our industries have followed at a halting pace 
those of other countries, where the sciences and the technic arts are closely 
united. Science itself has been the loser. It would have found in association 
with industry the means of fruitful discovery. 
As regards the requirements of war, the mistake has already been 
corrected. By a decree of August 11, 1914, a Government committee 
on inventions was created, and the following year (Nov. 13, 1915), 
in accordance with a report presented to the President of the 
Republic by the minister of public instruction, in agreement with the 
ministers of war and of the navy, a decree was issued instituting in 
the ministry of public instruction an office for inventions pertaining 
to the national defense. The new office is charged with the duty of 
making a careful examination of all propositions submitted by in- 
ventors, and also with that of conducting scientific researches which 
may be requested by the ministers of war and of the navy. Plans 
and models submitted by inventors, which are accepted as of pos- 
sible military application, will be submitted by the office of inven-
-P-A-G-E-613
  
GERMANY. 585 
tions to the technical officers of the ministers of national defense. 
Officers and experts from these ministries will then be appointed for 
examining and testing the invention. The committee on inventions 
was attached to this department. Although by the terms of the de- 
cree its tenure is limited to the period of the war, it serves as a prece- 
dent for a similar service in the interests of reorganized society. 
GERMANY 
The disorganization of education in Germany, as in the other bel- 
ligerent nations, has most severely affected the universities and higher 
educational institutions; the need for professionally and technically 
trained men has caused the drafting of medical students and students 
of higher technical schools for special services connected with the 
war. Nominally, the numbers of students have not considerably de- 
creased, for the reason that students in active service are maintained 
on the-rolls; the actual number of those continuing studies is in some 
cases as low as 15 per cent of those on the rolls. At the same time 
the proportion of women students has reached an unprecedented 
height. 
The number of matriculated students in the 22 German universi- 
ties in the winter semester of 1914-15 was 52,500, a decrease of 6,500 
against the preceding year. In this number there were 4,000 women 
(an increase of 300), and 1,500 foreigners (a decrease of 3,600). The 
number of students in war services was 29,500 men and 400 women, 
which brings the actual number of German students in 1914-15 to 
19,000 men and 3,600 women. 
ree universities suffered a heavier ieatirs on their students than 
others. At the University of Konigsberg, for instance, out of 1,260 
students, 1,057 were drafted for service; at Marburg, out of 2,049 
students, 1,448 were drafted, etc. 
The figures for the summer semester, 1915, show a still larger per- 
centage of students in military services. The total number of matric- 
ulated students in that period was 52,566, of whom 34,386 were in 
military service. 
According to the “Schulstatistische Blatter” of August 19, 1915, 
the proportion of students of higher technical schools who were in 
active service or in other services connected with the war, was about 
80 per cent. The records of attendance show the following numbers 
of students actually attending classes: Munich, 409; Dresden, 407; 
Berlin, 378; Karlsruhe, 221; Hannover and Aachen, 186 each; Darm- 
stadt, 183; Stuttgart, 121; Brunswick, 101; Danzig, 91; and Bres- 
lau, 41. 
The teaching profession has suffered loss of members called out for 
military duty amounting to 34.39 per cent for the Empire. The total    
-P-A-G-E-614
  586 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
number of teachers in active service, as obtained by actual enumera- 
tion made in 1915 by the three teachers’ associations, was 64,501. 
In almost every larger city the school buildings have been turned 
into barracks. Some cities, particularly those in frontier districts, 
have been compelled to surrender all their school buildings to soldiers. 
Berlin has escaped the general condition, but even in that city many 
school buildings have been occupied by the soldiers. The school 
children that are obliged to vacate their building usually find shelter 
in the one nearest. The pupils of the two schools are then taught 
in turns; one school in the morning, and the other in the afternoon 
hours. In Breslau all the school buildings have been requisitioned by 
the military authorities, and the teachers compelled to look for other 
available places for continuing instruction. A teacher in that city 
writes that he found a pool room attached to a closed saloon, and 
arranged his classroom there. He took his seat on the billiard table, 
the pupils standing around listening to his instruction. 
Even more important than the external difficulties described are 
the effects of the war upon the internal organization of the school 
system. In Berlin alone 2,100 teachers have been recruited for the 
war. This constitutes half of all the male teachers and nearly one- 
third of the entire teaching force of the city. Until a recent date no 
steps were taken by the school board to retain teachers for the pro- 
fessional service. This course was generally approved by the teachers, 
who believed that the service to fatherland was of foremost importance. 
But as the war progresses the problems arising from it grow more 
urgent, and their consideration becomes imperative; the military and 
civil authorities must consider ‘seriously which employment of 
teachers is of more importance to the country, even for the time 
being—garrison service or professional work. 
During the early period of the war school affairs could be adjusted 
to meet the changed conditions with comparative ease. But in the 
course of time the difficulties have multiplied. Schools have been 
obliged to assist one another; numerous changes due to the war have 
been introduced, or, in thé language of the war messages, “ regroup- 
ping and shifting have taken place.” To make up for the inade- 
quacy of teaching forces, the working hours of the remaining teachers 
have been prolonged. Classes have been combined and the instruc- 
tion shortened. The teachers—women as well as men—have taken 
up the extra work in the spirit of enthusiastic self-devotion that 
animates the whole nation. 
The observer from whom this account is taken, in the main, 
declares: 
It is obvious that in the atmosphere of strain and overwork the instruction 
can not follow the same course as in time of peace. Almost every teacher has 
devised his own methods to meet the temporary conditions. The choice of
-P-A-G-E-615

themes for class work reflects everywhere the preoccupation of minds with the 
war. It is seen in war drawings, war themes of class compositions, war dicta- 
tions, etc. The children learn by heart poems reflecting the spirit of the time, 
read selections about the war, and sing patriotic and warlike songs. It is too 
early to explain just how this warlike spirit affects the spirit of the school. 
There are no outward signs; no investigation would disclose it. It is only felt 
by the teachers and, perhaps, in a vague way, by the children.” 
INCREASE OF JUVENILE OFFENSES. 
The unruliness of youth deprived by the war of usual restraints 
has already led to corrective measures on the part of the schools. 
The city authorities of Mittweida, under the date of July 5, 1915, 
issued the following announcement: 
A large part of the school children are becoming more and more wild. Boys 
and girls behave shockingly and are not afraid to commit offenses against 
private property or to damage fields and public grounds and, walks. This 
observation fills all who are responsible for the rising generation with great 
anxiety, but it also compels them to check this menace with relentless firmness 
and by the application of all measures that are at their disposal. Parents and 
educators are hereby urgently requested to assist energetically the authorities 
and the school in this trouble. At the same time attention is directed to the 
fact that they will be responsible for the damage done. The provision of the 
school rules that the school children seen alone after 9 o’clock p. m. in the street 
are subject to punishment will be reinforced and applied unswervingly. 
In Chemnitz: three associations for child welfare have combined 
their efforts and intend to issue a similar appeal to parents and 
educators. 
The Central German Committee for the Protection of Children has 
received from many large cities reports of an appalling increase of 
juvenile offenses. This condition in Berlin is illustrated by the fol- 
lowing data: The younger boys showed during the first quarter of the 
war a marked decrease of crime as compared witb the corresponding 
period of 1913. But during the last three months of 1914 the num- 
ber of reports to the central committee climbed up as suddenly as it 
had decreased before, namely, from 319 to 417, while during the same 
period of 1913 the change of numbers was from 322 to 323. It must 
be remembered that a large part of the boys of the ages 16 to 18 are 
at the front as volunteers (Freiwilliger), so that the increase affects 
especially the two younger classes. 
The movement in regard to juvenile offenders appears from the 
table here given:

588 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
In the first quarter of 1915 the number of reported cases increased 
from 85 to 98 for boys of the ages 12 to 14, and from 187 to 160 for 
boys 14 to 16 years old. 
A considerable increase of offenses is also observed among young 
girls. An inquiry has been started in order to establish the propor- 
tion of offenses among the young girls and their prevailing character. 
Among probable causes advanced in explanation of the sudden in- 
crease of juvenile offenses are the lack of surveillance at home, owing 
to the absence of fathers who have been drafted for service, and the 
exciting effect of the war upon the imagination of children. 
PROVISIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN. 
Owing to the fact that so many mothers are engaged in factory 
work, in some of the German communal schools children are urged 
to do their review study in the afternoon hours at the school where 
teachers are provided to look after them and to assist them in pre- 
paring their tasks. The number of schools having such arrange- 
ments was increased during the winter. The main object of these 
afternoon studies is to keep children away from the street. 
In view of the food problem confronting the German nation, the 
development of school gardens has assumed special significance. 
Rapid increase in the number of school gardens is noted in German 
educational publications. The authorities are lending this movement 
all possible assistance and encouragement. “Das Schulhaus” (April, 
1915) states that in Prussia there were 213 school gardens established 
by the schools themselves and 53 established by private means. This 
development of school gardens is largely due to the decree of the 
‘“Kultusminister” issued a few years ago, which orders every school, 
including those located in the country, to furnish a school garden 
for its pupils. 
At the same time steps have been taken throughout the country 
by numerous societies for child welfare, by authorities, and new 
organizations formed for the purpose, to provide food and care for 
poor children whose mothers are either destitute or otherwise unable 
to attend properly to their wants. 
Free school lunches have considerably alleviated the suffering of 
children. But the number of needy children is so enormous that the 
task of providing for the lunches is too great for any single organi- 
zation or municipality. Even the city of Berlin could not undertake 
to provide for school lunches entirely by municipal funds, and limited 
itself to financing the citizens’ organization, “Verein fiir Kinder- 
volkskiichen.” The amount disbursed by the city for that purpose in 
1915-16 was 600,000 marks. There is tendency to connect the school 
lunches with instruction in cooking for girls.

EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS, 589 
TTALY: 
Information as to current educational conditions in Italy is 
meager, since the chief effect of the preparations for war, and final 
participation in the struggle, in regard to education has been to defer 
all plans for the development of that interest 
Efforts to alleviate suffering among teachers and their families, 
and to provide food and shelter for school children made destitute 
by war, continue to occupy the attention of teachers’ associations 
and private societies. The National Association of Teachers has es- 
tablished a fund in aid of teachers and their families impoverished 
by the war, the money to be raised by the gift of one day’s salary 
from every teacher, and increased by contributions from additional 
amounts that may be earned by teachers who take over the classes 
of teachers in active service. 
The National Association of Teachers has also created a source of 
aid for war orphans by the publication of a periodical which will 
be sold at all schools for 15 cents a copy. The Patronato Scholastico, 
which according to a law of 1897 is formed in every parish to aid 
poor school children, has greatly increased its services in the present 
emergency. 
Early in the current year the Unione Italiana dell’Educazione 
Popolare combined with the Federazione Italiana delle Biblioteche 
Popolari in the call for a congress to consider grave problems of 
popular education growing out of the war. The program covers the 
same questions that are uppermost in the public discussions of Eng- 
land, France, and Germany. It comprises assistance to children 
before and after the regular school age, vocational education, prepa- 
ration of emigrants for the industrial conditions of foreign countries, 
technical reeducation for the mutilated victims of war, assistance to 
war orphans, etc. The immense interest excited by these subjects is 
indicated by the prominence of the men to whom these various topics 
were assigned, including senators, Government officials, experienced 
teachers, and directors of industries. 
NEW LIGHT ON EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS. 
In addition to the effects of the war in disorganizing schools and 
exposing children to evil conditions, there are other results which 
are not only experienced in the warring nations, but will inevitably 
extend beyond those limits. Chief among these is the work of reedu- 
cating disabled soldiers, which has reached enormous proportions in 
all the countries engaged in the struggle. This work takes two main 
directions, one pertaining to bodily injuries, the other to impaired 
mental powers. The former concerns two classes of disabled men, 
viz, the blind and the maimed or crippled. In both these cases there  
-P-A-G-E-618
  590 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
is extended experience to guide in the effort. The material aids 
and methods of instruction applicable to the blind have been thor- 
oughly worked out by special schools established for them. The 
main difficulty here is to obtain a sufficient number of teachers to 
meet the immense increase in the demand for this kind of training. 
With regard to the crippled, also, there are precedents of great 
value to guide in the work. The Scandinavian countries have long 
been distinguished by provision of this nature, the most celebrated 
of all the establishments in these countries being the school for crip- 
ples at Copenhagen. Belgium has an important institution of the 
same kind at Charleroi; Germany has similar establishments at 
Munich, Hamburg, and other well-known centers; similar institu- 
tions are found in different parts of France, chiefly under the direc- 
tion of the Freres de Saint-Jean-de-Dieu; and at Petrograd an insti- 
tution for the training of mutilated soldiers, established after the 
Manchurian war, has accomplished great results in overcoming the 
effects of various forms of disability. Here again the chief difficulty 
arises from the great increase of facilities and resources required for 
the training of the thousands of maimed men who must, if possible, 
be fitted for the industries of which they are still capable. 
The greatest problem which this work of reeducation presents is 
that of men whose mental powers have been partially or, for the 
time, entirely destroyed by brain wounds or by shock. These cases 
must be dealt with individually, and require the attention not only 
of a teacher by also of a physician. Indeed, in the majority of cases, 
the teacher can do nothing until the physician has in some degree 
restored the lost powers. 
The types of mental infirmities which may be treated by educa- 
tional methods are almost entirely comprised within the meaning of 
the term “aphasia.” This may appear as inability to speak at all 
or inability to understand speech, or both. These symptoms exist in 
various degrees which have been carefully analyzed by Herr Volk, 
a teacher in a school for German soldiers in Cologne. In this article 
ten types of aphasia are enumerated. These include, besides the 
types commonly recognized, inability to form correct sentences, 
which may be overcome by methods similar to those used in teach- 
ing foreign languages; inability to read, due to the severance of 
communication between the visual and auditory centers; inability 
to write from the failure to recognize the shape of letters; optical 
defects which prevent the patient from understanding what he sees, 
though his eyes are uninjured. This is treated by exercises in visual 
observation. Experience gives hope that in most cases the victim 
can be restored to the normal use of speech through the efforts of a 
skilled teacher.

EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS, 591 
In this connection it is interesting to note an account of a success- 
ful experiment in dealing with dumbness, one of the rarest cases 
on record, since most of the wounds that destroy the brain centers of 
speech are mortal. The patience, the intelligence, and the skill 
required to restore this lost power are illustrated, step by step, in 
the processes employed by the writer, a man of large experience in 
educational matters and well known in this country as well as in 
Europe.* 
The endeavors to restore to society and to industry the forces that 
have been ruthlessly wrecked by war have a sufficient motive in the 
spontaneous impulses of human sympathy and in national require- 
ments. They have, however, developed an unforeseen importance in 
respect to education. The records of these cases, which are rapidly 
accumulating, afford invaluable lessons applicable to the training of 
defective and abnormal children, a problem which at present engages 
the attention of governments and educators in all civilized countries. 
A second effect of the war, which can not be ignored, relates to 
the education of women. New conceptions of the province which 
women must fill in public affairs, as well as of their capacity, have 
taken shape in the present emergencies. Larger opportunities for 
their higher education, and provision for more diversified forms of 
technical and vocational education in their interests, have already 
resulted as a consequence of the war. It is impossible at present to 
indicate the extent or the radical nature of the change that will thus 
be effected in educational systems, but as indicating the certainty of 
woman’s fuller recognition in the fields of higher education and the 
services for which it prepares, a few incidents are suggestive. 
In England the only universities that do not admit women to full 
privileges are Cambridge and Oxford, and even here the barriers are 
rather the result of regulations and long-established conditions, 
which can only be changed by legal or other formal action, than of 
pronounced opposition. It is at this moment significant that the 
senate of Cambridge University has decided that certificates in re- 
search shall in future be granted to women students. 
In France 104 women teachers were employed in the lycées for 
boys and 293 in the colleges in 1915. The number included 14 who 
were teaching Latin. This fact is important, since the policy of in- 
troducing Latin into the lycées for girls has been long opposed, and 
it was not until recently that a few experiments were authorized in 
that direction. It is further worthy of note that the opening lecture 
of a course on engraving in the seventeenth century was delivered 
at the Sorbonne the present year by Mlle. Duportal, the woman thus

592 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
distinguished having been the first to gain in France the “ doctorat 
és lettres.” At about the same time Mme. Toteyko, a Polish lady, 
who had studied at Paris, delivered a lecture at the old Collége de 
France on the subject of “ Fatigue in the biological aspect.” It may 
be recalled that a few years agd Mme. Curie was appointed to the 
chair in the Paris Faculty of Sciences made vacant by the death of 
her distinguished husband, but the presence this year of a woman 
lecturer in the Collége de France was a departure from immemorial 
custom. 
Even more significant than these instances is the fact that the 
Institute of Technology for Women at Moscow has received official 
sanction from the Russian Government, which gives its diplomas 
full standing and entitles its graduates to positions as engineers, 
architects, etc. It is stated that a number of the women graduates 
of this institution “have specialized in mining; others have become 
expert in the good-roads movement, which is a vital issue in Russia; 
several will undertake duties connected with the rapid extension of 
the canals and waterways.” 
It need hardly be added that the discussions of curricula for 
schools and universities have taken new direction as a result of the 
war. This is especially noticeable in respect to modern languages. 
The consensus of opinion appears to be that the value of language 
in a scholastic scheme is to be determined by the literature or the 
scientific works of which it is the medium. At the same time it is 
evident that there will be a shifting of values in this respect as a 
result of the war. Already new importance has been imparted to 
the study of the Russian language. 
In this connection interest attaches to the following statement: 
Facilities for the learning of Russian are provided at the universities of 
Liverpool, Oxford, Cambridge, and London (King’s College), and at University 
College, Nottingham, as well as by the London County Council. The Russian 
honors course at Cambridge is a three or four years’ course, offering the choice 
between Slavonic philology and Russian history and institutions, the latter an 
indispensable equipment for a better aquaintance of the Russia of to-day. For 
obtaining a degree one other language is required, the most advantageous com- 
binations being either Russian and German (for business and scientific pur- 
poses) or Russian and French (for literary purposes). 
The teaching of Russian is more fully developed in Liverpool than anywhere 
else in the Kingdom. In London, though the commercial teaching of the lan- 
guage has been taken in hand by the London County Council, the higher teach- 
ing, both of language, literature, and history, still suffers woefully from lack 
of endowment. Steps are being taken at this moment to remedy this defect, 
and to make the University of London what it ought to be, a dominant center 
for consolidating the friendly relations that now exist between Hngland and 
the Slav world. King’s College, which has been from the first the university 
center for the teaching of Russian in London, is trying to establish an ade- 
quately equipped school of Slavonic studies, which will form a focus for the
-P-A-G-E-621
  EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 593 
members of the various races who happen to be in London, and interpret their 
history and literature adequately and attractively to educated English people. 
The teaching of commercial Russian will be of little political use unless the more 
literary and scholarly side of the matter is also developed. 
The long connection of King’s College with Russia has resulted at the present 
moment in the interesting development that about 70 Russian refugee students 
are studying engineering and medicine at the college. The two important public 
lectures which were delivered during last term on “The Spirit of Russia” and 
“The Spirit of the Serbs” attracted large audiences, over which Mr. Austen 
Chamberlain and Sir Arthur Evans presided. They also elicited a letter from 
one of the lecturers, Dr. Seton Watson, the authority on the history of the 
southern Slavs, in which he suggested the formation of some such Slavonic 
school at King’s College, and generously offered to equip a Slavonic library 
with the main classics of Czech, Slovak, Serbo-Croat, and Bulgarian literature, 
and the necessary philological works and dictionaries dealing with these lan- 
. guages, and to contribute annually to the funds of such a library. This offer 
has been placed before the foreign office, the board of education, and the board 
of trade, and it is earnestly to be hoped that Government support will be given 
to the scheme. 
In August of the current year the French minister of public in- 
struction addressed a circular letter to the academic rectors with 
respect to the recognition of the Servian language in the examina- 
tions for the baccalaureate. The circular announced that in view 
of many inquiries on the subject it had been decided that candidates 
for the baccalaureate, natives of Servia, may present, as an “ex- 
ceptional and provisional” privilege, their native language in both 
the oral and written examinations for that diploma authorized for 
sections B afid D; that is, the section having Latin but no Greek, 
and the section in which modern languages are substituted for 
Latin. The rectors are instructed to bring this matter to the atten- 
tion of the deans of the faculties of sciences and letters. The program 
of the examinations in the Servian language is under consideration 
and will be announced before the next session of the examining com- 
mittees. 
EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 
The tercentenary of the death of Shakespeare was celebrated dur- 
ing the year with impressive ceremonies. The war necessarily inter- 
fered with the elaborate plans which had been originally formed for 
this occasion in England; nevertheless much was done to impress 
upon the public, and more especially upon the young, the significance 
of this event. At the Royal Victoria Hall, London, a Shakespeare 
festival was continued from April 22 to May 5, to which the London 
Shakespeare League made an unusual contribution by reviving a con- 
temporary satire in which one of the characters presumably repre- 
sents the poet himself.
-P-A-G-E-622
  
  594 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
Special celebrations were held in the schools of London and 
throughout England on the 3d of May, following a meeting at the 
Mansion House, London, on the evening of May 2, which gave oppor- 
tunity for representatives from all the British dominions as well as 
from foreign countries to pay tribute to the master dramatist of the 
modern world. 
The tercentenary o_ the death of Cervantes was commemorated on 
the 23d of April, current, with many imposing ceremonies in his 
native land, and appropriately commemorated in all centers of 
learning. 
In England a project was started for an educational endowment 
to be applied to the foundation of a chair in Spanish in King’s 
College, London. Commenting on this proposition, the London 
Times says: 
Such a chair (established on the tercentenary of .the death of Shakespeare 
as well as of Cervantes) would excellently typify the union of Spain and Great 
Britain in the common joy of having produced, contemporaneously, for the whole 
civilized world, the greatest of all romancists and the greatest of all dramatists. 
The international sympathies excited by the war are illustrated by 
ceremonies in honor of the Belgian poet, Emile Verhaeren, held at 
Paris May 29 of the current year. Before the distinguished com- 
pany of men and women assembled on this occasion the minister of 
public instruction, M. Painlevé, paid eloquent tribute to the poet 
whose verse has immortalized the tragic experiences and emotions 
resulting from the European catastrophe. It was natural that in 
this tribute the name of the Italian poet Gabriele d’Annunzio should 
be associated with that of his Belgian contemporary. 
The memory of the great Italian savant and clinician, Guido Bac- 
celli, was honored at Rome by appropriate ceremonies held at the 
Capitol on the 20th of April. On this occasion the French: Republic 
was represented by Prof. Joseph Teissier, of the Faculty of Medi- 
cine of the University of Lyon, who had been designated by the 
minister of public instruction by reason both of his distinction and 
his well-known friendship for the Italian savant to take part in the 
ceremonies. : 
Among the important events of the year noted by the German 
educational publications, first place is given to the establishment of 
the Central Institute of Education and Instruction (Zentral-institut 
fiir Erziehung und Unterricht). The inaugural ceremonies took 
place at Berlin on March 21, 1915. The minister of ecclesiastical 
affairs in the inaugural address set forth the purpose and organiza- 
tion of the institution briefly as follows: 
For a long time it has been the aim and the earnest desire of the educational 
administration to create one common central institution of information and 
practical activity for the entire realm of education, so widely ramified and
-P-A-G-E-623
  
EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 595 
diversified. The want of such an institution has been felt with increasing 
acuteness, and could not be met by the several distinct establishments created 
in the course of time to perform tasks corresponding to the subdivisions of a 
central institution, although these establishments have, beyond question, per- 
formed useful service within the scope of their special purposes. 
The, institute will be divided into three principal departments: Department of 
information; department of exhibitions; and department of padagogical work. 
Its main task consists in the collection of specimens and sets of historical and 
practical material. 
The division of information has its particular task, that of keeping informed 
about current events in education and furnishing information upon the follow- 
ing subjects: Organization and administration of education and schools; school 
buildings and equipment ; school programs and curricula ; methods of instruction 
and their results; textbooks; illustrative material; libraries of teachers and 
students ; school hygiene; welfare and protection of children. 
A central institution that can give information and advice in all these matters 
and offer opportunity for more profound and more penetrative study, is, in 
view of the steadily increasing complexity and diversity of our pedagogical 
systems and tendencies, a particularly urgent necessity. 
The division of exhibitions is to furnish illustrative material required for 
the understanding of such matters as school building and equipment, school 
hygiene, textbooks and materials of instruction, educational experiments and 
their results, etc. It comprises two formerly independent institutions: The 
German Educational Hxposition, and. the Education Museum of the city of 
Berlin. This division will maintain a permanent exposition and send out 
traveling exhibitions. 
The third division, that of scientific and practical pedagogical research, is to 
popularize the results of its work by courses, lectures, and practical information 
furnished to teachers, school boards, and to laymen interested in education. 
In order that the Central Institute of Education and Instruction may per- 
form its work in the varied Provinces, popularize it, give advice and information 
in the proper manner, the collaboration of experienced specialists is necessary. 
School teachers, communal officials, representatives of organizations, and other 
competent persons should assist in this part of the work. To avoid one-sided- 
ness, there will be represented in the managing and executive staffs of the 
institution, besides the state, also important communal and professional organ- 
izations, as well as individual prominent specialists. 
The Permanent Exposition. of Education and Instruction is to 
remain at its present location, 120 Potsdamerstrasse. In the same 
building will be located a State-controlled institute for instruction 
in natural history, and the psychopedagogical division of the Cen- 
tral Institute. For the Central Institute itself a monumental build- 
ing has been planned. Another institution to be merged into the 
Central Institute is the State bureau of information on school 
matters.

CHAPTER XXXITI. 
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 
By W. S. JESIEN, 
Translator of Slavic Languages, Bureau of Education. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The progress accomplished by Russia during the decade following 
the war with Japan has been frequently commented upon with aston- 
ishment. While the popular interest has been centered chiefly about 
Russia’s achievements in military preparedness, internal administra- 
tion, and industrial development, the deeper social and cultural prog- 
ress of the country deserves closer attention on the part of educators. 
The activity of the Russian Duma has had a marked influence on 
the progress of internal reforms, especially those connected with the 
welfare of the common people. After its second reorganization, in 
1907, the Duma entered on a course of legislative work which, al- 
though naturally slow and circumspect, has proved very beneficial 
to the country.. This period, termed by the Russians the “Third 
Duma,” includes important legislation pertaining to the introduction 
of a general system of popular education. 
The full extent of educational progress in Russia during the last 
10 years has recently been made known by publications in the Rus- 
sian language which are not generally accessible to students of 
education. The most important among these are: 
The Report of the Russian Minister of Public Instruction, published in 1915, 
and covering the period from 1910 te 1912, inclusive. 
A summary of the educational legislation of the Third Duma, during the 
period 1907-1912, by E. P. Kovalevsky, entitled ‘ Popular Education and Church 
Property” (Pt. I, St. Petersburg, 1912). 
An elementary school census was taken throughout the Russian 
Empire on January 18, 1911. The first four volumes of statistics 
resulting from this census have appeared in print; they represent 
4 out of 15 educational districts in Russia—those of Petrograd, 
Moscow, Kiev, and Kazan. The remaining volumes are not 
yet issued. The totals for the Empire have, however, been sepa- 
rately reported. The census comprised all the elementary schools 
of the Empire, including church, communal, and private schools of 
all kinds, as well as those pertaining to the different ministries, not 
61355°—16——40 597
-P-A-G-E-626
  598 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
included in the reports of the ministry of public instruction. Prior 
to this census it was extremely difficult to obtain correct figures re- 
lating to schools outside the province of the above ministry. The 
last previous school census was taken in 1880. 
All the above publications, as well as a number of other authorita- 
tive sources in the Russian language, have been freely consulted 
in the preparation pf this chapter. 
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
The control of elementary schools—The great majority of ele- 
mentary schools in Russia are directly controlled by the ministry 
of public instruction, which also exercises closest supervision over 
all private and communal schools. But a parallel system of elemen- 
tary schools is also maintained by the Holy Synod. This body 
is completely independent in the management of its schools. An 
ary schools is also maintained by the Holy Synod. This body 
State, and the sums appropriated placed at the unrestricted disposal 
of the synod. Most of the schools maintained by the synod are of 
the type known in Russia as léteracy schools (Skoly gramoty), that is, 
they simply teach children to read and write. 
The ministries of war, interior, marine, agriculture, etc., control, 
each, a number of elementary schools with instruction adapted to 
different special purposes. The relative importance of the various 
ministries and the church as educational agencies is evident from the 
following table representing the percentages of pupils receiving ele- 
mentary education in the different types of schools:

            The foregoing table is based on statistics of elementary education 
for 1910. Since that time the number of elementary schools has con- 
siderably increased. As the ministry of public instruction leads in 
the movement for popular education, it may be presumed that the 
relation has changed in favor of that ministry. In 1911 the enroll- 
ment in the various schools already indicated a growing predomi- 
nance of “ministry” schools. The enrollment in percentages was as 
follows:

EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 599 
In the following years, owing to large appropriations for the ex- 
tension of elementary education, great activity in school building 
was developed by the ministry of public instruction. The educa- 
tional debates in the Duma show the prevalence of the opinion that 
all education should be centered in the ministry of public instruction. 
Movement for popular education—The vigorous promotion of 
elementary education by the Russian Government is largely due to 
the attitude of the Imperial Duma. The Duma was established by 
the act of August 6, 1906, as a House of Representatives with very 
indefinite authority. On account of its radical attitude it was soon 
dissolved by the Emperor, and a new act of December 11, 1906, was 
proclaimed, instituting a new electoral system framed so as to limit 
the representation of radical elements in the Duma. The Second 
Duma, elected on the new basis, was soon dissolved. The act of 
June 38, 1907, created a new system of election that further restricted 
the electoral rights of democratic elements in the population. Asa 
result, the Third Duma was more conservative and inclined to move 
by slow, gradual reforms rather than by revolutionary measures. 
That the Russian Government recognized the necessity of extend- 
ing the provision for elementary education was plainly shown in the 
First Duma. Before this body a representative of the Government 
made a statement which contained a promise on this subject ex- 
pressed in the following words: . 
Recognizing the urgency of raising the intellectual and moral level of the 
masses of the population by promoting their education, the Government is 
preparing bills for the introduction of general education with extensive coopera- 
tion of social agencies, a reform of secondary education, and a reform of 
higher education. (Inaugural address, delivered May 18, 1906.) 
Universal instruction and prospects of its realization—In respect 
to elementary education the plan of the Government consisted in the 
gradual extension of the existing system with the view of bringing 
the schools within 10 years to the number required in order to pro- 
vide education for every child in the Empire. For this purpose the 
ministry of public instruction was to receive an annual addition to 
the appropriation for elementary education, to the amount of 
10,000,000 rubles. ; 
This plan was taken up by the Third Duma in connection with 
appropriations for the ministry, and a law was passed, on April 4, 
1908, providing for permanent addition to the appropriations for 
elementary education of an annual sum of 6,900,000 rubles, to be used 
for grants to zemstvos and municipalities for the establishment of 
elementary schools. Out of this sum 5,000,000 rubles was to be 
. expended for teachers’ salaries and 1,900,000 for new school buildings.

The law of June 18, 1912, as quoted by the Report of the Minister 
of Public Instruction, provided that: 
Beginning with the year 1912, there should be disbursed from the funds of 
the Imperial Treasury for the permanent needs of elementary schools, as well 
as for other needs connected with the introduction of general education, in 
addition to sums disbursed for that purpose up to the present time, 8,000,000 
rubles annually, with the proviso that the expenditure for the latter of the said 
needs shall not exceed 800,900 rubles annually. 
The further growth of the special provision for introduction of 
general education is seen from the following figures given by the 
Russian Year Book: 
The estimates for 1913 of the ministry of public instruction amounted to 
186,734,000 rubles, of which 2,759,000 rubles was for scientific societies, etec., 
7,652,000 rubles for universities, 31,767,000 rubles for secondary and special 
schools, 67,196,000 rubles for primary schools, 3,552,000 rubles for teaching 
staff, and 16,400,000 rubles for building and repairs. The last two items repre- 
sent the additional appropriations for the introduction of general education. 
The total increase over 1912 amounted to 19,357,000 rubles, or 16.5 per cent. 
The bulk of this, 11,500,000 rubles, was intended for elementary education. 
It was calculated that by the application of these annual increases 
Russia would realize general elementary education in 1920. The war 
will doubtless remove that time further into the future, unless the 
spirit of uplift pervading Russia at present produces some gigantic 
effort toward immediate realization of this educational aim after or 
during the war. 
The ministry of public instruction, in accordance with the law, 
used the special appropriations for subsidies to zemstvos and mu- 
nicipalities which had presented schemes for the introduction of 
general education within their areas. At the close of 1910, out of 
395 county zemstvos 303 had undertaken the gradual introduction of 
general elementary education and had accordingly received oe 
from the munistry.
-P-A-G-E-629
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 601 
The subsidies had a stimulating effect on the appropriations for 
education made by the zemstvos out of their own funds. In 1907, 
before the commencement of the general education activity, the ap- 
propriations of all zemstvos for elementary education amounted to 
26,243,100 rubles. In 1910 the appropriations were 42,444,600 rubles. 
The journal of the ministry of public instruction for September, 
1913, states that at that time only six county zemstvos had not taken 
steps toward the introduction of general education. 
Permanent commission for the conduct of popular lectures.— 
Among the agencies of popular education, especial importance at- 
taches to the education of adults, in view of the high percentage of 
illiterates in Russia. The ministry of public instruction has devel- 
oped considerable activity in this direction through the permanent 
commission for the conduct of popular lectures. In 1912 the com- 
mission published 18 new popular books, with a total issue of 175,000. 
During the same year the total circulation of publications of this 
kind was 191,033 copies, valued at 25,637 rubles. 
Lectures illustrated by slides were arranged under the auspices of 
the commission for Petrograd and the surrounding district at 105 
different places. The number of lectures was 532, with a total at- 
tendance of 75,599. 
The technical division of the commission, in view of greatly in- 
creased demands, extended its activity in 1912 by furnishing dem- 
onstration material and apparatus to zemstvos, municipalities, and 
school inspectors in charge of popular lectures in various educational 
centers of the Empire. Assistance was also offered to numerous 
institutions, to authorities in charge of education of the troops, to 
temperance societies, and to schools of various kinds. 
In 1912 the commission instituted a division of educational cine- 
matography, for which purpose an appropriation of 19,920 rubles 
had been placed at its disposal. 
Statistics of elementary education—The stimulus given to ele- 
mentary education by the appropriations referred to resulted in a 
rapid increase of the number of schools and pupils as indicated by 
the following table, which comprises the elementary schools under 
the ministry of public instruction: °

In 1911 the total number of pupils in elementary schools outside 
the control of the ministry of public instruction was 1,988,805, which 
brings the total enrollment for that year to 6,174,883. For 1912 the 
only available figures are those of the ministry of public instruction, 
appearing in the foregoing table. Presuming, however, that the 
     
 
-P-A-G-E-630

other schools had the same enrollment in that year as in 1911, i. e., 
1,988,805, and adding this number to 5,155,536, a conservative esti- 
mate of total elementary enrollment for 1912 is obtained, namely, 
7,144,841. 
The total expenditure for the elementary schools under the min- 
istry of public instruction amounted, in 1912, to 99,839,344 rubles, 
including 48,210,726 rubles contributed by the State. 
The various sources of maintenance of elementary schools are

The number of teachers of elementary schools in 1912 was 173,515, 
including instructors in religion, 48,834; male teachers, 53,415; female 
teachers, 71,266. 
Kindergartens Kindergartens have not had much development 
in Russia. In 1908 they numbered about 100, all supported by 
private funds and patronized by wealthy classes. A Froebel society 
was organized in Russia as early as 1871, but owing to the indiffer- 
ence of the general public it has shown little activity. It is sub- 
sidized by the State to the amount of 200 rubles annually. 
Higher elementary schools——By the law of June 25, 1912, an im- 
portant reform has been effected in the organization and programs 
of the old “urban schools.” The reform brings these schools into 
definite relation to secondary education by providing for the admis- 
sion of their students to the corresponding classes of the gymnasia. 
The main features of the reform are as follows: 
1. The name “urban schools” has been changed to “higher ele- 
mentary schools.” 
2. Provision has been made for the admission of girls, the old 
urban schools having been for boys only. 
3. The duration of the course has been fixed at four years. The 
admission requirements call for the completion of a one-class ele- 
mentary school. The courses of study have been extended, with adap- 
tations to local demands. 
4. The law has permitted the establishment of trustees’ councils 
for each school at the option of the founders. The members of the 
councils are appointed by the founders of the schools. The trustees’
-P-A-G-E-631
  
  EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 603 
councils attend to the business management of the school, endeavor 
to secure the cooperation of society for the best arrangement of the 
school, observe the instruction and education imparted in the schools, 
and communicate their conclusions to officers of education and direc- 
tors of schools. The trustees’ councils also have the right to nomi- 
nate candidates for the positions of directors and teachers. The final 
approval of the directors rests with the curator of the district, and 
of the teachers with the superintendents of primary schools. 
The courses of study of the higher elementary schools differ in 
some respects from the corresponding lower classes of the gymnasia, 
the general tendency being to make the education given in these 
schools complete in itself. In consideration of these facts, the law 
provided that students who had completed the second class of the 
higher elementary schools should be admitted to the third class of 
the gymnasia. Such students, however, were required to submit to 
an entrance examination in modern languages. 
The law also raised the prescribed amount of annual expenditure 
for individual schools from 4,170 rubles to 7,490 rubles, the increase 
to be used in augmenting the salaries of teachers from 540 to 960 
rubles, and of directors from 150 to 300 rubles. Other items for 
which expenditure was increased are: Singing lessons, from 75 to 
150 rubles; teaching material, from 150 to 300 rubles. Physiéal 
training was introduced by a special appropriation of 200 rubles. 
With reference to the measures to be taken to enforce the law, 
it was provided that the change from urban to higher elementary 
schools should be effected gradually, within a three-year period, be- 
ginning July 1, 1912. A number of lower elementary schools were 
also designated as subject to change. 
The number of higher elementary schools, including old urban 
schools, on January 1, 1913, was 1,183, with 162,858 students. The 
number of teachers and employees was 10,532. In 1912 the expen- 
diture for these schools amounted to 8,936,733 rubles, the State’s 
share being 5,583,332 rubles. 
County schools—tThe still existing schools of the old type called 
county schools, 115 in number, had 18,225 pupils in 1912. In this 
number are included three mountain schools in the Caucasus, with 
332 pupils. County schools are being transformed into higher ele- 
mentary schools. 
Schools of apprentices—The regulations pertaining to the schools 
of apprentices are contained in the general educational statute of 
1893. There are three types of these schools, as follows: 
(1) Trade schools, whose official purpose is to impart practical 
training in various manufactures and the knowledge necessary for 
the intelligent pursuit of a trade. For admission it is necessary to  
-P-A-G-E-632
    
604 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
have completed the course of a lower elementary school. The age of 
candidates must be between 11 and 14 years. The course is of three 
years’ duration, but a fourth year devoted entirely to practical work 
may be established at the option of the founders. The chief trades 
taught in these schools are locksmithing, carpentry, and smelting. 
(2) Schools of trade apprentices, which give general instruction 
preparatory to private apprenticeship which the graduates are ex- 
pected to take up. Admission requirements and the duration of the 
course are the same as in trade schools. 
(3) Lower schools of apprentices, the official purpose of which 
is actual training in trades as well as theoretical instruction per- 
taining to the trades. Applicants for admission must either have 
completed the course of a lower elementary school or be able to read 
and write, in which case they submit to a special entrance examina- 
tion. The age of the applicants must be between 13 and 16 years. 
The duration of the course is four years. 
In addition to the three types above considered there are a num- 
ber of trade schools having diversified programs, organized on the 
basis of special statutes. 
On January 1, 1913, the number of all schools of apprentices, in- 
cluding those under special statutes, was 301, with 1,589 teachers 
and 17,945 pupils. : 
Considerable extension of classes in manual training in lower and 
higher elementary schools is reported by the ministry. The law of 
June 25, 1912, pertaining to the reform of urban schools, required 
that classes in manual training attached to these schools should be 
transformed into vocational classes, such as bookkeeping, farming, 
postal and telegraph service. To meet the increased expenses the 
law raised the State subsidy for vocational classes to 2,500 rubles and 
for manual training classes to 1,000 rubles. In 1912 the total amount 
of State subsidy for vocational and manual training classes attached 
to primary schools was 603,253 rubles. 
In 1912 the total amount of State subsidy for vocational and 
manual training classes attached to primary schools was 603,253 
rubles. 
Training of teachers—The question of adequate provision for the 
training of teachers assumed special significance in connection with 
the rapid extension of elementary education. Realizing that new 
schools built throughout the Empire would be of little value without 
a parallel extension in teacher training schools, the Government from 
the very beginning of the execution of its school building program 
made ample provision for the establishment of new teachers’ semi- 
naries.

The appropriation for elementary education for 1912 contained 
a clause designating the sum of 479,700 rubles for the maintenance 
of 14 new teachers’ seminaries, and 50,000 rubles for the establish- 
ment of short-term courses for teachers. 
On January 1, 1913, teacher training schools of the advanced type 
(institutes) numbered 27, and of the lower type (seminaries and 
schools), 115. 
The number of students enrolled in the “institutes” at the same date 
was 1,818, and the number of teachers and other employees, 347; 22 
institutes had higher elementary schools attached to them as practice 
schools. The expenditure for teachers’ institutes for 1912 was 
872,583 rubles, the State contribution being 786,772 rubles. 
The total number of students in teachers’ “ seminaries” was 11,066; 
the number of teachers and employees, 1,460. The total expenditure 
in 1912 amounted to 3,695,456 rubles, including 2,799,358 rubles con- 
tributed by the State. 
There were also special courses for teachers in connection with 
elementary schools and intended to prepare candidates for teaching 
positions other than those reserved for seminary graduates. The 
number of such courses in 1912 was 127. 
Siberia—The conditions that make the introduction of popular 
education extremely difficult in European Russia are intensified in 
Siberia in proportion to the enormous area of the country and its 
scarcity of population. In an area of 10,996,346 square versts 
(4,816,400 square miles) Siberia has only 8,719,200 inhabitants, 
of whom 14.6 per cent are native tribes. The density of population 
is therefore 1.8 to a square mile. With the exception of a-few larger 
colonies, the inhabitants are scattered over a vast territory in little 
settlements which are almost isolated, owing to the lack of trans- 
portation facilities. The progress of elementary education in Siberia 
has nevertheless been steady, especially during the past decade. 
On January 1, 1915, the total number of schools in Siberia was 
5,190, of which 588 were in towns and 4,652 in villages. The number 
of schools in the various sections was as follows: 
West Siberian school district: 2,728 schools, or 52.6 per cent of the total 
number of schools. East Siberian school district : 1,751 schools, or 33.8 per cent 
of the total number of schools. The Priamur district: 709 schools, or 13.6 
per cent of the total number of schools. 
The distribution of the primary schools in various Provinces and 
districts of Siberia, their kind, number, and percentage of the total 
number of schools in each Province can be seen from the following

The west Siberian Provinces (Tobolsk and Tomsk) have the 
largest number of schools, followed by the east Siberian Provinces 
(Irkutsk and Yenisei) ; the smallest number of schools is in the Pri- 
amur district (Amur, Sakhalin, and Kamchatka Provinces). 
A+ the beginning of 1915 in all the Siberian towns there were 538 
primary schools, of which 57, or 10.6 per cent, were two-class schools, 
and 481, or 89.4 per cent, were one-class schools; in the villages there 
were 4,652 schools, of which 4,189, or 89.9 per cent, were two-class 
schools. 
The municipalities of Tomsk, Tobolsk, Akmolinsk, and Trans- 
baikal Provinces made widest use of the law of May 3, 1908, intro- 
ducing general education. 
NATIONAL CONGRESS ON EDUCATION. 
In December, 1913, representatives of Russian elementary teachers 
from all parts of the Empire assembled in Petrograd for the First 
Russian Congress on Popular Education. Over 600 teachers at- 
tended the congress, which was divided into sections with special 
programs, in order that its extensive work might be completed in a 
reasonably short time without overcrowding. 
The section of general questions adopted a resolution demanding 
the quickest possible development of the system of general compul- 
sory education with a six years’ course of study, and as a prelimi- 
nary measure recommended the extension of the three years’ course 
of study in the majority of existing popular schools to four years, 
and the appointment of two teachers to each school. 
As a means of reducing illiteracy among the adults, the congress 
declared itself in favor of the establishment of evening classes, Sun- 
day schools, university extension, and public libraries. 
Coeducation was upheld emphatically by the teachers, who pro- 
tested against the separation of sexes in the schools.
-P-A-G-E-635
  
EDUCATION IN ‘RUSSIA. 607 
The congress also demanded an extension of the course of study in 
elementary schools to include history, geography, and natural sci- 
ence. In reference to the language of instruction, on which subject: 
a special section was formed, the so-called “ Russification policy ” 
was unanimously condemned. The section expressed its opinion that 
the primary education of each nationality ought to be imparted in 
the spirit and in the language of the nationality to which the chil- 
dren belong and that the Russian language should be taught only 
after the children had acquired elementary knowledge in their own 
language. : 
The section on training of teachers devoted much time to the dis- 
cussion of general problems pertaining to the work and life of 
teachers throughout the country. There was complaint of the in- 
sufficient knowledge which the teachers acquire in the seminaries, 
and wish was expressed that more general education and more 
special knowledge of the methods of teaching might be given by 
the seminaries. The diploma of the seminary entitles a young man 
or woman to a situation in an elementary school somewhere in a 
village, cut off from the intellectual life of the country, since the 
educational resources of Russia are largely concentrated in the larger 
towns and penetrate very slowly and with great difficulty into the 
interior. As a means of keeping up the educational standard of the 
school-teacher, the congress recommended that zemstvos should sup- 
ply the teachers with daily papers and periodicals, and that the 
teachers should correspond with each other and form a school-teach- 
ers’ trade union. 
During the last few years much has been done toward helping 
the Russian school-teacher to get some experience of the world at 
large and to receive fresh intellectual stimulus from abroad. This 
has been achieved by organizing excursions, which receive assistance 
from the zemstvos and from the Government. Thanks to these ex- 
cursions, during the past five years over 2,500 teachers of elementary 
schools have passed their summer holidays in western and southern 
Europe, and have had a chance to study the elementary school in 
various countries. The section of the congress recognized the great 
educational value of teachers’ excursions, and advocated a further 
development of this highly useful work. 
The section further urged upon the Government the necessity of 
freeing the teachers from military service, on the ground that Rus- 
sia is very poor in intellectual social forces, and that every year 
12,000 teachers’ vacancies are left unfilled. The proposed reform 
would induce many young men to take up the teacher’s profession 
and, on the other hand, would save to the schools the years passed 
by the teachers in the army. Last, but not least, the section de-
-P-A-G-E-636
  608 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
manded a minimum salary of 600 rubles per annum for the teachers 
of elementary schools, the present salaries being often as low as 300 
‘to 400 rubles per annum. 
At the closing session, January 3, 1914, it was resolved‘to hold the 
next congress in 1915. The results of the congress satisfied the teach- 
ers; it is felt that the opinions and demands expressed by this body 
will undoubtedly affect the Government sooner or later. Moreover, 
the work of the congress excited the energy and spirit of the teach- 
ers and gave them many ideas helpful in their everyday tasks. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION, 
General features.—The prevailing type of secondary school in 
Russia is the eight or nine year school, comprising the period from 
9 or 10 to 18 to 22 years of age. It is generally preceded by a lower 
elementary school of three or four years. As a rule, the completion 
of the course of secondary school of this type leads to a maturity 
diploma which admits to institutions of university grade. 
The order of secondary schools described above comprises classical 
gymnasia, real schools, a number of technical schools, some agricul- 
tural schools, commercial schools, cadet corps, ete. 
Progymnasia and schools of similar grade have a course corre- 
sponding to the first four or six classes of the gymnasia and do not 
give diplomas of maturity. Recently a new type of secondary 
school, with a four or three year course corresponding to the last 
four classes of gymnasia or the last three classes of real schools has 
gained legislative sanction and is becoming increasingly popular. 
Gymnasia.—The classical gymnasia are divided, according to the 
degree of preponderance of Latin and Greek, into three types: 
(a) Old-type classical gymnasia. Both Latin and Greek are 
taught—Latin beginning with the first class and Greek with the 
third. 
(6) Reformed classical gymnasia created by the rescript of April 
30, 1905. Latin begins with the third class and Greek with the fifth, 
the corresponding time being utilized for natural science and law. 
(ec) Gymnasia with Latin only, established by the rescript of July 
20, 1902. 
The number of gymnasia in the Empire in 1912 was 393, with 
187,594 pupils and 10,500 teachers and employees. The number of 
progymnasia for the same year was 41, with 5,341 students and 553 
teachers and employees. 
The total expenditure for 1912 for gymnasia was 21,222,320 
rubles and for progymnasia 719,352 rubles, divided according to 
sources as follows:

The number of students who graduated from gymnasia with 
maturity diplomas in 1912 was 7,592. Of these, 97 per cent decided 
to enter higher institutions; nine-tenths of 1 per cent were devoting 
themselves to the study of fine arts, and eight-tenths of 1 per cent 
were engaged in practical occupations. Seventy-one gymnasia and 
one progymnasium had boarding departments accommodating 3,456 
students. There were 16,017 students boarding with private families. 
Gymnasium officials keep lists of private boarding houses, and regular 
inspection of such places is made by special inspectors. 
Real schools.—A majority of the Russian real schools are of the 
seven-class type, corresponding to the German “ Oberrealschule.” 
The ministry of public instruction is rapidly bringing the remain- 
ing six-class schools to the full seven-class type. In 1912 the num- 
ber of seven-class schools was 208, out of a total of 276. 
The total number of students for 1912 was 76,971. There were 
4,228 teachers and principals. The number of graduates who had 
completed six classes of real schools was 5,159; graduates who had 
completed the additional seventh class numbered 4,224. 
The expenditure for real schools in 1912 was 11,072,050 rubles, 
including 5,517,814 rubles, or 49.8 per cent, contributed by the State. 
Gymnasia and progymnasia for girls—The number of gymnasia 
for girls in 1912 was 825, and of progymnasia, 95. These schools are 
maintained almost entirely by private funds. In the total expendi- 
ture for 1912—22,158,258 rubles—the State contribution constituted 
only 1,778,300 rubles, or 8 per cent. The number of pupils was 
803,690, and of teachers, 16,658. The gymnasia for girls have only 
seven classes, but many have an additional eighth class, mostly peda- 
gogical. In 1912, 584 gymnasia had additional classes, and 13,754 
graduates had completed the pedagogical course. 
Technical schools——Secondary technical schools are intended to 
“supply native industries with assistants to engineers and superin- 
tendents of industrial plants and with persons able to direct the 
 
-P-A-G-E-638
    
610 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
work of laborers.” The number of such schools in 1912 was 57 
(exclusive of 2 private schools, in Warsaw and Odessa). Of this 
number, 30 schools were of secondary grade and 27 of primary 
grade. The total number of pupils in both grades of schools on 
January 1, 1913, was 10,321. The total expenditure for 1912 
amounted to 1,744,398 rubles (including State contributions, 884,791 
rubles) for secondary schools, and 744,044 rubles (including State 
contribution, 352,090 rubles) for primary schools. 
The secondary technical schools had the following divisions: Me- 
chanical, chemical, structural, mining, and agricultural. 
Recent reforms in secondary education—An important law per- 
taining to requirements for admission to higher institutions was 
adopted by the Duma in 1911. Previous to that time graduates of 
gymnasia were the only ones admitted to all higher institutions. 
Graduates of real schools and commercial schools of secondary grade 
could enter only higher technical schools. Graduates of other sec- 
ondary schools could not enter schools of higher learning unless they 
submitted to the complete final examination of a gymnasium and 
obtained certificates of maturity. 
As the number of various special secondary schools in Russia is 
considerable, the inferior position of their graduates in respect to 
university education was felt very keenly. The ministry had been 
authorized by a series of imperial orders to grant to individual 
schools certain rights pertaining to the admission of their graduates 
to universities and special higher institutions, and to determine the 
scope and character of partial examinations for graduates of those 
schools which failed to meet the standard requirements in a few 
subjects only. The ministry, however, made limited use of its au- 
thority, and graduates of many schools of secondary grade remained 
barred from higher education. The law of 1911 provided that grad- 
uates of real schools should be admitted to physico-mathematical 
faculties of universities without examination, and to other faculties 
with examination in Latin only. Graduates of theological seminaries 
of Russian Orthodox denomination, of cadet corps, commercial 
schools, eight-class technical schools, teachers’ institutes, and other 
secondary schools of the same grade were accorded rights of admis- 
sion to higher institutions, but examinations in certain subjects were 
required of the graduates of schools in which these subjects did not 
receive as much attention as in gymnasia or real schools. The form 
of these examinations was determined upon by the ministry of pub- 
lic instruction. The law specially provided that the graduates of 
cadet corps and commercial and technical schools should have the 
same rights of admission to higher institutions as graduates of real 
schools.
-P-A-G-E-639
  
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 611 
Another important law affecting secondary schools was adopted 
by the Duma in the same session as the foregoing. It was sanc- 
tioned by the Emperor on June 10, 1912, and is known as the “law on 
middle schools.” Its general purpose was to widen the field of 
private initiative in the establishment of secondary schools by re- 
moving certain restrictions in respect to types and programs of 
schools. 
It must be explained in this connection that all schools in Russia 
pertaining to the ministry of public instruction are subject to rigid 
statutes defining the procedure of their establishment, their organi- 
zation, curricula, and regulations of order, down to minutest details. 
The private founders, previous to the enactment of the law here 
considered, were allowed to contribute funds toward the establish- 
ment and maintenance of gymnasia and other schools, but these 
schools must be strict replicas of governmental schools of the cor- 
responding kind and were controlled by the ministry through its 
usual administrative channels in the same way as governmental 
schools. 
The report presented on this bill by the commission on gymnasia 
characterized the old legal status of private founders in the follow- 
ing words: 
This order of things, while having its convenient side, as it gives the staffs 
and the students of the said schools all the rights enjoyed by the staffs and 
students of the governmental schools, has nevertheless been restraining to the 
founders who, having contributed funds for the establishment and maintenance 
of secondary schools of general education, could not have any appreciable in- 
fluence upon the course of the school life and were not allowed to make any 
improvements for the benefit of the schools if the intended improvements did 
not fit the frame of the general statute provided for gymnasia and real schools. 
To give private founders and societies a voice in the management 
of the schools established by them, the new law provided that gym- 
nasia, progymnasia, and real schools maintained entirely or partly 
by private or association funds should be managed by councils of 
trustees composed of representatives of the said founders and repre- 
sentatives of the Government, the general tendency of the law being 
to give the first group of the members decisive voice in the matter of 
management of the schools. 
The law also provided that in addition to the existing types of -ec- 
ondary schools, gymnasia composed of the four higher classes and 
real schools composed of the three higher classes may be established. 
As this type of secondary school was new in Russia, the law contained 
detailed specifications in respect to programs, salaries of directors 
and teachers, rights of the founders, etc. 
In respect to ancient languages, the four-class gymnasia are iden- 
tical with the four higher classes of gymnasia with one ancient lan-   
 
-P-A-G-E-640
  
  612 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
guage (Latin). The three-class real schools correspond tc the fifth 
and sixth classes of real schools, plus an additional third year corre- 
sponding to the additional seventh year in full real schools. Parallel 
commercial classes existing in a number of real schools are excluded 
from the three-year school. 
. The budget of the new four-class gymnasia was fixed at the follow- 
ing figures: Maintenance of buildings, 2,000 rubles; director, 3,750 
rubles; 6 teachers, 7,875 rubles; gymnastics, singing, and games, 600 
rubles. 
The corresponding figures for the three-class real schools are as 
follows: Building maintenance, 1,500 rubles; 4 teachers, 6,300 rubles; 
gymnastics, singing, and games, 500 rubles. 
The founders of the new type of schools were allowed to introduce 
additional subjects not included in the prescribed programs, such as 
English, clay modeling, etc., and modify the prescribed number of 
weekly hours for other subjects, according to local or special require- 
ments, but subject to the approval of the curator of the district. 
Another important provision of the same law permitted the estab- 
lishment by private founders or societies of coeducational secondary 
schools. Thus the principle of coeducation has been admitted into 
secondary education after years of passionate debate. It will be of 
interest to American educators that in the debates in the Duma on 
the merits of coeducation the example set by the United States was 
quoted as conclusive evidence of the beneficial effects of the coeduca- 
tional system. Dr. E. P. Kovalevsky, prominent in the educational 
work of the Duma, during a debate on the subject, introduced an ex- 
tensive quotation from a report of Dr. W. T. Harris, former United 
States Commissioner of Education, bearing upon the ennobling 
effects on boys of association with girls of their age in the same 
schools. 
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. 
Organization —The administration of universities in Russia is 
regulated by the general statute (Ob8¢ij Ustav) which, after a series 
of modifications in 1804, 1835, and 1863, was finally enacted in 1884, 
and has undergone few changes since that time. Among the most 
important legislative acts of comparatively recent date should be 
mentioned the ukase of August 27, 1905, making the offices of the 
rector, the dean, and the secretaries of faculties elective and to be 
filled by university professors exclusively. 
The present organization of universities in Russia, while similar 
to that of German universities, presents many original features. 
Russia is divided into 15 educational districts with a curator at the 
head of each district, and the original scheme laid down by Emperor
-P-A-G-E-641
  
EDUCATION IN RUSSIA. 613 
Alexander I called for one university in each district. As it is, 
however, in six districts universities are still wanting. On account 
of the uneven development of different sections of the Empire, the 
distribution of universities by districts can not at present be carried 
out, but the original purpose explains the part played in university 
administration by the curator of the district. As an integral part 
of the educational system of a district, the university is subject to the 
control of the curator, who reports to the minister of public instruc- 
tion and to the Crown all important matters respecting the university 
in his district, decides in all questions which are not explicitly re- 
served to the minister, and confirms the decisions of the university 
council and the board of directors. 
The direct administration of the university is exercised by the 
university council and the board of directors, both presided over ex 
officio by the rector. The council has general executive power over 
the university, while the board of directors attends to the business 
affairs of the institution. The rector is elected by the council from 
the number of ordinary professors for the term of three years; his 
appointment must be confirmed by the Emperor. There is also an 
office of prorector, who keeps the register of students, apportions 
scholarships, subventions, etc. 
The universities enjoy certain privileges, such as importing books 
from abroad free of censure, publishing periodicals without previous 
censure, etc. 
The division of the teaching staff is essentially the same as in Ger- 
many. There are ordinary and extraordinary professors, privat- 
docents, lectors, ete. It must be observed, however, that the position 
of university professor in Russia has greater importance than else- 
where. In addition to ordinary teaching functions, professors are 
encouraged by the State to engage in scientific work, such as prepar- 
ing and translating scientific books, undertaking scientific researches 
and travels, and delivering public lectures on scientific subjects. 
They are often requested by the Government, scientific societies, 
universities, or zemstvos to make certain special investigations, 
to give their opinion in important matters, etc. The report of 
the minister for 1912 acknowledges the active participation of 
university professors in the work of Government commissions, such 
as the commission for investigation of Russian railroads, the com- 
’ mission of uniform tariffs between Russia and Finland, the confer- 
ence on governmental orders, etc. 
Detached university departments——In addition to the 10 universi- 
ties whose statistics are given on page 615, there are the following 
detached university departments:

The popular university is maintained entirely by private funds.

CHAPTER XXXIV. 
EDUCATION IN TURKEY. 
Of the numerous reforms whose urgency was recognized by the 
new Turkish Government following the change of régime in 1909, ' 
one of the most pressing was the creation of a comprehensive system 
of education organized in imitation of western systems. This reform 
was not, however, accomplished when the present war broke out and 
must await peaceful conditions for its fulfillment. It was recognized 
by the reform government that the undertaking would be one of 
extreme difficulty, not to be realized at once in the midst of troubled 
political conditions. : 
Nominally, compulsory school attendance has been in operation 
since 1840, but the law was not enforced. The latest enactment on the 
subject is the provisional law of October 6, 1913. Under this law all 
children from 7 to 16 years of age must attend public or private 
schools. Children of school age may also receive education at home, 
subject to certain tests. The State schools are under the direct 
control of the ministry of public instruction, which also exercises 
a general supervision over schools maintained by non-Moslem com- 
munities. 
The annual appropriation for public education in Turkey was 
$500,000 in 1878. During the last days of the old régime it reached 
the sum of $2,250,000. Immediately following the revolution the 
school appropriation was raised to $3,375,000, and in 1913 it 
amounted to nearly $5,000,000. According to the report of the 
Turkish ministry of public instruction, the number of State schools 
in the whole Turkish Empire in 1913 was 3,500, with 245,000 pupils. 
In this number there were included 400 schools for girls, with 
40,000 pupils. The total number of instructors was 6,900. 
One of the chief difficulties encountered by the Turkish educators 
in their efforts at reform is found in the Arabic characters still in 
use in the Turkish language. The old Arabic script is very difficult 
to learn, and little children must waste several years of their most 
precious school age in barely learning to read and write. To offset 
this disadvantage, Turkish reformers have proposed to introduce 
the Latin characters, which are perfectly adaptable to the Turkish 
speech. 
617
-P-A-G-E-646
  618 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
This reform has always found determined opponents in the Mo- 
hammedan teachers of writing (softas), whose economic interests 
are threatened by the proposed introduction of Latin characters. 
They exert a strong influence upon the common people, asserting that 
the Arabic characters are sacred, since they are the characters in 
which the Koran was written, and that the use of other characters 
would be an offense against the Mohammedan faith.* 
Besides the State schools, which are organized on modern princi- 
ples, there are also in Turkey a number of old religious schools called 
medressé, in which the main subjects of instruction are reading and 
writing, the Koran, and arithmetic. 
“There are schools of intermediate grade for boys from 11 to 16 
years of age. Training schools for teachers also exist, but their 
number is quite insufficient, especially in view of the new demand 
for teachers created by the recent extensions of public education. 
The total number of Turkish schools of all descriptions in the Em- 
pire is 36,230, with 1,331,200 pupils, or 1 to every 24 persons in the 
population. : 
FOREIGN SCHOOLS. 
The population of Turkey does not form a homogeneous whole, but 
comprises a number of different races and nationalities, among which 
the Turks themselves scarcely number two-thirds. The non-Turkish 
portion of the population may be divided into two groups: (1) Those 
nationalities that have been incorporated into the State organization, 
such as Arabs, Armenians, Greeks, Jews, etc.; and (2) Europeans 
and Americans who live in Turkey as foreign citizens and owe alle- 
giance to their respective Governments. The legal status of the 
latter group is contested ground since the abrogation by Turkey in 
1915 of the so-called exterritorial rights. None of the powers con- 
cerned acquiesced in this act, but representations that were about to 
take place were deferred owing to the entrance of Turkey into the 
European struggle shortly after the abrogation was declared. 
Almost all foreign groups in Turkey maintain their own schools, 
partly for the education of children of their nationalities and partly 
as places of European education for higher classes of the indigenous 
Turkish population. These foreign schools play an important rdle, 
not only as agencies of foreign influences, but also as factors in the 
cultural progress of the Turkish people. 
The Armenians have achieved notable success in their educational 
movement. Their school system already has a history of long devel- 
  
1In this connection the fact that the Koran is not written in Turkish, but in Arabic, 
is of interest. There is at present no Turkish translation of the Koran, although an 
English and a German translation have been available for a long time. Some of the 
ardent Turkish reformers believe that the cause of the Latin script would be greatly 
promoted if the Koran were translated into Turkish and printed in Latin characters.
-P-A-G-E-647
  
EDUCATION IN TURKEY. 619 
opment, and, while its metheds are not quite modern, it is perfectly 
well adapted to the needs of the Armenian population. It is sup- 
ported wholly by the Armenians themselves. In 1902 there were in 
Turkey (the city of Constantinople excepted) 800 Armenian schools, 
with 80,000 pupils and 2,100 teachers. Considering the number of 
Armenians in Turkey, which does not exceed 2,000,000, these figures 
show remarkable achievement in the educational field. The progress 
made by the Armenians is especially striking in the six Armenian 
vilayets, in which the Moslems form the majority of the population. 
In these the Armenians had, in 1902, 585 schools, with 52,000 pupils, 
while the number of Turkish schools was only 150, with 12,000 pupils. 
The Greeks in Turkey, according to data published by the Associa- 
tion d’Orient in Athens, have built up an efficient system of educa- 
tion. They have in Asia Minor 728 schools, with 120,000 pupils and 
2,200 teachers. 
The Jewish schools in Palestine—The number of Jews in Turkey 
was considerably decreased by the transfer of the greater part of 
Turkish territory in Europe to the several Balkan States in 1912-13. 
The present Jewish population in* European Turkey is estimated at 
80,000. 
The educational activity among the Jews in Turkish dominions is 
centered in Palestine, where the Jewish population has recently 
reached 100,000. Education in Palestine is supported by a number 
of Jewish societies, notably the Zionist Societies, the Alliance Is- 
raélite, located at Paris, the Hilfsversein der deutschen sats and 
the Anglo-Jewish Association. 
The schools of the Alliance Israelite are among the earliost Jewish 
schools in Palestine. In 1870 the alliance established an agricultural 
school near Jaffa. Between 1881 and 1906 it founded over a dozen 
schools in the cities of Jaffa, Jerusalem, Haifa, Safed, and Tiberias. 
The alliance has paid especial attention to training in handicrafts, 
and has founded a number of schools for this work. 
The Hilfsverein, an organization of German Jews, founded in 
1900, lays special stress on kindergartens, of which it has three in 
Jerusalem, three in Jaffa, and one each in Haifas, Safed, and 
Tiberias. It also maintains a teachers’ seminary and a commercial 
school at Jerusalem and a number of schools for boys and girls. 
The English Jews in 1880 founded a school under the name of 
Evalina de Rotschild. 
The schools maintained by the three organizations named are 
modern, the language of instruction being determined in each case 
by that of the controlling body. 
The Zionist Societies maintain an educational work which has 
attracted much attention. Their schools in Palestine are nationalis- 
tic and religious in character and employ the Hebrew as the language 
 
-P-A-G-E-648
  620 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
of instruction. Notable among these are the “colony schools” 
scattered among the Jewish farming settlements. There are about 
30 such schools, one in each settlement. Their program comprises 
the usual elementary subjects. as well as Arabic and in some settle- 
ments French. : : 
The Jews in Palestine have also two gymnasia, one at Jaffa and 
one at Jerusalem, both with full secondary curricula. The certifi- 
cates of the Jaffa gymnasium have been recognized by a number of 
universities in Europe. 
The Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts is devoted to the cultiva- 
tion of Jewish applied art. It gives instruction in carpet weaving, 
woodwork, and filigree work. 
As regards the strictly foreign schools maintained by Europeans 
and Americans, there were at the outbreak of the war 1,400 schools 
of this kind, of which 600 were French, 500 English, 200 Italian, 60 
Russian, and 25 German. 
The German schools.—A statement in the “ Neue Bahnen,” March 
number, 1916, may be regarded as authoritative as regards the Ger- 
man schools in Turkey. It places the number of elementary schools 
in Turkish Arnienia, with German language of instruction, at 32. 
These schools are conducted by the “ Deutsche Hilfsbund fiir christ- 
liches Liebeswerk im Orient,” which also maintains a teachers’ semi- 
nary at Mesereh. 
There is a German Oberrealschule at Constantinople, which has 
attached to it an elementary school, a girls’ school, a kindergarten, 
and commergial courses. The school gives instruction to 1,000 
pupils, of which number more than half are Turks, the remainder 
consisting of German, Austrian, and Swiss subjects. 
There are also German real schools in Smyrna, Jerusalem, Aleppo, 
and Bagdad, and higher elementary schools in Eskeshir (mainly for 
railroad employees), Adrianople, Adana, and Haidah-Pasha. 
The French schools, all closed by the Turkish authorities since the 
outbreak of the war, have played an important part in the establish- 
ment of French cultural influences in Turkey ; the fact that the French 
language has become the second language of Turkish educated classes 
and has gained predominance in railway traffic, trade, and almost all 
civilized relations is largely due to the activities of these schools. 
They were maintained by Catholic orders, namely, the Capuchins 
‘and Dominicans in Armenia and North Syria, the Augustinians in 
Anatolia, and the Jesuits in Syria. The closing of these schools was 
a consequence of the wave of repressions which came in the wake of 
the abrogation of exterritorial rights and was aggravated. by the 
entrance of Turkey into the European war. 
These repressions have also placed in danger the development of 
the American mission schools. According to the documents received
-P-A-G-E-649
    
EDUCATION IN TURKEY. 621 
by the office of the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign 
Missions, new official regulations have been issued under date of 
September 2, 1915, dealing with foreign schools. They are sum- 
marized as follows: 
Foreign communities, associations, and societies can not establish schools. 
Private individuals of foreign nationality may establish schools under the fol- 
lowing regulations: 
They must prove that the number of inhabitants of their nationality is suffi- 
cient to justify the opening of a school. 
Only those foreigners are allowed to establish schools whose native countries 
accord Ottoman subjects the right to establish schools. The premises selected 
for the school must not be larger than is necessary for the accommodation of 
the pupils. They must be located at proper distance from other schools and 
places of worship of the communities, so that the noise can not reach them. 
Mixed boarding schools are prohibited, with the exception of kindergartens. 
The Turkish language, history, and geography are obligatory in all the schools; 
at least four hours a week in the lower grades and two hours in the higher 
grades must be devoted to the Turkish language. Ottoman history and geogra- 
phy may be taught in languages other than Turkish. 
Schools established by Ottoman communities, associations, or individuals 
may not employ foreign directors or instructors without the authorization of 
the ministry of public instruction. 
All private schools are to be inspected by local Turkish officials and sanitary 
inspectors. 
No private school can be established without the permission of the Turkish 
authorities. A foreigner applying for the permission must state definitely the 
means of meeting the expenses of the school. Applications of foreigners may 
be rejected by the ministry without statement of the reasons therefor. 
After obtaining the permit the founder must designate, in a communication 
to local authorities, the person responsible for the conduct of the school and 
the intended location of the school building. This communication must be in , 
the form of a petition asking for the authorization to begin instruction. It 
must be accompanied by a detailed program of instruction and a copy of the 
school regulations; a list of textbooks to be used in the school; a list of pro- 
fessors, with detailed information concerning every person of the staff; a re- 
port of a physician and an architect in respect to sanitary and structural 
features of the school building, ete. 
When the director of the school is a foreigner, the opinion of the local au- 
thorities is presented to the ministry, together with the documents named, and 
the final permit can not be issued before the ministry gives its approval. 
In order to enlarge an existing school, an application must be made stating, 
among other points, by what means the additional constructions will be as- 
sured. No enlargements can be made without a permit. 
The new regulations also specify the conditions upon which pupils shall be 
admitted, examinations held, and certificates and diplomas awarded. They 
also comprise certain prescriptions in respect to school discipline. - All foreign 
schools are required to notify the local authorities of any extraordinary meas- 
ures taken and to furnish regular statistical reports. 
In respect to the foreign schools already established, the regulations contain 
the following provision: 
Private schools belonging to foreigners or foreign associations or societies 
which have not complied with the provisions of the regulations promulgated as 
a result of the abolition of the capitulations must, besides appointing a director

or directress, within three months proceed to obtain a permit or have their 
“firmans ”* registered. Otherwise these schools will be closed in conformity 
with article 129 of the General Regulations of Public Instruction and the pro- 
visions of the above law. 
The execution of these regulations, as far as they apply to American 
schools, has been three times postponed since their issue, the last post- 
ponement being until September, 1916. 
All the educational institutions.of the hostile belligerent nations 
have been closed and their property confiscated, according to the 
report of Robert College for 1914-15. 
AMERICAN COLLEGES. 
In January, 1914, a conference of American colleges took place in 
Smyrna, which incidentally resulted in bringing together statistics 
relating to all American colleges in Turkey. The following par- 
ticulars of this conference are derived from a report by Prof. Cass 
Arthur Reed, dean of the International College, Smyrna, Turkey. 
The conference, originally planned for Beirut, in April, 1918, but 
postponed on account of unfavorable political conditions, was pro- 
posed by Constantinople College, at the suggestion of Miss Grace 
Dodge, of New York, one of its trustees. Invitations were sent to the 
eight American colleges holding charters, as follows: Robert College, 
Constantinople; Syrian Protestant College, Beirut; Central Tur- 
key College, Aintab; Euphrates College, Harpout; Anatolia College, 
Marsovan; St. Paul’s Institute, Tarsus; Constantinople College, Con- 
stantinople; International College, Smyrna. 
The limitation of the conference to these colleges was primarily 
on the ground that they possessed charters. Each is controlled by a 
board of trustees duly incorporated in the United States and em- 
powered to conduct an educational institution. Moreover, these eight 
colleges form a group of institutions having similar aims and common 
problems. 
The questions discussed at the conference in Smyrna were prima- 
rily those having a direct bearing on the work of American colleges 
in Turkey. Among them were: The peculiar educational needs in 
Turkey; How can they best be served by the colleges; Religious life 
in the colleges; Ideal standardization of college curricula, courses, 
and degrees; Relation of the colleges to official standards; How far 
the American standards can influence the coming educational re- 
form; The educational outlook of the Turkish Empire. These sub- 
jects were all treated in carefully prepared papers and discussed at 
length by the delegates.   
1A decree issued by the Sultan of Turkey and signed by one of his ministers, generally 
in the character of a grant, patent, or license.
-P-A-G-E-651
  EDUCATION IN TURKEY, 623 
The colleges represented at the conference and a large number of 
secondary schools in Turkey have all been founded, and are admin- 
istered, as definitely Christian institutions. The donors whose gen- 
erosity has made possible their equipment, support, and endowment, 
have been actuated by the desire to offer to the youth of the Levant 
opportunities for Christian education. The founders and the lead- 
ers, as a rule, have been officially connected with the missions of the 
American board. 
The colleges are all organized on the same general plan, and offer 
preparatory and college courses leading to the bachelor’s degree in 
eight or nine years. Robert College is now also offering graduate 
instruction in a well-equipped and strongly manned graduate school 
of engineering. The Syrian Protestant College has long had 4 num- 
ber of professional schools, medicine, dentistry, commerce, pharmacy, 
and nursing. 
The necessity of the student’s giving a disproportionate amount of 
his time to language studies makes the satisfactory arrangement of 
the curriculum a difficult task. In the first place, every student must 
gain a mastery of English, the one common language, and the me- 
dium of instruction. French, perhaps still the most widely used 
European language in the Levant, though the use of English is on 
the increase, is also deemed necessary by most students. Then every 
student must have thorough training in both the modern and the 
classical forms of his native language, be it Turkish, Greek, Arme- 
nian, Arabic, or Bulgarian. Engineering students need German; 
those preparing for certain European and American universities 
must have Latin. In general, thorough proficiency in at least three 
languages is required of all candidates for graduation. 
In addition to the languages, instruction is offered in the usual 
secondary and college subjects: Mathematics, history, literature, 
natural sciences, political science, and philosophy. 
Increasingly the standards are approaching those of American col- 
leges, and graduates of the colleges have frequently proved their 
right to graduate standing in the best American universities. 
In all of the colleges a large percentage, and in some a large ma- 
jority, of the students are boarders. General dormitories, with beds 
for 15 to 85 students are the rule, rather than private rooms or suites, 
as in the colleges in America. Experience has proved that a much 
greater degree of surveillance is necessary for students in Turkey 
than in America. Some of the colleges have gymnasiums equal to 
those of American colleges, with athletic work in charge of trained 
directors. The American colleges have done much to introduce 
athletics into native schools. ‘
-P-A-G-E-652
  624 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
For many years there were few Moslem Turks in the American col- 
leges. Since the constitution of 1908, however, a considerable num- 
ber have enrolled, and their proportion is steadily increasing. 
The future of the American colleges in Turkey would seem to be 
assured. Fifty years ago, when Robert and Syrian Protestant Col- 
leges began their work, they were confessedly experiments. But the 
increase in the number of colleges and their enlarging constituency 
indicate that they are filling a real need in the Turkish Empire. 
Robert College, with permanent endowment funds approximating 
a million and three quarters dollars and real estate valued at nearly a 
‘million more, is as strong as many well-known colleges in America. 
Syrian Protestant College has a large plant and a substantial en- 
dowment. Constantinople and International Colleges, although 
without endowments, have demonstrated their ability to find friends 
able to supply them with splendid equipment and enlarged facilities, 
and their permanence seemed assured. The four colleges of the 
interior have small endowments but strong friends, who are deter- 
mined that their work shall go on. Five of the colleges receive 
annual grants from the D. Willis James Fund for Higher Educa- 
tional Work Abroad, administered by the American board, and all 
depend largely upon the tuitions paid by their students. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS. 
In 1913-14 Robert College, the oldest and the most renowned of 
the group, took possession of Anderson Hall and Henrietta Wash- 
burn Hall, the latest of the additions to its equipment, which were 
provided for by the extension scheme, involving half a million dol- 
lar, undertaken in 1910. 
Constantinople College, the American college for girls, has moved 
from Scutari to the heights of Arnaoutkey, just below Robert Col- 
lege, where a splendid group of buildings costing approximately ° 
three quarters of a million dollars has been erected. 
The International College at Smyrna celebrated on January 15, 
1914, the formal inauguration of its new campus and buildings lo- 
cated at the suburb of Paradise, just south of the city of Smyrna. 
Originally the institution was located in the Basmahane quarter of 
Smyrna, where it reached the maximum size possible in such limited 
quarters. Asa result of large gifts received in 1910-11 it was trans- 
ferred to the new location, where it occupies three large buildings 
and nearly a dozen smaller buildings. The amount already expended 
by the college for new grounds and buildings exceeds $150,000. 
Syrian Protestant College, at Beirut, has opened West Hall, a 
great social-center building modeled after the association type in 
the United States.
-P-A-G-E-653
    
EDUCATION IN TURKEY. 625 
Anatolia College, at Marsovan, boasts a new library building, and 
other interior colleges reported less extensive additions to their mate- 
rial equipment. 
The expenditure for new buildings of nearly a million and a half 
dollars within a few years in a small group of American colleges 
in a foreign country is in itself a significant fact. But in addition 
to the material equipment which has been placed at the disposal of 
these colleges, each one has considerably increased its faculty and 
strengthened its work in view of the new conditions brought about 
by the political changes in the Turkish Empire. 
According to advices received as this matter goes to press, Robert 
College and Constantinople College have continued their operations 
throughout the current year, notwithstanding the war. 
The following table shows in detail the distribution of students in 
the eight American colleges, by departments, and their status in 
respect to boarding and nationalities:

CHAPTER XXXV. 
MODERN EDUCATION IN BRITISH INDIA AND CHINA. 
BRITISH INDIA. 
The series of annual reports on education in India, which was 
started in 1914, as noted in the last annual Report of the Commis- 
sioner of Education, has been continued by the publication of the 
second number of the series, issued from the central education office 
at Delhi during the current year. In the introduction to this report, 
which has been received as this matter goes to press, attention is 
called to the fact that it deals with the year in which the effects of 
the European war were already felt on education in India. Financial 
stringency interrupted the imperial grants for education, measures 
for repressing the alien influences in the Empire became necessary, 
and the ranks of those engaged in educational work were depleted. 
Notwithstanding these difficulties, progress is reported in respect to 
nearly every department of education, which is largely due to the 
increased activity of the provincial governments. 
Among particulars of special interest brought out in this record 
is the increase in the number of girls attending public institutions; 
the establishment of a college for women in Madras, the third insti- 
tution of that kind in the Presidency; the provision of a residence 
for women students attending King George’s Medical College at 
Lucknow, in the United Provinces; and the increase in schools for 
instruction in domestic and feminine arts, especially in Burma. The 
Victoria School for Girls, in the Punjab, an outcome of private 
efforts, has been taken over by the Government and turned into a 
model institution in which the teaching of the lower classes is to 
proceed entirely on kindergarten and Montessori methods. 
The seven years closing with March 31, 1914, were marked by an 
increase of 1,343,000 pupils in public primary schools for boys. Dur- 
ing the current year the increase continued, though at a diminished 
rate. 
In the province of secondary education the scheme of medical 
inspection of schools sanctioned for Bombay has been maintained. 
In Burma schools and pupils have been brought under the inspection 
627 
 
-P-A-G-E-656
    628 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
of officers of the medical or sanitary department, and a similar 
inspection has been carried out in two districts of the northwest 
frontier province. This is one of the most important extensions of 
the education service thus far attempted. 
Attention should here be called to a change in the scope of the 
reports which makes it somewhat difficult to measure progress exactly. 
This change consists in excluding entirely from the tables statistics 
pertaining to schools in certain native states, so that the present vol- 
ume deals exclusively with education in the British provinces. 
The following table summarizes the statistics of public instruction 
for the year under review:

  The total male population of British India is 124,182,692, and the 
total female population 118,806,255. It appears, therefore, that the 
number of males under instruction in 1914-15 was 5 per cent of the 
total males, and the number of females under instruction was nine- 
tenths of 1 per cent of the total females. The enrollment in public 
institutions is 90 per cent of the total in all classes of institutions, 
and the enrollment in public primary schools is 73 per cent of the 
total enrollment.

MODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA. 
The spread of modern education in China continues, notwithstand- 
ing the political changes and foreign complications which have dis- 
turbed the country during the last year. From its enormous extent 
and population and the independence of the 18 Provinces in educa- 
tional matters, it is difficult to form a comprehensive idea of the 
movement which is gradually substituting the ideals and methods of 
modern education for the system which it is destined to replace. 
The endeavor made by President Yuan to centralize the control of 
education has had the effect of calling together in Peking conferences 
of the chief education authorities in the different Provinces, and thus 
a degree of unity as regards the provincial administrations and the 
classification of schools has been secured. No general census of the 
school population and of the number of schools established in the 
several Provinces has been published, and, therefore, available re- 
ports deal with individual Provinces. Several reports of this char- 
acter were summarized in. the Report of the Commissioner of Edu- 
cation for 1915, and through the efforts of American consuls in 
China who have collected and sifted educational data relative to their 
respective consular districts, the survey comprised in the previous 
report can be somewhat extended. 
Recent information has also been received relative to agencies 
that are having a powerful effect in exciting enthusiastic interest 
in the modern system and securing support for measures directed 
to the development of medical education and technical training, both 
of which concern the vital interests of the Republic.

    630 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
GENERAL AGENCIES. 
Chief’among the agencies referred to is the Young Men’s Christian 
Association, which is catrying on a work of propaganda in the most 
systematic manner. A national committee has been formed repre- 
senting all the Young Men’s Christian Associations of China. This 
committee, which has its headquarters at Shanghai, has established 
a lecture department organized in five divisions as follows: Educa- 
tion, science, visual instruction and science, health, and conservation. 
Each section is in charge of a secretary highly competent in his own 
specialties. The secretaries deliver lectures illustrated, as a rule, in 
the cities, and where the interest is sufficient they organize lecture 
institutes with the object of training selected men to become itinerant 
lecturers. By this means it is hoped in a short time to-reach every 
part of this vast country. The character of this work is indicated 
in the following extracts from a report to the Commissioner of Edu- 
cation on the educational campaign carried on in Shanghai by Mr. 
David Z. T. Yui, executive of the education division. 
This campaign was conducted under the joint auspices of the 
Educational Association of Kiangsu Province, the Shanghai Educa- 
tional Association, and the Shanghai Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tion. Two objects were proposed, first, to stir up a real interest in 
education among the people in Shanghai, and second, to organize a 
committee which would conserve the interest and thereby promote 
some much needed reforms in the city. The three associations named 
issued invitations to different classes of people to come to the four 
lectures given on the afternoons of January 3, 4, and 5 of the cur- 
rent year, with the result that a total attendance of 1,050 was secured. 
Subsequent lectures given in different parts of the city increased this 
attendance by 1,390 persons, including officials, educators, and in- 
dustrial and mercantile people. As to the effect of this campaign 
Mr. Yui says: 
The Shanghai campaign is marked by two special features. The first is the 
fact that in addition to the great interest and appreciation shown, 107 of those 
who attended the lectures were so deeply moved and strongly convinced that 
they voluntarily communicated with the three associations under whose 
auspices the lectures were given, requesting that these lectures be extended to 
other cities in China and that some ways and means should be provided to con- 
serve their results. Of the 107 communications, 52 were from educators and 
school-teachers, 33 from students, 4 from officials, and 18 from business men. 
The second feature is that the Kiangsu provincial government was so very much 
impressed by the usefulness and power of these lectures that plans were being 
formulated to request the Educational Association of Kiangsu Province and the 
lecture department to organize a lecturers’ institute in Shanghai during the 
month of April this year. ‘The object of the institute is to train about 30 men 
selected by the provincial government to become itinerant lecturers in Kiangsu.
-P-A-G-E-659
  
MODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA. 631 
About $15,000 will be set aside by the Government for training these men, for 
equipping them with lecture apparatus, and for traveling and lecturing from 
district to district during 1916. The lecture department will be asked to take 
charge of the institute. Courses on educational principles, city educational 
systems and administration, social service, social psychology, physical educa- 
tion, public health, etc., will be conducted. Invitations will be issued to the 
Provinces of Chili, Shantung, and Chekiang also to send delegates to the insti- 
tute. It is hoped that the proposed institute will be carried out and made a 
real success. The success of this year will doubtless inspire similar institutes 
to be held next year with delegates from perhaps a larger number of Provinces. 
The close of the campaign was marked by a teachers’ institute 
held in the University of Nanking under the direction of the Kiangsu 
primary school board. On this occasion Mr. Yui delivered a public 
address on present day educational problems in China and their 
solution, and also conducted a sectional conference. The total at- 
tendance was 635, mostly teachers. Campaigns have also been con- 
ducted by Mr. Yui at Tientsin, North Tungchow near Peking, and 
at Peking. Similar lecture itineraries have been undertaken by the 
executive secretaries of the other divisions and in every case with 
marked success. 
The office is also indebted to Mr. David Z. T. Yui for an account 
of the third meeting on medical terminology which was held in 
the building of the Educational Association of Kiangsu Province 
on February 12, current. The 31 delegates present represented— 
the China Medical Missionary Association, the Chinese National Medical Asso- 
ciation, the Medical-Pharmaceutical Association of China, medical schools and 
colleges in Kiangsu, the Medical-Pharmaceutical College of Chekiang, the 
Army Medical Department of the General of Chekiang, at Hangchow, the 
Chekiang Hospital, the Army Hospital of Foochow, the Medical-Pharmaceutical 
Association of Hangchow, and the Educational Association of Kiangsu Province. 
A number of letters were received from Chinese medical men in different parts 
of the country, and also in Japan, regretting their inability to attend the meet- 
ing and offering their greetings and some helpful suggestions on the question of 
medical terminology. 
These delegates reported the progress made by committees of their 
several associations appointed to standardize Chinese translations of 
medical terms with a view of securing the final recognition of the 
Chinese Government for terms sanctioned by the medical fraternity. 
As a result of the discussions before this body, important resolutions 
were adopted which provided, among other things, for the appoint- 
ment of a special terminology committee with authority to call a 
conference during the coming summer, at which time it was hoped the 
first manuscript of terms on anatomy would be completed. It was 
decided also that the headquarters of the Educational Association of 
Kiangsu Province should be the office of the several medical associa- 
tions united for this important work, and that the ministry of edu-
-P-A-G-E-660
  632 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
cation in Peking should be requested to send delegates to the forth- 
coming conference. Mr. Yui calls attention to the fact that— 
the question of translating medical terms into Chinese has been very vexatious 
and difficult. There has been much confusion and misunderstanding, as differ- 
ent men used different translations for the same terms in medical science. 
Medical missionaries in China and the Chinese medical men of the new school 
realize the importance of obtaining the best.Chinese for the medical terms, 
of standardizing them in a conference of medical associations in China, and of 
their being recognized and promulgated by the Chinese Government. 
In his opinion the steps already taken in this direction give 
promise of thorough work and final success. 
CLASSIFICATION OF SCHOOLS. 
Modern schools in China are classified on the basis of control as 
Government schools, that is, established by the central, provincial, 
or local authorities; mission schools; and private schools. As regards 
their scope, these schools are classified as elementary, middle or high 
schools, special schools, i. e., agricultural, technical, etc., and higher 
institutions. The mission schools are the pioneer agencies in this 
work, and, as a rule, are at the present time the best equipped in 
respect to teachers, material aids, and effective organization. The 
mission schools also enjoy the confidence of the official authorities 
and endeavor, as a rule, to conform to all official requirements. This 
general statement is subject to modifications, as will be seen by 
particulars here given for individual provinces. 
The American consul at Changsha, Mr. Nelson T. Johnson, has 
forwarded an important report on modern education in the Province 
of Hunan, from which the following information is derived: 
The Province of Hunan comprises a population estimated at from 
eighteen to twenty millions of people, being sixth in this respect in 
the country. Educational facilities adequate for 10 per cent of the 
population would comprise accommodation for two million students 
and an army of 40,000 teachers. When the new schools began, it is 
estimated that there were not a score of well-trained and qualified 
teachers available. The lack of funds (an ever present difficulty in 
China) and the friction between old and new ideas which was par- 
ticularly strong in this most conservative of the provinces presented 
almost insuperable obstacles to the new movement. In view of these 
early conditions the opinion is expressed that— 
great strides have been made with the result that one now meets with schools 
on every hand. Temples and public buildings have been turned into school- 
houses to meet the growing demand for a modern education, and we find Chinese 
private schools, Government schools, and foreign mission schools all working 
harmoniously toward the same goal.
-P-A-G-E-661
  
  MODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA. 633 
Changsha leads the province in education. Of the five normal 
schools, one is the high normal which prepares teachers for the mid- 
dle schools. The other four prepare their students to fill vacancies as 
teachers in the primary schools, both lower and higher primary. Tui- 
tion is free. The Chang Tsuen Middle School is the largest, with 
average annual attendance of 1,200 students; tuition free to Huna- 
nese. The High Technical School has an average annual attendance 
of from 800 to 900, the average age at entrance being 20 to 21 years. 
Its entrance requirements are high. It is fed from the graduates of 
the primary technical schools of the province. Subjects offered are 
civil engineering, architecture, railway and mining engineering, and 
chemistry; it has completely equipped laboratories. There are two 
commercial schools, with some 200 students each. In these schools 
most emphasis is laid on correspondence and bookkeeping. There is 
a railway school maintained by the Government with 600 students, 
a police school with 300 to 400 students. Girls’ schools lay great stress 
upon teaching domestic industries and Chinese language. 
The following table gives a general summary showing the state of 
education throughout the Province of Hunan for the school year 
1912-18:

covering the state of education throughout the province before and 
after the revolution, i. e., 1911.

        The statistics for 1912-13 include three higher institutions main-

students; 2,461 primary schools and 57 middle schools maintained  
-P-A-G-E-662
  
  634 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
by the provincial government, enrolling, respectively, 139,225 pupils, 
including 17,135 girls, and 9,789 pupils, including 2,212 girls. To 
the foregoing information the report of the consul adds the follow- 
ing, contributed by Rev. Brownell Gage, of the Yale Mission at 
Changsha. 
The Educational Directory of China for 1915 gives particulars 
relating to 14 Protestant missionary schools maintained at central 
points in the province. Four of these institutions, including the 
Yale College, are situated at Changsha. To this information the - 
consul adds: 
I have been unable to get complete figures covering schools maintained by 
the Catholic missions in this province. A member of the Franciscan mission 
has kindly furnished me with approximate statistics covering the schools main- 
tained by that mission. He informs’ me that their mission has about 43 schools 
all told, with about 1,500 boys and 300 girls in attendance. They have no 
high schools; nor does the curriculum follow that prescribed by the Chinese 
board of education. 
According to the statistics for 1912-13, the number of Chinese 
students in the modern schools of Hunan had reached a total of 
204,306, or about one-tenth the number for whom such provision is 
needed. 
The report from Hunan dwells upon the lack of proper textbooks 
as one of the chief obstacles to the spread of modern education in 
China. The efforts of the Government to supply this need are ably 
seconded by the Commercial Press (Ltd.), a Chinese publishing 
house, and the Chung Hwa Book Co., both located at Shanghai. 
These are said to be the only publishing houses supplying Chinese 
schools with textbooks in a large way. Mr. Fong Sec, the head of 
the English editorial department of the Commercial Press, on the 
subject of literal translations of foreign textbooks for use in China, 
says: 
In general the period for literal translation is past. We are now doing 
more and more compiling and original work, for only in this way can we 
make our books adapted to the needs of the people. Enormous improvement 
has been made in the contents of Chinese school books since the revolution. 
Chinese education is taking a practical trend, and textbooks on such subjects 
as manual training, farming, domestic science, physical training, etc., are mak- 
ing their appearance. The present tendency is to put out books in simple 
and clear Chinese. Our writers now recognize the fact that students of to-day 
can not spare the necessary time to acquire a high literary style. 
Under the regulations of the board of education the schools are 
only to use those textbooks which have received the approval of the 
board. The board of education does not issue textbooks, but it out- 
lines the courses of study for different grades of schools, and the 
publishing houses endeavor to prepare their textbooks in conformity
-P-A-G-E-663
  MODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA. 635 
with the regulations of the board. Many of the books of the Com- 
mercial Press have been approved of by the board. 
The conditions described in the report from Hunan are fairly 
typical of what is going on in the other principal provinces. This 
appears from numerous similar reports received from American 
consuls at other centers in China. Without multiplying details, it 
will be of interest to consider in particular the more noted institu- 
tions described in these reports, together with reference to organiza- 
tions that are moving for the closer coordination of the various 
agencies engaged in promoting modern education among the Chinese. 
It should be stated in this connection that all the schools here re- 
ferred to are intended for natives of the country. Schools for the 
foreign population, which exist wherever needed, are private in char- 
acter and do not come within the present consideration. 
Shanghai is noted as the seat of several high-grade modern institu- 
tions, including St. John’s University, Soochow University, the 
Shanghai Baptist College and Theological Seminary, all under pri- 
vate management, and two under Government control, namely, the 
Institute of Technology and the Nanyang College of Mining and 
Engineering. 
St. John’s University was incorporated in January, 1906, in the 
District of Columbia under an act of Congress, and by its charter is 
authorized to confer upon its graduates the degrees conferred by 
universities in the United States. 
In 1914, by the terms of an agreement between the trustees of the Pennsyl- 
vania Medical School, formerly of Canton, China, and the trustees of St. John’s 
University, Shanghai, the two schools were united under the title the Pennsyl- 
vania Medical School, being the medical department of St. John’s University. 
Universities of the United States generally admit graduates of St. 
John’s University having the bachelor’s degree into postgraduate 
and professional schools without examination. Those who have 
taken the course in the school of science have been admitted into the 
second or third year of technical schools (schools of mines; Sheffield 
Scientific School; Institute of Technology, Boston). It is hoped 
that the school of science of this institution will in time be developed 
into a well-equipped engineering school. 
With regard to the Nanyang Railway and Mining College, a report 
received from the American consul at Shanghai, Mr. Thomas Sam- 
mon, says: 
The college has been officially recognized by the board of communication at 
Peking, and therefore students graduated from our college have similar privi- 
leges as those from the Government institutes of this country. The college is 
practically a self-supported one, and it is run and managed by myself, with
-P-A-G-E-664
636 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
employed assistants. We have fairly complete equipments necessary for the 
courses assigned, but we have no workshops for electricity and engine. .The 
Shanghai municipal council, electricity department, and the management of the 
Shanghai-Nanking Railway have kindly granted concessions for our students to 
have practical experiments there when they take those subjects. With regard 
to qualifications and standards of our students, it has often been proved that 
they are equal in standard to those of the Government Institute of Technology, 
Shanghai, and the Tangshan Engineering College, Tientsin. Last fall a student 
from the sophomore year went to America. He successively passed the entrance 
examination and was admitted to join the sophomore year in the University of 
Colorado. 
Fukien is a comparatively small province, population 8,560,000. 
The capital, Foochow, is the seat of seven important mission schools 
providing higher education. In this city the Chinese Government 
has established a technical institution which is intended to draw 
students from the entire province. The curriculum provides for six 
courses of study, as follows: Electrical, civil, and mechanical engi- 
neering, chemistry, ceramics, and metal working. Each of these 
courses is organized in three grades; primary (8 years), middle (3 
years), and high (4 years). In the first two grades all instruction 
is in the Chinese language, excepting that the technical terms are 
expressed in English. In the higher grade courses the English lan- 
guage is used throughout. There are about 665 students in the 
school, which is supported partly by tuition fees and partly by Gov- 
ernment grant. No foreign teachers are employed, but the majority 
of the teachers are graduates from universities or high schools. The 
equipment of scientific apparatus is quite complete. 
Boone University, at Wuchang, Province of Hupeh, is maintained 
by the American Church Mission and is regarded as the leading insti- 
tution in central China. It has an extensive campus, fine buildings, 
and admirable equipment for the work of the several departments. 
These include (1) the school of arts and sciences, (2) the school of 
theology, (3) the school of medicine, and (4) the school of Chinese 
language and literature. In addition there is a Boone preparatory 
school, which offers a course of six years to fit students for the uni- 
versity. The teaching faculty is as follows: School of arts and 
sciences, 10 foreigners; school of theology, 6 foreigners; school of 
medicine, 6 foreigners; and the school of Chinese language and lit- 
erature, 10 Chinese. The teaching corps is made up of graduates 
of American universities and colleges or standard Chinese higher 
institutions of learning. The medical department has a practical 
union with the medical school of St. John’s University, Shanghai, 
and the Harvard Medical School of the same city, by which the 
students study for two years at Wuchang and go to one of these 
institutions for more advanced work. The total number of students 
is 333, of whom 275 are in the school department.  
-P-A-G-E-665
  
  MODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA. 637 
The Canton Christian College is located at the commercial, literary, 
and official metropolis of south China in the Province of Kwang- 
tung. The population of the province is 23,700,000 and of the city 
itself 1,500,000. This college antedates all efforts of the Chinese Goy- 
ernment at providing modern education, and is also the first institu- 
tion of its class established under mission auspices. Although it is 
the outcome of mission enterprise, it is nondenominational and de- 
pends for its support upon individuals who appreciate the opportuni- 
ties that it offers for influencing the development of this part of 
China. 
The institution is chartered under the regents of the University of 
the State of New York. It occupies a campus of 48 acres, on which 
six permanent buildings have already been erected, and possesses 
assets estimated at $200,000 and a yearly budget of about $25,000. 
It also enjoys the confidence of Chinese leaders, and its staff of 
instructors includes a large proportion of natives, many of them 
graduates of American colleges. 
The college courses are comprised in four groups, each arranged 
for three years. These groups of studies, supplemented when neces- 
sary by a working knowledge of French and German, furnish an 
adequate foundation for graduate studies in universities of America 
and Europe. They presuppose the completion of studies of the col- 
lege middle school or its equivalent. 
The college has recently taken measures for the establishment of 
an agricultural department, in which effort it has received substantial 
assistance from the Pennsylvania State College Young Men’s Chris- 
tian Association. Elementary education in agriculture has been 
introduced in the preparatory school, and experimental gardens for. 
observation and practice have been established on the college grounds. 
In regard to this development Dr. Edward A. Ross, of the Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin, who personally investigated the college and its 
opportunities, says: 
The proposed agricultural department in that noble institution, the Canton 
Christian College, may be of great service in bringing about, between our 
agriculture and that of China, a beneficial exchange of points of supe- 
Hionlive 26% * 
Nothing could be suggested more likely to convince the Chinese of our good 
will and to dispose them to listen to whatever we offer them in the way of 
moral or religious ideas. 
Tn all departments, including the preparatory school, 200 students 
were registered in 1915. 
Special interest attaches to the movement for providing medical 
training for young women which has already achieved definite re- 
sults in Canton. The Hackett Medical College for Women, the 
   
-P-A-G-E-666
  638 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
Turner Training School for Nurses, and the David Gregg Hospital 
for Women and Children are institutions owned by the board of 
foreign missions of the American Presbyterian Church and gov- 
erned by the Presbyterian mission of south China. The president 
and treasurer of the institutions is Dr. Martha Hackett, a graduate 
of Western College and of the Rush Medical College. A large pro- 
portion of her colleagues are also graduates of colleges and medical 
schools of the United States. The work is in its infancy and was 
seriously interrupted during the current year by the warlike condi- 
tions, but in May, current, the scattered students returned to the 
medical college and resumed their routine work. 
Among other institutions of special note must be mentioned Tsing 
Hua College, founded by the Government near Peking in 1909 with 
the proceeds of the Boxer indemnity claim, for the preparation of 
students to be sent at the Government’s expense to America, and 
which, therefore, has larger representation in the higher institutions 
of the United States than any other college in China. In accordance 
with the original provision, 80 per cent of the students sent to com- 
plete their studies in this, country must specialize in the industrial 
and technical arts. 
Peiyang University, located at Tientsin, is the leading institution 
of learning in north China, and, like the Peking Government Uni- 
versity, is under the direct control of the minister of education. 
Union Medical College in Peking has been taken over by the China 
medical board of the Rockefeller Foundation with the object of 
making it the leading institution of this kind in north China. 
In the Kiangsu Province modern education centers in three higher 
institutions, the University of Nanking, the Nanking School of 
Theology, and Ginling College. 
The University of Nanking is regularly incorporated under the 
laws of the State of New York, with a board of trustees resident in 
the States. Its local affairs are in the hands of a board of managers 
residing in China. The university has a well-organized collegiate 
department. Its examinations are recognized by the University of 
the State of New York, and that institution confers the degree of 
A. B. upon all graduates of the academic department. There is also 
a normal school in connection with the university which aims to sup- 
ply in part the lack of trained teachers in the lower schools to which 
reference was made in the preceding paragraphs. The medical de- 
partment of the university, only recently begun, has an excellent 
staff of foreign instructors, with some able Chinese assistants. There 
are good facilities for clinical work, but the equipment, owing to 
lack of funds, leaves much to be desired. This will, however, be 
gradually remedied as a larger income becomes available. The ex-
-P-A-G-E-667
  MODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA. 639 
aminations of the medical school are also to be recognized under the 
laws of the State of New York. The department of agriculture and 
forestry has been opened within the last three years. This course is 
designed to train men in the fundamentals of scientific agriculture 
and to give them such a knowledge of practical forestry as will be 
of service to them in the work of reforestation, which is so badly 
needed in China. It is significant of the quality of the work done 
in the university and of the confidence of the Government therein 
that the Bureau of Forestry has recently sent 40 of its students from 
Peking to Nanking to be trained there. Such cooperation is elo- 
quent testimony to the friendly feeling now existing between Chinese 
and foreigners. In addition to its other activities the university 
carries on a language school for new missionaries in China. This 
school applies the latest methods of phonetics to the study of Chi- 
nese, with a noticeable increase in both the accuracy and fluency 
with which newcomers begin to speak the language. 
For the academic year 1914-15 the university enrolled in all de- 
partments 507 students. 
The following list includes universities and higher technical schools 
of China from which reports have recently been received at this 
office. In the Government scheme of classification, which is gener- 
ally followed, the term university is applied to institutions that pro- 
vide both academic and professional courses of study. The higher 
technical schools are all specialized. As a rule, the institutions are 
named from the cities in which they are located, and they have been 
taken in geographical order from Peking on the north to Hongkong 
on the south.

CHINESE INDEMNITY STUDENTS. 
According to the Chinese educational mission, there were 345 
Chinese students in the United States in 1916 maintained from the 
indemnity fund. Colleges and universities enrolling 10 or more of 
these students were as follows: Cornell University, 27; Massachu-

sity of Michigan, 14; Harvard University, 18; Yale University, 11; 
University of Illinois, 16; University of Pennsylvania, 15; and Uni- 
versity of Chicago, 11. Four of the students were assigned to manu- 
facturing companies. The remainder were scattered through 77 
colleges and secondary schools. Of the total number of students, 25 
entered preparatory schools, 35. took academic courses in universities, 
and 93 were entered for various branches of engineering. The re-_ 
maining courses pursued by 10 or more students were as follows: 
Economics, 34; political science, 18; agriculture and chemistry, each 
15; medicine and pharmacy, 14; education, 14; and re 10.

CHAPTER XXXVI. 
EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. 
EDUCATION IN STATES OF AUSTRALIA. 
COMMON CHARACTERISTICS. 
The formal inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia took 
place January 1, 1901, coinciding with the opening of the twentieth 
century. By the terms of the federation the systems of public in- 
struction already established in the several States remained under 
their individual direction. New South Wales, the first colony in 
which settlements were made, naturally took the lead in providing 
schools and higher institutions, and although it has not been more 
active or more progressive in this respect than the other States, its 
influence has been greater because of its priority in time, and the 
main features of its educational administration have been generally 
adopted. 
In all the States the Government exercises large control over pri- 
mary education, and the expenditures, as a rule, are met from the 
public treasury. The chief officer of education, who bears the title of 
minister or secretary, is represented in each State by inspectors ap- 
pointed for special subjects or assigned to particular localities. Pro- 
vision is made in South Australia for local representation by means 
of boards of advice or district committees, who make recommenda- 
tions respecting the needs of their several communities. In Victoria 
the minister of education is assisted by an advisory council. 
Completeness of school provision —The classes of schools author- 
ized by law in the different States indicate the widely different con- 
ditions to which the schools must be adjusted. 
The typical school in all the States is called simply the public or 
State school. It must maintain a certain average enrollment and 
must be kept in session the full time. There are also provisional 
schools; that is, schools which may be kept open for the full time 
annually, but whose average enrollment is below the standard, and 
half-time schools in districts where the number of children is too 
small to justify the expense of a full-time school. In such cases a 
teacher is appointed for two or more districts and holds the school 
in each on alternate days or for a half session each day, according to 
641 
‘

the distance to be traveled. House-to-house schools have also been 
recognized as a temporary expedient. The plan of conveying chil- 
dren at public expense from isolated districts to a central school has 
been recently adopted and is gradually superseding that of special 
and half-time schools. 
Evening schools in several of the States and infant schools com- 
plete the public provision for popular education. 
Compulsory attendance.—Attendance upon school is compulsory 
for all children of legal school age (this varies in the several States) 
unless they are educated privately or exempted by law. 
Religious instruction —The schools are nonsectarian, but religious 
instruction is provided for in New South Wales, Western Australia, 
Queensland, and Tasmania. 
Extensions of public education—The upward extension of the 
public schools is the most noticeable feature of recent activities. 
This is shown by the establishment of advanced classes termed 
“superior” or “intermediate,” and also by the provision for free 
high schools giving complete secondary education. Until a com- 
paratively recent date this work was left to private agencies that 
were subsidized. 
Technical education is also fostered in all the States and technical 
schools or classes aided by public funds are found in all the chief 
cities. 
The Australian universities have been extensively aided by legis- 
lative appropriations and the University of South Australia by 
grants of land. These institutions are authorized to confer the same 
degrees as the universities in England, with the exception of degrees 
in divinity, and women are admitted to all their privileges: 
The progressive spirit of the education authorities is evident from 
the complete surveys of school population, the provision for practical 
training and recreative exercises, and the excellent systems of medical 
inspection maintained. The scone and character of these activities 
are indicated by the following statements drawn from current 
reports: 
The latest statistics of the publié schools of the several States are 
given in the comparative table in chapter 37 of this volume. The 
following statements relate to movements of special interest in the 
several States: 
NEW SOUTH WALES. 
EDUCATION ACTS. 
The system of public instruction in New South Wales is founded 
upon an act of 1866, which became operative January, 1867. This 
act made provision for a council of education, in which was vested 
authority over all the financial resources, lands, and buildings avail-
-P-A-G-E-671
  
- EDUCATION IN THE STATES OF AUSTRALIA. 643 
able for that service and extensive powers respecting the establish- 
ment and conduct of schools. Full recognition was given to denomi- 
national schools, and special features, such as provisional, half-time 
schools, itinerant teachers, etc., that have been adopted in all the 
States, were provided for under this early act. 
The public instruction act of 1880 transferred all the powers and 
authority of the council of education to a crown minister and pro- 
vided for the abandonment of subsidies to denominational schools 
and the establishment of an undenominational system; attendance at 
school for a minimum period of 70 ‘days in each half year was de- 
clared obligatory, and the following classes of schools were recog- 
nized: “Public schools, primary and superior; evening public 
schools; and high schools for girls and for boys; the conditions in 
regard to provisional schools and itinerant teachers, as contained in 
the Public Schools Act, 1866, were retained, but in amplified form.” 
The act of 1880 is in force at the present time, with amendments 
introduced by the free education act of 1906, which completed the 
effort to establish a system of public instruction up to the university 
standard. 
In this centralized system the Government inspectors bear a very 
important part, and the service is not only well organized in South 
Wales, but has been distinguished by the marked ability of the in- 
cumbents. The chief inspector is assisted by a staff, the members 
of which are assigned to particular areas. There are, in addition, 
special inspectors for different branches of the service, as secondary 
schools, continuation schools, etc. The recently organized technical 
department is in charge of a superintendent who is at once the 
director and inspector of the service.” 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION. 
As the result of a conference on the part of the representatives 
of different educational interests in the State, held in 1902, a royal 
commission was appointed “to proceed to Europe and America and 
investigate the existing systems of education in the leading coun- 
tries” with a view to such reforms and extensions of the system of 
New South Wales as might be deemed advisable. The recommenda- 
tions of this commission led to a second conference, convened by 
the minister of public instruction in 1904, for the purpose of con- 
" sidering measures for the development of the system. The resolutions 
adopted by this conference involved— 
the cessation of the pupil-teacher system, which had been operative in the 
public schools since 1852; the introduction of specially trained teachers, and 
for this purpose the equipment and maintenance of a normal school with a 
practice school attached; the formation of a kindergarten training college and 
of local training schools for country school teachers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-672
  644 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
The establishment of a chair of pedagogy at the University of 
Sydney, of truant schools, and schools for the feeble-minded were 
also urged. The last decade has been marked by progress toward 
the full realization of the measures thus advised. 
PRESENT CONDITIONS. 
The latest report of the minister of education, issued in 1915, per- 
tains to the operations of the previous year. The outstanding fea- 
tures of the educational work during that time were: 
1. The remarkable increase in school population. 
2. The extension of the scheme of school medical inspection to in- 
clude traveling hospitals and clinics. 
3. The continued expansion of secondary education. 
4. The establishment of trade schools. 
With regard to school population and school attendance, the re- 
port notes that there was an increase of 11,350 in the “ mean average 
quarterly attendance” at the primary schools. Of this increase, 5,941 
pupils, or 52.3 per cent of the total, were in attendance at “metro- 
politan” schools. This fact says the minister “ furnishes concrete evi- 
dence in support of the contention that the urban population of the 
State is increasing out of all proportion to the settlement of rural 
districts.” The same fact is indicated by the increased attendance 
at the larger country schools, which was equivalent to 41.5 per cent 
of the total increase. This leaves only the small number of 697 pupils 
as the increase in the country schools. With respect to this showing 
the minister says: 
If such movement continues it must increase the staffs of existing schools 
with a corresponding reduction in the proportion of “ one-teacher ” schools, One 
result of this will be to make the problem of attracting men teachers to the 
service less necessary of solution, since women teachers may more easily be 
employed as assistant teachers than as teachers in charge of small schools. 
The total attendance at all day schools during the year was 277,392 
(144,670 boys, 182,722 girls). The total enrollment was equivalent to 
14.4 per cent of the population. : 
The provision for universal education in this State is completed 
. by a special school for girls who need restraint and control, and a 
similar school for boys. In both these institutions the most advanced 
ideas of remedial training are employed. 
. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND GUIDANCE. 
As a result of the efforts to provide vocational training for young 
people who have just finished the primary grades, attention has been 
directed to the importance of guiding youth in the choice of a work- 
ing career. For this purpose an investigation was conducted in 1914 
 
-P-A-G-E-673
EDUCATION IN THE STATES OF AUSTRALIA. 645 
with a view of finding out what boys and girls who had just left the 
primary schools were doing. The inquiry related to 9,705 boys and 
8,364 girls, and with this information as a guide it was determined 
by the department to establish a boys’ employment bureau in the 
interests of boys who had gained either the certificate of a superior 
public school or an evening continuation school. This restriction, 
it was hoped, would induce boys to prolong their training beyond 
the very elementary course as it would enable the department to 
certify that the applicant had reached a definite standard in stated 
subjects and something of the aptitudes that he had displayed in the 
vocational training. The chamber of commerce and the chamber of 
manufacturers cooperated in the effort, and it was intended to extend 
the service as rapidly as results justified that course and eventually 
to make similar provision for girls. The war has interfered some- 
what with the progress of this helpful service. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION. 
The operations of the medical inspection service for the year 1914 
were marked by great activity and added provision “for treating 
physically defective children in those parts of the State where it is 
difficult or impossible for the children to obtain treatment otherwise.” 
With regard to the extent of the work, the principal medical officer 
says: 
During the year 94,198 children were medically examined. This easily 
constitutes a record for Australia. Although these figures represent less than 
one-third of the children to be examined, about three-fourths of the State 
had to be traversed to reach them, i. e., an area of considerably over 200,000 
square miles. The labor entailed in covering this vast area of country will 
be realized from the fact that on one occasion a medical officer spent three 
days in getting from one school to another, and had to sleep out in the open 
two nights, while another medical officer, in the course of his inspections, 
traveled 7,370 miles in seven and-a-half months (i. e., nearly 1,000 miles a 
month), and a half of this distance had to be traversed without the aid of 
a railway. The necessity for covering so much country during the year was 
due to the fact that it was decided to give precedence in the matter of inspec- 
tion to the children living in the most remote and sparsely populated parts 
of the country. This was done mainly because it was recognized that these 
children, living, as they do in many cases, far from resident doctors and den- 
tists, needed attention more urgently than those living in more favorably 
situated parts. 
During the year the minister approved of the establishment of the following 
schemes for treating school children— 
(1) A traveling hospital; 
(2) A traveling ophthalmic clinic; 
(3) A dental clinic in Sydney ; 
(4) A traveling dental clinic. 
Of these schemes, two—the traveling hospital and the traveling ophthalmic 
clinic—were started during 1914, while arrangements were completed whereby 
61355°—16——43 
   
-P-A-G-E-674
    646 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916, 
the metropolitan dental clinic and the traveling dental clinic would start at the 
beginning of 1915. 
The results of the medical inspection for 1914 are summarized as 
follows: 
All public schools inspected (exclusive of work bee aed by traveling hos- 
pital and ophthalmic clinic). 
  
  
  
  Total number of children examined 76, 323

Percentage number of children treated____. 
To the numbers given above of children treated must be added those treated 
by the traveling hospital and traveling ophthalmic clinic, viz, 2,558. 
      
    In concluding his report, the chief medical officer calls attention to 
the fact that this work is a highly specialized branch of medicine and 
should be intrusted only to persons who have had special training in 
hygiene and kindred subjects. He observes with much satisfaction 
that the Sydney University has been one of the first, if not the first, 
in the world to establish a special course for the training of can- 
didates for the school medical service. This branch of the university 
work was opened in the latter part of 1914. 
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
The importance of physical training is fully recognized, and spe- 
cial schools of instruction in this matter are maintained in various 
country districts, and special classes are held at convenient centers to 
qualify teachers for conducting physical exercises in the schools. 
This work is promoted by athletic associations organized among the 
older pupils and those who have passed through the schools. The 
teaching of swimming is regarded as a part of the ordinary school 
program and is conducted under strict regulations for safeguarding 
the health and life of the pupils. The rural camp school, which has 
been in successful operation over nine years, was discontinued on ac- 
count of the war, but it is intended to reopen the same in the future.

RELATION BETWEEN SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND THE TEACHERS’ COLLEGE. 
Until the year 1905 the teaching staff of the public schools was 
recruited by means of the pupil-teacher system. In that year a 
scheme was adopted under which prospective teachers received spe- 
cial training for their work after the completion of their own ele- 
mentary instruction. Some delay was experienced in effecting this 
change. A general training school, however, was established at 
Sydney with a one-year course, and shortly after a second school 
of the same character was provided for. In 1912 the Teachers’ 
College and Building Acts were passed, authorizing the construction 
and maintenance by the department of public instruction of a Teach- 
ers’ College within the campus of the University of Sydney. This 
institution has since been completed. 
When the high schools were reorganized in 1912, it was decided 
to make the school-leaving examination the standard of admission 
to the college. In this way the future teacher would pursue an unin- 
terrupted course of four years’ high-school work beyond the primary 
stage and then be eligible for the leaving examination which was 
accepted for admission to the Teachers’ College. For the present, 
however, it has been found desirable to admit students who have only 
received the lower qualification of the intermediate certificate granted 
by the high school at the end of two years’ study. 
SCOPE OF THE TEACHERS’ COLLEGE. 
Students admitted from the high schools to the Teachers’ College 
enter upon a two, three, or four years’ course, according to circum- 
stances, but it was found impossible to keep up in this way a sufficient 
supply of teachers for the rural schools, and therefore provision 
was made for short courses of training extending to 20 weeks or 
6 months. By holding two such sessions each year the college is 
able to train about 230 candidates for the smaller schools. Students 
are not admitted to the short course under 18 years of age, but in 
fact the average age is much higher, as many have been engaged in 
teaching or other work before their admission. Under the present 
arrangements, therefore, the course of the Teachers’ College com- 
prises the following divisions: 
(1) Short course of 20.to 30 weeks. Prepares teacher for small rural schools. 
(2) One-year course, open only to university graduates in arts or science. 
Prepares for secondary teaching, mainly in high schools. 
(3) Two-year course. Prepares either for infant or for primary-school work. 
(4) Third and fourth year courses. Allows of students completing the work 
for the arts or science degree, or of taking up some special group of 
subjects in order to qualify for superior public-school, continuation, or 
trade-school teaching.

QUEENSLAND. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The extension of public education in Queensland is exceedingly 
difficult, on account of certain characteristics of the country which 
are graphically set forth in the following statement: 
Queensland contains 670,500 square miles, a total population of 683,500, a 
primary school population between the ages of 5 and.15- of 140,000. Some of 
the cattle and sheep holdings contain nearly 3,000 square miles each, and some 
of the schools are a journey of not less than two weeks from the departmental 
base. The size of Queensland will perhaps be better understood when it is 
realized that the area is more than five times that of the British Isles, and is 
nearly as large as Germany, France, and Austria-Hungary combined. * * #* 
The extent of the territory involves much traveling on the part of some of 
the officials in the discharge of their duties; for example, the ophthalmic in- 
spector travels annually about 7,000 miles by train, motor car,-boat, and buggy.” 
SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
Education was one of the earliest matters which received the con- 
sideration of the Government, and the education act of 1860 pro- 
vided for a comprehensive system which was intended to bring all 
children within the same schools irrespective of social or denomina- 
tional distinctions. For this purpose liberal aid was granted by the 
legislature for the establishment and upkeep of schools in local 
districts.’ The amount of grant increased from time to time, and 
finally the amended act of 1912 abolished the local contributions 
entirely and placed the entire cost of education upon the State. 
The system developed under these favorable conditions is marked 
by the universally recognized elements of efficiency. School attend- 
ance is compulsory on every day upon which school is open. Effi- 
cient teachers are provided, and excellent school buildings. The 
most interesting features of the system, however, relate to expedients 
for reaching children in isolated districts who can not be brought 
to an organized school even by conveyance at public expense. This 
is accomplished by a “ system of traveling teachers, Saturday schools, 
week-end schools, house-to-house schools, part-time schools, and camp 
schools.” 
TRAVELING TEACHERS. 
With regard to traveling teachers, the publication considered says: 
There are 17 traveling teachers at present, and the number will be increased 
as soon as possible. Each teacher is supplied with a specially designed buggy, 
four to six horses, and a complete camping-out equipment. He has also 
the services of a boy of from 14 to 18 years of age to attend to the horses, help 
to pitch the tent, light the fire, lower slip rails, open gates, and do the numerous 
  
1 State Education in Queensland, by J. D. Story, Under-Secretary of Education.  
-P-A-G-E-677
    
EDUCATION IN THE STATES OF AUSTRALIA. 649 
little things which a handy youth can do. The teacher is expected to make his 
own arrangements for camping and food, and thus relieve parents of this re- 
sponsibility; he receives a special allowance from the department for the 
purpose. The motor car and motorcycle are also being tried as a quick means 
of locomotion; but, so far, owing to the nature of much of the country to be 
crossed—sandy tracts, heavy black-soil plains, timbered areas, hilly districts, 
treacherous billabongs, etc.—the motor car has not been an unqualified success 
particularly in the rainy seasons. The department is anxiously waiting the 
perfection of aeroplanes; the transit difficulties will then be reduced to a 
minimum, and sand and black soil and hills and torrential streams shall 
trouble us no more. * * * 
The traveling teacher is the handy man of the service. He must be a good 
pushman, and he must be tactful, so as to gain the good will of parents and of 
owners whose lands he must cross. He should also be of kindly disposition, 
so as to win the confidence of shy bush children; should be of trustworthy char- 
acter, for his work can seldom be inspected, as his duties take him to hqmes 
which are far away from the beaten tracks and which can often be reached 
only through lonely country patrolled by police in search of cattle duffers or of 
newchums who are lost; and, further, he must be a man of infinite resource, 
for he must be able to splice a broken pole, mend a wheel, doctor a sick horse, 
and, if threatened by fire or flood, be able to extricate himself and his boy 
and save His Majesty’s property. It says much for the capabilities of the 
teachers—and perhaps a little for the department in its judicious selection of 
men—that during the whole period of the system not one life has been lost, 
and not one very serious accident has occurred (1901 to 1915). * * * 
The traveling teacher is expected to visit each family in his district at least 
four times a year; he stays as long as possible at each visit; teaches the chil- 
dren; revises the work, written or otherwise, which has been done since his 
last visit; outlines the work which is’to be done before his return; cheers; re- 
proves; and passes on. * * * Each teacher is provided with a plentiful 
supply of the departmental school papers and with a large number of school 
library books for boys and girls which the British publishers now produce; 
those papers are given and the books lent to the children and parents, and in 
this way a supply of cheap and wholesome literature is kept circulating 
through these lonely homes. Needless to say, the papers and books are read 
with avidity by all. 
We do not pretend to produce university graduates under this system, but 
we are teaching these children to read, to write, and to count. And what a 
tower of strength the lads will be in the defense of their country. They can 
ride well, can shoot straight, are skilled in bush lore, can find their way in 
strange country as unerringly as a homing pigeon, and they know not fear. 
In 1913 the number of families visited was 846, and the number of children 
instructed was 1,893; the cost per pupil instructed was £3 11s. 4d. 
SPECIAL SCHOOLS, 
The Saturday and week end schools, like the itinerant teachers, 
are a temporary expedient in the interests of small groups of from 
four to eight children living some miles from the nearest full-time 
schools. As the children are visited in this case once a week, their 
progress is naturally faster than those who depend entirely upon 
the itinerant teachers.
-P-A-G-E-678
  650 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
The camp schools are intended to meet the necessities of the chil- 
dren of men employed in the construction ‘of the railways, which 
at the present time is vigorously pushed in Queensland. When the 
camp moves on, the portable school is packed on the railway truck 
and transported to the next stage and school work is resumed. 
Wherever possible, children remote from the ordinary schools are 
conveyed to them at public expense. 
VICTORIA. 
PROBLEM OF SMALL SCHOOLS. 
The latest report of the minister of public instruction discusses 
several problems of interest to the education authorities of all 
countries. Among these problems may be noted the status of small 
rural schools and the retardation of pupils. With regard to small 
schools in the Province the minister says: 
Of the 2,174 day schools in operation, not fewer than 732 are maintained 
for an average attendance of 20 pupils or less. The expenditure per pupil in 
small schools is thus very heavy, amounting, in some cases, to as much as £11 
($55) per child for expenses of instruction alone. Women head teachers of 
the sixth, or lowest, class are now receiving salaries from £110 ($550) 
minimum to £130 ($650) maximum per annum; and men teachers of this class 
salaries from £120 ($600) minimum to £200 ($1,000) maximum. This heavy 
expenditure is, however, an inevitable accompaniment of educational work in 
a new country, and the community as a whole will not grudge any reasonable 
expense incurred in bringing to the doors of pioneer settlers in the remoter 
parts of the State adequate educational facilities for their children. One of 
the best results of a centralized system of national education is shown in the 
provision of good schools for sparsely settled districts, districts which under a 
system of local taxation and control would probably be unable to provide 
schooling of the same character. 
DISTRIBUTION OF PUPILS BY GRADE, 
The primary schools of Victoria are classified in eight grades, 
each grade corresponding to one year. As the period of compulsory 
school attendance covers the ages 6 to 14, inclusive, it is easy to deter- 
mine the age for each grade. This system of classification, author- 
ized by the education act of 1910, has been fully carried out and 
furnishes a basis for a study of grade enrollment as compared with 
age, which is believed to be the only attempt thus far to determine 
the facts for a complete system of elementary education. The data 
for the year 1915 are comprised in an age-grade table, from which it 
appears that of the total pupils, 185,108, there were in normal classi- 
fication 63.9 per cent; in subnormal classification, 22.2 per cent. The 
remainder, 13.8 per cent, comprised the brighter children whose 
classification was above normal,
-P-A-G-E-679
  
EDUCATION IN THE STATES OF AUSTRALIA. 651 
RETARDATION OF PUPILS. 
The analysis of the age-grade statistics brings into clear view the 
facts with reference to retardation, a subject which is attracting at- 
tention throughout the world. The results of the analysis are sum- 
marized in the report as follows: 
If the column for children aged 10 years is taken, we find that, of the 21,457 
of this age, 4,515 are retarded, 15,330 are of normal classification, and 1,612 
are above normal classification. The retardation of pupils of this age amounts 
to 21 per cent. Similarly, the retardation of children aged 11 years amounts 
to 29 per cent. At 12 years the retardation amounts to 42 per cent, and at 13 
years to nearly 57 per cent. 
Briefly the following information is afforded by the table: 
(a) That 22.2 per cent, or more than one-fifth of the total number of the 
pupils in attendance at the elementary schools in 1914, were below 
the normal classification. This percentage indicates the amount. of 
retardation; that is, the number of old and backward pupils in 
early grades. x 
(bo) That the age range in every grade, especially in Grades I, II, and 
III, is very wide. The probability is that the old children in these 
grades are distinctly subnormal in intelligence. 
(c) That there is steady increase in the rate of retardation, reaching a 
maximum in Grade VI. 
(d) That only 10 per cent of the total enrollment of pupils for 1914 was 
in Grade VII and Grade VIII combined. It must, however, be 
noted that at least 5,000 pupils who would otherwise have been in 
those grades have transferred to high schools, junior technical 
schools, registered schools, and other educational institutions, and 
that the majority of those who were exempted from the compulsory 
provisions of the act by the minister on account of the poverty 
of their parents would also have been in Grades VII or VIII had 
they remained at school until they were 14 years of age. Includ- 
ing the enrollment of Grade VI with that of Grades VII and 
VIII combined, we find that 78 per cent of the enrollment was in 
the first five grades. The enrollment in Grade I was 21 per cent, 
and in Grade II 12 per cent of the total. The high percentage 
of enrollment in Grade I indicates that many pupils repeated the 
grade; that is, spent a second year in it. The comparatively low 
percentage in Grade II is partly accounted for by the fact that 
many pupils were detained too long in Grade I, and did not, on 
promotion, pass into Grade II, but were transferred to Grade III. 
(e) Although, as stated under (c) above, there is a steady increase in 
the rate of retardation, reaching a maximum in Grade VI, the 
retardation for children two or more years below the normal classi- 
fication for their age reaches a maximum in Grades IV and V. 
These results are in general agreement with the conclusions of 
the medical officers and strengthen the view they have urged that 
physical defects become most apparent in the grades mentioned, 
and those which are remediable—for example, defective vision— 
are either remedied before the children pass on to the higher 
grades, or these backward children are eliminated from school with- 
out reaching the higher grades.  
-P-A-G-E-680
  652 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
(f) The rate of retardation for children 10 years of age and upward is 
very significant, and is only partly accounted for by the fact that 
many bright children leave the elementary school and enter the 
high school at about the age of 12 years. The figures show con- 
clusively that the lower and middle grades are congested, and that 
only a comparatively small percentage of the children in attend- 
ance. at the elementary schools have any hope of reaching the 
highest grade before they leave. 
Of the entire number of children enrolled, 3,590, or nearly 2 per 
cent, were three or more years behind the normal age classification. 
With respect to this class the report says: 
This excessive retardation reaches its maximum in Grades IV and V. Ex- 
clusive of these, there were 9,828 children, or over 5} per cent, two years be- 
hind the normal classification for their age.. These cases also reach a maximum 
in Grades IV and V. 
Of the children who are three or more years behind the normal classification 
for their age, the majority are probably mentally defective. Those who are two 
years behind may be classed as very backward, and those one year behind as 
backward. 
The measures employed to discover the extent of retardation in 
each school with a view to its reduction are as follows: 
Twice each year, the head teacher of every school in the State fills in a 
return very similar to the table showing the distribution of the enrollment. 
The two returns show the distribution, in January and July of each year, of 
the pupils in the grades of the school according to age. At the foot of each 
return, the head teacher classifies the cause of retardation under the following 
heads: 
(a) Commencing school life late, namely, after 6 years of age. 
(bv) Irregular attendance of pupil. 
(c) Dullness of pupil. 
(d) Physical incapacity of pupil, due to delicate health, overwork at home, 
dairying operations, selling papers, long walks to and from school, etc. 
(e) Transfer of pupils from school to school. 
(f) Slow progress through any grade or section of the school. 
(g) The absence of any system providing for promotions at other than yearly 
intervals. 
(h) Crowded state of the schoolrooms, disturbance of school staff, or other 
unfavorable conditions. 
When the inspector visits a school during the second half of the year he 
discusses with the teacher the extent of the retardation and its causes, and 
advises upon the adoption of suitable measures to reduce retardation to a mini- 
mum. From returns received during the second half of 1914, it was apparent 
that many teachers are making earnest effort to expedite the progress of old 
and backward pupils. In their zeal, some of these teachers have, however, 
fallen into the error of over classification, and, in some cases, the improve- 
ment has been only apparent. The amount of retardation in the schools is of 
gradual accumulation, and can not be remedied immediately. It can never 
wholly disappear, for in only the ideal school can it be be supposed that children 
will all begin school not later than six years of age, that all will attend regu- 
larly, that the physical and metal ability of all will be the same, and that all
-P-A-G-E-681
  
EDUCATION IN THE STATES OF AUSTRALIA. 653 
factors making for retardation will cease to act. Still, much can be done to 
lessen the amount of retardation, and, in order to deal with the causes so far 
as they can be dealt with in the schools, a committee was appointed in 1913 
to report, with recommendations, upon the organization of the larger elementary 
schools. The committee consisted of two senior inspectors and seven teachers 
nominated at a largely attended meeting of metropolitan head teachers and 
senior assistants. Having made a closs investigation of systems of organiza- 
tion in operation in several schools throughout the State, the committee adopted 
a series of recommendations. These recommendation were discussed in detail 
at two large meetings of metropolitan teachers. Although there were differences 
of opinion upon minor matters, it was clear that the committee's report reflected 
the general opinion of the teachers present. 
The recommendations of the committee were made the basis of a circular of 
information which was issued for the guidance of teachers in August; 1914. 
Among other matters, the following important questions of school organiza- 
tion were discussed at some length in the circular of information: . 
1. An allotment of duties and responsibility among the assistants, propor- 
tionate to their classification, skill, and“ experience. 
2. Cooperation of effort on the part of the head teacher and assistants, so 
that their full teaching strength might be brought to bear upon the work 
of the school as a whole. 
8. The adoption of a method of closer grading (within the grade or class) 
and provision at regular intervals for the free promotion to a higher 
grade of pupils who failed to secure promotion at.the end of the school 
year. 
4, Some special provision to meet the needs of retarded pupils. 
5. Continuity of organization to provide for the systematic development of 
the teaching of each subject. 
The causes of retardation external to the school present special 
difficulties, which can not be corrected by the school authorities alone, 
although they may contribute in various ways to reduce them. These 
causes as classified in the report are: 
  (a@) Commencing school life late; that is, after 6 years of age. 
(b) Irregularity in attendance of pupils. 
(c) Dullness of pupils. 
(d) Physical incapacity of pupils, due to delicate health, overwork at home, 
dairying operations, selling papers, etc. 
(e) Transfer of pupils from school to school. 
The causes marked (¢) and (d) are closely related to the problem 
of the social welfare of the children, and therefore are matters of 
particular concern to the medical inspectors. Experience shows that 
the advice of these experts is often followed by parents, especially 
when the backwardness of the children is attributed to underfeeding 
or overwork. It is stated, however, that a very large percentage of 
the parents—about one-third—remain indifferent to the advice thus 
freely given. 
Tt is an encouraging fact that nearly 78 per cent of all the children 
enrolled in the public schools of Victoria in 1914 were either in nor- 
mal or above normal classification. The minister calls attention to  
-P-A-G-E-682
, 
  654 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
this fact as indicating that the requirements of the course of study 
are reasonable and well adapted to the majority of the pupils. He 
recognizes, however, that there should be adaptation of the school 
programs to the needs of backward children, and advises in their 
interests that there should be “ greater elasticity in organization, the 
segregation into special classes of the backward pupils, and a modi- 
fied curriculum giving prominence to manual work.” 
COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
In connection with the study of retardation, attention is called in 
the report of the minister to the compulsory clause of the education 
act of 1910, which is much more stringent than that of the act it 
displaced. It requires “that every child must, unless there is a 
reasonable excuse, attend school during each meeting that the school 
is held. In order to obviate hardship, truant officers have been in- 
structed to exercise care and tact in dealing with cases of nonattend- 
ance.” The number of prosecutions during 1915 was 7,480 and the 
number of convictions obtained 6,339. 
The statistics of average attendance offer satisfactory proof of the 
effect of this law. The ratio of average attendance to enrollment 
reached 733% per cent, the highest ever recorded. 
SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA. 
South Australia and Western Australia have been specially active 
in bringing high-school opportunities within the reach of children 
outside the urban centers. In South Australia 24 district high 
schools, including the one at Adelaide, were in operation in 1914; 
these schools enrolled 2,569 pupils and employed 90 teachers. The 
high school at Adelaide was attended by 749 pupils, or more than 
one-third of the total, and had a staff of 27 teachers, a little less than - 
one-third the total high-school teachers. Of the entire enrollment at 
the Adelaide school, 161 were junior teachers, 209 were studying for 
the university public examinations, and 115 were entered in the com- 
mercial course. The high schools throughout this State have become 
an important source for the recruitment of the teaching service. 
Three of the district high schools serve as domestic-science centers in 
which girls from either the primary or high-school grade receive 
special instruction, and also teachers who are fitting themselves for 
this branch. The most important of these centers is at Norwood, 
which by arrangements with the school of mines is able to offer 
unusual facilities for instruction in chemistry. 
A school for mothers is maintained at Norwood, which cooperates 
also with the domestic-science center in maintaining an infant-care 
course for the pupils of the latter.
-P-A-G-E-683
    
EDUCATION IN THE STATES OF AUSTRALIA. 655 
In Western Australia the experiment of a modern or nonclassical 
high school was started at Perth in 1911. Pupils are admitted at 
about the age of 13 years; the first two years of the course are com- 
mon to all pupils, but in the last two years specialization takes place 
according to the requirements of the students. Parallel courses are 
maintained for teachers, agriculturists, and those who look forward 
to scientific or business careers. Provision is also made for teaching 
domestic economy to girls. The school at present provides for 400 
pupils. Continuation classes are held at many centers in different 
parts of the State. These provide free tuition for pupils who have 
passed the upper limit of compulsory school attendance, namely, 14 
years. Admission to the classes is free, but pupils must attend at 
least three evenings in a week 
MILITARY TRAINING, 
In accordance with the system of military defense for the Com- 
monwealth of Australia, regulated by Defense Acts of 1903 and 
subsequent acts, universal military training was established in 1910 
for all the male population 18 to 20 years of age. 
Youths from 12 to 14 years of age are trained in junior cadet 
corps for a period of 90 hours annually; youths from 14 to 18 
years of age, in senior cadet corps 64 hours annually. The follow- 
ing statistics relate to the training of cadets from the period Octo- 
ber 1, 1911, to December 31, 1918:

It is of interest to note that of 72,387 junior cadets medically exam- 
ined only 2.3 per cent were found unfit for the training; of 123,469 
senior cadets examined, 11.5 per cent were medically unfit. In 1918, 
in response to requests by the education departments of the several 
States, a special course of instruction for women teachers was held 
in order that they in turn might be prepared to extend the system 
of physical training to girls. In these classes lectures on anatomy 
and first aid were given by medical officers. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Provision for technical education in Australia was started by 
private efforts, which resulted in the establishment of a mining 
school at Ballarat, Victoria, in 1870. An effort to organize technical 
   
-P-A-G-E-684
  656 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
education was made in New South Wales in 1883 by the appoint- 
ment of a technical education board. After six years’ operation the 
board was dissolved and its functions transferred to the public- 
instruction department. Technical classes were started at Sydney, 
and these developed into the technical college which was opened for 
the reception of students early in 1892, and is at present a highly 
developed and comprehensive technical institution. 
Measures were adopted in 1914 for coordinating the various agen- 
cies for technical education throughout the State. The trade schools, 
of which several had been established, were made the subject of strict 
regulations as regards the conditions of admission, and close rela- 
tions were established between them and outside shops, so that boys 
in the trade schools may get practical acquaintance with the condi- 
tions of work while they are studying. At the same time the trade 
schools were linked up to the technical college, and this in turn was 
brought into relation with the university by the acceptance on the 
part of the latter of the diploma course in science and engineering at 
the technical college. There is, therefore, now complete coordina- 
tion between the primary school, the trade school, the technical 
college, and Sydney University. 
The example of New South Wales in centralizing the control of 
technical schools was followed by Queensland in 1905, in which year 
the interest was vested in the education deaprtment. According to 
current reports, this State has 16 technical colleges, of which 3 are 
under the direct control of the department, the remainder being man- 
aged by committees under central supervision. 
As a result of the report of the royal commission on technical 
education appointed by the Government of Victoria in 1899, measures 
were taken to organize technical schools in that State, under the local 
councils, which receive grants for that purpose from the education 
department. By the education act of 1910, provision was made for 
placing such schools under departmental control. Agricultural and 
district high schools have been established which are intended to 
form a link between the ordinary public schools and the technical 
schools. Of the latter, 20 receive State aid. Three of these schools 
afford instruction in science, art, and trade; five of the number confine 
their teaching to art, and the remainder specialize chiefly in trade 
subjects. The largest technical institution in Victoria is the Work- 
ingmen’s College, at Melbourne, founded in 1887. This college, in 
addition to giving instruction in a large number of technical subjects, 
is also a school of mines. 
South Australia has an important school of mines and industries 
founded in 1889 at Adelaide. There are similar schools at four other 
centers. In this State, while the Government bears the bulk of the
-P-A-G-E-685
    
EDUCATION IN THE STATES OF AUSTRALIA. 657 
cost of maintenance, the organization and conduct of the technical 
schools are left to local councils. This arrangement is not satisfac- 
tory, and there is general support for the proposition to bring all 
schools of this class under one central authority. 
Western Australia has a special director of technical education. 
The most important institution under his charge is the technical 
school which was opened at Perth in 1900 and which has been 
recently enlarged and remodeled. Branch institutions have been 
established at 14 other centers, all of which are under the control 
of the education department, as is also the school of mines, at Kal- 
goorlie. The Perth school gives the full course required by the 
University of Adelaide for the degree of bachelor of science. 
The most important technical institution in Tasmania is the school 
of mines and metallurgy at Zeehan, which is affiliated to the Uni- 
versity of Tasmania. There are also three other schools of mining 
and metallury, all under the control of the education department. 
UNIVERSITIES, 
The following survey of the universities of Australia is derived 
from a recent official statement :* 
University education in Australia has followed the lines of British develop- 
ment. The State universities of to-day resemble in many respects the great 
English provincial Universities of Manchester and Birmingham. The degrees 
are, by royal letters patent, declared of equal status with those of any other 
university in the Empire. There are no tests of any kind, save those of merit 
and capacity. They are secular, in so far as no instruction in theology is given 
or theological degrees granted. Women students are admitted and can proceed 
to degrees. They are all national universities, in great measure supported by 
Parliamentary grants, and the State is represented, directly and indirectly, on 
the governing councils. 
The six Australian: universities vary considerably in size, financial endow- 
ment, and complexity of organization. Sydney (found 1850) and Melbourne 
(1853) are the oldest and largest. In the years in which these universities 
began operations the respective State populations were only 266,900 and 
347,307. When the University of South Australia began work in 1876 the 
State population was slightly over 210,000. The estimated population of Tas- 
mania in 1890, when the university was founded, was only 144,787. The two 
remaining universities were not founded until within the last year or two. 
Queensland University was formally opened in 1911; State population, 622,129. 
The University of Western Australia began work a year later; State popula- 
tion (1911), 294,181. The delay in the establishment of universities in the 
northern and western States was due in the latter case to slow national devel- 
opment (the population of Western Australia in 1890 was still under 50,000) ; 
in the former case to a prolonged period of financial depression.

British Association for the Advancement of Science, held in Australia, August, 1914. 
 
-P-A-G-E-686
  658 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
The organization of the universities is on familiar British lines. The 
governing body is a small senate or council, with over 20 members. . A general 
council (corresponding: to convocation) is, in the older universities, composed 
of graduates only, but in the new Universities of Queenland and Western 
Australia it contains representatives of the national, industrial, commercial, 
and scientific interests, and also donors of sums over £100. The general council 
in some cases has only a deliberative function, in others it has powers of revis- 
ing university legislation. In the constitution of Sydney University, the 
university is declared to consist as a corporation of the senate. The wider 
point of view appears in the constitution of the University of Queensland, 
which is declared to be “a body corporate consisting of senate, council, and 
graduate and undergraduate members.” 5 
Most of the professorships are held by graduates of English and Scottish 
Universities, but a considerable number of the professors and the great majority 
of the members of the junior staffs are Australian graduates. Many Australian 
graduates have afterwards obtained distinction at English, German, and Ameri- 
can universities as postgraduate students, lecturers, and professors. 
Unlike the State universities of the United States, the Australian 
universities do not provide entirely free education. In various ways, 
however, the fees are reduced in the case of promising students of 
limited resources. New South Wales took advanced position in this 
respect by the university amendment act of 1912, which increased the 
resource of the institution as follows: 
The statutory endowment of the university was doubled, and it was further 
provided that when the population returns of the State involve an increase in 
the number of exhibitions granted for free university education (one exhibi- 
tion for every 500 persons between the ages of 17 and 20) the endowment “ shall 
be inereased at the rate of £1 for every 15 persons of such increase.” When 
the new scheme of State university exhibitions is in operation, there may be 
800 students in attendance at Sydney University who pay no fees. These State 
exhibitions are not like other university exhibitions, tenable only in the 
faculties of arts and pure science. They may be held in any professional 
school, in a proportion to be determined each year by the senate of the univer- 
sity. The government of New South Wales has thus given effect to what has 
for long been an educational ideal in Great Britain and Australia—the ideal 
of a system which shall form a progressive and continuous whole, from the 
primary, through the secondary schools, to the technical colleges and the 
university. 
-At Sydney and Melbourne there are affiliated residential colleges 
within the university grounds. These colleges, while admitting 
students without respect to religious creed, are connected with re- 
ligious denominations. Their students are admitted for the uni- 
versity degrees. Evening lectures are provided at several of the 
universities for students who are unable to attend during the day; 
the new universities of Queensland and Western Australia propose 
to make special arrangements for such students.

EDUCATION IN NEW ZEALAND. 
STATUS IN 1915. 
The office has received from Dr. Mark Cohen an article on educa- 
tion in New Zealand, comprising a summary of the latest official 
report with interesting comments.’ From this article the following 
particulars are derived: 
The progressive spirit characteristic of New Zealand led in 1912 
to the appointment of a royal commission on education charged to 
investigate the system and suggest measures for its development and 
better adaptation to the expanding country. The change in the 
administration of the country interfered with immediate action in 
accordance with the recommendations of the commission; and the 
European war, which makes a heavy drain on the financial resources 
of New Zealand, precludes serious consideration at the present time 
of schemes that may involve increased expenditure of public money. 
Notwithstanding these adverse conditions, certain of the recom- 
mendations have recently gone into effect. Among these are the ap- 
pointment of a council of education to act in an advisory capacity to 
the minister of education. The first meeting of this council was held 
in July, 1915, and considered subjects of immediate importance for 
the improvement of public education, including agricultural educa- 
tion; the conduct of secondary education, especially that of public   
1Dr, Cohen, the editor of the Dunedin Evening Star, New Zealand, represented his 
country at the International Congress on Education held at Oakland in July the current 
year. He has long been identified with the educational work of New Zealand, and for 
many years this office has been indebted to him for information not otherwise attainable.
-P-A-G-E-688
  660 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
high schools; standards for admission to the university; and medical 
inspection for school children. 
At a second meeting of the council, held in November, further 
consideration was given to the questions of medical inspection, phys- 
ical training, and increased provision for free tuition in secondary 
schools, which are paramount matters at the present time. Other 
measures adopted in accordance with the advice of the royal com- 
mission are the reorganization of the school districts, reducing the 
number from 13 to 9, and the transference of the control of the 
official inspectors from local education boards to the central depart- 
ment. A scheme for the grading of teachers was also adopted, but is 
not yet in full operation; hence its merits have still to be tested. 
The statistics of primary education show that for the year end- 
ing December 31, 1915, enrollment in the primary schools was 181,192 
pupils. Of these, 160,895 were in public schools, 14,366 in registered 
private schools, 4,745 in schools for the natives, and 731 in schools 
for special classes. The teaching forces of these schools numbered 
1,591 men and 3,077 women, not including 626 assistants. 
An impressive fact in the statistical record is the high percentage 
of average attendance maintained. The status of New Zealand in 
this respect, as compared with other countries, appears as follows:

The satisfactory showing for New Zealand is attributed to the 
strict enforcement of the compulsory-attendance law, but more par- 
ticularly to the increased appreciation on the part of parents of the 
value of education for their children, and the improved conditions of 
the schools which make them so attractive that the children have no 
desire to be absent. 
The official report considers in particular the status of small schools 
which, as will be seen by the following statistics, comprise about two- 
thirds of the total number:

Of the schools with one teacher, 992 averaged less than 20 pupils. 
The difficulty presented by this class of schools is continually before 
the department, and the example of the United States is cited in favor 
of consolidation. With respect to this subject the minister says: 
Small schools should be grouped wherever possible. Instead of setting up 
small, ineffective schools, generally under untrained, uncertificated teachers, 
there should be central schools well equipped and staffed, where inspectors give 
more than double the time they now find possible. * * * If any one board 
would make one experiment in this direction, its success, guaranteed by experi- 
ence elsewhere, would be sufficient to cause a widespread adoption of the system. 
The children would benefit not only educationally but physically, owing to the 
method of traveling in covered conveyances in bad weather.* 
During the past year there was a steady increase in the number of 
female teachers, due to a large extent to the enlistment of male 
teachers for military service abroad. At the close of the year 1915 
over 400 adult teachers were serving with the colors, their places 
being temporarily filled by women. As a consequence the proportion 
of women teachers was greatly increased. In 1914 there were 173 
women to every 100 men teachers; in 1915 there were 193 to 100. 
Under normal conditions, however, it is said that the supply of male 
teachers in New Zealand is satisfactory and compares favorably with 
similar conditions in other countries. In view of the fact that about 
half the children in the public schools are under 10 years of age, it is 
considered that women teachers are the most suitable for about three- 
quarters of the school population, and there is no present apprehen- 
sion as to future proportions in the school staffing. 
The salaries are comparatively high and have been cn 
increased as a result of changes in the staffing provided for by legis- 
lation of 1914. The total amount appropriated for salaries during 
the past year was £846,810 (about $4,200,000). This was an increase 
of £105,674 above the appropriations for 1914. At present the 
average annual salary for male teachers amounts to £245 ($1,190.70), 
and for women teachers to £141 ($685.26). 
Because of the demands of war, the increase in the number of 
certificated teachers noticeable in recent years was not maintained. 
Only 16 teachers of this class were added during the year, and the 
number of teachers partially qualified was reduced from 73.7 per cent 
to 70.6 per cent of the total force, with a corresponding increase in 
the proportion of teachers having no recognized status. Regret is 
expressed that under present circumstances it has become necessary 
in many districts to appoint any fairly well-educated person as school- 
teacher. 
An interesting fact in the educational record of New Zealand is 
the continued maintenance of schools for the natives. It is stated 
1 Report of the Minister of Education, 1915, p. 3. 
61355°—16——44
-P-A-G-E-690
    
662 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
for the year under review that there were 117 Maori schools in 
operation, 8 primary mission schools for Maoris, and 10 boarding 
schools affording advanced education to aboriginal children, who also 
attend 551 public schools, where they pass the standards in just the 
same way as European children. The average weekly roll number 
of pupils is 5,232, of whom 2,409 are girls. No less than 51 of the 
purely native schools gained over 90 per cent in regularity of attend- 
ance. In the ordinary public school the Maori is at a disadvantage, 
and there is a consensus of opinion that in the higher classes—Eng- 
lish and arithmetic in particular—he finds the subjects too difficult, 
while very few of the natives seek to obtain proficiency certificates 
at the end of thesstandard (grade) 6 course. Irregularity of attend- 
ance and want of proper care in the home are the contributing factors. 
As regards secondary education, it appears that there were 6,905 
pupils (4,021 boys, 2,884 girls) in public schools of this grade, and 
992 pupils in the private secondary schools. Complaint is made of 
the failure of a large part of the pupils to complete an entire course 
of secondary instruction, and the legislature has been urged to 
devise means for preventing this wastage. 
By recent legislation the status and emoluments of secondary 
school teachers have been appreciably improved. Men principals are 
now paid £586 per year and women principals £436; the salaries 
of assistants are, for men £236, for women £187. By comparison 
with the salaries prior to 1914 this shows increases as follows: £61 
a year for men principals and £18 for assistants; £39 a year for 
women principals and £24 a year for assistants. It is noted further 
that in secondary departments salaries have been increased and 
made uniform. 
The provision for elementary education at public expense is com- 
pleted by the following special schools:

  TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
Says Mr. Cohen: 
It was thought that war conditions would have a depressing effect on the 
attendance at technical schools, but the reverse has been the case, and a sub- 
stantial increase of both classes and students has been recorded. The attend-
-P-A-G-E-691
  
EDUCATION IN NEW ZEALAND. 663. 
ances aggregated 20,202 pupils, of whom 6,983 children from the primary 
schools received free tuition. The capitation paid to the controlling authorities 
amounted to £48,475, being at the rate of £2.4 per pupil. There is a notable 
appreciation by local governing bodies of the work carried on in this depart- 
ment of the State’s activities, no less than £5,000 having been contributed by 
the local authorities, industrial organizations, and others. This action entitles 
them to a share in the management of the schools, but they can not interfere in 
any way with the course of instruction. The contributors receive a Govern- 
ment grant of £1 for every £1 so subscribed. 
The proportion of pupils in the different courses of study are as 
follows:

More than half the pupils were above 17 years of age and about 
one-half were young women. The report of the minister notes that— 
With a view of helping disabled soldiers who have returned from the theater 
of war to better equip themselves to earn a steady livelihood, the Government 
has thrown open to them, free of all charge, the full advantages of the techni- 
cal colleges, and the privilege has been largely utilized. 
In addition to the organized technical schools, the Government pro- 
motes the technical departments of high schools by capitation grants, 
amounting in 1915 to £20,000, which was at the rate of £10.7 for each 
pupil enrolled. These departments enrolled 2,000 pupils. 
INCREASING EXPENDITURE. 
In his comments upon the official report Dr. Cohen notes the 
ever-increasing cost of national education. This was urged upon the 
attention of Parliament by the minister of education, who, in his 
memorandum on the subject, says: 
The cost of primary education rose from £1,184,000 in 1914-15 to £1,273,000 
the past year, a result chiefly of the automatic operation of the new salary 
measure. Thus the cost per head of the Dominion’s population increased from 
20s. 9d. in 1914-15 to 21s. 11d. in 1915-16, while the cost of secondary instruc- 
tion rose in the same period from £175,000 to £197,000, principally due to the 
increased cost of maintenance. It follows that the total cost for national edu- 
cation was raised in one year by £118,000, equal to 1s. 4d. per head of the popu- 
lation of New Zealand. For the purposes of comparison it is stated that the 
United States expenditure on education is approximately £1.12.1 per head of its 
population.

THE UNIVERSITY. 
The New Zealand University is an examining body to which are 
affiliated four teaching colleges. The latter registered 2,039 students 
in 1915, and of these, 112 (79 men; 383 women) passed the examina- 
tion for the bachelor’s degree, and 42 (26 men; 16 women) the exami- 
tion for the status of master of arts, laws, or science. In addition 
two students qualified for the degree of doctor of medicine and one 
for that of doctor of literature. The number of men qualifying for a 
degree was 116, as against 167 the previous year. The reduction was 
due to the number of students enlisted in the military service. 
The total income of the university in 1915 was £46,584.

CHAPTER XXXVII. 
STATISTICAL SUMMARIES OF EDUCATION IN FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES.+ 
The present chapter comprises a statistical survey of education in 
all countries from which reports have recently been received at this 
office. The information is arranged in three sections, the first per- 
taining to elementary education, the second and third sections, re- 
spectively, to secondary and higher education. 
Of the three divisions the first alone offers data which fall natur- 
ally under common categories. In all civilized countries some pro- 
vision is made for giving the great body of the children the elements 
of knowledge in schools maintained at public expense and under 
government supervision. Experience has shown that only by this 
means can nations be saved from the evils of illiteracy on the part of 
the masses. This universal conviction is accompanied by a very 
general agreement in regard to the subjects of instruction for ele- 
mentary schools. The chief difference in this respect pertains to 
the number of years in the elementary course and the length of a 
school year. 
Tt should be added that the statistics and discussion comprised in 
this chapter relate almost exclusively to the three departments of 
education which form ascending stages in a complete system of 
general education. In many cases the entire educational provision 
of a country is covered by the presentation, but in the principal 
nations, provision is made for vocational and technical training by 
agencies not included in the general system of education and ‘not 
comprised in the same class of official reports. A bulletin treating 
of the higher technical schools of the leading nations has been pre- 
pared by experts in the bureau and will soon be issued. The time 
is not opportune for collecting adequate information with regard to 
vocational schools of varied types, or even in regard to secondary 
technical schools, which are well organized in several countries. 
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
Table 1 comprises statistics relating to elementary schools. The 
number of children under instruction (columns 5 to 7) is a matter   
1 Prepared by Anna Tolman Smith, specialist in foreign educational systems, assisted 
by W. S. Jesien, translator of Slavonic languages. 
665   
 
-P-A-G-E-694
666 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
of such importance that in all countries periodic censuses are taken 
to determine this fact. These enumerations are made annually or 
biennially, as a rule, and serve in part as the basis for estimating the 
amount of appropriation to be made by the respective governments 
for elementary education. Other considerations also affect these 
estimates; for instance, the policy of extending special aid to poor 
districts, and the purpose of making liberal provision for medical 
inspection and other welfare services in connection with the schools. 
The proportion of pupils in elementary schools to the entire popu- 
lation, as given in column 8, Table 1, has particular interest for 
students of sociology, since it affords a measure of the success of the 
effort to get all children under instruction. Naturally, this item 
must be interpreted with reference to the relation of the total child 
population to the adult population, which in a few countries, notably 
France, is below the normal. It may be assumed, however, that in 
countries having at least 13 per cent of the population enrolled in 
elementary schools the problem of school provision is solved. Those 
countries in which the proportion of the population enrolled is less 
than 18 per cent have still to complete the elementary school pro- 
vision and to enact compulsory school-attendance laws with means 
for their enforcement. 
Attention should be called to the fact that Table 1 includes, besides 
independent countries, several which do not possess responsible gov- 
ernment. These are all dependencies of Great Britain, the chief in 
extent and population being British India. With respect to this 
imperial possession, the chief educational question is that of the 
progress which has been made in extending modern instruction 
among the natives. The usual terms of school classification can not 
well be applied here, since, as compared with European countries, 
nearly all the instruction given in the modern schools is elementary 
in character. At the same time the enrollment in elementary schools 
in India, as elsewhere, is a measure of the success of the effort to 
get all children into schools under public control. This is evident 
from the fact that the total enrollment in these schools is 73 per 
cent of the pupils enrolled in all classes of institutions as shown by 
a statistical summary for India given in chapter XXXYV. 
In the island dependencies of Great Britain included in the table 
the systems of education are comparable in their results with those of 
of self-governing countries. They have been long maintained on the 
same basis, and progress steadily from year to year. 
In the self-governing colonies that are comprised in the Union of 
South Africa the educational statistics pertain to the white popula- 
tion alone; although schools for the natives are maintained by the 
Government and by missionary agencies aided by the Government, 
their inclusion in this table would destroy the comparative value of
-P-A-G-E-695
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 667 
the statistics relating to the schools for the Europeans, without con- 
veying any fair idea of the work carried on in the interests of the 
natives. 
For the great majority of the countries the schools included in the 
table correspond to the graded city schools and the rural schools of 
the United States. Infant schools (kindergartens, asili, etc.) for 
children under 5 are not included, even when supported by public 
funds. In the Provinces of Canada, excepting Ontario, the pupils 
in public high schools are included, but, as will be seen by reference 
to the chapter on Canada (p. 514), they do not form a very large part 
of the total enrollment. 
The item of expenditure, column 12, includes in every case the 
current cost of the schools and, as a rule, the cost of administration 
as well. The capital expenditure for permanent works, sites, build- 
ings, etc., is not generally included; exceptions, when known, are 
indicated by footnotes. It will be observed, also, that in a few cases 
the expenditures are not given for the same year as the enrollment. 
This is due to the fact that the business and educational work of 
school systems are under different direction, and their reports are 
seldom synchronous. At the same time the school expenditure for a 
particular year differs little from that of the next year, except in 
cases where large outlays are made for sites and buildings.

EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 673 
SECONDARY EDUCATION, 
The classification of schools in different countries presents so 
many standards that the term “secondary” in application to a col- 
lective table, such as is here attempted, has only a relative significa- 
tion. The differences referred to are due in part to the differences 
in the scope of elementary education, which often covers only the 
rudiments of instruction, while the secondary school overlaps a con- 
siderable portion of the proper primary field. In other cases the 
period between elementary and secondary education is provided for 
by special schools preparatory to the latter. 
To the province of secondary education belong also schools serving 
various special purposes and having no definite relation to either 
primary or higher education. In this class are vocational, continua- 
tion, trade, and other schools. They are, however, not included in 
the present consideration. 
The principle that secondary schools lead to university education 
can not be accepted as an exact basis of classification, since in many 
countries short preparatory courses serve as a link between the two. 
Notwithstanding this diversity of secondary systems, uniformity 
obtains among certain groups of countries, which therefore lend 
themselves easily to collective presentation. It is noticeable, also, 
that, irrespective of the schemes of classification, the courses of 
study for secondary instruction are essentially the same in all 
countries. They are comprised in four divisions: Classical, semi- 
classical, “ real,” and technical. 
In the countries of Continental Europe the gymnasium (lycée in 
France) is the prevailing type of secondary school. The course cov- 
ers eight or nine years, or classes, often preceded by a preparatory 
class, and leading directly to university studies. This type of sec- 
ondary school does not stand in direct connection with the primary 
school, but partly invades its province, the lower classes of the 
gymnasia being usually equivalent to the corresponding higher 
classes of primary schools. : 
This type of secondary education in Europe is illustrated by the 
following conspectus of courses of study, representing, respectively, 
the German gymnasium and the classical division of the French 
lycée. The German “real” schools differ from the gymnasia by 
the absence of Latin and Greek, which are replaced by modern lan- 
guages and science. The same divisions, but often under different 
names, prevail throughout the Continent of Europe. France has a 
system of elective courses arranged in cycles and completed by one 
year of philosophical or mathematical specialization.

SECONDARY EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 
Secondary education in England up to a recent date was in a 
chaotic state, but as a result of persistent efforts on the part of the 
universities, educational associations, and the Government, the agen- 
cies of secondary education have been largely systematized without 
the loss of their independent authority and individuality. 
On the basis of management the following types of secondary 
schools are recognized: Endowed, proprietary (maintained by stock
-P-A-G-E-704
  676 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
companies), and private (under individual ownership and direc- 
tion), and public secondary schools established and maintained by 
municipalities and counties. 
As a consequence of measures brought about by the reorganization 
of the English system under the education act of 1902, a large pro- 
portion of the secondary schools of England and Wales have come 
into relations with the Government and are now borne on what is 
called the grant list. In addition to the schools receiving appropri- 
ations, there are other secondary schools which do not desire to follow 
a prescribed program, but at the same time seek recognition from the 
Government in accordance with conditions which the Government 
lays down as guaranties of their efficiency. The Government regu- 
lations offer a definition which has assisted materially in determining 
a standard for secondary education in the class of schools which are 
not intended chiefly to prepare for university matriculation. In 
order to be recognized as a secondary school within the meaning of - 
these regulations, a school must offer to each of its pupils a progres- 
sive course of general education with the requisite organization, 
curriculum, teaching staff, and equipment of a kind and amount suit- 
able for pupils of an age range at least as wide as from 12 to 17. A 
school will not be recognized as a secondary school unless (1) an ade- 
quate proportion of the pupils remain at least four years in the 
school, and (2) an adequate proportion of the pupils remain in the 
school up to and beyond the age of 16. 
The required curriculum must include the following subjects: 
English language and literature, at least-one language other than English, 
geography, history, mathematics, science, and drawing. A curriculum includ- 
ing two languages other than English, but making no provision for instruction 
in Latin, will only be approved where the board are satisfied that the omission 
of Latin is for the educational advantage of the school. The instruction in 
science must include practical work by the pupils. 
The curriculum must also make such provision as the board, having regard 
to the circumstances of the school, can accept as adequate for organized games, 
physical exercises, manual instruction, and singing. 
In schools for girls the curriculum must include provision for practical in- 
struction in domestic subjects, such as nedlework, cookery, laundry work, house- 
keeping, and household hygiene; and an approved course in a combination of 
these subjects may for girls over 15 years of age be substituted partially or 
wholly for science and for mathematics other than arithmetic. 
In regard to internal organization, every secondary school of 
England has its own scheme of articulation. As a rule, however, in 
the higher secondary schools, that is, schools retaining their pupils 
up to 18 years of age and preparing them for university matricula- 
tion, distinct provision is made for a classical course and a modern 
course. The subjects of instruction in schools of this class are de- 
termined largely by the requirements of the universities in regard to
-P-A-G-E-705
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 677 
compulsory classical languages. A typical program comprises the 
following subjects: : 
Classical side; (1) Religion (or Divinity, as it is sometimes called), (2) 
English, (3) Latin, (4) Greek, (5) French, (6) history, (7) geography, (8) 
erithmetic, (9) mathematics, (10) natural sciences (viz, physics, chemistry, 
ete.), (11) drawing, (12) singing, and such other subjects as (13) German, 
etc, (14) instruction in instrumental music, etc. The two last subjects, viz, 
German and instrumental music, and also similar subjects, are usually optional, 
and extra fees are required for them. 
Modern side: (1) Mathematics, (2) English, (3) Latin, (4) French, (5) 
German, (6) history and geography, (7) natural science (viz, chemistry and 
physics), (8) drawing, and (9) singing. 
The secondary schools of Scotland, which have also been brought 
into close relations with the Government, are much more nearly 
uniform in character than those of England. 
Secondary education in Ireland has been largely systematized by 
the agency of the Intermediate Education Board, an examining body 
which tests the qualifications of all candidates who present them- 
selves. The examination scheme comprises the recognized subjects 
of secondary education, hence the pupils who present themselves are 
properly regarded as of secondary grade. 
The different divisions of the British Empire have maintained 
the same spirit of independence and individuality in their secondary 
schools. The status of these schools in Canada and Australia is con- 
sidered in the chapters dealing respectively with those two divisions 
of the Empire. 
It would be misleading to comprise schools so varied in character 
as those of Great Britain and Ireland in a table with the schools 
of continental countries organized under government supervision or 
control and following official programs which are uniform for all 
schools of the same class. The following statements comprise all the 
statistics at present attainable for the secondary schools of the 
United Kingdom.

As regards England it should be added that the numbers given 
above do not include secondary schools provided by local authorities, 
which in 1909 numbered 258, with nearly 48,000 pupils. There are 
also, on a rough estimate, from 450 to 500 private secondary schools, 
which in 1910 were educating between 60,000 and 70,000 pupils.

STATISTICS OF UNIVERSITIES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
The statistics comprised in this section relate, it will be seen, to 
the period immediately preceding the war. For the leading coun- 
tries of Europe detailed tables are presented, showing the distribu- 
tion of students by universities. Exception is made in the case of 
Russia, which is the subject of a special chapter in this report; for 
the purpose of making that presentation complete, the table of de- 
tailed university statistics was there included. 
These detailed tables comprise the institutions that are recognized 
as universities in their respective countries, and therefore the term 
“university” is used in somewhat different significations. On the 
whole, however, admission requirements based on well-defined and 
equivalent programs of secondary education, afford a standard for 
the classification of higher institutions. Another important stand- 
ard is the authority to confer degrees. 
The detailed statistics preceding the general table are arranged 
after a plan of presentation uniform so far as is practicable in view 
of the diversity of reports on which they are based. 
GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 
The universities of Great Britain represent three distinct eras in 
the history of higher education in the Kingdom. Oxford and Cam- 
bridge and the universities of Scotland are separated in their origin 
by many centuries from the later universities, and in their organiza- 
tion and scholastic standards preserve signs of the varied conditions 
under which they have developed. They have borne an important 
part in modern progress, and have in turn been modified and in- 
vigorated by modern influences. The later universities belong to 
two periods. Durham University, founded in 1832, was the pioneer 
in the movement for providing the north of England with university 
facilities. Although it followed closely the curricula of the older 
universities, the claims of the technical professions were recognized 
by temporary provision as early as 1837; and by the incorporation 
of the medical college at New Castle in 1852, and the North of Eng- 
land Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineering in 1874, this 
institution was brought into the sweep of the modern movement. 
_ The University of London was created as an examining body in 
1837 as a protest against the religious restriction which prevailed at 
Oxford and Cambridge until 1854. The new university stood, there- 
fore, from the first for the modern conception of higher education, 
which was fully embodied in the University of London Acts, 1898, 
by which it was transformed into a teaching university. 
The remaining universities in Great Britain and the University 
Colleges of Wales arose in response to the popular demands for
-P-A-G-E-707
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. ¢ 679 
education which marked the latter part of the nineteenth century 
in England. These institutions have one common characteristic: 
While preserving a fair proportion of classical studies, the curriculum 
is mainly devoted to modern languages and sciences and to the vari- 
ous branches of engineering, technology, and agriculture in order 
to supply capable experts for the great modern industries. 
The varieties in type preclude the presentation of the British 
universities in one general table. The complex organization of 
Oxford and Cambridge is indicated by the number of their con- 
stituent colleges. The colleges all have a high degree of autonomy, 
but are under university statutes. These statutes determine the re- 
quirements for degrees which the university alone has authority to 
confer. 
The colleges are richly endowed, the gross annual incomes ranging, 
for the Oxford colleges, from £7,179, reported for Hertford, to 
£79,561, reported for Magdalen. Incomes exceeding £20,000 a year 
are reported by 11 of the 22 colleges. The annual incomes of the 
Cambridge colleges range from £6,144, reported for St. Catharine’s, 
to £84,993, reported for Trinity. Annual incomes exceeding £20,000 
are reported by 4 of the 17 colleges. Each of the colleges, both at 
Oxford and Cambridge, contributes to university purposes an annual 
amount proportioned to its income. The universities also have inde- 
pendent sources of income. 
In the acts of 1898, conferring teaching functions upon the Uni- 
versity of London, certain schools and colleges were named as con- 
stituent bodies, and discretion was given to the senate to add any 
public educational institutions conforming to prescribed conditions. 
As will be seen by reference to the detailed table, this university 
now comprises 24 colleges or schools, giving instruction in 8 faculties. 
The development of the modern universities has been stimulated 
by a parliamentary grant which has been appropriated annually 
since 1889, to be shared by the institutions on the condition that they 
submit annual reports to the education department. The grant, 
which began’ at £15,000, was raised to £25,000 in 1897. Upon similar 
terms the three university colleges of Wales each receive annually 
£44,000 from the treasury. These institutions, it will be noticed, are 
classed together in the second and third divisions of the detailed 
table. 
Cambridge University has come into relation with the central 
board of education through the school of medicine, which received a 
grant from the public treasury for the first time in the financial year 
commencing April 1, 1915.. The engineering department of Oxford 
University, which was founded by a statute of November 19, 1907, 
also participates in the grant administered by the board of education.

FRANCE. 
Higher education in France is the province of State universities 
and the special schools of university rank which are under the min- 
ister of public instruction. Each of the 15 State universities is an 
incorporated body, having its own budget and exercising self-gov- 
ernment under the general supervision of the minister of public 
instruction and the higher council of education. The universities 
are organized in specialized faculties, preparing students for pro- 
fessional or official careers. The professors are appointed by the 
President of the Republic, from a list of candidates prepared by the 
university council. Each faculty has independent control of its 
separate affairs, elects its own dean and the members of the faculty 
council, and manages the budget assigned to it. The general council 
of the university, which is intrusted with all matters of interest to 
the entire body, is composed of the deans of the several faculties of 
the university and two other delegates from each and is presided over 
by the academic rector, who is the virtual chief (president of the 
university). 
The income of each university is divided into the ordinary income 
and the extraordinary income. The former comprises the revenues 
from property and the interest on invested funds, the fees for ma- 
triculation, lecture fees, library and laboratory fees, the receipts 
from university publications, the State appropriations for current 
expenditures, appropriations by the departments and cities, and all 
other income of a permanent character. The extraordinary income 
includes gifts and legacies, loans, appropriations for building or 
other special purposes, and funds intended to meet temporary de-
-P-A-G-E-710
  682 EDUCATION REPORT, 1916. 
mands. Each faculty comprised within a university has its own 
special budget. The salaries of all professors are paid from the 
State appropriation, according to a fixed schedule. A university 
may, however, make arangements for additional service, to be paid 
for out of its own resources. In giving up to the universities the re- 
ceipts from fees, which were formerly turned over to the State treas- 
ury, the legislature decided that they must be applied wholly to 
objects of immediate advantage to the students, such as the equipment 
of laboratories, libraries, new buildings, etc. Apart from these spe- 
cific limitations, the universities have free disposal of their resources.

  GERMANY. 
The German universities are controlled by the State, but enjoy 
in their internal administration certain rignts defined by statutes, 
often of ancient origin. Their maintenance is derived chiefly from 
State grants, the remainder being met from public funds, endow- 
ments, fees, etc. All the universities possess considerable proper- 
ties in the form of grounds, buildings, collections, etc.. which, in
-P-A-G-E-711
    
EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. $83 
several cases, notably that of the University of Greifswald, yield 
large revenues. 
It will be observed that, outside of the faculties of theology, law, 
and medicine, the majority of the students are included in the fac- 
ulty of philosophy, which, in Germany and several other coun- 
tries, combines an extensive variety of subjects, such as natural sci- 
ence, mathematics, philology, literature, sociology, etc. Nearly one- 
half of the total number of students are registered in this faculty. 
Teaching staffs, as represented in the tables, are composed of 
ordinary, honorary, and extraordinary professors, “ privat-docents,” 
and lecturers (lectors). The ordinary professors are appointed by 
the Emperor and have the status of Government officials. They 
form the real permanent teaching staff of the university, and, as a 
rule, they alone have the right of vote in matters pertaining to 
university self-government. The extraordinary professors are 
salaried or unsalaried. The position of the former is essentially the 
same as of ordinary professors. They are appointed permanently 
at a fixed salary, and are employed partly to complete the instruc- 
tion in the chief branches of study, partly to represent those sub- 
jects for which as. yet no ordinary professorship exists in the re- 
spective universities or elsewhere. 
The unsalaried extraordinary professors draw no stipend, but 
some have a teaching commission and receive in that case remunera- 
tion. 
The “ privat-docents” are teachers recognized as qualified to lec- 
ture in the universities on subjects usually not essential to the par- 
ticular branch, but of value as supplementary instruction. Privat- 
doceniship is the initial stage of professorship, and successful 
privat-docents are in due time appointed professors. They draw 
college fees in the same way as professors, and their lectures are 
counted in the ordinary way for students who attend them. 
Lectors were originally teachers of modern languages, but in more 
recent times their functions have frequently assumed a more scien- 
tific form, so that they are employed to complete the instruction of 
the respective ordinary professors. They are appointed temporarily 
and receive remuneration in proportion to work done. 
In addition to the foregoing classes there are assistants, teachers 
of physical culture, etc. 
The new University of Frankfort on the Main, opened October 
18, 1914, and therefore not included in the general table, in the 
summer semester of 1915 had 854 students on the rolls, but of this 
number 139 were in active military service. The number of pro- 
fessors and instructors was 134. 
The students were distributed by faculties as follows: Law, 119; 
medicine, 213; and philosophy, 522.

AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. 
The organization of Austrian universities is similar to that of 
German universities in all essential features. One peculiarity of 
the Austrian institutions is their division into national groups. 
There are five German universities, two Polish, and one Bohe- 
mian, with instruction in the three respective languages, and with 
nationalistic spirit pervading deeply the whole university life. 
The expenditure of the universities is met chiefly by State sub- 
sidies, income from fees, ete. Although they are under the direct 
control of the ministry of worship and public instruction, they enjoy 
an ample measure of autonomy. 
Two new universities were founded in Hungary after the outbreax 
ofthe war. They are located respectively at Debreczin and Pressburg. 
The University of Debreczin has provision for five faculties, viz, 
theology, philosophy-history-philology, law-statesmanship, medicine, 
and methematics-science. The University of Pressburg has no theo- 
logical faculty and has an agricultural department in place of the 
faculty of mathematics and science, the remaining faculties being 
the same in both institutions. 
   
-P-A-G-E-713
  
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 685 
The University of Debreczin was developed from a high school 
existing in that city for 320 years. The three departments of the 
school were transformed into university faculties. The University 
of Pressburg was founded likewise on an old institution—the Catholic 
faculty of law—which was incorporated into the new university. 
The faculties of medicine and mathematics-science at Debreczin are 
still in preparation, and will be opened in 1916-17. At the Press- 
burg institution the faculties of law and philosophy are still wanting.

  THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. 
Denmark.—The University of Copenhagen has been the seat of 
higher learning in Denmark for 488 years. It derives its means of 
support from its own properties, with the aid of a State subsidy, 
which amounted in 1912-13 to 811,434 kroner. The organization is 
similar to that of German universities. In addition to ordinary and 
extraordinary professors there are honorary docents (midlertidig 
docent), whose salaries and period of service are fixed for each indi- 
vidual case. Any person with a doctor’s degree obtained at the Uni- 
versity of Copenhagen may lecture at the institution. The faculties 
are as follows: Theology; law and statesmanship; medicine; philos- 
ophy; mathematics and science. The courses are of seven years 
duration in medicine and from five to six years in the other faculties. 
Women are admitted on equal terms with men. 
Sweden.—Sweden has two State universities, at Upsala and Lund, 
respectively, and a State faculty of medicine at Stockholm. There 
are also two private universities at Stockholm and Goteborg, 
respectively. 
The organization and instruction at the State institutions are based 
on the statutes of January 10, 1876. The supreme control of all the 
Swedish universities (including the two private institutions) is 
vested in the “Academical congress,” composed of representatives of 
the universities and a “ chancellor” appointed by the King. 
The internal administration of individual institutions is executed 
by the “Greater consistory,” composed of the rector, the prorector, 
and a number of professors. There is also a “Smaller consistory,” 
having charge of matters pertaining to instruction. 
The State universities derive considerable incomes from their 
funds, real estate, and other properties, the remainder being covered 
by State subsidies.
-P-A-G-E-715
  EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 687 
Norway.—The University of Christiania, established in 1811 by 
King Frederick VI, is the center of higher education in Norway. It. 
is lavishly endowed with funds and legacies, and enjoys special privi- 
leges, such as the monopoly for publishing all almanacs and calen- 
dars, free use of mails, etc. The university has the following facul- 
ties: Theology; law; medicine; history and philosophy ; mathematics 
and science. 
The administration of the university is exercised by the Collegium 
Academicum, composed of the rector and the deans of the five 
faculties. ; 
Women students have the same privileges as men.

The following table brings into comparative view university statis- 
tics of the foreign countries from which recent reports have been 
received at this office. The statements made in connection with the 
foregoing detailed tables sufficiently indicate the main distinctions 
to be kept in mind in considering the items tabulated. 
As regards England, the fact may properly be emphasized that 
preparation for the profession of law is conducted in accordance 
with regulations issued by the council of legal education, which 
determines also the examination requirements for admission to the 
bar. Since the council also maintains classes, the universities do not 
comprise the entire body of law students in the country.

PREFACE 
Tuts book has proceeded haltingly, as must be evident 
in many places, for it attempts to explore and describe a field 
that is not well illuminated. The actual examination of 
those mental functions which are relatively dissociated from 
general intelligence has not been carried far by experimental- 
ists. However, the problems have been sufficiently formu- 
lated, and enough evidence has been secured, to warrant 
attempts at gleaning implications for education, even now. 
Mine is the comparatively humble task of bringing to- 
gether in an ordered presentation the works of original in- 
vestigators, in such a way that they will be available for 
application. The appeal of the data is above all to educators, 
but also, of course, to those who deal in any office with human — 
beings. 
The chief difficulty in organizing the subject has been to 
delimit it, as regards the psychology of the elementary school 
subjects on the one hand, and mental measurement on the 
other. It is not the purpose to cover either of these fields 
in the present volume. Yet so closely are they related to the 
study of special aptitudes in school children that it will be 
scarcely possible to obtain the very clearest view of what is 
here written without additional knowledge of these matters. 
It will be observed, also, that there has been no attempt here 
to teach introductory psychology. It is assumed that readers 
of this volume will be acquainted with the vocabulary of 
elementary psychology. The time has definitely passed when 
it was either feasible or desirable to present all topics in a 
single volume. Those who would learn what modern educa-

The lists of references are selected, not complete. To 
present complete bibliographies of all works bearing immedi- 
ately or remotely upon every topic treated would cumber the 
volume inexcusably. References have been selected for these 
lists because they are historically indispensable, because they 
contain information of fundamental importance, or because 
they summarize much previous work. I believe that the 
selection is such that from the books and articles listed it will 
be possible for the student who wishes to do so, to construct 
the complete bibliography and history of each topic, up to 
the present time. ° 
The hundreds of teachers who be sat in the lecture room 
of Professor E. L. Thorndike will see how many guiding 
suggestions for this volume have come from that source. 
Professor W. A. McCall has given counsel on certain chapters. 
Many iiivestigators and publishers have extended courtesies, 
which are acknowledged through the references, and to which 
attention is here gratefully directed. I am indebted to 
Dr. John S. Richards, Medical Superintendent of The Chil- 
dren’s Hospital, Randall’s Island, New York, and to 
Mr. L. L. Kolburne, student at Teachers College, for assist- 
ance in securing illustrative material for Chapter VII. 
Finally, I have enjoyed the advantage of editorial super- 
vision by Professor M. V. O’Shea. 
My chief hope for the volume is that it may contribute 
toward the welfare of school children compelled to attend | 
upon prescribed education, without due regard for their idio- 
syncrasies of original endowment.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
WHEN the writer of this introductory note began teaching, 
it was popularly believed that a pupil who showed special 
excellence in intellectual work or in some particular study 
owed his superiority to a faithful and energetic will which 
held him to his tasks until he had mastered them thoroughly. 
It was generally believed, also, that marked deficiency in 
school work as a whole or in a special subject was due prin- 
cipally to a lethargic or indifferent will which could not resist 
distractions and temptations to self-indulgence. In those 
days, pupils were upbraided and even physically chastised if 
they failed to prepare: the lessons which were prescribed for 
them in any study. The writer has often seen pupils whipped 
because they failed in their spelling, arithmetic, reading, 
history, or grammar. When punishment was administered 
in the school it was frequently repeated in the home, since 
parents quite generally entertained the view that failure to 
perform intellectual tasks satisfactorily was due to negligence 
or laziness, and it was thought that the best way to correct 
such delinquency was to arouse the will, usually by means of 
dermal stimulation. In his early experience as a teacher, 
the writer never heard, either in training classes or in teachers’ 
institutes, that pupils possessed special talents or defects which 
were certain to be manifested in their school work because 
they were established by native endowment which could not 
be modified to any large extent by rewards or penalties. 
But we are gradually abandoning the view that either 
brightness or dullness in general or in special directions is due 
primarily to volitional control or the absence of it. During 
xvii

  Xviil EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
the last tew years, experimental studies have impressed the 
principle that individuals differ in their inheritance of special 
capacities. Dr. Hollingworth shows in this volume how far 
we have gone in the detection of special talents and defects, 
with particular regard to the work of the school. She shows 
in preliminary discussion what notions people have entertained 
regarding the nature of ability, and then she discusses methods 
of measuring ability, alike of a general and of a special sort. 
She discusses the bases for differences among individuals in 
ability in respect to various intellectual traits or functions. 
Then she presents in detail what is known to-day regarding 
special talents and defects as revealed in the more important 
subjects taught in the schools. 
We believe in these times that the school should to the fullest 
extent provide opportunities for each pupil to develop his 
talents as completely and as rapidly as possible. It is still 
required in most public schools, though, that pupils in any 
group should be kept quite close together in their educational 
progress, even when they show marked differences in ability 
in particular subjects or in the entire work of the school. 
But the pressure is becoming constantly greater to arrange 
school programs so that pupils may go forward as rapidly as 
their abilities, either general or special, will enable them to do, 
while those who are deficient may receive help according to 
their needs. There are already a number of experimental 
schools and school systems in which the principle of individual 
differences in ability is recognized and applied to a greater 
or less extent. One may safely predict that we shall find a way 
in time so that the principle may be recognized and applied in 
all public schools. 
Dr. Hollingworth’s book lays a sound foundation for the 
differentiation of pupils in a school or classroom according to 
special abilities or deficiencies. It can be read by teachers

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION xix 
who have not had extensive study of educational psychology 
or statistical methods of investigating such problems as are 
treated in this volume. The book is written in a graceful 
style, and technical matters are discussed in an unusually 
clear, simple, and attractive way. It may be confidently 
asserted that any teacher who has charge of thirty or forty 
pupils — or a smaller or larger number — will be helped to 
- understand individual traits of excellence or deficiency if she 
will read what Dr. Hollingworth has presented in this volume. 
It may be safely stated, also, that a teacher will be more 
sympathetic toward pupils who experience difficulty in master- 
ing special subjects of study if she will become familiar with 
the facts and conclusions which this book contains.

CHAPTER I 
PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION 
I. SPECULATION CONCERNING THE NATURE OF ABILITY 
SINCE reflective men began to record their speculations, 
theories have been expressed concerning the nature and rela- 
tionships of mentalfunctions. Plato in The Republic contem- 
plated the importance of knowledge in this field. ‘“‘Come 
now and we will ask you a question: when you spoke of a. 
nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you mean to 
say that one man will acquire a thing easily, another with 
difficulty; a little learning will lead the one to discover a 
great deal; whereas the other, after much study and appli- 
cation, no sooner learns than he forgets; or, again, did you 
mean that the one has a,body which is a good servant to his 
mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to him? 
Would not these be the sort of differences which would dis- 
tinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is un- 
gifted ?” 
In The Republic the use of mental tests to discover the 
caliber of the mind is foretold. “We must watch them 
from their youth upwards, and make them perform actions 
in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived, 
and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected, 
and he who fails in the trial is to be rejected. That will be 
the way?”

    2 SPECIAL TALENTS AND DEFECTS 
Aside from the speculations of scholars, folk-notions as 
expressed in proverbs are interesting, especially as showing 
what men wish were true concerning human talents and 
defects. Many of these proverbs embody the idea of a com- 
pensatory distribution of abilities: if I am weak in one re- 
spect, [am sure to be strong in another; if I am a failure now, 
I shall probably be’a success later on. ‘‘Every dog has his 
day.” ‘“Homely in the cradle, handsome at the table.” 
“Slow but sure.” ‘Easy come, easy go.” This doctrine 
of compensation satisfies certain cravings of human nature, 
and is therefore likely to be held wherever people have not 
given impartial attention to the results of experimental in- 
vestigation. 
Folk-wisdom has also seen men under mental types. Ac- 
cording to the theory of types, the human species is divided 
into separate categories, with respect to mental constitution. 
There would thus be the musical and the unmusical, the quick 
and the slow, the imaginative and the unimaginative, the 
eye-minded and the ear-minded, and so forth. The observ- 
able complexities of behavior have further led to the descrip- 
tion of a given person by a combination of type-terms, as, 
for example, ‘‘quick-musical-imaginative,”’ or ‘‘mathematical- 
accurate-unimaginative.”’ Persons thus classified by types, 
are thought to be of “different kinds,” ‘‘equal”’ but “‘unlike.”’ 
Two persons are thus compared as an apple is compared to 
an orange. Both fruits are “equal,” but of “different types.”’ 
People, according to this conception of human nature, are 
not thought of as differing from each other simply in 
amount, as an apple is compared with a larger, a smaller, 
or a sweeter apple. Comparison in terms of amount is 
disagreeable in some respects, so that uncontrolled spec- 
ulation would surely tend to favor the theory of distinct 
types.  
-P-A-G-E-23
PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION 3 
Type-terms have also been invented for temperament, — 
sanguine, choleric, melancholic}phlegmatic. The idea under- 
lying this classification is that everyone belongs to one or 
another of these distinct temperamental types, and, further- 
more, that there is a relationship among types which war- 
rants fixed hyphenated categories. 
The mental traits or “faculties” thus classified and hy- 
/phenated are conceived as entities, having each its distinct 
existence in the individual mind, and being susceptible to 
eneral training and strengthening, by prescribed exercises. 
Thus it has been believed that “‘the observation’? may be 
developed by exercises with particular materials, so that all 
materials whatsoever will be observed equally or approxi- 
mately as well. 
Speculation has been much occupied, as the history of 
human thought shows, with the problem of the origin of in- 
dividual endowment. Many different possible explanations 
were proposed, before the day of quantitative measurement 
in psychology. It has been surmised that mental endow- 
ment is the result of prenatal influences, the wishes and en- 
vironment of the mother, during the period of gestation; 
or that it is the result of education; or that it arises from 
the physical accidents met with by the organism; or that it 
may be inherited from ancestors, as physical traits rather 
obviously are. On the whole, speculation has favored the 
notion that mental endowment originates in the environ- 
ment. \The idea that ability_is hereditary, determined for 
each by the conditions of ancestry, is repugnant. Man pre- 
- fers to consider that-he-can-himself-determine-what-he-will-do- 
and be. This doctrine will not be tenable if it is admitted that 
talents and deficiencies are determined in the germ-plasm, 
from which the organism springs; that man_can only use, 
not choose;-his-mentalendowment.

II. RESULTS OF QUANTITATIVE INVESTIGATION 
Many of the cherished hopes and desires of mankind con- 
cerning itself are in some part violated by the teachings of 
scientific psychology. Experimental psychology is not yet 
half a century old, dating its beginning as a technical science 
from the founding of Wundt’s laboratory at Leipzig, in 1879. 
Therefore, it is clear that the study of these problems by quan- 
titative methods brings us very close to the present day. 
» When the problem of measuring mental capacity was first 
Aaken into the laboratory, the modern definition of a mental func- 
“tion began to be formulated. It became apparent that a mind 
must be judged by its product. The measurement of per- 
formance is the only approach there is, or probably ever will 
be, to the measurement of mind. On this basis it was found 
impossible to identify or measure any such function as ‘‘the 
- reason,” ‘‘the memory,” ‘‘the observation,” ‘‘the imagina- 
tion,” ‘‘the will,’ and similar supposed entities. A mental 
function came to be defined as “an actually or possibly observ- 
able event in behavior.”. Thus, memorizing cligits, detecting 
_ absurdities, and reading English print are examples of mental 
functions, in the sense in which the term is used throughout 
the chapters of this discussion. 
Other terms which are used to refer to performances or 
“events in behavior,’ are abilities and capacities. A pro- 
longed discussion might be conducted, in an attempt to as- 
sign different technical meanings to these words, and to bring out 
fine shades of distinction among them. For instance, it might 
be claimed that “‘ability”’ should be reserved to signify ca- 
pacity plus the skill acquired by practice, if any; while 
“‘capacity”’ should mean the innate aptitude, apart from all 
training. However, since capacity in this sense can never be 
known, but,,can only be inferred from the degree of actual   
 
-P-A-G-E-25
PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION 5 
performance, under controlled conditions, it hardly seems 
necessary to maintain such distinctions for our purpose. 
Refinements of nomenclature will, therefore, be avoided, and 
the terms mental function, capacity, and ability will be used 
interchangeably, to denote performance which depends on the 
inborn integrity and sensitivity of the individual. 
By way of clarifying the definition of a mental function as 
“an actually or possibly observable event in behavior,” we 
may quote from Spearman’s presentation of the distinction 
between “observation” as a mental function, and ‘‘ observa- 
tion of birds’ nests.” Spearman says: ‘‘Suppose, for instance, 
that a school boy has surpassed his fellows in the observation 
of birds’ nests. His victory has, no doubt, depended in part 
on his capacity for the general form of activity known as 
‘observation.’ But it has also depended on his being able 
to apply this form of activity to the matter of birds’ nests; 
had the question been of tarts in the pastry cook’s window, 
the laurels might well have fallen to another boy. A further 
influence must have been exercised by the accompanying cir- 
cumstances; to spy out nests as they lie concealed in the 
foliage is not the same thing as to make observations con- 
cerning them in the open light of a natural history museum. 
Again, to discover nests at leisure is different from doing so 
under the severe speed limits prescribed by the risk .of an in- 
terrupting gamekeeper. The boy’s rank may even depend 
largely on the manner of estimating merit. Marks may be 
given either for the gross number or for the rarity of the nests 
observed; and he who most infallibly notes the obvious con- 
struction of the house-sparrow may not be the best at. 
detecting the elusive hole of the kingfisher.” One cannot, 
therefore, identify and measure ‘observation.’ One- can 
only measure “observing birds’ nests, of all kinds, at leisure,” 
or “‘observing rare birds’ nests, under stress of pursuit,” 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  6 SPECIAL TALENTS AND DEFECTS 
and so forth, which are “‘actual or possible events in 
behavior.”’ 
As one may glean further from Spearman’s discourse, it 
has been shown that most of the mental functions performed 
by men are not elementary, but consist of the codrdination 
of complex factors, capable of analysis. Reading the English 
word “cat” from a printed page is, for instance, a very com- 
plex function. 
The application of quantitative methods to the study of 
mental functions as thus defined, quickly revealed the fact 
that human beings, sampled at random, in large numbers, 
do not fall into distinct types. On the contrary, they yield 
one unbroken curve of distribution in the function measured, 
clustering around a single type (or mode). In all mental 
functions which have been measured, there has been found 
but one type — the average human type — from which the 
individual members of the species deviate in degree (though 
not inkind). The majority of individuals deviate but slightly 
from this biologically established type or mode. “The typ- 
ical” in ability is, indeed, by definition, what the greatest 
number of people can do. From this performance of the 
average or typical person, a few individuals deviate widely 
in the direction of superiority,’ while a corresponding few 
deviate widely in the direction of inferiority. No doubt the 
conspicuousness, because of their infrequency, of extreme 
deviates in respect to any given function (or capacity) has 
led to the notion of separate types of mankind. Mental 
measurement shows clearly that men cluster closely around 
one type in mental traits, just as: they do in such physical 
traits as height and weight. All men can be no more di- 
vided into the dull and the bright, than they can be divided 
into the talland the short. The eye can see that most 
persons are best described as medium, in height.

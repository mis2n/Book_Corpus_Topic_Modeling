EDITOR’S PREFACE 
Spoken English, as presented in the following chapters by 
Miss Baker, is rapidly gaining a prominent place in both high- 
school and college instruction in English. As a textbook in this 
new field the volume will prove very useful. 
The case of spoken English is briefly as follows: 
1. As to motivation. In spoken English the student appears 
in person and speaks before the members of his class. This 
class is a cultured group of individuals whose social standard 
and self-respect are offended by faulty English. The student 
is therefore urged to his best efforts by a ‘“‘social pressure” 
which can seldom be obtained in written composition. 
2. Pedagogically. In written composition the student’s 
attention is divided. At the same time that he is forming a 
sentence he must devote part of his attention to handwriting, 
spelling, and punctuation. In spoken English there is the 
one unified and largely reflex act of pronunciation. This 
unity of effort greatly facilitates automatization, which is 
necessary in the mastery of a language. 
3. As to practical life needs. The necessity of a mastery of 
spoken English is fully evident to the student. He sees how 
the enviable offices and positions in his community require in 
the one seeking them the ability to dictate letters correctly 
and gracefully, and how leading citizens must converse and 
discourse effectively in business, social, civic, and political 
life. 
4. As to its relation to the time-honored written composition. 
During the past generation the greater part of the English that 
has appeared in typewritten or printed form has been produced 
ix 
 
-P-A-G-E-8
x Editor's Preface 
by the process of dictation to a stenographer, that is, by spoken 
English. This circumstance has greatly diminished the differ- 
ence between written style and spoken style, so that for 
Bas practical purposes the mastery of spoken English contributes 
directly to a mastery of written composition. 
All the foregoing phases of the subject and many more, 
together with their corresponding technique, have been 
gripped with a sure hand by Miss Baker both in the pages 
of this book and in her successful experience as a high-school and 
college teacher of spoken English.

AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
About fourteen years ago, when I had had but a few years’ 
experience in the teaching of English, I chanced to overhear a 
pupil of mine talking to a friend. This slight occurrence, 
together with the thinking it provoked, resulted in the trans- 
formation of my teaching of the English language. 
The pupil was a girl in one of the upper classes, quiet, 
reserved, undemonstrative, never uttering a word voluntarily, 
but using careful, correct language when she answered a 
question. As she stood with her back to me, unconscious of 
my presence, she poured out with enthusiastic rapidity the 
following: 
“Oh, Kiddo, I saw her yesterday over on Ross Avenue. Say, 
Kiddo, you ought to’ve seen her! The hat she had on was a 
peach! It wasa dream! It was the swellest thing I ever laid 
my eyes on!’”” 
This was the language she lived with. Correct but reluc- 
tant English she assumed when in the presence of her Eng- 
lish teacher. My efforts were not really affecting her habits 
of speech. Something was wrong. In class she was lifeless 
but correct; outside she was full of animation, but used by 
choice a lingo of slang. Something must be done to make 
connection between class and outside language, to relate enthu- 
siasm to good English. 
Beginning with this incident, seeking to remedy the evils 
of the unfortunate maladjustment of teaching to life which it 
revealed—which I believe was then general throughout the 
country, and is still of common occurrence—I found in spoken 
English the solution.

  xii Author's Preface 
In spoken English, moreover, I have found much more. 
Not only does it fire the student with genuine interest, and 
bring the habitual language of everyday usage into the class- 
room where it may be polished; it brings to bear the power- 
ful force of social pressure, that mainspring of civilization 
and culture heretofore so little utilized in the teaching of the 
English language. It includes also the training of the think- 
ing power, not divorced from human relationships, but func- 
tioning in life situations. 
Spoken English, in giving to its students a mastery of the 
language for instant use, also prepares them for the demands of 
present-day living, in which an increasingly larger proportion 
of their language communications will be spoken. 
Teachers of English are awakening to the value of training 
in spoken English, and school administrators are beginning to 
realize the strong demand for its inclusion in courses of study. 
Most of the teachers of English themselves have had little or no 
training in this phase of English, yet they are being called upon 
to teach it, and all over the United States are calling for assist- 
ance that will help them to understand the meaning, the possi- 
bilities, and the practical procedure in this new field in the 
teaching of the English language. Hence the need of such 
a book as this is apparent. 
While this book is on spoken English, it is not to be under- 
stood as taking the ground that written language shall be 
entirely superseded by spoken, but that the time given to each 
shall more nearly correspond to the importance and the relative 
amount of the part each takes in modern living. A discussion 
of written English has been omitted from this book, because the 
teaching of written language does not present so urgent a 
problem as does the teaching of spoken. The present need 
calls for light on how to teach spoken English.

Author's Preface xiii 
The principles and methods set forth in the present volume 
have been worked out through twelve years of experimentation 
in classes of the Oak Cliff High School, Dallas, and through 
four summer quarters of teaching in George Peabody College 
for Teachers. : 
These principles and methods will work. They will improve 
the actual speaking habits of students, and bring results in the 
rapid increase of their thinking and speaking power.

SPOKEN ENGLISH AND HOW TO TEACH IT 
CHAPTER I 
THE DEMAND FOR SPOKEN ENGLISH— 
INTRODUCTORY 
The teaching of English in high schools and colleges 
is being revolutionized. This change is taking place 
because business and life are carried on differently from 
the manner of a few years ago, and because teachers of 
English, all over the country, alive to the changes in 
contemporary living, are rapidly adjusting their teaching 
to the needs of the present. 
Most of the teaching of the English language in the 
past has been carried on through written composition. 
This practice is now changing. It must soon change 
even more markedly. 
A large proportion of business and professional work, 
aside from advertising and literary writing, is carried on 
through spoken language. 
The adjustment in teaching involves a shifting of 
emphasis from written to spoken language, the acquisition 
of a social viewpoint, and the reorganization and renewal 
of subject matter based upon social needs. 
The difference in the necessary equipment in English 
for business and other social contacts has been brought 
about partly by the adoption of labor- and time-saving 
inventions which necessitate discarding, for a good many 
I
-P-A-G-E-14
  2 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
practical purposes, the laborious method of written 
composition. 
The teaching of spoken English is not a transient fad. 
It is a stable manifestation of a steady, growing, and irre- 
sistible tendency of our language to adjust itself to the 
rapid-communication methods of our day—the closer 
touch, the impatience of intermediaries, the imperative 
demand for speed and directness. 
What proportionate amount of the English language 
used by people for the carrying on of enlightened living 
is written, what spoken? 
The writer of this book made a survey of Dallas, Texas, 
a city of two hundred thousand population, sending the 
members of the spoken-English class to interview promi- 
nent business and professional men and women and secure 
from them information by means of a simple question- 
naire. A few questionnaires were sent by mail to men 
of national prominence in their special occupations in 
various parts of the United States, and are included in the 
table of results. Fifty were returned, and all tabulated. 
The following form shows the questionnaire and 
explains the nature of the information sought. 
QUESTIONNAIRE TO BusINEss AND PROFESSIONAL MEN 
1. What proportion approximately of the letters you pro- 
duce in your business are written, what proportion 
spoken? (Letters written or typed by yourself are 
written, those dictated to a stenographer or dictaphone 
are spoken.)

If two exceptional letters be omitted from each list, 
the percentages of written English would drop respectively 
to 7, 9, and 8 percent, and that of spoken would rise to 
93, 91, and 92 per cent. 
Out of fifty answers, twenty-four reported all letters 
spoken; twenty, all other business spoken; and thirty-one, 
all speeches spoken. 
It may be pertinently observed that this questionnaire 
reached only the leaders in business and professional life, 
and omitted the large number of clerks, stenographers, 
and similarly employed persons whose work must be 
counted in a true estimate, and would swell the volume 
of written English. On the other hand, it left out of 
account social conversation, which should enter into 
all consideration of the factors of success, and which 
would greatly increase the proportion of spoken language. 
It may be remarked, moreover, that since high-school 
students are already educated far above the average 
of American adults, they may reasonably be expected 
as leaders to enter the field included in the questionnaire, 
which, while not of wide enough scope to supply a 
basis for conclusive evidence, is sufficient to supply 
a very significant indication. 
Thus it appears that a large proportion of the English 
language at present used in business and professional 
life is spoken. This fact has not been recognized by 
English teachers. \ 
_Another questionnaire was sent to all high schools in 
the United States in towns of over five thousand popula- 
tion, and to many in towns of the five-thousand class, as 
listed in the 1921 Directory of High Schools issued by the
-P-A-G-E-17

Bureau of Education at Washington. The object was to 
ascertain what the high schools were doing to prepare their 
stu dents to meet the requirements of the present social, 
business, and professional life. 
QUESTIONNAIRE TO ENGLISH TEACHERS

Of the 1,100 questionnaires sent out, 440 were returned 
— exactly forty per cent—an unusually large response, 
showing a general interest. But beyond this indication 
is another still more convincing: the fact that one hun- 
dred and sixty-eight busy English teachers took the 
trouble to give additional information. Nineteen wrote 
a page or more. Six sent outlines of their courses, and 
thirteen wrote separate letters. The tone of these special 
communications was of deep earnestness, sincerity in the 
desire to better the teaching of English, and enthusiasm 
for the work in spoken English. 
Only eighteen schools made no attempt in the direction 
of spoken English. 
Three hundred and eighty-nine claimed to give instruc- 
tion in spoken English. As one hundred and one, how- 
ever, admitted that the work was merely incidental, they 
were manifestly doing no more, probably, than correcting
-P-A-G-E-20
  | 
8 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
errors of grammar, pronunciation, and the like. Certainly 
they were not engaged in constructive, effective teaching 
of the spoken language. 
Two hundred and eighty-eight schools, therefore, or 
more than sixty-five per cent, were making conscious 
effort in the direction of training in mastering the lan- 
guage for speaking purposes. 
The following table shows the proportion of time 
devoted exclusively to spoken English in the four years

One thing stands out with unmistakable prominence. 
The large majority of schools reporting on this point give 
one-fifth of the time of their English classes, twenty per 
cent of their time, to instruction in spoken English, and 
set apart therefor a certain day in the week. Approxi- 
mately, then, seventy-one per cent of the schools give 
twenty per cent of the English time to spoken English; 
eleven per cent give more than twenty per cent. 
As to the number of students reached, two hundred 
and forty reported reaching all pupils, while fifty-seven 
reported reaching a smaller percentage. 
Thus it appears that most of the schools regard spoken 
English as belonging essentially to the work of the English
-P-A-G-E-21
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 9 
department, and are endeavoring to make it function for 
all classes and with every individual. As this is true for 
so many schools, so widely distributed, it cannot be 
doubted that spoken English has grown up in response to 
a need and a demand, and that the demand is rapidly 
growing stronger. 
As ninety per cent of the schools are carrying on their 
spoken English as an integral part of the English work, 
in the hands of the English teachers, it is manifest that 
the work in spoken English, occurring thus in every state 
in the Union, is a democratic movement among the 
teachers themselves. It is a response to a widespread 
demand, and originated in an effort to make language 
training meet the needs of youth living in a new day. 
Manifestly also, if the general practice at present in the 
more advanced and progressive schools is to give twenty 
per cent of their English time to spoken English, and if 
the requirements of business and professional life call for 
ninety per cent of spoken English, there must be further 
adjustment of the teaching of English language in the 
direction of the spoken if it is to function effectively. 
It is also evident that instead of spoken English being 
a requirement of the colleges put upon the high schools, 
it is a growth within the elementary and high schools. 
Its development there will surely react upon the colleges 
and universities with a demand for courses in spoken 
English for those who must teach it, and who desire the 
assistance of experts in, addition to what their own ability 
and vision have enabled them to devise. 
All teachers of English, as well as school executives, are 
awakening to a realization that the English language can 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
i 
10 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
no longer be taught in the traditional way, which gives the 
student a knowledge of the grammar and the rhetorical 
principles of the language and an understanding of how 
to write an essay (which, however, no one would pay for 
and publish and few would read gratis) but leaves him 
without the power to utilize for social purposes any 
knowledge he may have. 
They are further beginning to realize the need for 
definite preparation for the work of teaching spoken 
English, and are crying out for help and direction. 
It is the purpose of this book to supply them help and 
direction. Everything in it has been tested and tried and 
proved in actual classroom work. The kind of teach- 
ing described in it secures results. The students who 
are its products can talk effectively. It reveals to the 
teacher the fundamental principles underlying the teach- 
ing of spoken English, and suggests to him unlimited 
possibilities of application.
-P-A-G-E-23
CHAPTER II 
ENDS AND PURPOSES IN SPOKEN ENGLISH 
Training in the use of language. Spoken English is 
that division of English language whose object is mastery 
of the language for speaking purposes, directed by social 
needs. 
Spoken English is not to be confused with public speak- 
ing as commonly understood. It does not aim at teach- 
ing students to analyze, understand, and imitate master- 
pieces of oratory, or merely to prepare and deliver formal 
addresses—though students trained through spoken 
English are able to meet such a demand if it arises. _-Tt_ 
trains them to become skillful in the use of the language, 
to grow in mastery so that they can command it for use 
on all occasions. 
The power, the success, and the happiness of practically 
every person are conditioned largely upon his ability to 
talk well. , 
Good talking’ Note that good talking, as the term is 
used in this book, involves four elements: knowledge, 
thinking power, and ability to reach the audience, as 
well as command of language. } 
Vital communication between human beings comes 
largely through spoken language. One’s power is in 
proportion to one’s control of the lines of communication. 
Whoever aspires to succeed in business, to secure and 
maintain a standing among friends, or to be a leader in 
Il 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
12 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
any kind of human activity —in club or precinct meeting, 
church board or civic committee — will have his chances 
of success increased by the ability to talk when the time 
comes—to talk to the point, with force and convincing- 
ness and the moving power of persuasion. 
Speaking ability in business. Hundreds of manufac- 
turing concerns prosper because ultimately their products 
are sold through the talking power of their traveling 
salesmen. These men spend their days talking, knowing 
that upon their skill in the use of the language depend 
their living, the very existence of the commodity they 
sell, whether soap or automobiles, and the comfort or 
convenience of millions of people. 
“What about the mail-order business, chain stores, and 
the like?’’ suggests some one. ‘‘They seem to prosper 
without using spoken language.’’ They do seem to. 
But consider what an essential part the spoken lan- 
guage has in such businesses, since the one who con- 
ceived the initial idea had to interest capital in order to 
carry it out, and had to sell stock and complete a work- 
ing organization. 
It may seem as if engineers, of all people, deal with 
things and figures more than with language. Yet any 
engineer will tell you that it is indispensable to him to 
know how to direct his helpers with unmistakable clear- ° 
ness, and to win his patrons with persuasion; and that it 
is important to be able to speak with authority, foresight, 
and vision before his chapter of the American Association. 
Almost every craft and occupation has its organization 
in which the standing and influence of any member depend 
to a great extent upon his talking ability.
-P-A-G-E-25
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 13 
Social meetings—receptions, dinners, luncheons, ban- 
quets—are all occasions for speaking, where prestige and 
popularity depend to a great extent upon training in 
spoken language. 
Speaking ability in professions. It is generally recog- 
nized that the professions—law, medicine, the ministry, 
and teaching —are particularly bound up with the culti- 
vation of speaking ability. For the physician succeeds 
_ best, other things being equal, who knows how to address 
the Medical Association and at the same time is able to 
talk to a single patient in such a way as to inspire in him 
a feeling that his doctor knows, and will pull him through. 
The minister must reach his whole congregation with 
_ his sermons, must make hundreds of addresses at all kinds 
of meetings, and must keep members of every variety 
feeling enthusiastic or at least kindly in regard to the 
work of his church. 
In some branches of the law, the lawyer’s legal educa- 
tion counts for little unless he can express himself. 
‘In fact, all these build their success more upon talking | 
ability, as above defined, than 2 any other one th a 
save character. 
. The teacher ‘especially needs to be able to talk well. 
No matter what subject he teaches, he can double his 
usefulness if he is a master of English for speaking pur- 
poses. But some one may remark that most teachers 
talk too much already. Thisis true. Talking too much, 
however, is not talking well. Volubility, mere flow of 
words alone, does not constitute good talking. A mas- 
tery of spoken English involves thinking-power. Of all 
people, a teacher needs this kind of speaking ability.
-P-A-G-E-26
  14 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
He may teach arithmetic, manual training, or agri- 
culture, sociology or poetry: he cannot communicate with 
his pupils effectively save through spoken English. The 
lesson in history must serve to awaken the boy toa reali- 
zation of civic relations. The teacher of poetry, through 
the conjuring power of spoken language, must make the 
verses living things with power to touch living hearts. The 
principal must interview the superintendent and win his 
approval of new ideas for facilitating the work of regis- 
tration; affairs of the profession must be discussed at 
meetings of local, state, and national associations. 
Whoever hopes to make his way upward in his profes- 
sion of occupation; whoever desires to put to the widest 
and fullest use whatever he may possess of knowledge, 
experience, or ideas; whoever aspires to be a leader in 
civic affairs of community or nation, will find the reali- 
zation of his hopes advanced by the ability to talk well. 
Such ability does not come by nature or by merely 
incidental exercise. Witness the numbers of people who 
afflict the ears of the public or of their associates with talk 
that is rambling, feeble, pointless, without force, grace, 
or humor, and often seemingly without end! S be able 
to talk so as to command attention, to direet-thought, 
to sway opinion, and to call forth feeling that moves to 
action, requires study and thought and practice. And 
well does it repay every moment put upon it. 
Enlargement of vision. Not only does the study of 
spoken English result in social power for the individual 
through his increased ability to utilize what he knows 
in forceful and telling language: it does more. It greatly 
enlarges his knowledge and his vision.
-P-A-G-E-27

The subjects studied or discussed in a spoken-English 
class are not limited in range or variety or complexity 
by anything but his ability to cope with them. (They 
may lie in any field of knowledge, whether scientific or 
social, economic or governmental. )(Anything that relates 
to life or living interests he may use—anything whereby 
he may interest and influence his audience’) The amount 
of information gained through the preparation of his own 
talks, and by listening to those of other members of the 
class, will greatly enlarge his stock of usable knowledge. 
In working out his topics, he will learn of new sources 
of information and will become aware of movements in 
present-day life, and of currents in the sweep of history. 
He will get a better insight into the institutions of his 
country and his own responsibility in their workings. 
Development of thinking power. Along with this 
increase in usable knowledge and insight into the 
machinery of organized society, the student will develop 
his thinking power. There is no course in the curriculum 
better adapted to develop thinking power than spoken 
English. Mathematics has long been regarded as the best 
subject to develop power of thought. And it will, if 
properly studied, produce a certain logical habit of mind, 
a sense of orderly sequence complete from a point to a 
parallelepiped. But as a trainer for serviceable thinking, 
mathematics lacks certain advantages possessed by 
spoken English. 
In geometry, for example, the matter dealt with is 
mostly abstractions, not functioning directly in the daily 
experiences of most people. The activities of the mind 
move according to an unvarying set of axioms or
-P-A-G-E-28
  
  16 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
formulae, and the class work, as such, has little or no 
social significance. As in solitaire, the mind is work- 
ing to outwit itself according to the rules of the game. 
( In spoken English the materials of thought are facts 
of any kind, truths from any realm penetrated by the 
inquiries of humanity. |The mind moves to discover 
relations which it may utilize for a purpose that is vital. 
It taxes itself to present them in a way that will appeal 
not only to the mental perceptions, but to the emotions 
which enrich life—a complex that is invariably met in 
any real situation. And spoken English trains into the 
kind of thinking that takes into account a’ a factor the 
presence of other human beings—without which no 
thinking functions finally—and brings the resources of 
the mind into readiness for instant service. 
Any person standing before a crowd making a campaign 
speech presenting the issues of his party, subject to inter- 
tupting questions and refutations, must have thought 
thoroughly before he makes his appearance, and must 
think quickly when faced by a questioner. (For thinking 
is seeing relations, and a social situation ‘provides the 
most stimulating basis for live thinking. 
So the student of spoken English, dideie before his 
classmates, trying to convince them that his plan for 
an honor system for his school is going to effect great 
reforms if adopted, and answering questions or objections 
fired at him by the class, is getting his preparation 
for life situations. He is learning to think under con- 
ditions such as he is certain to encounter. He has to 
meet an instant demand, when there is no time to erase 
and revise.
-P-A-G-E-29
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 17 
Training for citizenship. Not only does the student 
get from spoken English a growth in thinking power, an 
increase of knowledge and a broadening of vision, and an 
enlargement of power and influence; he gains something 
more important than any of these in the training he gets 
for citizenship. 
He learns first of all not to be an unthinking follower of 
whatever is proposed. He sees that he must examine 
what is said to find if there is sufficient ground for accept- 
ing it—a fundamental thing for any voter. He inquires 
for the other side, and thereby shuns passionate and preju- 
diced opinion. He gets out of the habit of being a sitter 
merely, for he is trained to express his ideas for the good 
of public opinion as he sees it, and to add his part to 
any discussion. Having got into touch with the move- 
ments of civic life, he has a permanent interest in civic 
affairs that renders him an intelligent and active partici- 
pant. And having a mastery of the English language for 
speaking purposes, he is prepared in matters of citizenship 
to enter a situation with dynamic power. 
What is the place, then, of spoken English, and how 
can it be taught? It is the purpose of this book to 
answer these two questions.

  CHAPTER III 
VITALIZING CLASS WORK 
In all the field of teaching there is now probably no 
matter of greater importance, touching more subjects, 
affecting more people both as to their professional work 
and as to their individual power, and awakening more 
interest among teachers and school administrators, than. 
the question of how to vitalize the teaching of the English 
language. The importance of teaching the English lan- 
guage has long been recognized; but an appreciation of 
the possibilities that lie in the ends to be attained by a 
mastery of our native tongue for speaking purposes and 
a definite attempt to formulate those ends and discover 
a rmethod whereby they may be reached, have developed 
only recently. 
(Vitalizing the teaching of the English language means 
relating it directly with life, making it interesting. This 
spoken English does. \)Psychologically any study, work, 
task, or pursuit is filled with life, is vital or interesting 
for the one engaged therein, when, having before him 
an end which he desires to attain, he is able to make 
progress in the activity which will carry him toward 
his object. Note the elements necessary: an end or 
object; a desire to attain it; and active progress through 
work. It is the purpose of this chapter to show how 
these elements may be supplied in the teaching of spoken 
English, 
18
-P-A-G-E-31
Spoken English and How to Teach It 19 
Actually or in practice, the vitalizing of English- 
language class work through spoken English means that 
in the class the use of the language shall be as nearly as 
possible like the best in actual life —‘‘best’’ meaning most 
appropriate and effective; the situations shall be real, and 
the ends sought genuine. In other words, the motives 
actuating the speakers shall be those of real life. It can 
be done. The purpose of this chapter is to show how. 
Relation to audience. One of the chief character- 
istics of spoken English of which the student first becomes 
aware is that the audience or hearers must be taken into 
account. He is not merely talking; he is talking to some- 
body, and he is expected to get results. This is a new 
thought and a new experience to many people who had 
regarded English-language work as the production of a 
series of exercise-compositions, a sort of treadmill process, 
like turning a grindstone, that would somehow give them 
a skill which sometime they might put into use. The 
discovery of the audience revolutionizes the whole pro- 
ceeding. The thing is to be done now, now or never, and 
results are immediate. 
_. Manifestly, then, the speaker must study his audience. 
(He must direct what he has to say to real live people 
sitting before him; convince them if he can; make them 
understand—a difficult task; cause them to act—still 
more difficult; entertain them; make them feel. Here 
are fifteen, twenty, perhaps thirty people of different 
ages and attainments, each with already a hundred inter- 
ests on which his mind is eager to run if given a few 
moments of leisure. The speaker must make him forget 
all about his other classes — the letter he has just received 
3  
-P-A-G-E-32
    
20 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
—the one he will write next period —the pretty girl just 
across the aisle—the paper due in economics —even his 
own speech which may come next. The speaker must 
drive all these thoughts away, and make what he has to 
say the most important thing in the world for the time 
being. , 
“Why,” wonders a student, ‘‘did my talk fall so flat? 
Iam sure I spent plenty of time in preparation. I worded 
it carefully. I planned the introduction and the con- 
clusion. Every step was logical. It was unified; it was 
based upon facts, well authenticated, and it was well 
supplied with illustrations, yet there was little applause, 
and no one arose to discuss the question, which I am sure 
was a most important one!” 
““What, please, was your subject?” 
““Teachers’ salaries.” 
‘And what was the theme of your talk?” 
“TI was proving that teachers’ salaries ought to be 
raised.” 
“And who made up your audience?”’ 
“Why, they were practically all teachers!” 
“Would you teach a fish to swim? That was no ques- 
tion to them. That was a settled fact—settled a long 
time ago, and still settled —they were already informed, 
already convinced, and doubtless all engaged in activities 
tending to promote that elevation of salaries you advo- 
cated. Your speech had all the excellencies you men- 
tioned, yet it was of absolutely no value, because you 
failed to consider your audience.’’ 
A student, a very capable young man, once came to his 
teacher saying that he had been asked to make a talk in
-P-A-G-E-33
Spoken English and How to Teach It 21 
Sunday school the following Sunday, and would be glad 
to have any suggestion that might be given him. The 
pastor of the church he attended believed that every 
member of the church should engage in some form of 
church work, and had put on an “‘every member” cam- 
paign, one feature of which was to be this four-minute 
talk before the Sunday school. 
“What are you planning to say?” 
“Well, in four minutes I thought I couldn’t do more 
than show them the importance of the work, and the need 
of the services of all the young people, and urge them to 
come regularly and enlist for something. Of course, I 
should have to think up some attractive, concrete way to 
put it.” 
“About how many of the young people will be there?” 
“Probably about half that belong to the church—the 
rest don’t even attend. They are the ones we are after.” 
“You will have about half of them present. Your 
talk, though, is really addressed to those who will be 
absent. Why not talk to the ones who are there?” 
“Well, yes” (very thoughtfully). ‘‘But they are 
already attending and taking part!” 
“Don’t you think they might be able to help get the 
rest interested?” 
“They’d be about the only ones who could do it.” 
“Then why not consider the audience you will have, 
and spend your four minutes talking to them about what 
you want them to do?” 
He did it. 
But through taking into consideration his audience, 
the young man produced a speech which was entirely
-P-A-G-E-34
Be MIR Pe ec fair ce en am 
22 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
different from the one which he had at first contem- 
plated making. 
A student in planning a talk should ask himself the 
following questions: 
1. Of whom is my audience composed? 
2. Is my subject a good one, considering to whom I am to | 
talk? 
3. Have I treated that subject, and have I chosen my illus- 
trations, with that audience in mind? 
4. What is the purpose of my speech; or, what end or object 
do I wish to attain through it? 
A student acquires a new feeling of independence and 
responsibility, when he realizes that the audience for the 
time being belongs to him to inform or to sway or to 
entertain. He is stimulated to do his best when he 
knows that the situation is his to handle, that he must 
set the atmosphere and control his hearers; and that he 
must see to it that in the time allotted to him progress 
is made and he and the class get somewhere. 
The teacher should say to his students: ‘‘ While you are 
speaking, the class belongs to you. If you are tiresome, 
the teacher will not hinder them from going to sleep. 
You must do that You must see to it that they are kept 
| attentive and alert. And if what you are doing does not 
keep them so, change and try something else. Study your 
| audience beforehand when you choose your theme, con- 
sider them when you frame its expression in words; and 
watch them constantly while you talk, to see how they 
| take it.” 
Setting definite ends. Much oral composition work 
is uninteresting because the speaker is not talking  
-P-A-G-E-35
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 23 
toward any definite end. He has no purpose other than 
to perform when his time comes. He has no particular 
reason for talking except that he wants to improve himself 
in English, and he has never realized that it is possible 
to achieve the improvement and something else at the 
same time. Many students have difficulty in finding 
subjects about which to talk, the difficulty being not that 
they know little (for anyone who has lived ten years in 
this world, and is possessed of ordinary intelligence, has 
a stock of information on which to draw that is sufficient 
for hundreds of two-, three-, or five-minute talks), but 
that they do not know how to select an object or purpose 
and organize what they know around that purpose as a 
center. Hence the unaccustomed speaker so often selects 
a subject and material in which he himself has no particu- 
lar interest, presents them without impressiveness because 
he is without an object, and leaves his hearers with the 
feeling that there was no point.! 
Such subjects as the following, used without taking 
into consideration a purpose in connection with the audi- 
ence, are examples of the pointless sort: 
1. A Visit to a Coal Mine. 
2. How Sugar is Made. 
3. Sports. 
4. A Day at the Fair. 
5. My First Day at School. 
After having studied his audience, the next thing for 
the speaker to consider is the end or object toward 
which the speech is to be directed. 
1An excellent analysis of this subject may be found in Phillips’ Effective 
Speaking, Chapter II, ‘General Ends,” and in the table, on p. 223 of the same 
book,
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
One of the following, carefully predetermined, and 
kept in mind during the preparation and delivery of 
the talk, will give it point —that definite something that 
leaves the audience knowing where it has arrived, and the 
speaker feeling he has accomplished his purpose. 
Clearness. (The object. of the talk is to make sure 
that people understand); No matter what it may be: 
a process of manufacture, the structure of a plant, 
the relation of events in a historical crisis, a philo- 
sophical concept, a plan for the improvement of a part 
of the educational system—the speaker strives to leave 
no essential part of his topic vague or shadowy, to 
afford no possibility of a misconception or misunder- 
standing. He goes, however, no further. He is now no 
advocate, urging the acceptance of any particular view 
or attitude toward the information given out. That he 
leaves to the discretion of his listeners. He is content 
that they know. 
Entertainment. \. Here the object of the talk is to 
divert, to amuse, to provide recreation through whole- 
some nonsense or through detached interest, as in a story 
apart from social or moral significance. This is an impor- 
tant and valuable, though generally neglected, object of 
speaking. Every worker merits rest and amusement — 
especially the mental worker. Whoever can provide 
mental diversion is welcomed by all who have enough of 
the spirit of youth to rebound occasionally from respon- 
sibility. The ability to produce a talk of this kind is 
much more common than is generally supposed, and any 
class that is led to see the distinctions of end or purpose 
in talks will surprise and delight both teacher and class
-P-A-G-E-37
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 25 
with entertaining speeches as varied as the personality 
of its members. 
Action. (The purpose is to affect conduct. This is 
the end, immediate or ultimate, of probably a large major- 
ity of talks. | Most of the discussions of current questions 
are for the purpose of directing either individual or con- 
certed action. ) Why otherwise spend time talking about 
disarmament, the race problem, immigration, open shop, 
paving projects, and the next election issues, except as 
we hope more wisely to act our own part as concerned, or 
to join with others in determining a social or national 
policy? Our greatest detestation is given to the grouch — 
why? Because he talks constantly about these present, 
important questions without intending to change his own 
conduct, and without hope or expectation or intention of 
leading to any change of conditions through action on the 
part of anyone else. 
The student of spoken English should carefully deter- 
mine whether his object is to be immediate action or 
ultimate change in conduct. ; 
If the latter, his end may be reached by one or the 
other, or by a combination, of two methods. ( He may 
strive to affect opinion by persuasion and reasoning; or he 
may mold ideals and sentiments by arousing purifying 
emotions. Much has been said by psychologists against 
the stirring of emotion which is allowed to abate or 
evaporate without any result in action, such as is fre- 
quently effected by the stage, the picture shows, and 
sometimes by sermons. Such fruitless reveling in feelings, 
sometimes to the extent of tears, has been labeled, 
justly, dissipation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
A legitimate appeal to emotion is made, however, 
whenever the speaker thereby can purify the spiritual 
perceptions and strengthen sentiment which cements the 
social structure in kindlier relations. The effort to affect 
opinion, too, is a legitimate end, for individual or public 
opinion must be behind all conduct or any movements. 
The difference between clearness as a purpose of a speaker, 
and persuasion or convincing that is affecting opinion, is 
that clearness stops with understanding, while conviction 
relates to life by pointing out the use to be made of the 
knowledge, or its bearing upon conduct. The opinion 
talk itself stops short of indicating the definite applica- 
tion of any conviction produced. This last becomes the 
end of immediate action. 
A talk intended to secure immediate action must be 
aimed at a definite thing to be done, must be adapted to 
the audience as to its abilities in the line pointed out, and 
must emphasize action that can be begun at once. Such 
a talk may embody an effort to sway opinion, or an appeal 
to the emotions, but both are directed toward securing 
results in immediate action. In short, this kind of pur- 
pose carries the speaker and the hearers a step further 
than any of the others, and the speaker may employ any 
of the foregoing ends as part of its process. 
Under the general head of ‘‘Good Roads,” for example, 
the subject in different aspects might be treated from the 
viewpoint of each of the ends in turn. 
For entertainment: ‘‘My Experience on the . . . . County 
Roads.” 
For cultivation of public opinion: ‘‘The Relation of Good 
Roads to Rural Schools.” 
For immediate action: ‘Vote for the Good Roads Bonds.”

_o Discussions and voting. C Much of the talk that fills 
ay I our daily lives outside of school is the discussion of. 
matters of current interest on which each airs his own 
‘opinion, learns that of his neighbor, gets new view- 
points, rubs off his angularities, and, in proportion to 
his intelligence and his open-mindedness, arrives at a 
just conclusion of the matter discussed. G Such dis- 
cussions may be transferred to the classroom of spoken 
English, where they not only insure an atmosphere of 
genuineness and live interest, but become centers of 
stimulus and enthusiasm. ) 
Bearing in mind his audience and determining before- 
hand the purpose or object he will pursue, the student 
is allowed to select a topic of present-day interest and 
importance, the more nearly related to the audience the 
better, but capable of arousing differences of opinion. 
Each student in the class prepares a talk of say three 
minutes, in which he presents the matter as he sees it, 
closing with a motion. As soon as the speaker has 
finished, the student who is presiding opens the question 
to discussion, allowing five minutes’ discussion to each 
three-minute speech, but permitting no one to speak 
more than one minute, nor anyone to appear twice on 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 29 
the same question. At the end of the discussion the 
class votes on the motion. 
This arrangement permits great flexibility, as the 
length of the speeches can be adjusted to the size and 
ability of the class.. It provides variety, in that five to 
eight subjects may be presented in an hour, The work 
never drags, for if one topic does not arouse discussion, it 
is closed and another immediately introduced.) There is 
no fear that material will give out, for no class is likely to 
be smaller than ten, and it is impossible to get into a class 
period as many as ten talks of three minutes each, with 
their discussions. 
( The difficulty is likely to come from the other direc- 
tion, namely, that the students will prepare talks and not 
be called upon to give them. ) Then the trouble will be 
to keep them busy with preparation. How this may be 
done will be shown a little later. 
\ The plan furthermore permits practice in two kinds of 
talking:'! extemporaneous, in the prepared three-minute 
speech; and impromptu, in the one-minute discussions. 
It stirs such interest and arouses such enthusiasm that 
frequently half the class are on their feet at once trying 
to get the floor. Often they wish to prolong the discus- 
sion beyond the allotted time. Such extension may be 
governed by the discretion of the teacher, who should 
be careful here, for every such extension, in a large 
class, takes from some student the chance to present 
his prepared speech, and if permitted often would 
tend to discourage preparation. ( It is better not to 
1Extemporaneous means planned as to material and organization, with 
wording chosen at the moment of speaking. Impromptu means offhand.
-P-A-G-E-42
30 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
exhaust interest, but to dismiss the class while its mem- 
bers are still eager to talk.) 
It will readily be seen that the impromptu talking is 
optional. ( Impromptu speaking should seldom, if ever, 
be required, for often it would result in embarrassment 
to a student who has no ideas on the subject (if he did, 
he would be ready enough to express them). It will 
make the timid wretched, and will lose most of its 
resemblance to talk outside the classroom. On the other 
hand, if voluntary it leaves everyone feeling free. (It 
often leads the self-conscious to forget themselves, and 
it puts a premium on quickness of thought and action, 
in that the same person may speak on every topic if he 
has the enterprise to get the floor. \Of course some will 
get four times the practice others get. | They have four 
times the ability and ambition. 
The following is a list of such topics, actually selected 
and used in a college class: 
1. Why study Latin? 
2. Physical education should be optional in this College. 
3. Soldiers’ Bonus. 
4. Negro Education. 
5. Men should be called Master before marriage, Mister 
afterwards. £ 
. Misquoting others. 
. Pupils making 90 or over in studies should be exempt 
from examination. 
8. This College should maintain a book exchange. 
9. Free Textbooks in Public Schools. 
to. Bachelors should be taxed. 
11. Free individual drinking cups should be furnished by 
this College. aoa
-P-A-G-E-43

12. The franchise in the United States should be limited to 
those who can speak English. 
13. Buy a fireless cooker. 
A change may be introduced at the discretion of the 
teacher -— though the class work just described will not 
pall for a good while—and the difficulty above men- 
tioned of keeping the class busy with preparation of 
talks between class hours may be met, by having now 
and then all talks on a given day based upon the same 
subject. The determination of the topic thus. treated 
may grow naturally out of class work or it may be 
suggested by the teacher. 
As an instance of the first method, a student one day 
gave a talk which aroused much discussion on the subject 
“Race Relations in the South.” The class voted to take 
that topic, make a study of it, and each prepare a five- 
minute talk for a class period four days ahead. They 
ransacked the library, consulted the professor who was 
giving a course in Race Relations, informed themselves 
at least better than before on facts and conditions, and 
when the day came were so eager to present what they 
knew and what they thought, that several pleaded for 
more time than five minutes, and talked better than they 
had ever talked before. Many wanted another session 
on the subject; and some stayed to discuss the subject 
still further among themselves and with the teacher. 
In case such spontaneous development as is shown 
in the instance above does not occur, the teacher may 
divide the class into groups and allow say five minutes 
for consultation.) Each group may present one or 
more topics upon which they have agreed as being of
-P-A-G-E-44
    32 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
i 
importance, and have the topics written on the board 
and voted upon by the class, selecting three or four for 
concerted work. 
( Or, to vary the matter still further, the teacher may 
prepare a list of forty or fifty such topics and assign ten 
for the first day, allowing each student to choose within 
the ten, and seeing to it that too many do not take the 
same one. (Several talks on the same subject, however, 
rarely grow tiresome, as the treatment is varied.) ( The 
following day assign the next ten in similar manner, and 
so on until each student has had three or four assign- 
ments,” This plan insures variety and also provides, 
in large classes, against allowing those who have not 
been called upon to rest on speeches already prepared 
instead of preparing new ones. >) 
The following is a list of topics suitable for such treat- 
ment: 
1. You had better work for a degree than take only what 
you like. | 
2. You ought to stop drinking coffee. 
3. You should exercise every day. 
4. Treat yourself to some new clothes. 
5. Teach a class in Sunday school. 
6. Buy our typewriter and learn to use it.

Topics used for study by the entire class should of

Immediate perception of results. One of the impor- 
tant advantages of the procedure described above is that 
to both speaker and audience the failure or the success 
of a speech is largely manifest at once, and is an integral 
part of the work. A motion which arouses no discus- 
sion evidently appeals to no one, and the fault cannot 
be laid to the audience —not all of them can be stupid 
or asleep at the same time. It can be the fault of no one 
but the speaker, and he must discover the cause and 
see to it that his next effort shall overcome the difficulty. 
On the other hand, if the speech starts enthusiastic 
“support and opposition, the speaker is immediately sure 
that he has been successful in his choice of a subject; 
  while the arguments launched against his, or confirming “ 
and supplementing his, will reveal to him the force or 
the weakness of his speech. Meanwhile everyone in the 
{
-P-A-G-E-47
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It as 
class is absorbing at the same time knowledge of the sub- 
ject and of human nature, and a perception of the 
meaning of effective speaking. 
(Questions by the teacher will also reveal much as to 
the actual results gained by the speakers.) A student 
who was an interesting speaker made an appeal to the 
class in behalf of the mountain schools of East Tennessee 
and West North Carolina, presenting conditions in that 
section vividly, showing the needs of the children, and 
closing with the motion that all should help to improve 
their educational facilities. With little or no discussion, 
the motion was unanimously carried. The interest of 
the speaker was undoubtedly genuine, and her knowledge 
of affairs could have been obtained only through personal 
experience or observation. The class was manifestly 
impressed. 
“What,’’ asked the teacher indicating a man in the 
class, ‘‘do you intend to do about this matter?” 
“Well, I don’t know, exactly; but I think that people 
with as much native ability as they have, situated where 
they cannot help themselves, ought to be helped.”’ 
“And you,” to another. ‘‘Do you intend to go there 
to teach?”’ 
“No; I have already signed a contract for another 
school.” 
“How many expect to subscribe to the support of these 
schools?” 
No volunteers. 
Turning to the speaker: ‘‘These people voted for your 
motion. You must have expected them to do something. 
What did you want them to do?” 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
       English and How to Teach It 
After some hesitation, she rose, and said, ‘‘I wanted 
them to see that the schools need good teachers, and— 
well, yes, I move that the members of this class offer 
themselves as teachers for these schools.” 
When the issue was thus made clear, the motion was 
unanimously defeated. 
Another student, a public-health officer, enthusiastic 
for the promotion of cleanliness and the prevention of 
disease, made a talk advocating the cultivation of public 
opinion against spitting on sidewalks, and closed with the 
motion that all members of the class should pledge them- 
selves to remonstrate with anyone whom they might see 
expectorating on the sidewalk. 
It was a clear, strong talk in favor of a measure intended 
to benefit society, and the aim was very direct and very 
definite. 
The vote was overwhelmingly for the motion. It 
looked like a great success. 
But a few questions revealed the weakness, which this 
time lay in the thought of both speaker and voters—or 
rather lack of thought. 
“Now, you have asked these people to promise to 
_remonstrate with any person whom they may see expec- 
torating on the sidewalk. Suppose tomorrow morning 
as you pass the Union Station you should see a man 
spitting, what would you say to him?” 
“Well, I would tell him that spitting by persons with 
communicable disease is likely to spread contagion, and 
endanger the lives of other people!” 
“And suppose he replied that he had no communicable 
disease? Or suppose he became offended and answered
-P-A-G-E-49
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 37 
you rudely? Remember, you have every one promised 
that every time —” 
It was unnecessary to gofurther. The speaker changed 
her motion, and the class rescinded its vote. 
It may be asked, What have these things to do with the 
teaching of the English language? Are we not wandering 
wide of the subject? By no means. (Our subject is 
making class work in the teaching of English vital, 
and it is the omission of considerations like these that 
makes much class work so barren of results. A study 
of human relations such as are involved in the above 
instances will revolutionize much of the talking which 
is oftentimes considered acceptable, but which for any 
practical purpose is foolish or futile. 
The speakers learned that almost’anybody will assent 
to any proposition having general moral bearing, but 
that definiteness of purpose is necessary if that assent is 
to have any meaning; while the class learned that before 
voting on a motion it is wise to inquire into the meaning 
of the proposition. 
Further questions by the teacher, such as the following, 
can be adapted to many situations: 
“What was the end intended by the last speaker?” 
(Ask five or six.) 
Perhaps all answer, ‘‘Clearness.”’ 
“Very well, what did he wish to make clear?” 
Here may come in unanimity or much variety, measur- 
ing the success of the speaker in reaching the various 
intelligences before him. 
“What illustrations did the speaker use?” 
“What point did he impress?”
-P-A-G-E-50

Such questions cultivate close attention on the part of 
the listeners, while the answers are frequently a revelation 
to the speaker. j 
Parliamentary procedure, Organizing the class by 
election of a president, vice-president, and secretary, so 
that much of the class work can proceed under parlia- 
mentary usage, with an occasional parliamentary drill, 
is a long step toward vitalizing spoken English.) Its 
many advantages are readily apparent. It furnishes a 
situation which is that of real life, for wherever people 
meet to carry on common or social business, parliamentary 
order is taken for granted; and the habit of addressing 
the chair before beginning a speech, which is everywhere 
customary and courteous, becomes easily habitual. ( It 
lessens the constraint sometimes felt in the relation of 
teacher and pupil, in that it enables the teacher, in the 
réle of director and critic, to be forgotten and, by putting 
power into the hands of the class, makes the students 
feel the force of their own initiative in a democratic 
unity.) When once they understand the simplicity of the 
ordinary parliamentary order, they see that it at the same 
time restrains the forward and reassures the timid. 
The teacher may place before the class the choice of 
having parliamentary drill or not, according to whether 
the members already feel themselves proficient enough, or 
are conscious of the need of further practice. There are 
few classes that will not at once acknowledge the lack 
and profess a desire for instruction. Where there are 
those who object, or who already are well versed, they 
may be enlisted by being made referees—a tribute to 
their more advanced knowledge which makes it possible  
-P-A-G-E-51
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 39 
for their presence to be a distinct advantage and at the 
same time a means of insuring their diligent application 
to the study of Robert’s Rules of Order. 
It is understood that a parliamentary drill means)more 
than an explanation of terms and procedure by teacher 
or students, though such discussion may be valuable; it 
means actually conducting a meeting and transacting 
business in parliamentary order/ The matter of the 
business may be suggested or supplied by the teacher, 
who may distribute to the class slips of paper on which 
are several different motions, numbered, and varied, 
insuring that each student have some part in the work; 
but this method is not to be recommended for any but 
the most inexperienced. It is much better to let each 
contribute voluntarily his part to the business of the 
hour. Do not be afraid of the introduction of nonsense 
here. |The business must of necessity be feigned or 
assumed anyway, and the practice in correct procedure 
can be gained from nonsensical motions as well as from 
serious ones. There is no psychologist who will insist 
that pleasure or enjoyment make the memory less lasting, 
or that a good laugh interferes with the intensity of the 
impression. 
In order that all, or as many as possible, may get 
practice in presiding, the elected president of the class, 
after a few days, may call to the chair each day a new 
member as temporary presiding officer; and, during a 
drill, the teacher may change the presiding officer every 
few minutes.) Through presiding for five-minute drills 
with an enterprising and enthusiastic class, a student can 
learn a great deal,
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
Card catalogue of class. Acquaintance of the members 
of a class with each other will promote a democratic 
spirit and a feeling of ease and harmony in working 
together, and enable them to utilize the resources of the 
class to the best adventage. A card catalogue containing 
information regarding each member, placed where it will 
be available to the entire class, as in the library, will do 
much to familiarize the students with the names of their 
classmates and with other data that further acquaintance 
and increase respect. It will assist the presiding officer 
in appointing committees and in utilizing the knowledge, 
abilities, or experience of his members; and it will be of 
help to any one of them to whom falls the duty of intro- 
ducing the speakers when five-minute speeches fill the 
program. 
A blank for securing the desired data may be formu- 
lated by a committee appointed for this purpose, sub- 
mitted to the class, and voted upon. The following is 
suitable for a college class, and may be modified or 
adapted to fit any class:

Travel   
  
  
  
  
  
  
The introducer. (When the class work consists of 
speeches four or five minutes long, especially when the
-P-A-G-E-53
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 4 
subjects are chosen by the members individually and are 
not known to the rest of the class, one member of the class 
may be selected to introduce the speakers.) His time 
should not exceed five minutes, and shouldbe so appor- 
tioned as to include a general introduction of about one 
minute devoted to the subject and the series of speakers 
as a whole; with four minutes divided among those who 
appear before the class that day. 
(It is the function of the introducer to create an atmos- 
phere of pleasant anticipation of what the audience will 
hear.) Hence he may direct their minds toward the sub- 
jects of the speakers, or indicate anything on the part of 
the speakers that gives them authority through distinction 
or special knowledge./ /The introducer must be careful, 
however, not to trespass on the ground of the speaker’s 
subject, and should avoid all personal detail, anecdote, 
or reminiscence that does not directly contribute toward 
the end described above. In his general introduction he 
should avoid unrelated stories, however laughable or 
clever, merely for the purpose of creating good humor, 
remembering that his time is short, and that every word 
of his should direct attention to what is coming. In 
his direct introduction of a speaker he should avoid 
personalities that might be embarrassing to the one intro- 
duced! (An introducer should not comment on a speech 
after the speaker has finished.| \ No commendation of his 
can enhance any favorable i impression already made, but 
ve the contrary is almost sure to detract from the effect. 
The advantages of having an introducer, aside from 
the practice which the students get in a form of speaking 
for which any of them may be called upon later outside the
-P-A-G-E-54
42 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
classroom, are that it helps to make the situation real 
- and gives distinction to the speakers introduced.) To the 
introducer as well as to’ those on the program frequently 
it gives opportunity for rapid thinking and adaptation; 
for sometimes a new speaker is unexpectedly introduced 
into the group and must be included with smoothness 
and graciousness; and the remarks of the introducer must 
be connected by the speaker with the introduction of his 
own speech. {If the introducer has said something inappro- 
priate, tending to make one uncomfortable, there is 
opportunity for the person introduced to cover the crude- 
ness with skill and restore good feeling. ) i 
Adaptation of work to correction of faults. Faults 
in speaking may be grouped under two general heads: 
first, those of habit, due to carelessness, ignorance, or bad 
taste; second, those of temperament. 
( Mistakes and errors of habit may be corrected by the 
instruction, inspiration, and example of the teachers 
and by unremitting drill.) But those of temperament are 
harder to reach, both because they are deeper seated and 
because they are harder to bring to consciousness. A 
fault or weakness once recognized as such is on the way 
toward cure; but people are unaware of their constitu- 
tional failings because these failings are essentially a part 
of their way of looking at life. It is not a very difficult 
matter to induce a student to change his pronunciation 
of a word, for by a little drill and practice himself, and a 
few repetitions by the teacher and other members of the 
class, he realizes that president’, residence’, and similar 
pronunciations are not quite what cultured people say, 
that chuldrun, Jeruzalum, and whut are incorrect. Those,
-P-A-G-E-55
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 43 
however, who are temperamentally quick, or correspond- 
ingly slow, find it hard to realize that their manner of 
speech is nearly unintelligible on account of rapid and 
indistinct utterance, or tiresome because it is too delib- 
erate. Students affected by these constitutional weak- 
nesses need something beyond telling and correction and 
pointing out. It takes something that goes deeper to 
be of help to them. But they may be reached by an 
adaptation of work to their peculiar and individual needs. 
A student who is constitutionally phlegmatic, and never, 
speaks with sufficient animation, may be spurred to life’. , i 
and show of spirit by debate, especially if chosen to repre- 
sent a class or section of a class. \A desire to succeed” 
for the sake of those who elected him, together with the 
excitement of a contest, -will arouse him to a liveliness 
never before experienced. 
The over-deliberate may be appointed to preside, par- 
ticularly at parliamentary drills, when the success of the 
meeting depends largely upon the speed with which the 
chairman keeps things moving. Debate, with limited 
time, often will also work wonders with this type. 
(The timid are encouraged by success, and should have 
opportunity to take part in impromptu speaking, where 
they lose themselves in interest in the subject; and, if 
capable, should be given leading parts where they will 
be obliged to rise to the occasion and do the thing well. 
A consciousness of success gives confidence, and practice 
will do the rest. 
To speak of a person as constitutionally affected, or 
naturally artificial, seems a contradiction, but is meant 
to describe those who without conscious effort give the
-P-A-G-E-56
{ fe 
44 Spoken English and How to Teach It | 
effect, by their manner, of elocution. Sometimes this 
manifests itself in stiffness and solemnity, sometimes in 
too much smiling and unnecessary motion. In either 
ee the attitude, and often the voice, will be artificial 
\ and strained. Often the cause isfound to be the very 
é py Jy opposite of what it seems to be. \ Instead of a desire for 
display, there is often a deep-lying self-consciousness or 
nervousness, which requires very careful handling and 
utmost tact.\) The work needed by these students is the 
same as that which is beneficial for the ordinary timid)— 
leading parts which stimulate self-forgetfulness in “the 
importance of the thing to be done; and discussion, both 
impromptu or offhand, and extemporaneous or prepared, 
of questions of moment and interest. 
The quiet or undemonstrative students, who speak 
as if the matter, while well mastered and prepared, 
were of no moment at all to anyone else; who take 
too mental a view of things, and decline to get at all 
excited about anything, and who generally are without 
impressiveness, may be helped out of the crust that 
enwraps them—for usually they have fine and strong 
feeling too rigorously repressed —by some kind of make- 
believe. One such student, having been criticized by 
his instructor for lack of animation and force, reasoned 
with himself about the situation as follows: 
“My talks lack force. They do not get across to my 
audience. Now, what kind of talkers need force?” 
“‘Salesmen have to have it.” 
“What kind of salesmen are the very brassiest talkers 
there are?”’ 
“Book agents have that reputation.”
-P-A-G-E-57
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 45 
“Very well, then—a book agent I will be, and I will 
sell that class some books, or die—no, they shall die!’’ 
He planned his talk with all the seductive persuasion 
he could muster, and sent it toward the class like the 
charge of a tank. When he got through the class was 
clamoring for the book, and that student was never 
again found fault with on the ground of lack of animation. 
Options. Classes in spoken English should frequently 
be allowed choice as to phases of work to be undertaken, 
manner of proceeding, and like matters. /As subject 
matter is unlimited, and a great variety of subjects are 
pressing for notice, option as to what shall occupy the 
time of the class in discussion always tends to increase 
interest and pleasure in the class work. ’) Thus, out of the 
list on page 34, only five, perhaps, can be utilized. If 
voted upon by the class instead of being assigned by the 
teacher, the subjects will give the students not only the 
satisfaction of personal election, but Daas stimulus of the 
approval of the majority of the class. /Of the many phases 
of the work, such as five-minute talks, three-minute dis- 
cussions, debates, exercises for distinctness, parliamentary 
drill, after-dinner speeches, pronunciation, conversation, 
carriage, and platform conduct, only a part can be 
selected for work during any term or for any course. | 
It is productive of good results to allow the class to elec 
what shall fill part of the time, especially if it be a class 
of more mature people, for they often know their needs 
better than the teacher can. He must see to it that they 
get the essential training demanded by the course offered. 
But he may say: ‘‘We have now three weeks remaining 
‘of this term. We can spend it on a continuation of what
-P-A-G-E-58
i ! 
46 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
we have been doing, or we can devote it to after-dinner 
or introductory speeches. You may choose whatever 
you think will best fit your needs.” 
Conversation. There is no one but will readily 
grant that practically everyone every day has occasion 
to take part in conversation; nor will anyone deny the 
social value of ability to converse well.( A welcome is 
given to the entertaining talker, and power is in the hands 
of any person well informed and capable of expressing his 
knowledge and opinions with clarity and charm. \ The 
accomplishment of being a good conversationalist is gen- 
erally looked upon as a gift of nature, like curly hair or a 
true ear for music, and no effort is made directly to 
cultivate it. But it is truly an accomplishment that may 
‘be gained through effort and practice, and the spoken- 
English class is the place where it may be acquired. All 
the conditions of genuineness can be easily arranged, and 
each student may feel the pleasure of entertaining his 
friends while fulfilling the requirements of the English 
course. 
The class should be divided into groups of five or six, 
according to the size of the room and the number in the 
class—enough in the group to insure variety and the 
inspiration of different personalities, but not more than 
can easily hear each other when other near-by groups are 
talking. A leader, who takes the part of host or hostess, 
should be appointed for each group, and the members of 
the group determined by the teacher, who can thus make 
sure that no group becomes a clique, and that those whose 
abilities or needs demand it may have the responsibilities 
of leadership or opportunities for new contacts. Thus
-P-A-G-E-59
Spoken English and How to Teach It 47 
the timid or backward.may be placed beside the ready 
and the gracious; the forward but careless may be coun- 
teracted by the able and well-poised; while the self- 
conscious may be led to forget himself through the con- 
sciousness that the pleasure and profit of his group 
depend upon his skillful and tactful leadership. 
Hindrances to good conversation. The Monopo- 
lizer may be entertaining for a short time, or even for 
a long time or every time— but he is sure death to con- 
versation. For conversation is essentially an inter- 
change, a give and take, made up of contributions. No 
one, however brilliant, should be suffered to occupy the 
whole time, nor even a great part of the time, except of 
course on such occasions as honor a special guest. Con- 
versation in the hands of the Monopolizer becomes a 
monologue or a lecture — interesting, illuminating perhaps 
—pbut not conversation. Everyone must take part, as 
well balanced a part as can naturally be achieved. »s 
On the other hand, there is the Silent One. He often 
has the merit of supplying a ready listener, but he should 
supply more than merely intelligent glances. For his 
continued silence makes everyone else uncomfortable, 
and his example, if followed by everyone, would be even 
more disastrous than that of the Monopolizer. 
Another objectionable person is the Shop Talker. He 
is the one who, not a master of his occupation but mas- 
tered by it, cannot rule his faculties to pleasant recreation, 
or forget his business in matters of common social inter- 
est, but must be talking about its details, often in the 
technical jargon of his work; or, even if beguiled into 
discussion of a neutral matter, still must draw from his  
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
work all his illustrations. \ Besides being a sign of narrow- 
ness and a signal of neurotic auto-intoxication, shop talk 
is also a badge of self-importance. 
There is another type encountered occasionally, fitly 
called the Bitter Ender, who, having once launched forth 
upon a topic, generally a narrative, cannot be induced 
to relinquish it until the end is reached. Others, weary 
of the long recital, may by stratagem turn the conver- 
sation into new channels by question or comment; or, 
not so delicate, may interrupt with new matter; all to no 
purpose. No sooner is there pause, than, taking up the 
narration at the exact point where he left off, the Bitter 
Ender resumes the story, and makes it a complete thing. 
Now, conversation is not a complete thing. It is 
a tossing back and forth, a game of chance, of which 
no one can foresee the outcome, and therein lies its charm. 
It challenges all our wit and fancy and calls forth 
anecdote and illustration; it calls as if by conjury from 
forgotten recesses of the mind anything that will adorn 
the moment. \Every genuine conversation should sur-. 
prise each participant, his own part in it most of all. 
And while each should come to the class fortified against 
silence with plenty of material well in hand, he should 
not be disappointed, but rather gratified, if he has not 
used any of it. 
The Arguer, too, is a blight upon conversation, for he 
is never content to let a statement pass without challenge, 
whether it be a statement of fact or of opinion. He must 
bring up something to discountenance it, to show wherein 
it is not wholly accurate, or cite opposing authorities or 
contradictory views. His contention is not for the sake of 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
Spoken English and How to Teach It 49 
arriving at the truth, but for the mere love of opposition. 
Arguing is not discussion, for it has no desire or inten- 
tion to make the slightest change of position through new 
light gained. It does not result in a broadening of out- 
look, but rather in a confirmation in narrowness, pro- 
ducing in others a feeling of irritation and harassment 
detrimental to the spirit of true conversation. 
Akin to the Arguer is the Authority. He is informed 
on whatever subject may happen toarise, and pronounces 
upon it with a conclusiveness that leaves little to be said 
by anyone else. Timidity or courtesy on the part of 
others precludes a contradiction, for the manner of the 
Authority makes the expression of any other opinion 
a flagrant contradiction—and after such pronouncement 
only the most hardy have the courage to introduce a new 
topic. Perhaps the best way to treat the remarks of 
such a person is with a little airy facetiousness, for as he 
rarely has a sense of humor he is baffled for awhile to 
understand the meaning of nonsense, and the conver- 
sation may have time to recover. 
Frequently encountered and readily recognized is the 
Diseased One. He has had all the latest fashionable 
maladies, is conversant with the most recent medical 
researches and opinions, is familiar with every detail of 
symptom and suffering, remedial agent and hospital 
procedure, and revels in operations and extraction of teeth. 
He will disappear like the ichthyosaurus and the mega- 
therium when public opinion decrees that disease is either 
a crime or a disgrace, or at best a misfortune, in conver- 
sation, to be hidden or politely ignored like piratical 
ancestors or a crooked nose. 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
    Spoken English and How to Teach It    
  Types like these, and others, will be encountered, and 
must be handled with whatever skill may be available, 
so as not to allow them to dominate or destroy the 
conversation. | 4 
Principles of good conversation.\. The true conversa- 
tionalist is a cheerful person, who radiates kindliness 
and good feeling. He must believe in people, and at all 
times look for the best in them. \ He is genuinely inter- 
ested in people, and in what they have to say, and shows 
his interest by being a willing listener and by contributing 
to the discussion of any topic they may introduce.) He 
is considerate of the feelings of others, and foregoes any 
remark, however clever, or any reference, however apt, 
that might make anyone uncomfortable. He guides the 
conversation away from the awkwardness caused by the 
lack of tact or feeling on the part of any speaker. He is 
careful to include, without patronizing, everyone in the 
company. 
The foundation principles of good conversation then 
are: \consideration for other people, interest, and effort — 
a conscious endeavor to make a success by careful 
preparation beforehand and by vigilance and tact while 
conversing. | 
Every member must prepare and contribute; everyone 
must endeavor to avoid being himself one of the hin- 
drances described above, and to transform or tactfully 
suppress one if he appears; and everyone must put into 
practice the three principles above stated. The leader 
must do all this and, further, must see that the conver- 
sation does not flag, nor resolve itself into side discussions 
maintained between two members.
-P-A-G-E-63
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 51 
After a given time has been occupied in social talking 
among the groups, the teacher may call the class together 
for general discussion of their work. It is best to ask that 
question or comment be written and handed to the teacher, 
who reads to the class only a selection of them; for such 
questions, relating to difficulties encountered, will be too 
personal for free discussion, and the feelings of the class 
must not be wounded. Such questions as the following 
will occur: 
What shall I do as leader when a member of my group makes 
comparisons between her home town and this city, to the 
disadvantage of this place? 
What can be done when an elderly person persists in talking 
shop? 
Suppose you notice that a popular and vivacious girl is seated 
next to a boy whom she considers stupid, and on whom 
she has half turned her back? 
What if some one tells a doubtful story? 
How about swear words, or semi-swear words like “darn” 
and ‘‘golly’’? 
What should be done if some one laughs too loudly, and in 
general makes too much noise? 
The teacher can give general help for all such inquiries. 
Public programs. When a class or several classes 
combined put on a program for the entertainment of 
the school or the general public, the situation is genuine, 
and the students are animated by the stimulus of reality. 
The returns are simultaneous with the performance. 
The attention given by the audience, the play of 
expression on their faces, their laughter and evident 
enjoyment, the hush that attends an effective appeal, 
are so manifest that the spontaneous and vigorous or 
5 ’
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 Spoke re and How to Teach It 
prolonged queue bole the kind words of congratu- 
lation after the program are not only assurances but 
confirmations of success. 
The class may be given much freedom in planning 
such a program, and may work out its general scheme and 
its details in committees, or in a committee of the whole. 
The teacher; however, should not forget that his place is 
to guide into better things than the class has known. He 
must also retain the right of selection where there is 
danger of a mistake, especially among inexperienced 
students, who often vote for a popular member lacking 
ability in the line required. (It is better to select some 
capable person, and leave it to his discretion as to just 
what he will say, than to give definite instructions to 
one with less originality. | 
The following plan for a public program was carried 
out with success, the object being to show the kind of 
work being done in the spoken-English department and 
at the same time entertain the audience. 
About twenty students were selected to sit upon the 
stage and participate. (The selection may be effected 
by volunteering, by appointment, by election, or by com- 
petition; on the occasion described all these methods 
were used, as will be shown later.) 
There were a presiding officer; an introducer; two five- 
minute speakers; a three-minute speaker; and about 
fifteen others (one of whom was timekeeper) who joined 
in the discussion. 
The presiding officer was to call to order and keep 
things going, his instructions being to use as few words 
as possible and let nothing drag.)
-P-A-G-E-65
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 53 
The introducer was to state the purpose and nature 
of the program, and introduce the two five-minute and 
the three-minute speakers. 
The five-minute speakers talked upon topics widely 
different in interest; one address was literary in tone, 
animated but serious; the other of popular current nature, 
having a center of worth-while thought but treated 
humorously. 
The three-minute speaker introduced a topic capable 
of arousing differences of opinion, closing with a motion, 
which was then opened for general discussion. No one 
but this speaker (and the instructor) knew what this 
topic was to be, so that the discussion was entirely im- 
promptu—a fact made clear by the introducer, who 
invited the whole audience to take part and to vote on 
the question at the end. This inclusion of the audience 
heightened the interest, as did the voting at the close. 
The whole program took thirty minutes —full time for 
the chapel exercises of the school. 
A musician of the class conducted the singing; a divinity 
student led the Scripture reading and made the announce- 
ments; the presiding officer and introducer were appointed ; 
the three main speakers won distinction in competitive 
talks; while the impromptu speakers were volunteers. 
When the time is strictly. limited, as it was on this 
\ occasion, the main speakers must be kept strictly to their 
limit. They can show their self-possession and ready 
mastery of speech by drawing immediately to a close 
when time is called. |The general discussion is an elastic 
feature which can easily be prolonged a little or cut short 
to fit the circumstances.
-P-A-G-E-66
    54 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
One thing essential to success is that every speaker 
make himself distinctly and easily heard throughout the 
auditorium; and the teacher should drill all speakers until 
this point is certain. 
The program was as follows: 
Two minutes of singing by audience. 
Prayer, Scripture reading, and announcements. 
1. Students pass out upon stage, standing before their chairs 
until all are placed, when they sit, except the presiding 
officer. 
. President calls to order, and presents the introducer. 
3. The introducer explains the nature and object of the pro- 
gram, at the proper time making clear to the audience 
the arrangement for the three-minute speech and the 
inclusion of the audience in the discussion and voting. 
Time not to exceed five minutes. 
4. Five-minute talk on “Americanizing through American 
Literature.” 
Five-minute talk on “Patent Medicines.” 
Three-minute presentation of the question: ‘Should Dogs 
be Exterminated in the United States?” 
Eight-minute discussion of question 
Vote on question.

CHAPTER IV 
KINDS AND SOURCES OF MATERIAL 
Multiplicity of material. The amount of material 
within easy reach for use in classes in spoken English 
is so great, and the kinds so varied, that the teacher 
is in danger of becoming bewildered from its multiplicity 
and endlessness. 
This statement may seem startling to some whose fear, 
in entering upon a field of effort that is new to them, the 
teaching of English for speaking purposes, is that there 
will not be enough to talk about, that the material will 
become exhausted; but it is happily a fact, whose truth 
becomes more and more apparent with experience. 
Two commonly prevalent ideas have kept many a 
student, and teacher as well, in a sort of bondage. One is 
the belief that all or a large part of composition must be 
based upon literature studied —must be about it in the 
way of comment, criticism, condensation, or summary, 
or must be in imitation of it—a reproduction of its style 
or a dramatization of its incidents. The other is the 
unthinking dependence upon a textbook for material, 
and even for apportionment of material into daily lessons 
for the class. 
The purpose of teaching spoken English is to give the 
pupil command of language for use on every occasion that 
may arise in life, Will he be talking the major part 
of his time about literature, or about other things? 
55 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
    56 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
Undoubtedly, most people do not spend much time 
discussing literature. Why, then, should teachers limit 
their instruction, and pupils their practice, to the kind 
of topics that will be used comparatively little?) Why - 
not attend also to those things that occupy so large a part 
of the time of most human beings? 
As for textbook lessons—while it seems as if they 
might be the easiest, most economical in time and labor 
for both teacher and class, there are certain insuperable 
and inherent objections to them. Confinement or limi- 
tation of work to a book excludes in large measure the 
personality of the teacher, and thus eliminates the finest 
element of his work, so that page-by-page covering-the- 
ground-of-the-course-of-study teaching is bound to be 
mostly routine drill, which may have some value but is 
not a high form of teaching. Such work also fails to 
take into account the infinitely varied complexity of 
human nature in the class. It fails to fit individual needs, 
causing pain and maladjustments in the mental and 
spiritual development of the pupils, such as would result 
physically if they were all required to wear simultaneously 
the same make, size, and last of shoe. It is at the same 
time, in comparison with the possibilities at hand, 
poverty-stricken in content and interest. ) 
A textbook for spoken English, even though it were 
ideal, should not be used as an ambulance for the teacher. 
It should be a repository, in convenient form, of prin- 
ciples, examples, references, forms, and suggestions, which, 
used in whatever order the needs of the class demand, 
would serve to save time for teacher and pupils; and 
which, studied outside the class, would liberate the class
-P-A-G-E-69
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 57 
hour for instruction by the teacher of the kind that can- 
not be put into a book. Satisfactory textbooks for any 
kind of English composition are rare. Fortunately, for 
spoken English they are not absolutely necessary. The 
teacher does not have to depend upon them. There is 
at hand sufficient material to keep the members of 
the class talking continually until they are ready to be 
graduated, at which time they will feel that they have 
only tapped the shallowest of the pay sands of the 
study of spoken English. 
In considering the division of the general subject 
treated in this chapter, ‘‘ Kinds and Sources of Material,” 
two main objects should be kept in view: first, the 
student must be directed toward self-help, or, in other 
words, taught how to be independent or largely inde- 
pendent of his teacher, in getting subjects and material; 
and, second, he must be led to an acquaintance with new 
interests through which his world will be enlarged, his 
understanding of life deepened, and his appreciation of 
human relations quickened. 
It is the object of this chapter to show the teacher of 
spoken English the way to reach the rich and exhaustless 
stores of subjects and material easily available for him 
and his classes. 
Social needs. The direction of the work must be 
determined by social needs. These will be found to be 
so numerous that no class can possibly cover them all. 
The teacher can only select from among them. They 
will differ somewhat for every community, but the differ- 
ence will appear mostly in details of drill rather than in 
ends sought. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
A few of the social needs of any class will be found in 
the following list: 
x. Announcements 
2. Requests 
3. Interviews 
4. Committee work 
5. Discussions . Conversations 
. Entertainment 
. Influencing opinion 
. Securing action oc won OD 
The end or purpose. The laying out of the plan of work 
according to social needs makes the determination of the 
end or purpose in any work assigned the first thing to be 
done. And a purpose to work toward puts meaning 
into any undertaking. 
Analyzing a social situation. The material to be used 
for any assignment must be discovered by an examination 
of any given social situation, and an analysis of its 
factors as shown in the example given in the following 
paragraph. 
Interviews. A social need which seems simple enough 
at first, but which appears upon experience to be more 
complex and difficult, is the interview. An interview is 
always of importance to the person who seeks it. It may 
mean anything from the obtaining of desired information, 
to the securing of an important position, or the success of 
a cherished enterprise. It requires careful preparation, 
and after all is done that is possible to get ready for it, 
it still presents unknown possibilities and all the unexpect- 
edness of a game. For no one can foresee all the ques- 
tions that may be asked, or predict to a certainty the 
attitude of mind taken by the one interviewed. 
The student decides upon what he wants, and selects 
his man for the interview. He intends, for instance, to
-P-A-G-E-71
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 59 
enter the National Firestone Scholarship contest, and in 
order to get information upon the general subject of good 
roads, and upon the condition of roads in his own state 
and county, he plans to go to see the former state roads 
commissioner, who lives in his town. 
What must he do to get ready for the interview? Or, 
what kind of material does he need, and where can he 
get it? 
Now let him analyze the situation. It consists of the 
commissioner; of himself and his needs; and connection 
between his needs and the store of information possessed 
by the commissioner. 
He must be able to state his desire with definite clear- 
ness. He must tell who he is, his purpose in getting the 
information, and the use he expects to make of it. This 
sounds like a simple proposition, but try it and see how 
many ways there are of missing the mark. 
He must have formulated in his mind the questions 
by which he expects to elicit the desired information. 
These will require some thought, for unless carefully 
considered they may fail to bring out just the facts which 
render the information significant. 
Finally it remains to determine how to present the 
matter to the commissioner so as to enlist his interest 
and engage his assistance. 
The student’s preparation for the interview then will 
include the following: 
I. What he must tell the commissioner about himself: 
1. His name, class, school. 
2. How he expects to use the information. 
3. What the contest is. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
   
60 Spoken [Eng ish and How to Teach It 
II. The questions he must ask: 
1. How many miles of paved highways are there in 
Texas? 
2. How many were built in the last ten years? 
3. What is the present program in road building in the 
state? the county? 
. What was the approximate cost of roads already built ? 
. How are funds derived? 
. How are roads maintained? 
. How many automobiles are now owned in Texas? 
. What revenues for roads are derived from automobile 
taxation? 
9. What are the chief advantages of good roads? 
to. Why are paved roads particularly. advantageous in 
this section? 
III. What he must know about the commissioner: 
1. Is he a present or former official? 
2. What has he done for good roads? 
3. Why is he particularly interested in the school? Is 
he a graduate? Has he children attending? 
IV. Unifying all this material, and so organizing it as to take 
as little time as possible in presenting the request and 
obtaining the information. 
The student now presents his interview before the class, 
another member being appointed to impersonate the 
commissioner, the teacher and the class at its close giving 
suggestions for improvement. 
' The student is here preparing for a genuine social need. 
The material for his interview comes almost wholly from 
his own thinking. The part the teacher takes is to guide 
him to a selection of a worth-while object, and stimulate 
him to see what are the factors in his situation, and what 
he needs to know in order to meet it. 
Omran
-P-A-G-E-73
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 61 
The replies of the student impersonating the one inter- 
viewed, and the questions he may ask, break up fixedness 
in the talk that is prepared. 
Discussions. Again, the class is about to begin the 
study of brief discussions.( Let it be divided into 
committees of four or five, each with a chairman, and 
given ten minutes to select a topic to present to the class. 
The chairman sees that each member of his committee 
supplies a topic, and expresses his opinion on the ones 
offered. At a signal, a vote is taken in each committee. 
The class is assembled. The chairmen report the topics 
selected in the committees. These are put upon the 
board, discussed for say ten minutes, and then voted upon 
to determine which should be used for a program. 
One high-school freshman class thus produced the 
following topics: 
1. It would be better to have a new high school than to 
build additions to the present one. 
2. Dallas should at once build a new viaduct across the river. 
3. The Ku Klux Klan ought to be encouraged. 
4. There should be no charges to any high-school enter- 
tainment. 
5. Every boy and girl in high school ought to be compelled 
to take physical training. 
6. Dallas should inaugurate the all-year-round school system. 
Number 2 was rejected because of the difficulty in 
obtaining information in regard to it; number 3, because 
of the strong feeling which a discussion was likely to 
arouse. Number 6 was chosen. 
After about ten minutes of suggestive questioning by 
the teacher, for the purpose of showing the class to see 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
| 
62 Bhai English and How to Teach It 
how to think ah its subject, the assignment was 
given that each pupil should bring to class a list of ques- 
tions whose answers the class would have to know in 
order to discuss the question intelligently. (A minimum — 
of say ten was required, the aim being to cover the 
ground, to think of all necessary information. In addi- 
tion, the students were asked to bring a list of possible 
sources of answers for the questions.) 
The following day, each student showed his list. One 
was selected to read his. As he read, the rest checked 
duplicate questions and took down any that were new to 
them. When that list was exhausted, another student 
read all his which had not been given, the class taking 
down new ones as before; and so on until the entire 
resources of the class were in the possession of each 
member. 
The following list of questions was thus compiled in a 
high-school class: 
Aut-YEAR ScHOOL SysTEM 
  General questions: 
1. What is the plan for the all-year school system? 
2. What is the number of school buildings now? their 
capacity? 
3. Would the new plan require more or fewer buildings? 
4. Could pupils who attend nine months in the year be 
taught in the same classes with those who attend 
twelve? 
5. What is the main object of the new system? 
Finances: 
1. What would be the cost of inaugurating the new 
system?
-P-A-G-E-75
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 63 
2. What would be the total expenditure per annum under 
the new system? What is the total expenditure per 
annum under the present system? 
3. How much is now expended for the following items, 
and hew much would be needed under the all-year 
system? 
a. Salaries: Principal, teachers, office force, janitors, 
lunch-room force, engineers, matrons. 
b. Supplies: Lunch-room, lights, water, fans, fuel. 
c. Repairs. 
4. How much on the average would be saved on each pupil, 
under the new system? 
Teachers: 
1. What was the number of teachers required last year, 
and the number it would have taken under the new 
system? 
a. Elementary. 
b. High schools. 
c. Night schools. 
Pupils: 
1. Would a summer term relieve the present congestion in 
the other three terms? 
2. What is the present enrollment? 
3. What is the estimated enrollment under the new system 
for (a) fall, (b) winter, (c) spring, (d) summer? 
4. Would the decrease in fall, winter, and spring quarters 
be sufficient to warrant any decrease in the present 
number of teachers? If so, how many? 
5. What is now the average length of time from entrance 
_ to graduation? 
6. What would it be, under an all-year system? 
7. What is now the average age at graduation? under pro- 
posed system? 
 
-P-A-G-E-76

Health: | 
1. Would it be advisable to consider the plan from a health 
basis? 
2. Would the health standard be lowered? 
3. Would the new system be harmful to the health of the 
teachers? 
Experience with plan: 
1. What cities or schools have tried this plan? 
2. How many have found it satisfactory? unsatisfactory? 
Why? 
The list of sources of information was treated in the 
same way, with the following results: 
. The secretary of the board of education. 
. The superintendent. 
. The assistant superintendent. 
. The principal of the high school. 
. Ahy teacher in the high school. 
. A principal of an elementary school, who had made a 
study of the question two years before. 
. The public library. 
. The students’ own knowledge and observation, for 
illustrations.

The next day, each student was to bring answers to as 
many questions as he could, citing sources of information. 
In order that the school officials might not be swamped 
with inquiries, committees were appointed to secure 
information from each of them, 
The information brought in the next day, a surprising 
amount, was pooled as had been the questions, and for 
the next day the assignment was given: Take one point 
on either side of the question, and try to convince the

class. Three minutes will be allowed for each talk, and 
two minutes for the class to answer it. 
Great interest will be manifested in such a discussion, 
which may be extended over two or three days, according 
to the ability of the class to develop the subject. At the 
close, four students may be selected by vote, as those 
having done the best work in the class, for a more formal 
discussion, or a debate. A good way to conduct such a 
debate and to include all members of the class, is to 
have the chosen speakers present the main arguments, 
while the class, divided into corresponding teams, furnishes 
the rebuttals. 
Subjects for such discussions can be furnished in great 
variety by any class. In the chapter on ‘‘Vitalizing 
Class Work”’ are two lists used in college classes. The 
following list was prepared by a high-school class, and 
shows the abundant supply of topics within easy reach 
of any class. Many of them require no library research, 
but can be developed from the facts and information 
already in the possession of the students. 
Supjects For Discussion 
. R. O. T. C. should be compulsory in high schools. 
. The Bible should be taught in high schools. 
. Oak Cliff needs a new high school. 
. Levees should be built along the Trinity River.

Requests. One of the simplest social needs is the 
making of requests. 
The student can easily think of endless possibilities in 
this line. ( He must be taught to study the dispositions of 
persons of whom he makes the requests, in order to 
proffer them in a way most likely to bring a favorable 
response. ) Then he must state clearly and exactly what 
he desirés, explain conditions in connection’ with the 
matter, and foresee objections so as to forestall them. 
Announcements. There are announcements to be made 
in every school. They constitute the advertising through 
which many school enterprises are carried to the student 
body, and upon which the success of the enterprises 
depends. Practice in making them includes drill in the 
unmistakable statement of the facts, the reiteration for 
emphasis, and the introduction, which is designed to fix 
the attention and win the favorable consideration of 
the audience. The close should leave everyone in a 
pleasant state of mind. These things are worthy of being 
well done, and can only be so done through painstaking 
practice. 
A good announcement should be brief —not longer than two 
minutes, at most. 
The announcer must know all the necessary facts, and get 
them to his audience by skillful repetition. 
He must make his event seem attractive. 
These directions seem simple, and the problem involved 
easy, but only an experienced teacher of spoken English 
and the pupil who has striven to produce a good announce- 
ment know how many ways there are to make a failure, 
and how difficult it is to create a success.

The announcements given below are stenographic 
reports of work done by pupils in the spoken-English 
classes of the Oak Cliff High School. The stenographer 
was directed to take the speech verbatim, and in typing 
not to make any corrections. | 
A 
Can you imagine being blown to pieces ae explosion in a 
blast furnace and then returning to collect your own damages? 
According to the laws of nature and the laws of man, this is 
impossible. But a certain colored gentleman of Birmingham, 
Alabama, has done it. 
Mr. Septic Sims, a resident of the colored section of 
Birmingham, Alabama, is supposed to have been blown to 
atoms. His remains are collected and given burial, and his 
widow collects two thousand dollars fr the owner of 
the furnace. She then proceeds to make marriage to Joe Bugg, 
another prominent colored gentleman in the town. But 
Septic in reality had left for Chattanooga, Tennessee, just 
two seconds before the explosion, though no one knew it. 
While in Chattanooga he gets news of the events, and decides 
that since he was the one who did the “‘corpsing,”’ the two 
thousand dollars should be his. 
Just how he got the two thousand dollars is set forth 
in an interesting and super-humorous way in the minstrel to 
be given by the K. J. U. Class of Tyler Street Methodist 
Church. | 
Among the actors are Dick Somers, Atwell Reed, Wilbur 
White, Laurence Grayson, Wes Woods, and many others who 
are prominent in Oak Cliff High School. 
The admission is fifty cents. Tickets will be on sale at 
the door of Oak Cliff High School, in whose auditorium the 
minstrel is to be played. | | 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
Spoken English and How to Teach It 73 
Dick Somers takes the part of Septic Sims, and Atwell Reed 
takes the part of Saline, who is Septic’s widow. It is a revela- 
tion to hear Laurence Grayson sing, and to watch Wes Woods 
dance. 
The date—next Friday night. 
The time—eight p.m. 
The place—Oak Cliff High School auditorium. 
The price—fifty cents. 
The event —the first annual minstrel of the K. J. U. Class. 
Note how this announcement catches the attention 
instantly by its startling initial statement. Enough of 
the story is given to arouse interest without revealing the 
outcome. The sentences are good, and the wording 
adequate and appropriate. The personal element enter- 
ing through the participants in the show is skillfully 
made use of. The tabulated facts at the end are admis- 
sible where the interest has been strongly engaged. 
Of quite a different tone from the preceding, number B 
below is equally good. Aside from the awkward and 
incorrect expression, ‘‘insists for no class to have,’’ the 
dignity of the language is in keeping with the gravity of 
the situation as well as with the importance of the 
issues involved.

Next Friday evening, April 11, in the auditorium of the Oak 
Cliff High School, the Parent-Teacher Association will meet 
with the Board of Education. They will thrash out the prob- 
lems confronting the Oak Cliff High School, namely, the con- 
struction of the Sunset High School. 
It is absolutely necessary that this school be completed 
before September, 1924. This is due to the fact that Oak Cliff

High classes are overcrowded, and will be more so at the begin-

Spoken English and How to Teach It 78 
If his object is to form opinion or ideals he goes much 
farther than when his object is clearness, and endeavors 
to convince his audience that the views he advocates are 
admirable, just, or desirable. Subjects suitable for such 
a purpose are: ‘“‘Rats Are an Expensive Nuisance in the 
United States’’; ‘‘Courtesy as a Business Asset”’; ‘‘The 
Character of Sam Houston”’; ‘‘Jane Addams as a Social 
Force.” 
When a speaker desires to secure immediate action, he 
_ carries the process a third step, and appeals to his hearers 
to do something. Immediate action means that resolved 
upon at the time, definitely intended, whether carried out 
instantly or within a short time. It is the end in view 
in talks made on such subjects as the following: ‘‘Volun- 
teer to Help Take the Sunday School Census”; ‘‘Buy 
This Make of Car’; ‘‘ Vote for My Motion”’; ‘‘The Safest 
Investment.” ° 
Finally, the speaker, wishing merely to entertain, may 
take for his subject one of these: ‘‘My Most’ Embarrass- 
ing Moment”; * ‘‘The Diversions of Our Grandpas”; 
“Uncle Will’s Favorite Desserts.” 
The following lists of subjects were handed in as one 
day’s preparation, typed, and filed for reference by high- 
school classes. They serve to show how capable pupils 
of that age are of helping themselvts.

kind of talk difficult to classify under the divisions| 
given above, and important enough to deserve attention 
by itself, is that intended for special occasions, when th 
speaker must present to his audience something that i 
alive, appropriate, original, and as forceful and graciou 
as he is able to make it. No previously prepared speec:
-P-A-G-E-97
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 85 
kept on hand can of course serve any genuine occasion, 
which makes its own unique conditions; but the prepara- 
tion and practice in giving this kind of talk will inform 
students as to what is appropriate, and make it easy to 
prepare for an: occasion as it arises. No cut-and-dried 
speech ever sparkles as an after-dinner entertainment; 
but one who has been trained in making and listening to 
such speeches is at no loss to plan one for the par- 
ticular dinner which he is to grace as honor guest. A 
gracious acceptance of a gift can rarely be made by 
a recipient who is unpracticed in the art of speaking; 
far less can a speech kept on hand serve his purpose. 
But previous trainihg will cultivate a sense of what is 
fitting, and leave the speaker free to meet the situation 
of the moment.

  CHAPTER V 
IMPROVEMENT THROUGH ERRORS 
The first step toward the improvement of the language 
element in speaking has been taken when the student is 
aroused to a desire to._say something —a definite some- 
thing, to-a-known-audience,-for-a_special purpose: In 
his effort to convince and persuade, he first feels the 
inadequacy of his language equipment in a vague con- 
sciousness that somehow he failed to do justice to his 
subject and his feelings on the subject. He is not satis- 
fied with the response he gets. The audience did not 
warm up as he expected it to do. He knows there is 
a discrepancy between what he wanted to say and what 
he did say, but he does not know how to get to work to 
remove it. : 
He needs next to be shown what kind of product he 
has put forth as it appears from the viewpoint of his 
hearers. 
Showing a class its errors. The teacher has taken down 
from day to day the words that were mispronounced and 
the poor sentences that were uttered, and at intervals 
of about two weeks has had them mimeographed and 
returned to the students. There they are with their bad 
grammar, their useless repetitions, their broken sentence 
structures, their primer style— bald and unescapable. 
List A and List B show two such collections of feeble 
and faulty sentences or parts of sentences taken verbatim,

The task confronting the English teacher. It may 
surprise some teachers of English who examine these 
lists, that high-school and college students could commit 
so many and in some cases such gross offenses against 
their own tongue. But let them remember that these 
students were talking in class under the stimulus of 
interest and a purpose, in the style which they habitu- 
ally used outside the classroom. Here is the genuine 
article, the English language as it is actually spoken. 
To lead these speakers to desire, and to show them how 
to attain, better usage and more adequate expression 
is the important task confronting the teacher of spoken 
English. 
The wrong way to handle errors. The practice, com- 
mon among English teachers, of correcting errors as they 
occur in the speech of pupils, of ‘never accepting an 
answer unless it is in expressed good English,” results in 
little good and much evil. It does, it is true, produce a  
-P-A-G-E-108
        96 Pane English and | 
certain degree of correctness as dng as the student is in 
the presence of his English teacher. But it does not, 
in many cases, produce improvement in the habitual 
speech of the student when not in the English class. ( It 
causes self-consciousness, it kills spontaneity and interest, 
and destroys the vital relation between speaker and 
audience. ) (Please note that this is written, not for 
primary, but for high-school teachers.) So much stress 
has been laid in this way upon correctness that many 
students get the idea that there is little to English besides 
mere correctness, and quite lose sight of those aspects 
of good speaking that arise from the fact that it is a 
social art. 
The method of social pressure. Expressions like those 
in the list above, and in the word lists following, gathered 
from the daily work of the class, should be discussed in 
class, their errors disclosed and corrected, their wording 
and structure improved. As no names are attached to 
errors, no one is embarrassed or made self-conscious. 
Each ong is eager to identify and analyze his own mis- 
takes. (As there is nothing personal in the discussions, 
the students may laugh at the more absurd of the blun- 
ders, and freely express their opinions, creating among 
themselves an atmosphere, a public opinion, in favor of 
good form and adequate expression. ) When the teacher 
makes the correction, the individual student does not 
feel that the class, his social unit, condemns his mode of 
speech. 
Many of the errors are at once recognizable by the 
class as such, and are to be attributed not to ignorance 
but to carelessness and bad habit. /After a desire for a to Teach It
-P-A-G-E-109
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 97 
improvement is aroused by the social pressure of the 
class, this sort of error may be weeded out by drill which 
establishes better habit. Other errors are due to the fact 
that the student does not possess a consciousness of 
better-language possibilities, so that for improvement in 
understanding sentence structure he is dependent upon 
two sources—treading, whereby he absorbs it uncon- 
sciously, and the teacher of English, from whom he gets 
it consciously. Facility in handling sentences will be 
treated a little later. 
Analyzing errors for drill. To point out and correct 
the errors in such lists as those shown above will result 
in some improvement, but it will not go to the root of the 
trouble. The teacher should analyze the list and classify 
the mistakes in order to drill the students against those 
types of errors to which they have shown themselves 
most liable. 
Such an analysis of the foregoing lists reveals the fact 
that about: seventy-five per cent of these errors arise 
either from inappropriate or inexact expressions (about 
thirty per cent); or from violations of grammatical usage 
(about forty-five per cent). The classes therefore that 
produced them are weak on those two points, and 
should receive reinforcing drill. 
To drill on grammar, however, sounds like an indefinite 
and endless task. Not so. Examine the sentences in 
which grammatical errors occur. From them the teacher 
can readily learn on what parts of grammar the class 
needs drill. 
In the case given, one-fourth of the errors lay in lack 
of agreement (verbs with subjects, and pronouns with
-P-A-G-E-110
  68 Spobels Bhish died! Hdw|tol Teach Te 
antecedents, principally) ; one-fourth in double negatives; 
one-fourth in wrong form; and one-eighth in confusing 
like and as. 
These errors then may be simplified down to these four 
heads: 
x. Agreement 
2. Double negatives 
3. Form (drill on errors actually made) 
4. Like and as 
Habitual errors of individual students. Many people 
have the reputation, and constantly give the impression, 
of using very poor English, when the truth is that their 
English is in the main excellent, but they have the habit 
of using double negatives, or their pronoun agreement is 
poor, or they use a few awkward phrases. ( The frequent 
recurrence of_a small number of errors will cause any 
one’s speech to seem that of an uncultured person?) The 
mistakes made by individual students, if a record is kept 
by the teacher, will often reduce themselves to a few 
habitual errors, which if tabulated and brought to their 
attention can by watchfulness and careful self-discipline 
be finally eradicated. 
( Any teacher who will show a student, what his habitual 
errors are, will do him a great service. ) Many a student 
who has often been told that his English is bad may be 
encouraged to hope that it will become good through the 
correction of a few habits. 
Concreteness. Besides the errors treated above, 
students may easily discover that their sentences carry 
numerous expressions of “abstractions which should be 
translated into concrete terms. The ability to think in 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
ESSE LF LS RGN ERE AL TES OM SY Leek Lt ee ee v 
Spoken English and How to Teach It 99 
abstractions is highly useful, in fact indispensable, for 
anyone, but when the results of thinking and feeling are 
to be communicated to others, the most telling method 
of presentation is the concrete. The most effective 
style is that permeated with images, suggestions of definite 
objectified realities. 
One reason for the popularity of the humorous sketches 
of Irvin Cobb is the objectivity, the definiteness, the 
vivid concreteness, which his sentences possess. 
He says: ‘‘I had been slowly stirring my thoughts 
on this subject for a good while, but they refused to jell.” 
And: ‘‘The modern girl of this type is likely to be 
ting-shy unless you can show her a six-cylinder auto- 
mobile.” 
Concreteness involves more than the supplying of 
examples or other illustrations, though that is important. 
It means the framing of sentences in such a way as to 
call up in the minds of hearers definite images of familiar 
objects. 
Contrast the two following sentences, the first of which / 
is a general statement of vague connotation, while the 
second impresses through calling up familiar sights and 
abitual experiences.     
    
   
   
   
      
   
       
   1. Pittsburgh is a smoky city. 
2. Pittsburgh smokestacks keep Pittsburgh laundries busy. 
The following list of sentences, made up largely of 
bstractions and generalities, was prepared by a com- 
ittee from a college class, while the transformations 
nto more concrete form, given below, were produced in 
fhe same class by various members.

Paraphrasing. In order to secure greater variety in 
sentence form, a college class prepared the following 
list of sentences. Copies were made to supply the class, 
and distributed with directions that the next day each 
member was to be able to express the thought of each 
sentence in at least three different ways, more if possible, 
striving to attain variety of wording, phrasing, and sen- 
tence form. The sentences were not to be written, but 
spoken. 
Each student was given a certain time, say one min- 
ute, to give his minimum number of sentences. (A time 
limit will secure adequate preparation, and require rapid, 
ready speech. Such a drill, repeated frequently, will 
help to secure power to vary phrasing and sentence 
structure.)

The technique of teaching sentence structure. Much has 
been done in developing the technique of teaching sen- 
tence structure for written English. But the technique 
of teaching sentence structure for spoken English is yet 
in process of being developed, and is a field of sufficient 
extent and importance to merit treatment in a separate 
book. Mechanical drill for the automatizing of correct/ 
expressions must be constructed. 
Slang. One of the richest sources of language growth 
is slang. Language grows, it is true, by means of impor- 
tations, but it develops by means of the actual making 
or creating of new terms. Some of these are names for 
new inventions and ideas, and some of them are slang. 
- As growth is a sign of life in any organism, so slang is a 
“manifestation of vigor in a language. As growth belongs 
especially to youth, so slang is peculiarly the province of 
youth. High-school and college age are particularly the 
time for the creation, adoption, and trying-out of slang. 
A high-school or college student who uses no slang has 
about him something anaemic. The teacher who does 
not recognize these truths is looked upon by the students 
as being a little out of harmony with life. 
Not a taboo on all slang, but a recognition of slang as 
a manifestation of national language vigor, is what is 
needed, together with discrimination of gradations of 
quality and worth in slang.
-P-A-G-E-116
  104, Spoken English and How to Teach It 
Made by the people, springing up through their imagi- 
nation to supply a need, these fresh expressions are 
exactly as good and as bad as their source. Some are 
vulgar, some are tawdry, some are picturesque, and some 
are vigorous and admirable. Produced in innumerable 
variety, some of these slang expressions are destined to 
die after a brief day of currency, but some survive and 
permanently enrich the language. The danger in slang 
is that slang will by its too frequent use crowd out 
a wealth of words that ought to be in every speaking 
vocabulary. (The safeguard is cultivation of interest in 
word acquirement and an appreciation of the almost 
endless resources of the language. ) 
Levels or gradations of style. Corrections of errors 
of diction, discussions of slang and its use and the con- 
scious acquirement of vocabulary and better sentence 
structure should be accompanied by some effort on the 
part of the teacher to awaken in his pupils a consciousness 
of that fine thing called style, and a perception of the 
existence of various levels of style. 
The division of words into correct and incorrect, or 
‘sanctioned by good use” and not so sanctioned (being 
then barbarism, solecism, or impropriety), is entirely too 
simple and easy. (The task of the teacher would then be 
almost purely a mental one: distinguishing between good 
and bad, and acquiring the good. )But the situation is 
t more complex. word must be not only good, but 
good for a particular use, appropriate for securing a 
desired effect upon a certain audience.) The teacher must 
not only direct mental powers, but he must also cultivate 
taste.
-P-A-G-E-117
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 105 
Occasions, audiences, and purposes of speakers differ. 
What. would be entirely appropriate for one would be 
unsuitable for another. For hours of relaxation in the 
company of intimate friends when all are free and per- 
haps hilarious, homely and colloquial turns of language 
and slang phrases are permissible and desirable. Almost 
as wide a range of choice lies before the speaker who 
addresses an audience informally upon some matter of 
local concern. Lifted above these informal talks in style 
are the friendly letter, the business letter, and finally 
the formal address, whose gradations are measured by the 
culture of the audience, the nature of the subject, and 
the kind of emotion aroused. 
The use of literary diction on a hike would be as 
ridiculous as colloquialisms in an address crowning a 
1 solemn memorial exercise. 
To cultivate power to discern what is appropriate for 
different occasions, a sense of the degree of language” 
dignity suitable for each, and a nice feeling for harmony 
between emotion and its expression —this is the demand 
made upon the teacher of spoken English. | 
The place of correctness in the teaching of English. Cor- 
rectness is not the most important end to be striven 
for in English. Henry Ward Beecher had the right view- 
point when he said to one who was pointing out errors in 
a sermon of his: ‘‘Young man, when the English lan- 
guage gets in my way, it doesn’t stand a chance.” Cor- 
rectness has been stressed until many people think it is 
the sole end in English teaching, while other elements 
of good speaking, much more valuable, are often over- 
looked.
-P-A-G-E-118

There will be no habitually dla speech until stu- 
dents are aroused to a sense of the need for it by social 
pressure. Subordinate correctness then by taking it 
out of the place of chief importance. Do not make it 
detestable by nagging, but desirable because good form 
is seen to be an element of power in speaking. Drill 
frequently by methods such as are described above, but 
spend a large proportion of the class time upon those 
elements of power that are even more important. )

CHAPTER VI 
INCREASING THE SPEAKING VOCABULARY 
Previous chapters have made clear that the chief way 
to secure improvement in vocabulary and language com- 
mand in general is through interest in a live subject, 
opportunity for speaking in a live situation and for a 
genuine purpose, and through social pressure brought to 
bear by the class. 
But there are other means which may be added to 
the technique of the teacher of spoken English. They 
are not ends in themselves, but means to the end of 
attaining greater mastery of the language for speaking 
purposes. They are valuable if used with judgment. 
The student will ask: ‘‘How can I increase my vocabu- 
lary? I hesitate for words. I haven’t enough words at 
my command to express my ideas. I use the same words 
over and over. Can you give me some help in enlarg- 
ing my stock of words?” 
The teacher must be prepared to give help of a definite 
kind in a way that brings results. The following methods 
have been tried in both high-school and college classes. 
They worked satisfactorily, invariably arousing great 
interest. 
Basis for vocabulary work. The acquiring of a varied 
and exact vocabulary should be in direct relation to needs 
and use. A supply of dictionaries and synonym books 
is desirable. But the study of synonyms by means of 
107
-P-A-G-E-120
    108 Spoken English and How to Teach Ji 
lists of detached words is usually a dreary and tedious 
task. Synonym study should be undertaken as the need 
arises from the talks made in class. It should grow out 
of errors actually made by students, or arise from an 
increasing consciousness in the students themselves of 
their own limitations. 
Arousing consciousness of need. Such expressions as 
the following, taken down by the teacher, mimeographed, 
and returned to the class, show them their poverty of 
vocabulary, and their meagerness of expression. They 
call forth effort to improve as no list of words isolated 
from their experience would do. 
These came from a college class: 
1. A navy that is manned by men capable and sufficient to 
man these ships. 
2. The way to builda building... . 
3. These forests are under the control of foresters. They 
have chief foresters and under foresters. 
4. Since the first settlers settled in thiscountry ... . 
5. They could make a nice living. 
6. A nation that did consider its obligations a scrap of paper 
was held up to ridicule. 
7. When those foreigners come over here. . . . 
8. The people have as much say-so.. . . 
9. There was a constant nag from the pupils... . 
The first four sentences show by their repetitions of 
similar forms a lack of word resources. 
The fifth is an example of the common misuse of the 
word nice, in its substitution for one of a large number of 
words which would express the thought more accurately. 
Number six shows the use of a word entirely inadequate 
to express the idea, a vague effort in the direction of the
-P-A-G-E-121
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 
meaning, and ignorance of such words as disapproval, 
censure, condemnation, reprobation. 
“Come over here” in the seventh is an expression 
familiar in its tiresome repetition to everyone who has 
had to do with discussions of the immigration question. 
Omnibus. words and their substitutes. Some of the 
words most often misused by being substituted for other 
words which more accurately denote shades of meaning, 
are lots, awful, and nice. They may be called ‘“‘omnibus 
words,” for they are made to carry hundreds of mean- 
ings. Convenient and easy to say, they readily become 
fixed in habitual use, and crowd out a rich variety of 
words which should be a part of every person’s speak- 
ing vocabulary. 
People speak of lots of time, lots of money, lots of 
paper, lots of trees, lots of people, lots of fun. 
They talk about the awful weather, awful manners, an 
awful lesson, an awful hat, the awful ways of young 
people. 
They say the class is nice, those people are nice, he 
has a nice sum of money, her dress is nice, over and over 
in indefinite monotony and ineffectiveness. 
For each of these there are in the language many 
words which would fit any one of these examples better 
than the omnibus word. 
After having called the attention of the class to the 
prevalence of the use of the omnibus words, the teacher 
will next show them how to begin the process of securing 
substitutes. Note that it is not synonyms that are 
being sought, but substitutes for these words as com- 
monly misused. It may be well to pause long enough 7 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
    110 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
at the start to fix in mind the correct or true meaning. 
But it is the incorrect use that i is to be replaced with the 
use of other words. 
Write on the board a simple sentence containing a 
common misuse of the word awful: 
We are having awful weather now. 
Call on the class to supply, impromptu, five or six 
substitutes in that sentence, as: 
disagreeable wet unpleasant 
cold unseasonable 
Now look up each of the above words in a synonym 
book or a dictionary, securing such a list as: 
hateful rancorous annoying 
offensive abominable invidious 
cantankerous detestable chilling 
spiteful odious — 
Each of the above eleven words may be in turn looked 
up, until the student’s resources, or the time allotted, 
have been exhausted. | 
Take then another sentence using the word in another 
connection: 
Edward has awful manners. 
This will lead into a different set of substitutes, fur- 
nished impromptu by the class, such as: 
rude ungentlemanly rough 
boorish diseaqrtscre 
Continuing as above, with the use of a synonym 
book and a dictionary, each student will endeavor to 
secure as long a list as possible of substitutes for awful 
as commonly misused. The next day the lists will be
-P-A-G-E-123
  Spoken English and How to Teach It III 
turned over to a committee, who will combine them into 
one, striking out duplicates and alphabetizing. The lists 
will then be mimeographed and returned to the class. 
Great interest and enthusiasm will be aroused by the 
search for words, and great rivalry in obtaining the 
longest lists. High-school classes will often put double 
the required time on their English work, and bring from 
fifty to two hundred and fifty words each, while the com- 
bined lists will run to several hundred. 
Next drill on the pronunciation and meaning of the 
words. The length of time spent on this part of the 
work will vary with the needs of the class. The object 
is not so much to ascertain that each student can define 
each word, or accurately distinguish between synonyms, 
as to arouse him to a sense of the rich stores of words 
which may be in the possession of anyone who will take 
the trouble to acquire them. The use of the exercises 
which follow will develop a sense of appropriateness in 
the use of words. 
If the work stopped here, it would be but formal and 
effect but little change in speaking habits. There must 
be application in use. 
Drill in use of words. After having drilled on pronun- 
ciation and meaning of words, dictate a list of short 
sentences, using awful in various connections: 
We had an awful time. 
Her dress was awful. 
John has an awful disposition. 
This is an awful situation. 
The weather is awful. 
The poor child was in an awful condition. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124

112 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
Your conduct was awful. 
This prisoner is an awful man. 
Emma’s hair was awful. 
His face wore an awful expression. 
Let the students select from the list of substitutes 
words appropriate for the connection in each sentence, 
and drill until they have mastered them. Various games 
and contests can be devised to test the results in class. 
Games with words. Let one student give a sentence 
containing the omnibus word, for which each student 
in turn offers a different substitute until his vocabulary 
is exhausted. Thus: 
First student. Lucy has nice hair. 
Second “ Lucy has abundant hair. 
Third “ Lucy has pretty hair. 
Fourth ‘“ Lucy has glossy hair. 
Fath (t Lucy has fine, soft hair. 
Sith oy Lucy has shining hair. 
Seventh “ Lucy has beautiful hair. 
Eighth “ Lucy has smooth hair. 
Another offers: ‘‘We have a nice breeze this morning.” 
Others supply: A cool breeze, a delightful breeze, a 
refreshing breeze, an exhilarating breeze, an agreeable 
breeze, a gentle breeze, a soft breeze, a sweet-scented 
breeze, an invigorating breeze, and so on. 
The next says: ‘‘We had a nice dinner.’ 
Substitutes are: A satisfying dinner, a well-prepared 
dinner, a well-cooked dinner, a hot dinner, a well-flavored 
dinner, a refreshing dinner, a savory dinner, a healthful 
dinner, an appetizing dinner, a delicious dinner, an abund- 
ant dinner, a generous dinner, an excellent dinner. 
   
-P-A-G-E-125
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 113 
Sides may be chosen and contests carried on to see 
which team can supply most variations. Boys may be 
matched against girls) Champions may be selected to 
represent each division, and the game element varied 
indefinitely. Z 
Such practice as is suggested in the exercises above 
cannot fail to make students sensitive to the abuse of 
words like awful, lots, and nice It will awaken them to 
the existence of the almost countless numbers of better 
words, and the endless shades of meaning that may be 
expressed; and it will lead them to greater discrimination 
in their thinking as well as in their expression. 
For lots there are given below thirty-six words or expres- 
sions (by no means all), obtained by the method described 
above, each carrying a slightly different connotation: 
abundance 
adequacy 
affluence 
ample amount, portion, quantity, stock, supply

Overworked words. Through the work of committees, 
lists of words overworked by the members of the class 
may be tabulated and studied for better variety. The 
following list, actually compiled in class by students, 
shows the kind of words for which synonyms or substi- 
tutes should be acquired. Such a list will be eagerly 
studied, because it reveals a need which students recognize.

Thorndike’s Word Book, a list of the ten thousand most- 
used words, while compiled for elementary schools and 
with a view to a reading rather than to a speaking 
vocabulary, may be used with profit by the teacher of 
spoken English. The method followed will, of course, 
vary with the age or needs of the class, and should not be 
allowed to become a routine drill on long lists of words. 
The teacher should make sure that the students under- 
stand the nature of the Word Book—what these words 
are and how they were compiled—a matter which is 
explained in the preface to the book itself. He should 
then direct each student to go through the book, and
-P-A-G-E-129
Spoken English and How to Teach It 117 
select the words which he does not know and has never 
used in speaking, making a list for himself, looking up 
the words for pronunciation and meaning, and using 
them in his speaking as soon and as often as he can. 
The student will thus obtain some idea as to the extent 
of his own vocabulary, of which he could previously form 
no estimate whatever. He will add some words to his 
working vocabulary—perhaps a few, perhaps a good 
many. He will certainly be impressed with the impor- 
tance of a wide command of words and stimulated to 
increase his stock of usable words. 
Tests can be made from the lists handed in by the 
students, and also from the book, and each student’s 
knowledge of the words in the book estimated approxi- 
mately on the proportion he has mastered. 
The aim of vocabulary work. ( The aim of all vocabu- 
lary work must be to create a perception of the value of 
words, a love for exact use, and an enthusiasm for a 
command of a variety of terms for shades of meaning. 
Avoid tiresome exercises isolated from life relations. 
Encourage individual efforts and the formation of habits _ 
of acquirement, and be sure to include joy in the process. } 
Work remaining to be done. The field of spoken 
English is new, and the technique of vocabulary building 
for speaking purposes has received little attention com- 
pared with that given the acquiring of vocabulary for 
writing. This chapter is intended to be suggestive merely, 
indicating the psychological approach to the work with a 
class, and pointing out ways in which such work may be 
done to effect improvement in actual speaking habits. 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
   CHAPTER VII 
THE TALK AND ITS. PREPARATION 
Objectives. In the teaching of spoken English two 
objects should be kept in view, one main, the other 
secondary. The main object is that each student should 
advance in ability to use the language. The secondary 
object, which must be merely a means to the first as an 
end, is the excellence of each speech. The relation of 
these two aims should not be confused, for if the less 
important is put first, the more important results may 
be lost altogether, and the efforts of the students may 
fail to bring them to what it should be their chief 
purpose to attain. 
While it may seem at first thought that these two 
objectives constitute one and the same thing, experience 
shows that it is possible for a student to make a credit- 
able showing by means of the second, while gaining little 
or nothing in the first. It is therefore sometimes advis- 
able to follow methods that seem at first to decrease the 
excellence of the talk, in order in the end to increase 
facility in the use of the language. 
A high-school teacher once had in her class a girl whose 
handwriting was very legible, with beautiful, even, well- 
formed letters. Her reputation as a student, however, 
was that she was slow to learn. Studying that pupil to 
discover why she was not quicker or brighter, the teacher 
one day while dictating some sentences in an exercise Pisa. 118 ‘ 
      
   
                                             / 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
Spoken English and How to Teach It 119 
on punctuation, discovered that Mildred was three sen- 
tences behind the class in transcribing. She never asked 
for a sentence to be repeated, but wrote one, carefully 
forming her letters, while she held in mind the other sen- 
tences until she could get to them. The writing was 
beautiful, the work was inferior. 
The teacher decided that there was nothing the matter 
with Mildred’s mind, that the only trouble with her was 
that she was using her writing as an end instead of a 
means to accomplish her work; and deliberately set about 
spoiling the beautiful drawing process that was really 
a hindrance to the girl’s effectiveness. She made her 
write fast, and while Mildred for a time wrote a very 
scrawly hand, she was liberated to accomplish more 
important things, and learned to use her writing as a 
secondary instead of a main object. 
Thus a student who writes, re-writes, and polishes his 
speech, and finally memorizes it, will probably have, for 
that one speech, a choicer wording and sentence struc- 
ture than if he prepared it in a different manner, but his 
progress in gaining facility in language for constant use 
will be but little affected. He will be like Mildred, put- 
ting the secondary object where he should place the main 
one. It may be added also that a memorized speech is 
rarely delivered in a convincing manner, the speaker 
being hampered by the rigidity of his fixed expression, and 
at a loss if his memory fails for an instant. 
Facility in the use of language includes three main 
factors: a large usable vocabulary; sentence mastery to 
provide variety and insure clearness; and a sense of 
appropriateness. a   
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
It is the object of this chapter to show how each speech 
or talk may be so prepared and so used as to contribute 
to advancement of the student in mastery of the language 
for ready use on any occasion that may arise. 
Method of work in preparing talk. Having selected a 
subject appropriate for his audience and suitable for treat- 
ment in the time given, and having gathered his material, 
the student selects from it what is most worth while to 
attain the end he has in view, and organizes it with 
that purpose in mind. He then writes a brief outline, 
from which he practices the speech by saying it aloud, 
each time varying the wording so as to gain variety and 
avoid a stereotyped expression, and each time seeking 
to improve. 
In his consideration of audiences he must distinguish 
between those which are select and those which are 
popular. A select audience is made up of persons 
whose interests and general attitude toward life are much 
the same, and who come together to discuss or hear dis- 
cussed some subject on which in general they are already 
informed. With such an audience a good deal may be 
taken for granted; explanations and even introduction 
may be dispensed with, and the subject matter treated, 
if desired, in a technical manner. A popular audience 
made up of diverse elements demands a subject and a 
treatment through which its attention and feeling may 
be unified, so that the talk must be based on general 
information already present, but much less definite than 
in the select audience. It must have an introduction, 
and must avoid technical language, which is a timesaver 
to the initiated but baffling to the general mind.
-P-A-G-E-133
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 120 
With the audience understood, the speaker must next 
determine the end,! and know definitely whether he 
intends to explain the subject for the purpose of making 
it clear; or to appeal for the formation of opinion or ideal; 
or to ask for immediate action; or solely to entertain. 
In selecting his subject he has the range of the universe, 
limited only by the nature of his audience and the length 
of time he is to occupy. 
His material he may obtain from three main sources: 
reading, conversation, and thinking.” 
Choice of material must be made with the point of the 
talk in mind; everything selected must serve to impress 
this main idea, and nothing may be included, however 
interesting or clever, that does not bear directly upon it. 
The outline. In the organization, avoid including too 
much. A long outline with many points is almost cer- 
tain to lay the foundation for ineffective speaking. In 
five minutes any speaker will do well if he impresses upon 
his audience one single point, explaining that clearly and 
fastening it in the memory with illustrations. When as 
many as three or four points are attempted in so short 
a time, the hearers get a confused idea of what is 
intended, and probably retain none of it. One reason 
why many students make extended outlines is that they 
have not distinguished between the chief divisions of 
their topic and the explanatory or illustrative details. 
This distinction should be made, and the outline sim- 
plified to a few head topics and a very few subtopics 
1Explained in detail in Chapter IV, ‘‘ Kinds and Sources of Material.”

under each. This kind of outline can easily be kept in 
mind, and can usually be written on a small card. 
The following are examples of the very simple outline 
that should be made for a short talk.

Preparatory practice. The next step after organization 
is practice in talking the speech, in which there are three 
ends in view: familiarizing the speaker so thoroughly 
with his material that he will not forget it when he / 
stands before his audience; acquiring adequate wording 
and facility.in expression; and comprehending the entire 
talk within the time limit. This last object is important 
enough to be treated under a separate head. 
Many people suppose that with the talk planned and 
material decided upon, preparation is complete. The 
fact is it is not more than half done. The speech is not 
ready, nor has the student made much progress, until he 
has made certain that he can embody his ideas in clear, 
forceful, appropriate language, used without halting. 
Hence he should talk his speech aloud many times, each 
time varying his expressions and seeking to improve it 
through choice phrasing, more exact and definite wording, 
substituting concrete for general terms, and finding 
better illustration. Such practice will result at once in 
an increase of mastery over language, and should be 
required as habitual. It is as unreasonable to hope to 
gain ability in speaking through practice in the class 
only as it would be to expect to play well on the piano 
by appearing in recital. Home practice is absolutely 
essential. Through it come smoothness and that other 
essential of good speaking, self-confidence. 
“But,” reasons a thoughtful student, ‘if I practice 
my talk many times, have I not memorized it, after all?”’ 
“Not if, as directed, you vary your wording, your sen- 
tence structure, sometimes your manner of presenting 
ideas, every time you go through the talk in practicing.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
124 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
“Won't that make it a different speech each time? 
And how shall I ever know beforehand what I am going 
to say?” 
“What is kept the same each time is the thought, 
and the order of presentation. They must be fixed in 
your memory. The expression must be left free to grow 
in power and beauty.” 
Time limit. One of the most important things in con- 
nection with the teaching of spoken English is the strict 
observance of the time limit. It derives its importance 
from its relation to the audience, and from its effect upon 
the speaker and his talk. 
Everyone will agree that one of the commonest faults 
of speakers is that they talk too long, exceeding the power 
of attention in their audience, weakening their main point 
by excessive detail or even by irrelevant matter, or ram- 
bling without any conscious goal. The time limit pro- 
hibits this pointlessness or, at least from the point of 
view of the listeners, prevents it from continuing beyond 
endurance; and further, where there are several on the 
program, it makes it impossible for one speaker to 
encroach upon the time of another. 
For the speaker, the effect of the time limit is most 
salutary. It permits no rambling; it obliges the exclusion 
of extraneous matter; it requires condensation and con- 
ciseness; and it points the way to proportion. For if 
when the time limit is reached the speaker has progressed 
but little beyond the introduction, his speech is a failure. 
If he has carefully planned a telling ending, which the 
inexorable timekeeper prevents his delivering, his talk 
ends weakly and he is impressed with the necessity of
-P-A-G-E-137
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 125 
shortening somewhere. A very prevalent habit is that 
of using many unnecessary words. The time limit helps 
to eliminate them. For most classes, few talks should 
be longer than five minutes. The training thus given is 
most excellent discipline for those who ordinarily must 
talk longer, say from twenty minutes to three-quarters 
of an hour, in that it inculcates careful condensation, 
conciseness, definiteness of aim, and good proportion. 
All preparation practice should be done before a time- 
piece. 
The wording of the title. Since the initial impression 
made has much force in determining the interest aroused, 
some attention should be given to the wording of the 
titles of talks. In this matter, as in all others, some 
consideration must be given to the occasion and to the 
audience. 
A title to be good must meet three requirements: 
1. It must be brief and clear. 
2. It should be attractive. 
3. It must be appropriate. 
Brief means simple and short, with no unnecessary 
words or long phrases: about three words or less. 
Attractiveness is of course a relative term, but gen- 
erally it is heightened by novelty, by alliteration and 
charm of sound, and by whatever appeals to curiosity. 
Observe the titles of moving-picture shows. They must 
be short, the space occupied being limited to the length 
of the sign in incandescent lights across the sidewalk, and 
they must be snappy, being the chief advertisement 
of the show. In order to be attractive, however, the 
title of a talk need not go to the extremes of novelty

and of the curiosity-exciting phraseology sometimes found 
in titles in the movies. Avoid jazz in titles as well as in 
music. 
Appropriateness requires that there be in the title a 
suggestion of the theme of the talk. Herein may be 
introduced the curiosity-provoking element, in that 
figurative language may at the same time conceal and 
disclose the intention of the speaker. While a too-dry 
literalness should be avoided, the subject must not be 
misleading or without relevancy. 
The following are titles as first worded by high-school 
pupils (numbered a), and as finally used after measure- 
ment by the three requirements (numbered b):

Style of speaking. Dr. Charles Eliot, formerly president 
of Harvard University, once made an address of an hour’s
-P-A-G-E-139
Spoken English and How to Teach It 127 
length to an audience of five or six hundred persons. 
He stood with hands clasped behind him, and spoke with 
a quiet ease that held the attention of his audience until 
the close. Afterwards, one of his hearers overheard 
another pronouncing: 
“Well, that was a good talk. But there wasn’t any- 
thing oratorical about it.” 
His viewpoint was that any speaker who addressed an 
audience was expected to do something unusual and 
unnatural with his voice and his hands. 
\The style of speaking demanded by good taste, based 
upon common sense,.and valued for its effectiveness, is 
the conversational. | It means talking simply and natu- 
rally to people, in a direct, forceful way, just as in talking 
to one or two friends, with the difference that the larger 
the hall, the louder, the slower, and the more distinct the 
speaking must be.) 
Self-discipline. Stuccess in spoken English depends 
upon self-discipline — the teacher can suggest, direct, and 
stimulate, but the student must have the capacity for 
drilling himself. Progress is proportional to practice. 
Power comes to those who are capable of self-discipline. 
Examples of talks made by high-school students. 
The following are specimens of talks prepared by high- 
school students and produced according to the methods 
described in this chapter. Soon after being given, they 
were written out, as nearly as the pupils could remember, 
exactly as they had been spoken. No one knew before 
making the speech that he was to be asked to write it. 
Let it be kept in mind that the purpose of the course 
in spoken English is to develop in the student command 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
of the language for instant use as a means of communica- 
tion with other human beings; that such communication 
involves the power to interest his hearers, the power of 
independent thinking, and the ability to get his product 
over to the audience. 
In judging these specimens, it is essential to look for 
more than the teacher usually requires from an exercise 
in written composition. A written composition is usually 
marked for correctness, for sentence structure, and other 
rhetorical qualities, and if it possesses these, is considered 
good. In spoken English these qualities are desirable, 
but are subordinated to the adapting of material to a 
purpose; to the qualities of originality and interesting- 
ness; to the discrimination in the selection of details 
necessary to produce an effect; and to the clearness of 
thinking evidenced in appropriateness of wording and 
the driving home of a point. 
Let it be borne in mind also that a speaker, who must 
impress what he has to say as he is speaking, must 
necessarily repeat more than a writer, whose reader may 
read and re-read the paragraph if attention wanders; and 
that a speaker may, and frequently does, construct his 
sentences rather more loosely than a writer conforming 
to traditional written standards. 
More Homes ror Dattas 
In looking over the Dallas Morning News for last Sunday, I 
noticed twenty-some odd advertisements that read something 
similar to this: “A house for sale; a small payment down, the 
balance like rent.” 
Now in the course of the last few days I have talked with 
several apartment house owners, and I have found from them
-P-A-G-E-141
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 129 
that the great working class of America pay all the way from 
twenty-five dollars to seventy-five dollars per month for 
apartments. 
People, this is absurd! Twenty-five to seventy-five dollars 
that these people give to the landlord! They will never see 
them again, unless it is in the form of an automobile or some 
other luxury that the landlord owns. The dollars will never 
work for them again. They have relinquished their claims 
upon them, and these hard-earned savings are gone forever. 
But the man who is putting his money in a home is making 
an investment. It means the same to him as going to the bank 
and depositing it. It is a case where there is everything to gain 
and nothing to lose. 
Why, at the end of ten years, at the rate of fifty dollars a 
month, these people would have saved six thousand dollars. 
Just think of it, six thousand dollars! That would buy them a 
beautiful home. 
Some people may say, ‘‘ What if he loses his job, or becomes 
ill? Sometimes the real-estate people take the house if the 
payments are not made.’’ What if they do take the house? 
He has lost no more than he would have by paying rent. 
But in most cases we find that he is able to get a loan on his 
property or sell it, and thereby regain his money. 
Then when this home owner becomes too old to work, he has 
something to fall back on, instead of being kicked into the 
gutter when he is no longer able to pay rent. But when the 
renter gets too old to work and cannot meet his rent—it is 
over the hill to the poorhouse. 
Some people say that they would rather live in an apartment 
house than own their home. The majority of these people 
have never lived in a home of their own, and consequently 
don’t know what a home means. Almost any one can tell you 
that the feeling of privacy that exists in a home does not and 
cannot exist in an apartment house. Then in an apartment  
-P-A-G-E-142
  130 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
house there is no yard space, and people are jammed and 
crowded into the houses until they have scarcely room enough 
to breathe. 
It is said that nine-tenths of the people who occupy apart- 
ment houses do not have children. But nine-tenths of the 
people who own their own homes do have children. And, 
ladies and gentleman, I leave it to you, is there anything 
sweeter, or that can take the bitterness out of a man’s life 
quicker, than a little child? 
It has often been said that where a man’s money lies, his 
heart is also there. Then would it not be reasonable to conclude 
that the home owner would have his heart in America? The 
renter has nothing to look forward to at night. He has nothing 
“ to do, no children to play with, no yard to care for, and so we 
find an idle mind. An idle mind is the devil’s workshop. Here 
is where the bolshevik and the anarchist get in their deadly 
work. Are we going to stand with hands folded behind our 
backs and watch the enemies of hai ube tear her to pieces 
from the inside? 
If not, then it is up to us, the future citizens of America, 
to encourage more home buying and more home building. 
More homes, more happiness; more happiness, better com- 
munities; better communities, a better America! 
This talk, while it has a few flaws in wording and sen- 
tence structure, possesses the admirable virtues of direct- 
ness, animation, and forcefulness of style. It drives to 
the point without waste of words. The beginning is 
devised to catch the attention, the reasoning is convinc- 
ing, and the appeal to feeling is cumulative. 
Tue Neep or A New AvuDITORIUM 
You have all heard of that old saying, that spring turns 
thoughts toward clothes and love. This may be all very true
-P-A-G-E-143
  Spoken English and How to Teach It TSE 
of the Dallas youth, but the older generation, those who are 
thinking of a future and greater Dallas, of their posterity — 
their thoughts turn to one of the greatest needs Dallas has 
ever known—a new auditorium. 
Dallas is the only city of its size in the United States that 
holds its grand opera in a ‘‘barn.” ‘This was the statement 
made by Miss Mary Garden, when she sang in Dallas a few 
days ago. And Miss Garden was not mistaken in this state- 
ment. For the present Coliseum was originally built for a 
barn and at the present time is little more than one. In the 
year 1900 the State Fair Officials had the present Coliseum 
built. And, ladies and gentlemen, it was built for a barn, a 
cattle barn, a place for cattle brought from all over the state 
to be judged at the State Fair. During the next few years the 
officials saw that Dallas was growing so rapidly that she would 
have to have a large auditorium, so seats were installed in this 
barn, and from then on it was known as the Coliseum of the 
State Fair of Texas. And, ladies and gentlemen, please bear 
in mind that at this time the population of Dallas was not 
quite 70,000, and at the present time is over 200,000. Now 
does it seem fair that the present Dallas should have to use 
the same auditorium she had when she was a city three 
times as small? Miss Garden goes on to say, “I have just 
finished helping to open the new auditorium in Chattanooga, 
Tennessee. It was an inspiration to sing in this beautiful build- 
ing. And I understand that the Dallas people are seriously 
considering building an auditorium similar to this one in 
Chattanooga; and I want to say to the people of Dallas, 
that this is the greatest thing that could possibly be done for 
the furtherance of art in Dallas and in Texas.” 
Now Miss Garden is not the only celebrated person to protest 
against the Coliseum. When Geraldine Farrar was here this 
past winter, she declared she would never sing in Dallas again, 
for it was so cold the night she sang here that she had to keep 
10
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
her coat on all the time she sang. John McCormack, too, made 
this protest, that he was so cold in the Coliseum that he had to 
keep his overcoat on all the time he was singing, therefore he 
would never sing in Dallas again. When William Jennings 
Bryan was here, in the afternoon he talked at one of the large 
downtown churches, at night at the Coliseum. Both of these 
times hundreds of people were turned away; people to whom this 
meant probably the only chance they would ever have to hear 
this celebrated orator. When Fritz Kreisler played in Dellas, 
during two of his most beautiful numbers the freight trains 
went tooting by and ruined both of them. (I mean the pieces, 
not the trains.) 
Now this is not the only defect in the Coliseum, for it is 
not situated in a central location. When the present Coliseum 
was built, the majority of the Dallas people were situated around 
the State Fair. At the present time Dallas has extended for 
miles around the country, to Oak Cliff, Highland Park, Trinity 
Heights, Munger, and other suburbs. 
Now you may say, granting for the sake of argument, that 
the Coliseum is not all that it should be; there are other audi- 
toriums in Dallas, why not use them and save the expense of 
building a new one? But the City Hall was not built for an 
Opera House, but for a gathering place of Dallas citizens; and 
it only has a seating capacity of 500. The Majestic Theatre 
was not built for an Opera House, but a place for vaudeville 
companies to come to; and it only has a seating capacity of 
2,100. 
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, for no other reason than 
to hold her place with the other large cities of the United 
States, Dallas, the largest city in Texas, the leading city of 
the Southwest, and with the exception of Los Angeles the 
city that is growing faster than any other in the United 
States, should certainly build a new, large, centrally located 
auditorium.

This talk is a good example of rapid, forceful spoken 
English, directed by the purpose of influencing opinion 
toward a desired end. The audience is strongly felt, 
even in the printed version. The style is easy without 
being colloquial, and exhibits that looseness of sentence 
structure characteristic of conversation, where relation 
of parts and relative importance are indicated, not, as 
in written composition, by placing, but by pause and tone 
of voice. 
Tests of ability in spoken English. A fair and yet 
an exacting test of proficiency, in giving evidence of 
thinking power and language command, on the part of 
high-school students of spoken English was held when 
the following talks were produced. 
Each student was handed a sheet of blank paper and 
a pencil with which to make an outline, and a list of sub- 
jects from which to choose; given twenty minutes to 
decide upon and organize his material; and allowed five 
minutes to make his talk. 
The subjects given were as follows: 
A Problem now confronting the State of Texas. 
A Civic Problem now before Dallas. 
A Problem of the Oak Cliff High School. 
What makes Texas a Great State? 
What constitutes a Home? 
A Great Character from History. 
The subjects taken by these pupils had never before 
been used by them for speeches. The stenographer was 
directed to take every word as spoken, and in typing to 
correct no errors. Every effort was made to secure an 
accurate reproduction of the work of the speakers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
         
134 Spdlies English and How to Teach It 
Talk A was made by a junior who had had eight months 
of training in the spoken-English class. His work shows 
power of organization, and discrimination in the selection 
of material directed strictly to making his point in favor 
of exemptions. His thinking is clear, his sentence struc- 
ture in the main good, and his style fluent. 
Talk B was made by a sophomore who had had four 
months in spoken English. While it has the obvious 
faults of clumsiness due to lack of experience, it is notable 
for force and directness, has the merit of making the 
idea attractive through concreteness, and shows a fine 
perception of the value of concentrating on a single idea 
and hammering it home. 
The last talk, C, made by a senior after six months of 
training, is a remarkable example of excellence in spoken 
English. It shows rapidity of thought, grasp of the sub- 
ject, a wide and accurate vocabulary, and a sentence 
structure showing an exceptionally fine and delightful 
sense of sentence rhythm—a quality seldom found in 
the extemporaneous talks of even experienced speakers. 
A. Pupirs Maxine Ninety or Asove SHoutp Be Exempt 
FROM EXAMINATIONS IN THE Datias HicH ScHooLs 
Let us take a brief survey of the present system of schooling 
in regard to examinations in high school in the city of Dallas. 
The time was when in the Dallas high schools the students, 
after having made the grade of ninety or above in any subject, 
would be exempted from final exams in that subject. Now, 
matters are entirely different. Regardless of the grade which 
the student gets, regardless of the fact that he even might 
get a hundred, he is not exempted from the final examination. 
The main objection brought against this system of exempting 
pupils from final exams before, was, that it is beneficial to 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 13 
students to stand the finals, that these finals prepare him for 
the college exams which he will have to take. Under the 
present system of examinations no more benefit is derived from 
the final examinations than from the quarterly tests. The 
finals are of the same length as the tests, due to the fact that 
three exams are given instead of one. One examination covers 
very little more than a quarterly test. So the pupil gets the 
same training out of the quarterly tests for college as he does 
out of the finals under the present system. 
Now the merits of this rule of having students who make 
ninety or above exempted from that subject far outweigh this 
objection, for, as we have seen, the argument that it is bene- 
ficial in preparing the student for college reviews is but a brief 
survey of the facts. One merit is that it will lessen the burden 
of the teachers. Of course, many will say that the teachers 
are paid to do their work if they are paid to do it at all; but 
when such a rule as this is for the benefit of the students, why 
not take into consideration our teachers? Because of that, 
they are grading the papers of pupils who most likely would not 
fail anyway. It is one of the teacher’s hardest tasks — grading 
examination papers. 
The greatest merit of this system is that it gives the student 
agoaltoworkfor. It adds zest tothe work. The student who 
does not thus, under the present system, get a reward if he 
makes ninety in one subject, and does not make ninety in all 
subjects, would receive a reward under this system by being 
exempted in that subject. At the same time it has stimulated 
him to work for this reward. 
I do not say that human psychology would show that any 
student would work harder when there is such a reward await- 
ing him, but it is possible beyond a doubt that this is the case. 
When this system was in Dallas the students would work 
harder to keep their grades above ninety than they do at 
" present.

B. Wuat Maxes Texas A Great State? 
What is it that makes Texas a great state? It is organi- 
zation. Organization is something where everyone is work- 
ing together for a common cause. Everyone works together 
to put one thing over and put it over well. The people of 
Texas always work together for a common cause. They are 
united. 
Some people have for a motto, “‘ Be prepared,” but this motto 
could be better by saying ‘‘Be organized,” because in organi- 
zation there is preparedness. Every person who is looking for 
a fight or scrap does not pick out some one who is larger than 
he is. He would not go to anybody or any person who is 
organized. He goes to some one who is small. 
This can be applied in many ways. For instance, when 
Germany started the war she did not pick out any nation that 
was larger than she was, but she picked out Belgium and 
France, and a few of the smaller places around there. Why 
was it that Germany lost out during the war? She had one of 
the best armies and navies in the world. Was it because France 
was on the other side, or England? 
It was because the Allies were united. They were under an 
organized lead to ‘“‘keep the world safe for Democracy.” 
An anecdote may be applied in this way. One summer 
afternoon, when it was real hot, a traveler was seen going from 
one city to another. He had not walked very far when he saw 
an old darky ina buggy. When the darky came up to him, he 
asked him for a ride to the nearest town. 
“Boss,” said the fellow, ‘‘I will be glad to let you ride.” 
They were passing through a forest, and every time they 
came to a bee on a flower, the old darky took his long whip and 
knocked it off. He did this each time they came to a bee. 
The traveler did not say anything, but kept on sitting where he 
was. Finally when they came to a beehive the darky just 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
Spoken English and How to Teach It 137 
looked at it. The traveler asked him why he did not knock 
those bees down. And the negro said, ‘‘Boss, them bees is 
organized.” 
This can be applied to everyday life. If one is organized, 
no other persons can put something over him. 
Texas, the state of states, where statesmen work together 
for the common interest! The fine roads and highways in 
Texas were not put over by any official in one city, but they 
were put over by the officials in all the cities of Texas, work- 
ing for the common cause of the border state. Every time 
anything is needed in Texas, they have a bond issue, and 
everyone works for the common issue. And this is organiza- 
tion. And that is why Texas is one of the greatest states in 
the Union. 
C, LEGISLATIVE ORGANIZATION IN TEXAS 
The legislative organization in Texas should be modified. 
The Hull-Youngblood case, which recently attracted state-wide 
attention, has awakened a great many people of Texas to a 
problem which demands their serious consideration. 
The Legislature has too many members, and the bicameral 
system should be abolished. It is a regulation of former time, 
and has far outlived its usefulness. At present, few bills which 
pass one house are stopped in the other, and if such a thing 
should occur, a conference is called and matters are adjusted, 
if possible. The House has the power to pass most of the laws 
which affect the people of Texas. The Senate is restricted in 
its power to legislate. The work done by both houses could as 
easily be done by one and an immense saving of time and 
money effected thereby. 
Each house, each branch rather, of the Legislature, must 
support its army of clerks, stenographers, and readers, and 
each house must have a chaplain. If these branches were
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 § Spoken English and How to Teach It 
consolidated into one house, most of these expenses could be 
eliminated. 
Then the amount of time it requires to pass a bill through 
both houses could be saved to the people. A bill is introduced 
in one branch and there it is debated upon, read, re-read, referred 
to, criticized, and examined down to the last analysis. Then it 
must pass the other house, where it undergoes precisely the 
same process before it can go to the governor for his signature. 
One year thirteen hundred bills were introduced into the 
regular session of the thirty-eighth Legislature. Each bill 
had to be passed if possible. It would mean that the two houses 
together would have to consider during sixty days twenty-six 
hundred measures, because each house must consider each 
measure. Were the two houses consolidated, more and better 
legislation could be effected, and there would be less of the 
so-called “‘blind legislation,” for there would be more time for 
the legislators to consider each bill. 
At present we have about one hundred fifteen representatives, 
and something like thirty senators, making a total of one 
hundred forty-five. We pay these men five dollars a day for 
sixty days, which totals up to forty-three thousand dollars, 
and yet not a single member received sufficient money to pay 
his expenses during this time. 
The same work which is done by one hundred forty-five 
members could easily be done by one hundred thirty members 
had we but one Legislature and were the districts enlarged. 
Each member could then give more consideration to each bill. 
The cost of printing would be lessened, and the time which is 
taken up in lengthy debating would be comparatively decreased. 
The amount of money which each member received could be 
increased, and we could pay our legislators a living wage, 
which at present they do not receive. 
The lawmakers are incompetent, and the reason can be 
attributed to the fact that efficient and intelligent men 
  1
-P-A-G-E-151
Spoken English and How to Teach It 139 
hesitate to place their names before the people as candidates 
because the state of Texas is too niggardly to pay their expenses 
while they are doing the state’s business. The men who are 
down there now are mostly influenced by considerations of 
position. They are for the most part politicians, few of them 
being experts in business matters. 
If we were to increase the salaries of these men, the best 
in the state could be secured. Experts in economical and social 
conditions would then be behind the Texas laws, and less of 
the haphazard legislation which characterizes our present 
legislators would be passed. 
When Texas, through the abolition of the bicameral system, 
then really does away with the overcrowded Legislature, 
bringing into effect a more efficient government, we will see a 
new era in the politics of the state, and we will have paved the 
way for governmental reforms which experience has shown to 
be impossible under the present organization. 
Letters in spoken English. Another test of profi- 
ciency in spoken English is found in the dictation of 
letters. 
The following examples of letters were produced by 
a college class toward the close of its second quarter of 
work in spoken English. No writing whatever was done 
in the preparation, and the dictation was taken by a 
member of the class. 
At that time George Peabody College was engaged in 
raising certain endowment funds, and these letters were 
prepared by the class for actual use in forwarding the 
campaign. A letter for such a purpose is one of the 
most difficult to frame successfully. It must conform to 
the general standards of effectiveness in business com- 
munications; it must further meet the more exacting 
   
-P-A-G-E-152
  140 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
requirements demanded by the conditions peculiar to the 
college; and it must adapt itself also to the individual 
disposition of its recipient. 
Standards in general. The letter must be short and 
to the point. Long letters are seldom read. It must be 
clear, and definite as to what is wanted. It should be 
correct in every detail, and courteous in tone. 
Standards definite as to the college. The letter must 
not put the college in the attitude of begging. Rather 
it must show that the college, engaged in the service 
of education, is offering to the recipient an opportu- 
nity to codperate and share that service. The style of 
the letter must be in keeping with the dignity of the 
institution. 
‘Standards definite as to the recipient. The letter must 
show an acquaintance with the various interests and 
accomplishments of the recipient, to create a favorable 
impression, not by flattery, but by the expression of 
appreciation of what he has done and what he stands for.

I do not know of a person in Giles County who has con- 
tributed more in the last few years towards the prevention of 
children’s epidemics than you have. I feel that your influence 
will be felt for generations to come. You have no doubt reached

the prevention of same is through the education of the children 
themselves.

The greater part of this training will fall on the shoulders 
of the teachers of our public schools. 
Peabody College is doing more each year in the health 
department toward the training of teachers for their duties 
at home. This year, twelve teachers from Giles County who 
are taking this training in Peabody will go back and train our 
own children to be well. 
You can readily see how many children will be reached in 
this way by these and other teachers. 
Will you be one of ten professional men to contribute five 
hundred dollars each toward the building and equipment for this 
work at Peabody College? I feel sure you cannot do more for 
your county in this line than by your contribution to Peabody 
College.

Dear Dr. Howarp: 
No doubt you, as a former president of the Arkansas Medical 
Association, have intimate knowledge of the health needs of 
the small towns and the rural communities of the South. 
Entirely too many children are suffering from one or more 
physical defects that could be easily remedied if the teachers 
possessed the training that would enable them to detect these 
weaknesses. Thousands of children in the South are suffering 
from undernourishment because their parents and teachers 
do not know enough about dietetics.

Peabody College is endeavoring to train teachers in the 
subjects of health service, nursing, dietetics, physical education, 
and child welfare. Her facilities, however, are not sufficient to 
enable her to render the service for which she sees so great a 
need among the ten million children of the South. 
A benefactor has agreed to give Peabody College two hundred 
‘thousand dollars as an endowment for training teachers in this 
work, provided other friends will give a like amount. 
For how much can we count on you in raising this fund?

In the campaign of educating the children of the nation, the 
Southern section is, as you are aware, in the rear. The one 
hundred fifty thousand teachers who are leaders in this work 
in the field have been greatly handicapped because of lack of 
proper training. 
George Peabody College for Teachers has come to the rescue 
in this great need. The members of the faculty are experienced 
experts in their respective lines. 
For them to render the greatest service, it is desirable that 
they visit the teachers in the field in solving their problems. 
They have not been able to do this because of the lack of 
substitute instructors to carry on the work during their 
absence from the college. 
We are endeavoring to supply this need by raising an endow- 
ment fund of eighty thousand dollars to be used to employ 
substitute instructors. Forty thousand dollars of this amount

has been pledged provided the remaining forty thousand dollars 
is secured from other sources. 
Knowing your interest in the South, I feel that you will 
want a part in this work. I take this opportunity of ask- 
ing you to make a contribution of one thousand dollars for 
this cause. Trusting that you will give this your favorable 
attention, I am

My pear Miss WuarRTON: 
I have been very much interested in the work the women 
of Little Rock have been doing to improve health conditions 
for the children of Little Rock. Consequently I am writ- 
ing you about the work at Peabody College in training 
teachers for leadership in physical education, health, and child 
welfare. x 
During the past few years much substantial work has been 
done in training the teachers. However, our facilities, as far 
as buildings are concerned, are limited. Hence we are planning 
to improve these facilities by an endowment of four hundred 
thousand dollars, two hundred thousand of which has been 
promised by a responsible person. 
We are planning to raise the other two hundred thousand 
through the women’s clubs. The quota for Arkansas is ten 
thousand dollars. 
I am asking you to present the matter to the women’s clubs 
of Little Rock, and ask them to send us one hundred dollars. 
Very truly yours,

Mr. Alfred T. Marshall,

Dear Mr. MarsHALt: 
I do not know how you are meeting the demands that 
physical education be taught in all the public schools. How- 
ever you are meeting them, I am sure you find that there is an 
insufficient number of teachers prepared to give this instruction. 
Peabody College is trying to meet this demand for physical 
education, and is offering training in child welfare, public health, 
and physical education to the extent of its capacity. In order 
to enlarge in this work, the equipment of the college must 
be extended by an endowment of four hundred thousand 
dollars. One half of this sum is offered on condition that the 
South furnish the other half. 
Tennessee, being the home of Peabody College, and being 
directly concerned on account of the compulsory education 
law, is making generous efforts to aid in this work. 
We should like to have you organize a campaign in your 
county to raise money to help in this endowment. The litera- 
ture inclosed will inform you of the needs of the state, and of 
the hopes of the college, and we shall be glad to send personal 
representatives to the meetings of your people. 
Kindly let us know what you will attempt along this line so 
that we may codperate. 
Yours very truly,

  CHAPTER VIII 
\ CONDUCT OF THE RECITATION 
Atmosphere of the class. The teacher of spoken 
English should bear in mind constantly, and also im- 
press upon his pupils, that the object of the course is to 
make them better speakers—that is, to give them more 
ready command of their language for any purpose of 
speech that may arise.) This requires practice, constant 
and daily practice, and that under the most favorable 
conditions. ence it is important that the atmosphere 
of the class be that of friendly feeling, and freedom./ An 
informal lecture or talk by the teacher, which the students 
are encouraged to interrupt by question, comment, and 
illustration, given at the first meeting of the class, and 
setting forth the general objects of the course, its main 
underlying principles, and the rough divisions of the 
work, will help to make the students feel at home. If 
the teacher will appeal to them directly for their opinion 
on the points he touches, and for corroboration of his 
statements out of their own experience, he will do much 
to remove the feeling of constraint that many students 
experience in the presence of superior knowledge, and to 
establish confidence in themselves based on their teacher’s 
respect for them. 
The work of the teacher of spoken English is largely 
individual, and it is essential that he make each student 
145

ae gaeee. I Spoken English and How to Teach It eas i 
feel that his teacher is ei in him individually and 
understands his needs and will help him to improve. 
In order to improve the speaking habits of any person, 
it is essential that the teacher know what that person’s 
speaking habits are, and those habits are revealed only 
when the student forgets himself and forgets the teacher 
sufficiently to express himself naturally —that is, as he 
is accustomed to speak when voluntarily moved to talk 
the classroom. 
order that there shall be an atmosphere of freedom, 
e students must furthermore understand that they are 
at all times allowed to express their own opinions) They 
must feel that it makes no difference if their opinions do 
not coincide with those of the teacher, and that such differ- 
ences in no way affect their standing —that the teacher 
is not censoring opinion, but cultivating speaking ability, 
and directing the student toward a sound basis for his 
opinions. 
\ Most important of all—except kindliness—is stimu- 
Saga of an interest that focuses the attention of the 
student wholly outside of himself. Such interest does 
away with timidity, self-consciousness, and constraint, 
and reveals the actual condition of the speaker, from the 
point of view of mastery of language, so that the teacher 
can point out the way to betterment. His trouble may 
be faulty diction, habitual mispronunciation, slovenly 
enunciation, addiction to semi-profanity, lack of taste in 
choice of words or illustrations, absence of logical con- 
nection or thinking power, love of high-flown phrases— 
whatever fault is there will be apparent and can then be 
corrected. 
       
-P-A-G-E-159
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 147 
oe geile first things then for the teacher to do is to 
ceriter the thought of the students on the thing to be 
done —to stimulate interest in the topics to be discussed, 
so that there will be a strong desire to talk/ 
Organization of class. Organization of the class by 
its election of a presiding officer is a help to creating an 
atmosphere of freedom and promotes acquaintance and 
friendliness. At the same time such organization gives 
opportunity to a number of the students to learn how 
to preside; every one of whom, as he learns, gains con- 
fidence and power. 
The presence of a student in the chair releases the 
teacher from the duty of recognizing speakers.) He may 
seat himself among the students, toward the back of the 
room, where he can better observe every detail of the 
work done, and especially ascertain whether the speakers 
can be heard with distinctness throughout the room. 
Seating. The students should be scattered over the 
room. This enables the speakers to get practice in 
speaking to those at some distance from them and in 
adjusting their voices to the size of the room, and causes 
the members of the class to realize that such adjustment 
of voice is necessary. 
The speakers should, as a general thing, be called to 
the front and seated on the platform facing the class. 
This gives them an opportunity to gain composure by 
looking at the audience awhile before beginning to speak, 
and is exactly what they may expect when, outside the 
class, they have occasion to speak before any assembly. 
Timekeeper. The presiding officer at once appoints a 
timekeeper, whose duty it is to see that no speaker goes 
11 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
148 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
beyond the allotted time. When the timekeeper calls 
time, the speaker should finish his sentence and take his 
seat. Under only the most exceptional circumstances 
should the time be extended. For if the plea be admitted 
that this talk is so very interesting, there will frequently 
be talks so interesting that exceptions will be made until 
the time limit will be of no force. If the time of one 
student is extended, it can only be at the expense of the 
time rightfully belonging to some other student. / A rigid 
enforcement of the rule has also a most wholesome effect 
in securing careful preparation in organization and pro- 
portion, and prevention of rambling, 
Applause and voting. Applause in the class, both as a 
speaker is called and when he has finished, has a double 
function. First, it prepares the student for actual con- 
ditions of life, an end which always is held in view in the 
teaching of spoken English; and second, the applause 
preceding the speech encourages the speaker, enabling 
a self-conscious one to feel, as he moves to the-front of the 
stage, a little shielded by the general stir. \The applause 
that follows a speech will, if feeble, apprise the speaker 
of his failure; or, if enthusiastic, assure him of his success) 
Occasional voting by the class for the best speech of 
the day is beneficial in revealing to the speaker what has 
appealed to his audience, and prompts him to study both 
the speech securing the greatest number of votes and his 
own, in order to discover the elements of success. 
Constructive criticism. Criticism by the teacher must 
be of such a sort as eolepee student eager to try again, 
with a definite ide to what in his work may be im- 
proved, and how to go about making it better. \It must 
J 
 
-P-A-G-E-161

2% the same time apprise him of his weakness and fill him 
with encouragement. 
As a general rule, it is best to give a student one thing 
at a time to work on. Impress upon him that the eradi- 
cation of that one fault is what he most needs;) send him 
away with his attention centered upon how he may over- 
come it; and the next time he appears, watch for the 
results of his effort, recognize his success if he has 
improved —and then set him to work on another point. 
Though no enumeration can cover the infinite variety 
of failings and the subtle shadings of excellencies which 
the complex humanity of any live class may present, 
the following list will suggest to the teacher the main 
points for criticism?! 
1. Appearance? 13. Conclusion 
2. Loudness 14. Repetition 
3. Distinctness 15. Conciseness 
4. Speed 16. Variety

1This list is followed by only a brief explanation of each point, the most 
important being fully discussed elsewhere in the book. 
2 The physical aspect of speaking has been fully treated in many books on 
Public Speaking and Oral Composition, which may be consulted by any 
student interested in making a special study of this phase of the subject. 
Some good treatments may be found in the following books: Woolbert and 
ecen, Better Speech; Brewer, Oral English; Houghton, Elements of Public 
peaking.

150 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
The appearance of the speaker, though often neglected 
as an item in his effectiveness, enters into every inter- 
view, consultation, conversation, talk, or address. It 
cannot be ignored. If the speaker is unconscious of its 
potency, one may be sure the audience feels its effect. 
It is silently making either for or against the force of his 
speech. 
The speaker uld keep in mind constantly that the 
object of piste to reach his listeners, and should 
consider €¥Very part of his physical make-up—his 
appearance, -his voice, his movements—in the light of 
that object. | / 
\Good pogition means standing well-poised, erect, feet 
not too far apart nor too close together, chest high, head 
up—in short, with the whole body ready for use, and 
without any peculiarity of attitude that would detract 
attention from the speech, 
All movement then which reinforces the thought should 
be encouraged, while all that hinders it, either by over- 
shadowing it'in interest or by aimlessness, had better,be 
left out. All affectations of voice or manner should be 
avoided. ln 
(The student w7 | the safe ground of right theory, 
and will alway¢ be“free in practice, if he takes as his 
guide this ohefrinciple: any gesture is bad, however 
full of grace it may~be, if unrelated to what the 
speaker is trying to’express; any gesture is good, if it 
helps the audiengé get the thought and feeling he wishes 
to convey.) / 
The voiceffnust be sufficiently loud to be easily heard 
throughout the room, whatever its size.\ Any person in.

health can talk so as to make a thousand people indoors, 
or several hundred outdoors, hear every word. It is 
one of the essentials of good speaking, without which 
nothing else avails anything, to make oneself heard, and 
to adapt the force of the voice to the size of the audience. 
Occasionally a student will be found who talks too loudly. 
This fault is usually more difficult to cure than the habit 
of talking too feebly, but while it is not fatal to success, 
like inaudibility, it is irritating and often painful, and 
occasionally comic, to the listeners, and should be modi- 
fied. The desirable medium is that which can readily, 
without strain, be heard by all in the room. 
Distinctnesé must increase with the increase in the 
number isteners. An enunciation intelligible to two 
or three might be very indistinct to fifteen or twenty. 
For thirty or a hundred, a much greater effort at distinct- 
ness must be made. 
Speed is an indeterminate thing, depending upon tem- 
perament, distinctness, size of the crowd addressed, and 
the subject handled.\ Given a distinct enunciation, few 
people speak too fast.) They may speak in a rapid mono- 
tone, in which case it is the monotony that prevents the 
listeners from getting the meaning. But many speak 
too slowly. ( Over-deliberateness wearies an audience in 
a short time, and in an address of over five minutes 
becomes noticeably painful.) It may be easily cured 
if it arises from lack of preparation; but if from tempera- 
ment, it takes patient, continued effort. The speaker 
should try gradually to increase his speed until no one 
will think of his rate of talking, but only of what he 
is saying. 
11 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
    152 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
The pitch of the voice is a very important matter, inas- 
much as a high-pitched voice is tiresome and repellent, 
while a low pitch is pleasant and winning. The voice 
should be pitched as low as one can comfortably speak. 
The subject should be judged by this twofold standard: 
Is it appropriate for the audiencé and the occasion; and 
can it be treated in the tim€ allowed? 
The amount of matefial should fill the allotted time, 
~ This does not mean measured down 
to the second; but a talk, called a five-minute talk, which 
fills only three minutes is manifestly ill prepared and is 
lacking in material. The student should be taught how 
to amplify by explanation and illustration. The speech 
which, when time is called, has progressed but little past 
the introduction, manifestly lacks proportion. The 
speaker needs to think of unity, selection of details, and 
relative importance. 
The material itself should be thought of in regard to 
its appropriateness for the audience, and its relation to 
the main point, and should be discarded if, however inter- 
esting, it does not help to drive home the central idea; or 
if, however pertinent, it will offend the taste of the 
hearers. Many a joke or entertaining anecdote is woven 
into a talk, which has no more relation to the theme than 
one fact in an almanac has to the next; and many a 
scientific fact or truth is inappropriate in a popular 
address. 
A sense of proportion is lacking or dormant in some 
speakers, and is perhaps more effectively stimulated by a 
time limit than by any other means. Such people are 
always struck with surprise when time is called. They 
     
     
-P-A-G-E-165
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It ~ 153 
are usually habitually unsystematic in their thinking, 
and should be held to account for not having a point 
when they do not arrive at it within the given time, and 
should be criticized for lack of a good ending as well as 
for poor proportion. ) 
Organization includes the arrangement of the parts of 
the talk, the relation of part to part and of illustration to 
point aimed at. There is no set form, such as introduc- 
tion, body, conclusion, to be strictly followed. / But 
organization must result in clearness, and forbid the-mix- 
ing of points and wandering. 
Most talks permit and many require an introduc- 
tion. This must serve to establish sympathy between 
audience and speaker, secure interest, and be relative to 
the speech. 
There must be an unmistakable object in the speech, a 
theme, central idea, or purpose on the part of the speaker, 
one of which Ye is f conscious, and toward the reali- 
zation of whch must direct every word. This is 
called the pginff ‘Aimless talking should be considered 
only a shadelbetter than inaudible talking. 
The conclusion should be strong and impressive. 
“Letting the old cat die’ will do very well in a swing, 
but will not do at all in a speech. The impulse of pur- 
pose should vivify all that is said, the last few sentences 
most of all. f 
Repetition, whether of words or of complete thoughts, 
is a fault if it occurs from a scanty vocabulary or from 
lack of preparation and faulty organization; but it is a 
matter for commendation if it is consciously inserted for 
emphasis.    
     
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
Conciseness is a rare virtue. The teacher will do well 
to watch for words which add nothing to the meaning, 
for circuitous ways of expressing an idea, and for what may 
be called ‘‘fillers.” How many speakers begin: ‘‘I 
thought I would talk to you a few minutes this afternoon 
on the subject of ‘Our Pet Superstitions.’ ” 
Of course he will talk a few minutes—the time limit 
is five. | 
To be sure he is going ite talk—that is what he is 
there for. 
It is presumed he has Hemet net is a part of his 
preparation. 
This whole sentence is state waste of words and time. 
“And now I must pass to my next point.” One might 
as well say in walking, ‘‘And now I must advance my left 
foot.” Donot say you are about to pass —just go ahead. 
“And now I must close.’’ And by so saying, the 
student has taken uselessly part of the time in which he 
might have made an effective close. 
Variety of expression comes as a result of imagination 
plus industry. Let the teacher not fail to arouse any 
student who needs such awakening, to a realization of 
the poverty of his vocabulary. 
Sentence structure fails oftenest in two points—a 
broken formation resulting in lack of clearness; or a primer 
style resulting in lack of distinction in importance. 
The style of speaking to be cultivated is the conver- 
sational. All artificiality of voice or manner is to be 
discouraged. Talk to fifty people as you would to one, 
with only the necessary difference in loudness, distinct- 
ness, and speed. |  
-P-A-G-E-167
  le and How to Teach It ish. 
Animation is present whenever the speaker himself has 
a lively interest in his talk and an earnest desire to reach 
his audience. It cannot be assumed on the surface, but 
must be secured through an intensification of the feeling 
of the speaker. 
Force, like animation, is dependent upon that something 
in the speaker that wills to succeed. A talk may have 
all the essential elements of success in its composition, 
yet lack that compelling element that makes the goal. 
The speaker must be direct. If he looks at the floor, 
or out of the window, or anywhere except into the eyes 
of his listeners, he cannot command their attention. He 
must watch his audience as he talks. 
Notes, such as may be contained on a small card, do 
not necessarily detract from a talk. Anything larger 
is almost certain to do so. But any notes should be 
regarded as a sort of crutch, from which a healthy intel- 
lect should free itself as soon as possible. 
Direct criticism for diction in the way of pointing out 
specific errors to individuals is usually inadvisable. It 
produces constraint and destroys spontaneity. Occa- 
sionally a student may be told that his weak spot is his 
diction, but particulars should usually be reserved for 
private conferences. The errors of diction may better 
be recorded by the teacher, and given to the class 
without personal reference. This method has the advan- 
tage of sparing the pride of individuals, and giving the 
class freedom to discuss, condemn, or laugh at errors. 
This impresses the fact that the faults are noticeable 
and undesirable, in a way that is impossible if they 
are not the common property of the class. The effect
-P-A-G-E-168
  156 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
of this method of handling errors, however, will be to 
lead the individual to see that he must not spare himself. 
Smoothness is to be attained only by constant and 
systematic practice. Hesitation for words, halting, means 
insufficient preparation on a single speech or inexperi- 
ence in speaking, and is to be overcome by self-drill in 
preparation. The student must actually practice his 
talk aloud, varying his wording each time, until he can 
command sufficient vocabulary to express his thoughts 
readily. 
Concreteness is one of the very foundation stones of 
effective speaking. One-third abstractions or general 
statements, and two-thirds illustrations is a good propor- 
tion for any talk not made to a highly select body already 
interested in the subject. Often, nine-tenths of the talk 
may be made up of illustration. 
Good feeling. It is essential that good feeling between 
student and teacher be maintained, and a right attitude 
on the part of the student toward his work. Hence the 
teacher must use tact, not so much in avoiding disagree- 
able truths as in establishing confidence in the expectation 
that help from him will be forthcoming whenever the 
time comes for his criticism. 
Record of speeches and criticisms. As the teaching of 
spoken English is, on the side of instruction, an art 
dealing with individuals, anything that enables the 
teacher to acquire definite knowledge of the members 
of his class adds just so much to his ability to accelerate 
their progress toward power in speaking. (He must 
know, when any student is addressing the class; exactly 
where that pupil stands as to previous criticism and  
-P-A-G-E-169
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 157 
helpful suggestions, what faults he has overcome, and, 
definitely, what he has been directed to work on. ) Any 
well-equipped teacher could of course listen to an address - 
given by anyone and point out its weaknesses; but in 
order that the work of the course may be a continued 
progress, aimed with intelligence toward certain ends, he 
must organize his criticism so as to build each time on 
what has gone before.) Haphazard criticism is likely to 
spend itself upon details, and while it will effect some 
improvement, it is likely to fall far short of what is possible 
and to miss the constructive quality of that criticism 
which is organized. 
When a class is large, and the teacher must hear six, 
eight, or ten short speeches in rapid succession; when two 
or possibly three classes are scheduled for successive 
hours; and when two or three days must elapse before a 
speaker reappears, it is almost impossible for the teacher 
to hold in mind the exact status of each individual. 
Hence he should keep a written record of every speech 
given in the class. : 
(The record should be complete for each student. ) It 
should be as brief as possible. It should consurme in 
the making as little time as possible, and should be 
made in class. The record should show the criticism 
given for each speech, and indicate whether or not the 
fault was overcome at the next appearance. As a term 
record, it should trace the progress of the student and 
show where he stands at the end. 
On page 158 is a table showing the form of such a 
record as actually kept. A dash or check mark after 
an entry means that the student has corrected the fault.

Criticism by students. Criticism of each other by 
students is a matter of which the teacher cannot be too 
careful.) Judiciously timed and watchfully directed, it 
often proves a helj; but it is capable also of producing 
some very undesirable results. For some time after the 
class is organized, it should not be used at all; comment, 
suggestion, and help should be given entirely by the 
teacher. The students know too little, both of what 
constitutes good speaking and of what is the best way 
to criticize, to use the office of critic wisely.. Their taste 
and judgment both are to be trained by the course 
they are taking, and before a knowledge of general prin- 
ciples in these matters is gained their criticism would 
probably be productive of more harm than good. / Stu- 
dents also sometirnes lack tact, and blurt out bluntly 
opinions which wound the feelings of the speaker, or 
perhaps cause laughter, and in any case increase self- 
consciousness and hinder free and unconstrained speak- 
ing.) Sometimes, on the other hand, the class, through 
fear of offending, will not comment frankly but will 
express only praise. | 
At best, class criticism without guidance is likely to be 
merely scattering shots at miscellaneous details, confus- 
ing by their multiplicity. After the class has made some
-P-A-G-E-171
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 159 
progress, however, criticisms from the members may be 
helpful if they come in response to questions by the 
teacher, in that they show the amount of attention, 
understanding, and appreciation present in the class, and 
reveal to the speaker what impression he has made upon 
his audience. 
Such questions as the following are suggestive of the 
kind that will bring good results: 
1. What is the point in this talk? 
2. Was the introduction appropriate? Why? 
3. What illustrations were used? Were they effective? 
Why? 
4. Was the speech well proportioned? 
5. Was the enunciation good? 
6. Criticize the choice<f subject. 
7 
8       
    . Was the mannerfatural and conversational? 
in the talk? 
Faults and failings that cannot be 
pointed out before the class can often be handled effec- 
tively in private conferences.\ Students then will respond 
to the interest of the teacher, and often explain conditions 
and difficulties, a knowledge of which will make it easy 
for the teacher to point out means of betterment. Praise 
can be given then which it would be unsuitable to express 
before the class, and faults stressed more pointedly. 
While all sensible and earnest students are eager for 
helpful criticism, and ready to acknowledge their faults, 
their pride in their work and their personal feelings in 
regard to their appearance and standing must at all 
times be maintained. Hence the value of the private 
conference. 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  
' i! . 
160 Spoken iinglish and How to Teach It 
Such conferences: may be held either outside of class 
time or during the class period. It is seldom practicable 
to schedule a conference hour; but nearly every day some- 
body will desire to stay after class hour for a few minutes’ 
further conference with the teacher. The time thus spent, 
perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes a day, is often most 
fruitful in results. It is true it reaches only a part of the 
class; but those who seek help are the ones whom the 
touch of the teacher can most benefit. And if he sees 
the need of a few words with any student who does not 
come voluntarily he can easily detain him a moment to 
give the suggestion required. 
A class period may now and then be devoted to con- 
ferences. The best way to manage that is to apportion 
the time so that everyone may have his fair share. 
Appoint a timekeeper who will call time at the end of four, 
or three, or two minutes; indicate the order in which the 
students are to have their turn; and let each one come toa 
seat by the teacher’s desk for his conference, where, while 
the students are talking among themselves, he can speak 
freely with the teacher, knowing that no one else is listen- 
ing or can hear what he is saying. Conferences (except 
in special cases above described) should be voluntary. 
The class may request special individual criticism, or the 
teacher may think it is needed. In either case, if the 
class votes to have it, it is received in a better spirit and 
has a better effect. 
Practice in carriage and attitude. Some time should 
be spent in drilling the class upon the best way to sit on 
the platform, to ge to the front of the stage, and to make 
a presentable beginning. Nothing promotes confidence
-P-A-G-E-173
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 161 
and ease more rapidly than a sense of knowing just how 
a thing should be done, and doing it with others. Have 
the class, in sections of eight or ten, pass to the platform 
and take their seats. From this position let each one in 
rapid succession go to the front, address the chair, and 
return to his platform chair. The attention of everyone 
in the class is thus centered upon one thing, and through 
drill it becomes easy and habitual. 
Groups. Whenever the nature of the work allows, the 
class may be divided into groups, each of which will be 
working on a different detail. This promotes acquaint- 
ance, gives elasticity to the work, permits options, and 
saves time.) Topics such as the following may be handled 
in groups: 
Conversation. “ 
Selection of topics for class discussion. 
Determination of plans for debates and other work. 
Planning a program. 
Learning to breathe from the diaphragm. 
Preparing for parliamentary drill. 
Giving information to introducer. 
The introducer. When the class is studying the 
five-minute talk, where each student chooses his own 
subject, the names of those who are to appear the follow- 
ing day may be announced, together with the appoint- 
ment of an introducer. Immediately a two-minute 
conference between introducer and speakers may be 
arranged in one corner of the room, permitting the intro- 
ducer to secure from the speakers all the information he 
will need—names, subjects, etc.—so that he may per- 
form his part of the program with skill and graciousness.
-P-A-G-E-174
  162 Spoken lnglish and How to Teach It 
Sometimes it will be feasible to divide the class into 
sections for two or three days in advance, with an 
introducer for each group, when conferences of all the 
groups may be held at once. 
Visitors. The presence of guests in the class is most 
desirable in the work of spoken English. If not con- 
trary to the rules of the school, the door of the spoken- 
English classroom should always be open to visitors, who 
afford the chairman an opportunity to exercise his powers 
in meeting the situation by appointing some one to see 
that they are seated, and by judging whether or not he 
should offer them the floor. The privilege of the floor 
should be tendered. very seldom, for remarks by chance 
visitors are of doubtful benefit, and if occurring often 
would consume too much of the time of the class; it should 
be reserved as a distinguishing honor for exceptional 
occasions. The students are benefited by the presence 
of strangers in that they grow accustomed to speak- 
ing before anyone who may present himself, and are 
not thrown into confusion by an unexpected face in the 
audience. The work of the course in spoken English is 
largely a matter of gaining perfect self-control, and 
visitors are distinctly a help. 
Lectures by the teacher. Only a comparatively small 
part of the time of the term should be consumed in lec- 
_tures by the teacher; but that part is extremely important. 
{ It must be used for the purpose of creating in the class 
\the proper atmosphere, implanting right conceptions of 
the purposes and ends in view and of the kind of speak- 
ing which it is desirable to cultivate, and stimulating 
interest in definite parts of the work. No person can
-P-A-G-E-175
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 163 
learn to talk well by any other means than by talk- 
ing himself; therefore the main part of the class. time 
must be given to practice by the students. The 
teacher’s lectures may cover such phases of the subject 
as the following: 
Creating an atmosphere of good will. 
Explaining the fundamental aims of the course. 
Shaping ideals of good speaking. 
Explaining the physical basis of good speaking. 
Giving instruction in regard to conversation. 
Explaining relations with audience, and the end to be 
sought in any one speech. 
An

Approval of subjects. “Some supervision of subjects 
should be maintained in order to be sure that students are 
learning to use the resources within their reach and are 
not at a loss to know what will be suitable for their pur- 
poses; and to ascertain also that no single student is 
confining himself to too narrow a field.) It is the tend- 
ency of some minds to concentrate upon a single line, 
as mechanics, or sanitation, or literary criticism, their 
narrow choice not being noticeable in the variety offered 
by the class, so that it is important that they be directed 
toward other interests and required to diversify. Exact 
knowledge of what each student is doing in the choice 
of subjects can be obtained through a record kept by 
the teacher of each subject used; or, perhaps better, as 
such a record would consume some of the time and 
tequire the attention which may be needed for other 
work, it may be kept by a member of the class appointed 
for that duty, who hands in a report at stated intervals. 
The same end may be reached by asking each student to

hand in, say every two weeks, a list of the topics he has 
used. Most students can be assumed to be capable of 
selecting their own subjects, provided they have the 
general instructions and guidance of the teacher. In 
fact, the richness of resource in this line is rather a matter 
of surprise to teacher and students, and there will 
always be much suggested material which time does 
not permit to be used. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
       CHAPTER IX 
THE ACE OF SPOKEN ENGLISH 
Three divisions of English. The general subject of 
English may be regarded as threefold, consisting of 
literature, written language, and spoken language. 
These three divisions should be recognized as having 
distinct and separate functions and ends, and requiring 
special treatment. In the process of education each 
serves a different purpose and should aim at a different 
result. This can best be attained by separating them in 
the teaching. 
Literature. Literature should be taught for the pur- 
pose of cultivating taste, a right view of life, and high 
ideals, and of giving a better insight into human nature. 
There are, of course, besides these main objects, lesser 
or contributory ones, such as knowledge of history and 
social customs, appreciation of humor and style, and 
absorption of the vocabulary and the structure of the 
language. 
None of these things can well be attained unless the 
teaching is such as to cause the student to enjoy the books 
he studies, and to instill in him a permanent and growing 
love of good reading. This is the paramount thing in the 
teaching of literature. It is doubtful whether any course 
in literature, however much information about novel or 
poem it may impart, is not futile, or worse than futile, 
165
-P-A-G-E-178
166 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
unless it carries with it a love for the book studied, and 
a desire to read more. A course in literature should 
create a permanent interest in good reading. 
A young woman once remarked in regard to a college 
course in English she had just completed: 
“We had Milton. And when we got through we knew 
it. Dr. E was very thorough. We knew it going 
and coming —and we all hated it!” 
Better for her had she never taken the course. 
It is a matter of observation more frequent than is 
pleasant to contemplate that ‘‘classic’”’ is a synonym to 
grammar-grade and high-school pupils for dryness and 
tedium, and that while these pupils are reading, often 
reading largely, they are reading not additional books by 
the authors they study in their English classes but 
other books which they choose for themselves. 
The reason for these unfortunate results is partly that 
the object of teaching literature — the fostering of a love 
for good reading —is not kept in view, and partly that 
instruction in the interpretation of the book is mixed 
with drill in composition, grammar, and punctuation. 
It is only to be expected that if the fire of patriotism in 
Patrick Henry’s memorable speech be sprinkled with 
instruction on the function of the semicolon and the 
derivation of words, the result will be what always follows 
rain on fire—the fire dies out. 
A visitor once entered a class in English of the seventh 
grade in a demonstration school in the college of educa- 
tion of a great university. The teacher had not come, 
so she asked one of the pupils, a boy of about fourteen: 
‘“What is your lesson today?’’   
   
-P-A-G-E-179
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 167 
“Tt’s on King Arthur.” 
“Do you like the King Arthur stories?” 
“Oh,” indifferently, ‘‘I don’t mind ’em.” 
The teacher came in, and the visitor waited expectantly 
for the lesson on ‘‘Arthur the Blameless, who cannot 
die.’ She sat through the entire lesson and saw the 
teacher return some compositions, which the pupils had 
written the day before, and spend thirty-five minutes 
explaining punctuation, or rather certain marks of punc- 
tuation. That was all. 
Here were boys and girls at the impressionable age 
when heroes and noble deeds arouse warm admiration 
and desire to imitate, and the time was spent on the 
semicolon! 
Now the use of the semicolon ought to be taught. But 
the teaching of punctuation should not be misnamed 
literature, and a fine poem should not be its illustration. 
Such mixing confuses the minds of the young students, 
and dims the glory, and deadens the enthusiasm which 
they should feel when becoming acquainted with the 
ideals of the race fashioned in our literary masterpieces. 
Written composition. Written composition too will 
gain by the separation from literature. The object of 
teaching written composition is to drill in matters of form, 
such as punctuation, sentence structure, and _letter- 
writing, and to cultivate appreciation of qualities of style. 
Now all this can better be accomplished if it be taught, 
not in lessons interspersed among other interests, but 
daily for a period long enough to form habit. 
A small boy whose parents had moved to Dallas was 
desirous of entering the fifth grade in the public schools,
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
and consulted a teacher who lived next door in regard 
to the entrance examinations. He remarked: 
“One trouble about the teaching of grammar is, I 
think, that they teach us so many things that we never 
use again.” 
He touched here the weakness in the teaching of many 
things besides grammar—the failure to stress a thing 
until it becomes a habit. 
The separating of the three divisions of English allows 
concentrated, continuous attention upon one line until 
it becomes a habit. Correct. placing and paragraphing 
can become a habit. There can be drill upon punc- 
tuation until it becomes as automatic as forming letters 
in writing. A feeling for sentence structure can be so 
ingrained that a faulty form can be instantly recognized, 
and it becomes natural to think in good sentences. And 
thus can be laid the foundation for appreciation of some 
of the qualities of style. 
Spoken English. Spoken English, more than either of 
the other two divisions, gains by being taught separately, 
and through the separation becomes a source of help to 
the others. ‘For spoken English is more than the framing 
of sentences in answer to questions of the teacher, or in 
fulfillment of an assignment.) Spoken English is the 
study of language directed toward an end, in response to 
a social need, judged by the social unit to which it is 
given, and measured by immediate results. ’) 
A boy is advocating before his class that the use of the 
high-school gymnasium, at present given to the girls’ 
classes for all the school periods, and to the boys only 
for basket-ball after school, should be apportioned equally
-P-A-G-E-181
  
Spoken English and How to Teach It 169 
between boys and girls. A vote is to be taken in the class 
upon his motion to send a committee to the principal to 
request consideration of the plan. Discussion follows. 
Questions are put to him. Objections are raised. He 
finds that he is not informed as to all the facts upon which 
a decision must be based. He is made to realize that he 
has no definite working plan to present for handling the 
classes. He realizes that some otherwise excellent people 
do not agree with him on even his basic proposition that 
the boys ought to have the gymnasium part of the school 
day. He sees a girl smiling—can it be because he 
said, ‘‘They was runnin’’’? Or did he say, ‘‘How come 
we don’t get the gymnasium at all during the entire day?” 
His father had told him not to say ‘“‘how come.’”’ He 
must watch himself for that. It certainly did sound bad. 
He comes back the next day prepared with facts and 
figures. His bad grammar has disappeared. His experi- 
ence the day before was a challenge, and his determination 
to convince that class and win its vote has redoubled. 
Both his material and his language have greatly improved. 
Win or lose, he is eager to try again. If, however, he 
must wait a week, until he has had four lessons on Silas 
Marner, his interest subsides, and the keen edge of his 
experiences spurring him on to do better has been turned: 
     line until a habit is established. 
Spoken English will prove to be a tim .) Almost 
any principle of composition can be taught more effec- 
tively through. spoken English than through written 
composition. \Organization and the making of outlines 
come easily and naturally in preparing talks to be given
-P-A-G-E-182
  170 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
to the class; Leib comes so naturally it is hardly ever 
violated and scarcely needs to be mentioned. Proportion 
becomes so manifestly necessary that its mastery is seen 
to be imperative. A person whe spends two of his 
allotted three minutes in getting s:arted merely succeeds 
in making himself ridiculous. Emphasis is demon- 
strated in the beginnings and endings of the talks. 
Both pupils and teacher are spared a large part of the 
drudgery of preparing and coryécting written themes. 
And the correcting in spokeri English is much more 
efficacious. The spomtanegtis applause or the feeble 
response of the class/is A much better incentive to im- 
provement than the gpdde or the red mark of the teacher 
on the paper. 
Social pressure, Social pressure, or the effect of the 
opinion of others, is the force that has brought about most 
of the elements of our present civilization. It has wrought 
out of the primitive impulses the courtesy of cultured 
society. It drives us all to constancy to monotonous 
routine. It enforces honesty, cheerfulness, cleanliness. It 
inspires to heroism and the finest achievements of the 
spirit. It keeps our laundries going and writes our novels 
and poetry. Yet as a motive power in the teaching of 
English it has been utilized but little. 
Social pressure can be brought into play with great suc- 
cess in spoken English’; Herein spoken English differs from 
written, where direct social pressure cannot be brought to 
bear. ‘The desire to appear well before the class, the wish 
to impress his own ideas and opinions, the elation that 
comes through having convinced and won to his side the 
majority vote, will work great improvement in the 
     
   
-P-A-G-E-183
  Spoken English and How to Teach It 17 
student. Grammar will right itself. Knowledge, merely 
theoretical before, will be transformed into a guide for 
conduct. Knowledge of rhetorical principles will sud- 
denly be illuminated by social demand. Clearness must 
come, to prevent puzzled frowns and blank expressions 
on the faces before the speaker. Words will be assimi- 
lated into the usable vocabulary as filings are attracted 
toamagnet. The intense desire to communicate to other 
intelligent beings will free the powers of personality that 
give charm and distinction. No one who has once tasted 
the intoxication of wakening living response in others but 
will delight in putting forth his best efforts to reach his 
hearers. 
If the teacher does no more than provide the social 
situation, he will have assured better results than could 
come from the most painstaking marking and grading 
of papers.) He can of course do much more than this, 
as the preceding chapters have shown. But the funda- 
mental and all-important thing is to make use of this all- 
powerful force— public esteem, or social pressure. 
And while most of the things that are aimed at in writ- 
ten composition can be better done through spoken 
English, a main object can be reached that is never 
achieved by written work —the mastery of the language, 
coupled with increased thinking power, for instant use 
to meet any occasion life may present—the ability to 
talk well. 
The field of spoken English is a new one. We are 
still pioneers. The teaching of spoken English is being 
carried on in all parts of the country by individuals who 
are doing the work of experimentation. The results
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 Spoken English and How to Teach It 
obtained are gaining recognition by organized bodies of 
teachers, which are undertaking investigation and 
research, far beyond the scope of single teachers, on 
which the foundation for general unified effort must be 
laid. 
The technique of the teaching of written language has 
been in large measure worked out and perfected, and is 
the common possession of teachers of English every- 
where. 
The technique of the teaching of spoken language is 
not yet complete. Such points as the mastery of sentence 
structure and the acquiring of vocabulary for speaking 
purposes yet remain to be perfected. 
Spoken English offers an attractive field for leaders of 
vision and constructive imagination.

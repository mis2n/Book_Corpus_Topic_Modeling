Review of Work in 1919 
By George E. Vincent 
PRESIDENT 
A WORLD-WIDE FIELD 
During the year 1919 the Rockefeller Foundation par- 
ticipated in activities of public health and medical education 
in thirty-nine different governmental areas. Yellow fever 
control was successfully extended in Ecuador, Nicaragua, 
Honduras, and Salvador. Public health progress through 
co-operative campaigns for the cure and prevention of hook- 
worm disease was made in thirteen southern states of the 
American Union, in seven of the states of Brazil, in five 
islands of the West Indies, in five countries of Central Amer- 
ica, and in Ceylon, the Seychelles Islands, China, and Queens- 
land. Demonstrations in the control of malaria were 
continued in Arkansas and Mississippi, and arrangements 
were made for extending the program to eight other southern 
states. A systematic organization for combating tuber- 
culosis in France was widened to include twenty-one 
departments. A modern medical school under Foundation 
* auspices opened its doors in Peking; pre-medical schools were 
aided in Changsha, Shanghai, and Nanking; medical courses 
were supported in Tsinanfu; seventeen hospitals in various 
parts of China were aided. Co-operation was continued in 
the maintenance of an Institute of Hygiene in Sao Paulo 
University in Brazil. A School of Hygiene and Public 
Health at Johns Hopkins University was entirely supported 
by Foundation funds. Fellowships in American University 
centers were granted to seventy-two students of medicine 
and public health from China, Brazil, Salvador, Czecho- 
Slovakia, and the United States. Continuing studies of

publichealth and medical education, officers of the Foundation 
made special visits to the Far East, Europe, Canada, and 
South America. 
A.SEQUEL TO CUBA AND PANAMA 
The sanitary conquest of Havana and of the Canal Zone by 
American medical officers was the first brilliant victory in a 
campaign for the gradual restriction and control of yellow 
fever. For a century and a half this disease had been 
continuously present in Havana, where at times it had 
destroyed entire crews of visiting vessels. The disease 
almost exterminated a French army in Haiti. In 1842 half 
the population of Guayaquil (Ecuador) was carried off. New 
Orleans was often infected; the epidemic of 1878 took a toll 
of 13,000 lives in the Mississippi Valley. 
When the United States forces occupied Cuba, a group of 
army medical officers, headed by Dr. Walter Reed, was sent 
to the island to find out the means by which yellow fever is 
transmitted. In 1881 Dr. Carlos Finlay of Havana had 
suggested that the infection might be traced to the bite of a 
mosquito. To the lay mind this theory was palpably 
preposterous; even medical opinion did not take it seriously. 
The belief generally held was that the disease was spread by 
contact either with a person who had yellow fever, or with 
rooms, bedding, or clothing which he had contaminated. 
Following the discovery by Ross that malaria is trans- 
mitted by the mosquito, the American officers undertook 
ingenious experiments with yellow fever. Volunteers were 
asked to submit themselves to a variety of tests, such as liv- 
ing in a screened building filled with bedding and apparel 
which had been used by fever patients, receiving injections 
of blood taken from infected persons, and exposure to the 
bites of mosquitoes which had access to fever hospitals. The 
response of officers and enlisted men to this challenge was a 
fine example of calm, high-minded courage. Dr. Lazear 
sacrificed his life in the interests of science and humanity. 
The experiments were completely successful; they proved 
conclusively that yellow fever is carried from one person to 
  
e

another by a female mosquito of the species known as 
Stegomyia. This insect is thoroughly domestic in its habits 
and almost invariably breeds in artificial, or man-made, 
“containers. It prefers rain barrels, cisterns, cans, bottles, 
and similar receptacles which contain clean water. It 
seldom flies more than 200 yards and usually bites during the 
daylight hours. The female Stegomyia which bites a person 
who has yellow fever during the first three days of illness, can 
after twelve days and up to a limit of twenty days transmit 
the infection to a healthy individual, who will develop the 
fever within three to six days after infection. 
The discovery of these facts gave a firm basis for sanitary 
. procedures. By depriving the Stegomyia of breeding 
facilities and by the screening of houses against such mos- 
quitoes as managed to get themselves born, General William 
C. Gorgas, first in Havana and later in the Panama Zone, 
achieved a notable control both of yellow fever and of 
another mosquito-borne infection, malaria. Inspired by 
these triumphs, Dr. Oswaldo Cruz succeeded in ridding Rio 
de Janeiro of yellow fever, a feat soon emulated by Dr. 
Liciaga at Vera Cruz. 
During the past fifteen years measurable progress has been 
made in controlling epidemics and in gradually restricting 
yellow fever to a few seed-beds of infection in which the

disease has continuously persisted. Up to 1918 the chief of 
these endemic centers were Guayaquil in Ecuador, Merida in 
Yucatan, suspected areas in Venezuela, along the coast of 
Brazil, and possibly along the West Coast of Africa (see map 
p. 3). To eradicate yellow fever from these seed-beds and 
thus to rid the world of the disease, is the high adventure 
upon which the Rockefeller Foundation embarked in 1918 
under the leadership of General Gorgas. The results so far 
have been substantial and encouraging. 
ON THE TRAIL OF THE YELLOW FEVER GERM 
Until recently attempts to discover the organism which 
incites yellow fever had failed. How the Stegomyia mos- 
quito goes about her work was fully understood, but just 
what she injects into her victims remained a mystery. . 
Obviously, knowledge of the specific germ would be of the 
greatest service in making a final attack upon the seed-beds. 
Yellow fever looks so much like certain other diseases, 
especially infectious jaundice, that a means of identification 
would be immensely useful. Again, if the germ were isolated 
there would be a chance of preparing a serum which would 
both cure and protect. So it was deemed best to make fur- 
ther investigations into this phase of the problem before the 
practical field work was begun. 
Guayaquil was selected as the most favorable center for 
research. There, cases of yellow fever were always available, 
and experienced physicians skilful in detecting them were 
at hand. The one man peculiarly fitted by natural abilities, 
training, and experience to pursue the elusive organism was 
the eminent bacteriologist of the Rockefeller Institute, Dr. 
Hideyo Noguchi, who had made a special study of its near 
relative, the germ of infectious jaundice. The government 
of Ecuador and the city of Guayaquil extended courteous 
invitations, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research 
was ready to co-operate, Noguchi welcomed the opportunity. 
In 1918 a Commission headed by Dr. A. I. Kendall of 
Northwestern University set sail for South America.

PUBLIC HEALTH 5 
  ‘TRAILING THE YELLOW Fever GERM 
Dr. Hideyo Noguchi, of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, in his 
laboratory at Guayaquil, Ecuador, which was specially provided by local health 
authorities. 
The Commission was hospitably received by the author- 
ities and the medical profession of Guayaquil, thus enabling 
Noguchi promptly to begin his investigations. His Ecua- 
dorean collaborators were able to show him indisputable cases 
of yellow fever. With the blood of patients who were in the 
early stages of the disease Noguchi infected guinea pigs. 
These fell ill, showing symptoms which resembled those of 
men suffering from yellow fever. The blood of the first 
group of guinea pigs was used to inoculate another group, in 
which the same manifestations of disease duly appeared. 
Dogs and monkeys proved to be susceptible in a similar way. 
Attempts to transfer the infection from one animal to another 
by means of Stegomyia mosquitoes were successful. Finally 
Noguchi was able to cultivate from the blood a minute, 
delicate, thread-like, spiral organism—half-way between a 
microscopic animal (microbe) and a microscopic plant 
(bacterium). To this he gave the name Leptospira icteroides, 
“slim spiral, the jaundice maker.”’ 
Although Noguchi did not assert that he had discovered 
the inciting germ of yellow fever, and was careful to state 
that he wished to test his results at Guayaquil by further 
investigations in other places, especially in Merida, Yucatan, 
there is no doubt that he has made an enormously valuable  
-P-A-G-E-10
6 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
contribution to the knowledge of the disease. Furthermore, 
his discovery of the slim, spiral jaundice-maker enabled him 
to prepare a serum. This has been administered in a number 
of cases with apparently favorable effect. The number of 
trials is of course*too small to decide the actual value of the 
serum. Thepatients might have recovered without it. All that 
can be said at present is that it seems more than likely that 
a means of identifying yellow fever has been found, and that 
the chances are good of substantially reducing the mortality 
of the disease, which now ranges between 40 and 85 per 
cent, and furthermore that a vaccine can be made which 
apparently protects non-immunes against infection. 
MOBILIZING TO FIGHT THE FEVER IN ITS STRONGHOLD 
The average number of cases of yellow fever annually 
reported in Guayaquil for the years 1912-1918, inclusive, 
was 259. In 1918 the total reached 460. It was in Novem- 
ber, 1918, that a representative of the International Health 
Board of the Rockefeller Foundation arrived in Guayaquil 
to organize a campaign of eradication. He came upon the 
scene when the disease was at its height. In December 88 
new cases were recorded. The attack was undertaken on the 
invitation of the authorities both of Ecuador and of Guaya- 
quil, who left nothing undone to insure success. Officials were 
delegated to co-operate in the program. Special municipal 
ordinances were enacted and rigidly enforced to compel com- 
pliance with the: measures which were recommended. The 
editors of the city pledged themselves to support the under- 
taking and to refrain from premature criticism of methods 
or results. : 
Only one American was sent to Guayaquil to organize 
the staff, which was made up of Ecuadoreans many of whom 
were experienced in yellow fever work. Within a short time 
more than a hundred men were recruited and assigned to 
their tasks. In order that the members of the group might 
work intelligently, they were frequently assembled for 
instruction and conference. Lectures were given and bul-
-P-A-G-E-11

letins published. In this way a sense of team-work was 
fostered; each man saw his own task in relation to the whole 
program. The resulting enthusiasm and loyalty to the cause 
were most gratifying. The education of the public was not 
neglected. By means of addresses, pamphlets, bulletins, and 
press articles the plan was described to the citizens, and the 
reasons for the measures employed were explained. 
For the prosecution of the work the city was divided into 
districts, to each of which was assigned a sanitary squad of 
four or five men. A corps of inspectors supervised the 
operations as a whole. A spot map of Guayaquil was pre- 
pared. This showed the location of each case of fever that 
had originated in the city (see map below). The density of the 
spots indicated the areas in which intensive measures ought 
first to be applied. The campaign aimed at two things: (1) 
the earliest possible discovery of cases of yellow fever, which 
were to be promptly isolated and screened from mosquitoes; 
and (2) the elimination of the Stegomyia by denying the

Each spot on the map indicates a case of yellow fever. Nearly all cases reported 
during 1918 are seen to have been near the center of the city, where houses were 
close together and breeding places numerous.

females access to water in which to deposit their eggs. It was 
the peculiar condition of the public water supply which pre- 
sented the chief problem. The hydrants of Guayaquil flow 
only an hour and a half in twenty-four. The well-to-do have 
tanks on the upper floors of their houses; the less fortunate 
store water in barrels, cans, and other containers. These 
conditions were ideal for the breeding of the Stegomyia. It 
was not difficult to screen the tanks, or to protect barrels with 
wooden covers. Water could be poured through screened 
holes. It could be drawn off through spigots inserted near 
the bottom of the barrels. 
FISH VERSUS MOSQUITOES 
There remained a good many open receptacles which it was 
hard to protect. Resort was had to the experiment of 
recruiting fish to live in these containers and to eat the 
mosquito eggs as fast as they were deposited. The first kind 
of fish tried was a disappointment. It was nervous, easily 
frightened, and short-lived. A hardy fish was next drafted, 
but this turned out to be so vigorous that it was always 
jumping out of the water. Finally a satisfactory fish was 
discovered. It ate larvae gluttonously and darted to the 
bottom of the barrel whenever the surface of the water was 
disturbed. Thus, by a variety of attacks—drainage, filling, 
oiling, screening, and the mobilizing of minnows, the Stego- 
myia was baffled. 
By early January, 1919, the control work was far ad- 
vanced. In spite of warnings and explanations the public 
expected immediate results. In November, 1918, 81 cases 
had been reported. Although the control measures had not 
been started until the last week of that month, the people 
confidently believed that there would be a sharp reduction 
in the cases in December. When 88 cases were reported for 
that month there was general disappointment. The Ameri- 
can director made a plea for suspension of judgment, and the 
control measures were vigilantly and rigorously continued. 
Here are the figures for successive months: January 85,

since 1842. The figures at the top of the black columns indicate the number of 
cases reported during each month of the two years 1918-1919. 
It is too early to speak finally. Vigilance will be continued for at least a year. But 
it is believed that this city, which has so long been the most stubborn endemic cen- 
ter, is at last freed from the ravages of this disease. To take the fight to the few 
remaining seed-beds of yellow fever is the definite program to which the Rockefeller 
Foundation is now committed.

  10 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
February 43, March 17, April 3, May 2, June 0. Since 
June, 1919, no case has been reported. (See chart p. 9.) 
It is too early to affirm that yellow fever has been com- 
pletely eradicated from Guayaquil. Vigilance will not be 
relaxed for a year at least. During the wet season of 1920 
cases may recur. Nevertheless the possibilities of control 
have been convincingly demonstrated. Guayaquil, the chief 
seed-bed of yellow fever, has been free from the disease for 
months. The public has proclaimed its deliverance from a 
menace which had never been absent since 1842. General 
Gorgas’s ambition to write “The Last Chapter of Yellow 
Fever” seems no Utopian dream. 
A LEAGUE: OF CENTRAL AMERICAN NATIONS 
While the seed-bed in Guayaquil was being successfully 
sterilized, an epidemic in Central America also demanded 
attention. In July, 1918, an outbreak in Guatemala had been 
reported. This increased alarmingly week by week. At last, 
on the invitation of the Government, an expert sanitarian 
was sent to organize an attack upon the disease. By quaran- 
tine, isolation of cases, and anti-mosquito measures the epi- 
demic was brought under control before the end of the year. 
The sources of the infection were believed to be the city of 
Merida, Yucatan, and possibly other points in southern 
Mexico. The continuance in 1919 of approved precautions 
protected Guatemala against a recurrence of the fever. 
Later the disease appeared in Honduras, Salvador, and 
Nicaragua. 
Offers of assistance were warmly welcomed by the govern- 
ments of these countries, and the Foundation promptly 
dispatched a group of experts headed by General Gorgas. 
In each country a special government commission was 
created to take charge of control measures. The body was 
composed of local physicians and sanitarians, with one 
representative of the International Health Board of the 
Rockefeller Foundation. Each country provided at least a 
part of the cost of control. The Foundation contributed the
-P-A-G-E-15
PUBLIC HEALTH 11 
services of its expert staff members, and made additional 
appropriations toward the common budgets. These several 
commissions co-operated in an international program for the 
protection of. all the areas concerned. It was a practical 
League of Nations on a small scale and for a specific object. 
The plan was carried out energetically ‘and thoroughly to 
such purpose that by the middle of October yellow fever had 
been practically banished from Central America. Although 
the epidemic was not severe, so far as the number of cases 
went, these cases were scattered over a rather wide area and 
if prompt measures had not been taken they might easily 
have led to a serious situation. 
The commissions are being continued in authority, and 
concerted efforts will be made during 1920 to guard against 
another outbreak. The governments of Nicaragua, Salvador, 
Guatemala, and Honduras have agreed to control Stegomyia 
mosquito breeding in all ports, to require daily inspection of 
ships which touch at Pacific points to discover whether there 
are Stegomyia breeding places on board, and to maintain a six- 
day quarantine against all travelers from southern Mexico 
until yellow fever has been eliminated from that country. 
With Guayaquil free from fever, and with Central America 
protected, a good start has been made upon the world-wide 
project of extirpation. Plans for the early future include the 
sending of commissions to Peru, where yellow fever appeared 
during the latter part of 1919; and with the active co-opera- 
tion of the British Government, to the suspected area on the 
west coast of Africa. It is hoped also that a way will be 
found to banish yellow fever from southern Mexico. The 
League is widening its membership and is going confidently 
forward. i 
DIVERSIFIED ATTACKS ON MALARIA 
At the same time that the Stegomyia was being thwarted 
in Ecuador and Central America, her cousin, the Anopheles 
mosquito, which specializes in malaria, was being baffled in 
Mississippi and in Arkansas, where experiments in the con- 
trol of “chills and fever” were continued in six towns and

The International Health Board of the Foundation, co-operating with the local 
health organizations of these towns, undertook experiments that developed into 
convincing demonstrations that it is feasible and economically practicable to 
control malaria. The problem is one of preventing the breeding of the Anopheles 
mosquito. These figures show the rapid decrease in the number of physicians’ calls 
for malaria following the beginning of control measures, and demonstrate that the 
cost is within the means of the average community.

symptoms and swift mortality of yellow fever and the less 
obtrusive but more protracted effects of malaria may easily 
conceal from the uninformed the real menace of the latter 
malady. Malaria is a crippling and deadly disease which 
attacks or threatens the 800,000,000 people who live within 
the zone of its influence. In India alone it is estimated that 
1,300,000 die annually from its effects. The southern 
part of the United States, the whole of Mexico, and Central 
America, the West Indies, and the northern countries of 
South America, lie within the malaria belt, which practically 
coincides with the tropical and semi-tropical regions of the 
earth. 
The scientific basis for malaria control is firmly established. 
The infection can be communicated only by the Anopheles 
mosquito, which differs from theStegomyia in being a rural or

In the town of McGehee, Arkansas, the number of physicians’ calls for malaria 
was greatly reduced following the introduction of control measures in 1919. Before 
these measures were introduced, October showed the highest number of physicians’ 
calls for malaria—299 in 1917 and 284 in 1918—but the figures dropped to 9 in 
1919, seven months after the beginning of anti-mosquito measures. Plans are 
perfected for similar demonstrations in 1920 in 10 Southern States through the co- 
operation of the International Health Board, the State Boards of Health, and the 
U. S. Public Health Service. 
suburban insect, easily detected by its habit of standing on 
its head when at rest, and unlike its yellow fever colleague it 
prefers water containing grass or other plants in which to 
breed. Quinine has long been successfully employed to 
destroy malaria parasites in the blood and thus free the 
sufferers from their infection. The practical measures for 
fighting malaria, then, are clearly indicated: (1) to eliminate 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  14 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Anopheles by preventing their breeding, (2) to. screen the 
houses against this mosquito, (3) to sterilize by quinine the 
blood of human malaria carriers. In a given demonstration 
one or all of these methods may be used, according to local 
conditions. Anti-mosquito measures were relied upon almost 
wholly in the four Arkansas towns in which experiments 
were carried on during 1919. A reduction of 67 per cent 
in the prevalence of malaria was secured at a per capita 
cost of 60 cents, exclusive of the overhead expense of super- 
vision. 
The object of these demonstrations was to show that 
methods of control which have been successful in large towns 
and cities are applicable to villages at an expense which the 
communities can and will assume. The results have fully 
confirmed the expectations of the Board. Continued super- 
vision of control projects which have been in progress for 
four years in six Arkansas towns affords convincing proof that 
it costs a community approximately a four-fold greater sum 
to harbor malaria than to banish it. As a consequence of 
these demonstrations public funds for malaria control opera- 
tions are now being appropriated faster than sanitarians can 
be found to do the work. 
Other anti-malaria experiments were undertaken or con- 
tinued during 1919. In Hinds county, Mississippi, a rural 
area of 36 square miles, with a population of 830 people, 
was selected for one of the experiments. Encouraging 
progress was made, but it was not possible by the end of 
ithe year to reach conclusive results. The method of steriliz- 
ing malaria carriers was continued in Sunflower county, 
Mississippi, after an experiment which in 1918 seemed to 
indicate that in an area of about 100 square miles with a 
population of 9,000, an area which represented typical 
plantation conditions in the Mississippi delta, reasonable 
control could be secured at a per capita cost of a little more 
than one dollar. In 1919 the experiment was extended, 
with encouraging prospects of success, to a considerably 
larger area.
-P-A-G-E-19

Still further tests will be made during 1920 by screening 
isolated farm houses and cabins in places where large-scale 
anti-mosquito operations are economically impracticable, and 
by concentrating scattered plantation dwellings in order 
more easily to protect their occupants by means of screening 
and of mosquito control. A significant feature of the 1919 
campaign was the use of top minnows to consume the eggs 
of theAnopheles. This proved a cheap and effective measure, 
especially in the case of stock ponds which were used for 
watering cattle and horses, and which could not be drained 
or covered with a film of oil. 
A CO-OPERATIVE ANTI-MALARIA CAMPAIGN 
From the outset of its health work the. Foundation’s 
International Health Board has entered an area only at the 
invitation of the government concerned. All of its work has 
been based upon at least three primary considerations: (1) 
co-operation with the authorities, (2) the community’s

Hookworm control measures were continued in 25 different states and countries 
during the year, and new work was undertaken in 8 others. These include 13 Southern 
States, and areas in South and Central America, and in Ceylon and Australia. 
This work is carried on by the International Health Board of the Foundation in co- 
operation with the governments concerned.

assumption of some part of the expense, and (3) an agree- 
ment that if the experiment is successful, the government 
will take over the enterprise as a part of its official machin- 
ery. Thus, in the Arkansas and Mississippi malaria demon- 
strations, work was begun in co-operation with the local and 
state authorities and with the United States Public Health 
Service. The United States Public Health Service did 
notable work during the war in malaria control in the areas: 
which surrounded the large army camps, and as a conse- 
quence trained a group of sanitarians to be expert in anti- 
mosquito measures. 
In June, 1919, a conference was held to plan a concerted 
campaign against malaria in the Southern States. Repre-

the following achievements under the direction of the State health authorities 
are reported: 2,712 homes surveyed; 8,907 individuals physically examined; 200

spected; 30,000 pieces of literature distributed; and 52 public meetings held. A 
permanent county health department is expected to result.

sentatives of the United States Public Health Service, of 
the state departments of health, and of the International 
Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation were present. 
After full discussion these men worked out a program which 
was subsequently approved and adopted in ten states. It 
is proposed to carry on simultaneously in at least four 
communities in each of these states a systematic anti- 
malaria campaign. The object is twofold: first, to test the 
measures of control by applying them under a wide range of 
varying conditions; and second, to educate a larger public 
with the hope of arousing sufficient sentiment to support a 
‘comprehensive effort to eliminate malaria from the whole 
South. 
In the execution of the plan the Federal authorities, the 
state boards, the International Health Board, and local 
governments will contribute either personnel or funds or 
both, in accordance with a program sufficiently flexible to 
meet varying conditions. The whole enterprise is based 
upon two principles: (1) whole-hearted co-operation with- 
out duplication of effort, and (2) assumption by govern- 
mental agencies of responsibility for administration and 
expense. This concrete example of team-work in preventive 
medicine will be watched with interest. There is reason to 
hope that its success will insure a concerted and persistent 
attempt throughout the South to shake off the burden 
which malaria imposes upon that region. 
HOOKWORM CONTROL IN MANY LANDS 
First in point of time among the diseases to be dealt, with 
by the International Health Board, hookworm disease still 
remains its chief concern so far as areas covered, per- 
sonnel employed, and funds expended are concerned. 
The disease is widely prevalent in tropical and semi- 
tropical regions. In parts of Porto Rico, in the low-lying 
districts of Colombia, on many of the plantations of Cey- 
lon and Dutch Guiana, and in the mines of China, an 
infection rate of about 90 per cent is found. The hook-

worms, lodged in the intes- 
tinal tract, impoverish the 
victim’s blood and produce 
an anemia which impairs 
bodily and mental vigor. 
The malady is easily cura- 
ble, but the campaigns are 
not of permanent value 
unless proper sanitation is 
introduced to protect the 
soil from pollution.and the 
population from re-infec- 
tion. For this reason the 
Board is declining more and 
more to undertake control 
measures until governments 
have actually seen fit to 
enforce the necessary sani- 
tary provisions.

success were attained in different fields, the general tendency 
has been steadily toward a reduction in the prevalence and 
intensity of the infection, more efficient and more wide- 
spread sanitation, an increase in the financial burden 
assumed by governments, and an education of com- 
munities in the possibilities of general public health 
policies. From the beginning the last named object has been 
kept steadily in mind by the Board. Hookworm control has 
proved a most successful means of convincing communities 
that health is a purchasable thing. Brazil and Australia

sissippi, under the 
leadership of the Department of Rural Sanitation of the 
State Board of Health, has expanded a hookworm project 
into a health program which is arousing the enthusiasm of 
the entire population. Local pride has been stimulated. 
“The County De Soto was seeking” is one of its health 
slogans, 4,000 of which were produced by the school children 
in a county-wide prize competition. “Chew your food; you 
have no gizzard” won the first prize. Fifteen hundred 
health slogans greet the traveler from mile-posts which 
enterprising merchants have installed on the county high- 
ways. At the county fair the health exhibit attracted chief 
attention. The campaign began in July, 1919. During the 
first three months 2,712 homes were surveyed, 8,907 indi- 
viduals given physical examinations, 200 vaccinated against 
typhoid, 1,100 school children medically inspected, an epi- 
demic of scarlet fever controlled, 30,000 pieces of literature 
distributed, and 52 public meetings held. It is said that the 
establishment of a permanent county health department is 
assured for the early future. 
A feature of the hookworm work of the Board has been 
the preparation of a bibliography which deals with this

disease. The compilation of this material has been in 
progress for a considerable length of time. It is hoped the 
completed work, which will be exhaustive in scope, will be 
published some time in the near future. 
NO ARMISTICE WITH TUBERCULOSIS IN FRANCE 
The control of yellow fever, malaria, or hookworm is a 
relatively simple undertaking compared with the attempt to 
arrest and prevent the insidious and well-nigh universal 
ravages of tuberculosis. Only in France—and there as a 
war measure—has the International Health Board under- 
taken to aid in combating the white plague against which so 
many vigorous agencies, public and private, are enlisted. A 
campaign begun there in the summer of 1917 aimed, not at an 
impertinent importation of scientific knowledge into the 
land of Louis Pasteur, but at the following definite objects: 
(1) the setting up in typical urban and provincial areas of 
standard demonstrations of systematic control methods; 
(2) the training of public health nurses, clinicians, lecturers, 
and organizers; (3) the arousing of communities to the need 
of creating local agencies, governmental and voluntary; (4) 
the educating of the public in the causes, treatment, and 
prevention of tuberculosis; (5) the gradual transfer of re- 
sponsibility to French agencies and the organization of 
these agencies on a national basis. 
During 1919 appreciable progress was made toward each 
of these goals. The demonstrations in the 19th Arrondisse- 
ment of Paris and in the Department of Eure-et-Loir showed 
increased efficiency through the consolidation of dispensary 
service in the urban district and the operation of 22 dis- 
pensaries scattered throughout the towns, villages, and 
rural areas. In six nurse-training schools administered by 
the French, 205 women who held American scholarships 
were registered. Fifty-one graduated; 76 nurses were 
assigned to various departments. A graduate course
-P-A-G-E-25
  
PUBLIC HEALTH 21 
on the theory and practice of treating tuberculosis was 
worked out in co-operation with the Paris Faculty of Medi- 
cine and with physicians of the Paris hospitals. A six- 
weeks’ course for physicians on the diagnosis and treatment 
of tuberculosis was attended by a group of French doctors, 
22 of whom received scholarships from the Commission of 
the Foundation. 
As a result of extension work, dispensaries were opened in 
three of the departments in the devastated region. Pre- 
liminary surveys in anticipation of work to be undertaken 
were made in five others. It is worth noting that the Com- 
mission reports a more hearty and effective response from 
the people of this region than from communities in other 
parts of France. In 14 departments new committees 
were organized, and in 12 others preliminary arrange- 
ments were made. Forty-one new dispensaries were built,

The Foundation’s Commission has demonstrated the possibilities of publicity. 
In 1919 traveling exhibits visited 293 towns in 28 departments and distributed 
8,000,000 pieces of literature; 1,400 talks were made in public schools.

22 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
36 were in process of construction, and plans for 52 more 
had been made. The program of popular health education 
with special reference to tuberculosis is described in a sub- 
sequent paragraph. 
THE FRENCH ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY 
The process of transferring responsibility to French com- 
munities and agencies has gone forward steadily. The 
personnel in charge of the dispensaries is now almost wholly 
French. In the Paris demonstration, for example, there is 
not one American on the staff. During the war the American 
Red Cross provided on a generous scale hospital and sani- 
tarium facilities for the tuberculous. This service has been 
taken over and extended by municipalities and departments. 
The central government has passed a law under which each 
department will be compelled within five years either to 
build a sanitarium of its own or to send its patients to that of 
another department. The cost of construction is to be shared 
equally by the central and the departmental governments. 
In the departments in which the Commission organized new 
dispensaries in 1919, the funds provided by government 
councils amounted to $713,000. The Eure-et-Loir agreed to 
assume all local dispensary costs for 1920. Not only have 
departmental committees been formed throughout France, 
but a National Committee which originally concerned itself 
only with tuberculous, soldiers has been re-organized and 
henceforth will be known as the National Committee of 
Defense Against Tuberculosis. This body has agreed to 
supervise and direct the entire national anti-tuberculosis 
campaign. 
A significant feature of the Commission’s activities has 
been the development of community spirit as a result of the 
formation of committees to carry on the tuberculosis work. 
All over France, individuals and groups formerly sharply 
divided by social distinctions, religious differences, and 
political partisanship have been drawn together in loyalty 
to a common cause, and have come to understand and respect

one another. In a town where 
animosity had been bitter and 
the prospects of co-operation 
seemed remote, the American 
representative by tact, pa- 
tience, and persistence finally 
brought about a large measure 
of concord and good will. Some 
time later a leading citizen of 
the town wrote this gracious 
sentence: “You have taught 
us that not only tuberculosis 
is contagious.”

grace and de- 
spair have been associated with it. People have been reluc- 
tant to go to dispensaries lest they might be declared tubercu- 
lous or suspected of harboring the dreaded infection. This 
combination of traditional dread and ignorance had to be 
attacked boldly and with every resource. Exhibits and 
groups of lecturers were sent out to visit cities, towns, and 
villages. Mass meetings with addresses, slides, and motion 
pictures were organized. Attractively written and whim- 
sically illustrated pamphlets were widely distributed. Striking

“Tf you bring home cakes, don’t buy those which are outside. 
You know that the tuberculosis microbes are walking around on

These two phrases were spoken, one by a child of six, the other 
by a little girl of seven. The mistress of their school heard them 
and repeated them to me. And this advice to Aunt Clotilde and 
this warning to the big brother who is going to buy cakes came 
from two children who, some days before, had seen in their school 
the Punch and Judy show of the American mission.

The “Commission Américaine de Préservation contre la Tuber- 
culose en France” has had a little Punch and Judy built like the 
ones of the Champs-Elysées. M. Henri de Gressigny has written 
a piece for the wooden actors, and himself works the puppets and 
makes the conversation of the heroes of his little drama. A {cw 
days ago the Punch and Judy was at Paris, in a school of the 
19th Arrondissement. At present it is at Lyons. The piece has 
been played in 30 departments. Thousands and thousands of 
children have heard it. The plot does not pretend to equal that 
of King Lear. The psychology does not attempt that of “L’Ame 
en Folie.” <A little boy on his way to school meets a little girl in 
the street. The boy starts to talk of hygiene. “Do you know 
what a microbe is?” he asks the little girl. ‘Yes, it is a big animal,” 
she answers. Then the boy explains how microbes are spread, 
by dust, by dirt, by overheated air, etc. He also tells how to avoid 
them. A soldier appears who teaches them how to keep the house 
clean, how to air it, etc. While he is speaking a drunken man 
reels in, who shocks the children. The soldier scolds the drunkard; 
“You mustn’t drink alcohol.”’ At this moment the drunkard falls 
down. ‘See what becomes of a man who drinks!” says the little 
girl with great scorn. “We must not imitate him, we must take 
care of ourselves for we are necessary to France.” With these 
noble and generous words the curtain falls!

26 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
During the year 1919 the Commission’s exhibits visited in 
28 departments, 293 towns, with a combined population of 
8,000,000, 700,000 of whom were reached directly. More than 
1,400 talks were given in public schools. Many facts and 
pictures were inserted in 900,000 almanacs. Three million 
pieces of literature were distributed. A good beginning has 
been made in directing the attention of the French people to 
the importance of health, and especially to the menace of 
tuberculosis. 
A WEST POINT FOR HEALTH OFFICERS 
Convinced by its own experience that there is a lack of 
trained men and women for health work, the Foundation 
offered in 1916 to establish at Johns Hopkins University a 
School of Hygiene and Public Health. Two years later the 
school opened with a faculty of 30 and with 18 students. 
In 1919 these numbers rose to 36 and 82. The courses vary 
in length from two years for the degree of Doctor of Public 
Health to a period of six weeks for officials in active service 
and for physicians who expect to enter part-time public 
health work. During the year the school not only gave 
‘instruction and encouraged research in a wide range of 
fundamental sciences, but also established relationships 
with the community and the field. A course of public 
addresses was given by a number of men eminent in pre- 
ventive medicine. A series of lectures on Problems of 
Motherhood was offered in co-operation with the Maryland 
Division of the National Congress of Mothers. The Depart- 
ment of Public Health Administration of the school arranged 
to give students practical experience in the health depart- 
ments of Baltimore and of the State of Maryland. Co- 
operation of the United States Public Health Service was 
secured. Significant demonstrations in nutrition were 
conducted in connection with an orphan asylum and in the 
public schools of Baltimore. The Department of Vital 
Statistics was asked by the United States authorities to make 
a statistical analysis of the influenza epidemic of 1918. The

This complete modern medical center is planned to advance the development of

and the China Medical Board of the Foundation. The School formally opened in 
1919; the Pre-Medical School opened in 1917. The entire physical plant will 
include 13 modern buildings, a 250-bed teaching hospital, and 2 compounds of 
faculty residences. It will be finished early in 1921. By the close of 1919 a faculty 
of 40 had been carefully chosen, 30 of whom were in China and 10 in this country. 
same division also undertook an intensive study of tubercu- 
losis in a limited group at the request of the National Tuber- 
culosis Association. The new school already has made 
measurable progress in its three chosen fields of professional 
training, scientific research, and popular education. 
WESTERN MEDICINE IN CHINA 
In the introduction of the theory and practice of modern 
medicine among the Chinese, Japanese influence has been 
direct and important. For the most part the government 
and provincial medical schools have been staffed by Japan-
-P-A-G-E-33
  
  MEDICAL EDUCATION 29 
ese-trained Chinese, together with considerable numbers of 
Japanese teachers. A large majority of the native physicians 
who profess to practice Western medicine have been trained 
in Japan. Unfortunately with few exceptions these Chinese 
medical students have resorted to special schools which are 
not fully recognized by the Japanese Government. | It is 
even asserted that the tests applied to Chinese graduates 
have been lenient. The Chinese medical schools and hospitals 
suffer from lack of well-trained staffs, absence of adequate 
laboratory and hospital facilities, the intrusion of political 
and social influences, and the generally disturbed condi- 
tion of the country. In a few cases there are hospitals 
under Chinese control which approach average Western 
standards. 
A Japanese medical school in Moukden, until recently a 
German-manned school in Shanghai, a British medical 
school in the University of Hongkong, groups of European 
and American physicians in the chief Treaty ports, hospitals 
supported by local town councils or voluntary societies in 
foreign concessions, and military and naval hospitals main- 
tained by various foreign governments, have had an appreci- 
able educative effect upon Chinese public opinion. The 
influence of Chinese physicians who have been trained in the 
medical schools of the United States and of Europe has been 
significant and of increasing weight. 
Missionary societies have played a leading part in intro- 
ducing a knowledge of modern medicine into communities 
scattered throughout the entire Republic. Dispensaries, 
begun as adjuncts of evangelistic work, have in many cases 
developed into small hospitals, in a few instances in larger 
centers into institutions comparable with the average of 
those in the West. In 1919 the Protestant missions in China 
supported 317 hospitals. Catholic orders and _ ‘societics 
maintain hospitals and dispensaries in large ports, such as 
Shanghai and Hankow, and in several smaller places. 
The need for Chinese assistants in these missionary hos- 
pitals led to the opening of pioneer medical schools, which,
-P-A-G-E-34
30 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
through the devotion of the teachers, were able to give a 
preliminary training of practical use in the routine of the 
hospital. Some of the students of exceptional ability made 
considerable progress. A few were sent to Western schools 
to complete their training. Of late, missionary medical 
education has been concentrated in a few schools. 
The Chinese National Medical Association, composed of 
Chinese with modern training, and the China Medical 
Missionary Association, are professional organizations which 
seek to advance the interests of dispensary and hospital ser- 
vice, of medical training and research, of professional 
standards, and of public health policies in China. The latter 
society has rendered substantial aid to medical missions by 
fixing a minimum standard of personnel, equipment, etc., for 
a missionary medical school, by its advice concerning the 
number and distribution of such schools, by co-operating in 
the translation of medical works into Chinese, by a survey of 
missionary hospitals, and in various other ways.

A MODERN MEDICAL CENTER IN PEKING 
The China Medical Board of the Foundation seeks to aid 
the agencies which represent Western medicine in China to 
make steady*progress toward higher standards and more effi- 
cient service. In fulfilling a purpose to promote modern 
medical education in the Republic the Board recognizes the 
following essentials: (1) pre-medical education; (2) under- 
graduate courses for physicians; (3) graduate study for 
investigators, laboratory workers, teachers, and _ clinical 
specialists; (4) short courses for private practitioners and 
missionary doctors both foreign and Chinese; (5) medical 
research, especially with reference to the problems peculiar 
to the Far East; (6) standardized hospitals as training 
centers for internes, as models for imitation by the Chinese, 
as headquarters for practicing physicians, and as a means 
of popular education; (7) organized efforts to diffuse among 
the Chinese a knowledge of modern medicine and public 
health; and (8) the fostering of professional ethics through 
development of character and idealism. 
The chief agency by which it is hoped to further these 
aims is the Peking Union Medical College, which has recently 
been opened in the Chinese capital. Controlled by a Board 
of Trustees who are chosen by the Rockefeller Foundation 
and by six co-operating missionary societies, American and 
British, the Peking institution is being built and maintained 
by Foundation funds. The completed plant will include: 
laboratories for anatomy, physiology, and chemistry, a 
pathology building, a 250-bed hospital with provision for 
about thirty private rooms, a large out-patient department, 
a hospital administration unit with quarters for resident 
physicians and internes, a nurses’ home, an animal house, 
and plants which will supply water, heat, electric light and 
power, and fuel gas. The faculty residences, with a few ex- 
ceptions grouped in two walled areas or compounds, are of 
brick and concrete with slate roofs, and are supplied with 
every convenience of Western life. The medical and hos- 
pital buildings, which are fire-proof, embody certain charac-

teristic features of Chinese architecture. The roofs are 
covered with glazed green tiles made in one of the factories 
which once supplied tiles for the imperial palaces. Eaves 
and porticoes are embellished with conventional Chinese 
decorations in red, blue, green, and gold, painted by native 
artizans. Three of the teaching buildings were occupied in 
October, 1919. It is expected that the entire plant will be 
completed by January 1, 1921. 
During the autumn of 1919, 61 students were registered: 
82 in the pre-medical school, seven in the first year of the 
undergraduate medical course, and 22 as graduate students 
and internes. Of the faculty of 40, 30 were in Peking, and 
the remainder, chiefly representatives of the clinical branches, 
were completing special graduate studies in the United 
States. A superintendent of nurses and eight nurses were in 
Peking in preparation for the opening of a thorough course 
for the training of young Chinese women as hospital and 
public health nurses. Women are admitted to both the pre- 
medical school and the medical courses on equal terms with
-P-A-G-E-37
  MEDICAL EDUCATION 33, 
men. Chinese are appointed to the teaching staff, which is ex- 
pected to include steadily increasing numbers of native 
teachers and investigators. Graduate students are wel- 
comed, and with the opening of the new hospital will be 
offered excellent opportunities to pursue both laboratory and 
clinical studies under well-trained and enthusiastic teachers. 
Special efforts will be made to put the resources of the 
school and hospital at the service of medical missionaries and 
other doctors who wish to keep abreast of progress in medi- 
cine and surgery, or to undertake specific investigations. 
Short courses of six weeks or more will be given in the 
summer, and possibly during the Chinese New Year season. 
HELPING PRE-MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS 
Until a sufficient number of secondary or “middle” schools 
in North China can give satisfactory training in the pre- 
medical sciences of physics, chemistry, and biology, as well 
as in English and French or German, the Peking Union 
Medical College will continue to offer this preliminary train- 
ing. In central and southern China it has been deemed 
best to assist certain well-established institutions which are 
offering pre-medical courses, by appropriations toward labo- 
ratories, equipment, and maintenance. During 1919 such 
aid was given to two institutions: St. Johns University, 
Shanghai, and Fukien Christian University, Foochow. Ap- 
propriations were also made toward the current support of 
medical schools in Shantung Christian University, Tsinan-fu, 
and in the Hunan-Yale College, Changsha. 
Appropriations were made during the year to 19 hos- 
pitals conducted under the auspices of missionary socie- 
ties. In each case the amount given by the China Medical 
Board was supplemented by mission funds and was used to 
increase staff, buildings, or equipment. In December, 1919, 
the Board, in the light of five years’ experience in co-operat- 
ing with hospitals, adopted a somewhat revised policy for the 
future. This includes concentration upon a small number 
of hospitals of the better type which by reason of location,  
-P-A-G-E-38

staff, and equipment are in a position directly to promote 
the cause of medical education. 
Although the instruction in the Peking Union Medical 
College is conducted in the English language, the Board 
recognizes the importance of translating standard medical 
works into Chinese for use in Chinese medical schools and 
in missionary schools which teach in the Mandarin. An 
annual appropriation is made to the Publication Committee 
of the China Medical Missionary Association, which super- 
vises translation work. 
A further form of assistance to Chinese medical education 
has been the granting of fellowships and scholarships to 
Chinese to enable them to study medicine in the United 
States, and to missionary doctors who, during their fur- 
loughs at home, wish to pursue graduate courses or attend 
special clinics. When the college in Peking is fully under 
way the need for the first type of fellowships will largely 
disappear. To a considerable degree also, medical mission- 
aries will resort to Peking for opportunities which heretofore 
they have been able to secure only when at home on leave. 
AID TO CANADIAN AND OTHER MEDICAL SCHOOLS 
In transmitting his gift of December, 1919, the Founder 
made the following statement: 
My attention has been recently called to the needs of some of 
the medical schools in Canada, but as the activities of the General 
Education Board are by its charter limited to the United States 
I understand that no part of that gift may be used for the Canadian 
schools. The Canadian people are our near neighbors. They are 
closely bound to us by ties of race, language, and international 
friendship; and they have without stint sacrificed themselves— 
their youth and their resources—to the end that democracy might 
be saved and extended. For these reasons, if your Board should see 
fit to use any part of this new gift in promoting medical education 
in Canada, such action would meet with my very cordial approval. 
At a subsequent meeting of the Foundation, .ae sum of 
$5,000,000 was set aside for use in Canada. The officers 
were instructed to make a careful study and to confer with
-P-A-G-E-39
  MEDICAL EDUCATION 35 
Canadian medical school authorities, government officials, 
and other citizens with a view to making recommendations 
as to the distribution of this appropriation. 
In order to provide expert direction for the growing work 
of the Foundation, the Board created a Division of Medical 
Education and appointed as Director, Dr. Richard M. 
Pearce, Professor of Experimental Medicine in the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania Medical School. Dr. Pearce made in 
1919 his third trip to South America under Foundation 
auspices to survey medical schools. It was in connection 
with an earlier visit that he arranged for the co-operative 
establishment of a Department of Public Health in the 
Medical School of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Ina 
similar way a Department of Pathology in the Oswaldo Cruz 
Institute is being aided. In December, the new Director 
of the Division of Medical Education and the Director of the 
International Health Board sailed for England and Belgium 
to study certain phases of medical education and public 
health administration. 
INTERNATIONAL FELLOWSHIPS AND SCHOLARSHIPS 
During the year 1919 the Foundation provided fellowships 
and scholarships for 85 persons who were in residence in 
universities in the United States. Fifty-seven came from 
China, 12 being Chinese doctors, eight Chinese medical 
students, seven Chinese nurses, 26 medical missionaries on 
furlough, and four prospective appointees to the Board’s 
teaching staff in China. Five doctors from Brazil, -one 
from Salvador, and four from Czecho-Slovakia pursued 
courses in public health. Five American physicians held 
fellowships in the same field. The Foundation also sup- 
ported 13 research fellows in physics and chemistry, who 
were selected and supervised by a special committee of the 
National Research Council. The obvious fact that the 
successful extension of scientific research, medical educa- 
tion, and public health work is dependent upon discovering 
exceptional individuals and giving them the best available
-P-A-G-E-40
  
36 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
training makes this plan of granting fellowships clearly a 
sound and fundamental policy. The Foundation does not 
create inflexible fellowship systems but is guided solely by 
the possibility of finding unusual persons who give distinct 
promise of promoting the end in view. The international 
implications and consequences of sending students from one 
country to another for purposes of study and research need 
not be amplified. 
THE POST-WAR SITUATION IN EUROPE 
Aside from its anti-tuberculosis work in France and its 
final payments on war work appropriations made in 1918, the 
Foundation has had no direct part in relief and reconstruc- 
tion activities in Europe in 1919. The American Relief 
Administration, the American Red Cross, the League of 
National Red Cross Societies, the Near East Relief, the 
Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and many other 
societies have been engaged in direct relief in various parts 
of Europe and the Near East. The officers of the Foundation 
were throughout the year in constant communication with 
these agencies; they received reports from the chief Euro- 
pean centers, and they conferred frequently with returned 
officials and with other first-hand observers. Two members 
of the central staff were sent abroad on a special mission. The 
constant aim was to gather information and to be ready to 
co-operate as soon as conditions permitted the undertaking 
of work of the kind in which the Foundation feels especially 
fitted to participate. 
SUNDRY ITEMS OF AID AND SERVICE 
From time to time the Foundation provides funds to 
standing or special committees for surveys or studies. Under 
the auspices of the Public Health Committee of the New 
York Academy of Medicine a study was made of the dis- 
pensaries of New York City. This brought to light many 
significant facts. Serious defects with which the medical 
profession and social workers have in a general way been

familiar were displayed statistically and clearly. A special 
committee on the training of Public Health Nurses was 
organized from a group of persons especially interested in the 
problem. With the aid of an appropriation from the Founda- 
tion, this Committee is making a survey and will report 
recommendations. During 1919 the Foundation continued 
to support studies carried on under the auspices of the 
National Committee for Mental Hygiene. Members of the 
Foundation staff assisted in the formulation of a health center 
program for Halifax, participated in a study of public health 
administration in Massachusetts, conferred with health 
officials in all parts of the country, conducted a large corre- 
spondence of information and suggestion, gave addresses 
before a wide range of audiences, and in many other ways 
made contributions within the special fields of Foundation 
work.

The income from invested funds was approximately seven 
millions. The balance of five millions carried over from 1918 
was largely mortgaged by pledges made in that year but not 
payable until 1919. This applies also to the balance of four 
and a half millions carried forward into 1920, of which over 
three millions had been pledged but were not due. Tables on

the year issued in the early autumn will contain a full state- 
ment from the Treasurer with all details as to investments, 
other property, income, and expenditures of the Foundation. 
On Christmas Day, 1919, announcement was made of a 
uew gift of fifty million dollars from Mr. John D. Rocke- 
feller, who wrote: “‘I am greatly interested in the work which 
is being done throughout the world in combating disease 
through the improvement of medical education, public 
health administration, and scientific research.”” This addition 
to the Foundation’s resources will enable it more adequately 
to meet the large demands of a world-wide program which 
already reaches twenty-five foreign countries. 
THE HEALTH OF THE NATIONS 
The war against disease is a world war. Commerce carries 
dangerous infections, as well as goods and ideas. The health - 
problems of the remotest land concern all peoples. More and 
more, nations are coming to recognize their interdependence 
in health as in industry, government, science, and culture. 
There are even now foreshadowings of world-wide co-opera- 
tion in combating the maladies which have long threatened 
humanity. For this new campaign leaders are needed to 
extend the frontiers of medical science, to teach, to organize, 
to administer. Demonstrations are required to convince 
communities and nations that diseases can be controlled and 
even eradicated. The Rockefeller Foundation, enlisted for 
this world-wide campaign against disease, is co-operating 
with many agencies in five continents, is fostering the growth 
of international confidence and good will, and is seeking the 
fulfillment of its chartered purpcse—“to promote the well- 
being of mankind throughout the world.”

Law, I have the honor to submit a “detailed report of the 
official proceedings” of my office, for the year ending the

REPORT. 
The requirement of law which imposes upon the State 
Superintendent the duty to annually submit to the Gov- 
ernor “a detailed report of his official procpedings and 
of all that pertains to the Public Schgols, as to theis’ cost 
and the degree of their usefulness cand success, créates 
a responsibility which, if properly net by all the agents 
of the law, should afford an unefring test of the progress 
and success of the system. During the nine ‘months 
that I have had the honor to hold” the commission, “at 
the hands of the Executive, I have, therefore) enileavored, 
through every instrumentality which the’ operation of the 
law affords, to collect and consolidate such facts as might 
make a plain exhibit of the financial status of the schools, 
and tend to illustrate their condition, néeds and success. — 
Had the theory of the law worked out practically, as jin- 
tended, there would have been little difficulty in carrying 
out this purpose. But, as will be seen from an examination 
of the statistical tables accompanying this report, there 
are many blanks to be filled which. are the result of in- 
attention to the duties imposed, and which are necessary | 
to a complete view of the school system of the State. 
This defect arises from two causes, which I.deem of so 
much importance, that I shall proceed to set them forth
-P-A-G-E-4

in detail, trusting that it may be the means of securing 
ultimately a sufficient remedy by proper legislative enact- 
ment, These causes are: 
First. In some cases the failure of County Superintend- 
ents to make full and clear reports to this office, as re- 
quired by law. : 
Second, In many cases the failure of Clerks and Treas- 
urers of School Districts to make their reports to the 
County Superintendents, and to require the proper re- 
ports from the. teachers. we 
The calde Bret, ‘enumerated is clearly traceable to the 
election of inefficient’. ‘persons to the office of County 
Superintendent, ary to the refusal of the proper authority 
to, allow them such compensation for their services as 
would etlable them to: ‘discharge the important duties im- 
posed upon them by: law in a satisfactory manner. In 
some counties no compensation whatever is allowed by 
the County Court to the Superintendent, which is a vir- 
tual annulment of the office, and acts directly as a denial . 
of the intention of the Legislature to make a fair experi- 
ment of the Public School system. In other cases, the 
County Courts have taken upon themselves to instruct 
the Superintendent to omit certain duties imposed by the 
law, that they might have a reasonable pretext for cur- 
tailing their compensation. This presents the worst as- 
pect of the question. The magistrates of the county are 
‘the chosen conservators of the law, and for any of them 
to instruct an officer not to discharge certain duties, plain- 
ly imposed by the law, for the purpose of saving a few 
paltry dollars, manifests rather too much zeal in the direc-
-P-A-G-E-5
4 , 
tion of a false economy. In one county the County Court 
wholly failed or refused to elect a Superintendent, in Jan- 
uary last, as commanded by law. 
The failure of many Clerks and Treasurers to require 
reports from .teachers, and themselves to make reports 
to the County Superintendent, is an evil inseparable from 
the employment of so great 4 number of officers with 
scarcely no compensation. There is an average number 
of twenty Clerks and Treasurers throughout each county 
of the State. Each of these has his own private affairs 
to manage, and many regard the office as too trivial to 
demand that exact method in its administration which is 
necessary to its success. In many instances no regular 
books are kept. Others are incompetent to keep ac- 
counts, It has, then, happened rarely, or not at all, that 
County Superintendents have not been compelled, in order 
to make their own reports, to visit several or all of the 
districts in person, that they might secure any report 
from a District Clerk and Treasurer. In many instances 
they have even then failed to secure intelligible reports. 
This simple detail of facts, derived from the practical 
operation of the law, shows defects which may be easily 
remedied by legislative amendments, and which will secure 
the desired accuracy and system in the reports upon which 
our school statistics are based, and which are absolutely 
essential, that we may know the working of the system. 
The necessary amendments will also result in bringing 
about the fairest practical test of the system in every 
county of the State, and will be a lighter burden, in the 
way of expense, than the present system. It is simple 
and easily reached ; and is to provide for a School Board
-P-A-G-E-6
8 
in each county, to be composed of not less than three 
nor more than five persons, to be elected by all the School 
Directors of the county, whose duty it shall be to assemble 
quarterly, at the county seat; to draft against the ap- 
portionments of school money in the hands of the County 
Trustee; to disburse the same to the different districts, 
upon the vouchers of the Chairmen of the Boards of 
Directors, and in gro rata proportion to the amounts 
to which said districts are entitled; to select the sites 
of. school houses ; to require monthly reports from teach- 
ers; and generally to manage the schools, excepting , 
as to employing teachers, which shall be done, as now, by 
the District Directors. Said Board to have a Secre- 
tary, to keep exact and prescribed accounts of the 
finances, progress and condition of the schools, the 
duties of which shall be performed by the County Super- 
intendent, in addition to those now imposed upon him, and 
with a salary to be fixed by said School Board, subject to 
the approval of the State Superintendent. This Board to 
make an annual report of all details to the State Super- 
intendent, and such other reports as may be required, 
through the County Superintendent, and to receive a per 
diem allowance for their services, when actually in session, 
to be fixed by law. It will be seen, at once, that sucha 
Board would generally be composed of business men, 
who would seriously work under a fixed responsibility, 
and who would substitute order and system where chaos 
and confusion now prevail. To’ prevent the possibility of 
an undue exercise of. power, it might be provided that an 
appeal may be taken from their decisions to the State 
authority. It can be easily shown that the expense of 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
°9 
such an organization, while securing responsibility, effi- 
ciency and respect, would be less than that of the present 
system, if the Clerks and Treasurers of districts were 
relieved of their duties, and their pay transferred to this 
Board. It would consolidate the whole business of the 
public schools in a county administration, would secure 
accurate accounts and prompt reports, and would greatly 
strengthen the popular interest in each county in the cause. 
At the same time, it would provide all the advantages of 
the district system, by retaining local control over the 
schools in the hands of the District Directors, whose du- 
ties being thus simplified, would enable them to devote 
the necessary time to contracting with teachers, visiting 
the schools, and providing comfortable buildings and ap- 
pointments. It would tend to secure higher qualifications 
in the County Superintendents in those counties where 
little care is taken to elect a capable incumbent, to require 
that each candidate for the position shall be examined by 
a Board of Examiners, to be appointed by the County 
Board of Education; thus giving better promise of filling 
the office with a man of “literary and scientific qualifica- 
tions.” 
In happy contrast to the delinquencies I have no- 
ticed, which have served as obstructions to the harmo- 
nious working of the system, 1 take pleasure in stating 
that several of the counties have managed their school 
affairs with great intelligence and public spirit, and have 
employed as agents zealous and capable men. Such in- 
stances have invariably demonstrated how successfully the 
schools may be conducted, and how powerfully they may 
be made to answer the benign intention of the Legisla-
-P-A-G-E-8
10 
ture, where proper support and co-operation are invoked, 
and where friendly, instead of hostile, elements, are called 
to their aid. Indeed, the striking contrast thus pre- 
sented between the employment of County Superintend- 
ents who have been permitted, by reasonable compensa- 
tion and encouragement, to. bring to their work their 
whole energies and attainments, and the hostile policy of 
some, -necessarily resulting from the election of inefficient 
and poorly: paid Superintendents, triumphantly vindicates 
the wisdom of the county supervision, which the law in- 
tended to create and organize. In the case of counties 
where there have been no Superintendents to look after. 
the interest of the schools, or where they have been un- 
remunerated and inefficient, or where they have been in- 
structed by the Court not to discharge their delicate and 
responsible duties, there can be no evidence, and conse- 
quently no guaranty, that the fund apportioned to them 
has not been wasted or misapplied, or that the schools 
_ have been opened and conducted according to law, since 
there is no official report, and no. responsibility in these 
cases, The effort to conduct a system of public schools» 
based upon combined State and county co-operation, 
would prove a failure without county supervision, as is 
clearly demonstrated: in those counties that have ne- 
glected to avail themselves of the advantages which have 
been derived by other counties from such a necessary 
feature of organization. Every business, and especially 
every system, which has need for as many agents and 
employees as the public school system, must necessarily 
have its supervisors, who must be well and carefully se- 
lected, and reasonably compensated for their services, It
-P-A-G-E-9
il 
is universally recognized in every. other enterprise as a 
necessity to success, and in no instance is the money ex- 
pended deemed either a waste or'an extravagance. This 
principle-has been universally applied to the public schools 
of all our cities, and its advantages have never been dis- 
puted or denied. There could be no tolerable organiza- 
tion without it—no system, no method, no government, no 
responsibility, no statistical experience, no progress, no 
success, The weakness. of such a school system was 
well illustrated by that which prevailed in our State 
before the war. . There was a State Superintendent, 
who was a mere financial custodian, but no County 
Superintendents. I have searched in vain for any records 
which attest the existence of any progressive, popular, 
universal school system, where the schools were under the 
sole direction of District Commissioners. It is true that, 
in some isolated cases, some benefit was derived from 
these schools, and from -the fund appropriated to them. 
But the evidence is overwhelming, in the vast amount of 
illiteracy prevailing, that it utterly failed to reach the great 
masses of the people. And are not the schools in the 
rural districts, and the children in the country, entitled to 
equal facilities for advancing their education as those in 
the cities? If a wise and careful superintendence of the 
city schools is deemed indispensable, can any reason be 
shown why it is not equally important to the country 
schools, which have not the same facility for massing, or- 
ganization and inspection, and therefore require ‘more 
earnest and determined. efforts to effect these purposes? 
No such reason can be given, but, on the contrary, there 
are additional grounds for deeming such organization and .
-P-A-G-E-10
12 
supervision more necessary in consequence of their iso- 
lated, struggling and straggling situation, which increases 
the importance of a common responsibility, method and 
visitation. It seems certain, that without such supervision 
and visitation, the idea of a universal system of free 
schools must be abandoned in the rural districts, which 
must inevitably add to the already alarming exodus of 
population from the farming areas to the towns and cities, 
and ensue in the consequent retrograde of agricultural 
prosperity and depreciation of farm values. The cities 
will continue to present the educational advantages which 
have been found to add so greatly to their wealth and 
population, or will rather strive, from year to year, to im- 
prove upon their present advancement; for there is no 
city which has ever enjoyed these advantages that will 
readily abandon them. The country schools, being left to 
the feeble, isolated and uncertain struggle under local 
directors, who, in a large majority of cases, as appears 
from official reports, never “darken the doors” of the 
school rooms, and having no responsible head and no defi- 
nite organization, must gradually grow worse. and worse 
under such management, until all aspiring citizens, who 
can, will emigrate to other States, or to cities, where some 
of the blessings of civilization and of the age may be 
successfully sought and enjoyed. It is sometimes said 
that the schools need no supervision, and that Superin- 
tendents’ salaries would be better applied to the teachers. 
This would be a sound statement if it could be shown that 
unity, homogeneity and organization were not more neces- 
sary to the success of a school system than poor teaching; 
and that it is the only. way to avoid the latter, in very
-P-A-G-E-11
13 
many cases, where so many teachers, for the proper train- 
ing of whom adequate provision will always be necessary, 
are required. We must either have isolated schools, with 
no system and no responsibility, or we must choose to 
have a County Superintendent with unification and a proper 
responsibility. Which of the two is the better way, it is 
not difficult to decide. And if wé have a County Super- 
intendent, it follows that he should receive such pay for 
his services as is reasonable and just. The duties that 
come to his share are equally as important to the interests 
of the county, and of every person in it, as those of any 
other county officer. And where his labors are well and. 
faithfully performed, they are equally as arduous, and re- 
quire more culture, judgment and capacity than are 
necessary for many other county officers. .Why there 
should be so much hesitation in awarding to him such 
compensation as-will secure proper attention from a good 
and competent man, is one of the problems which can 
only be solved by ascribing it to the novelty of an estab- 
lished system of free schools in our State. County. su- 
pervision exists in twenty-seven States of the Union and 
eight of the Territories, and I might here accumulate 
much testimony, of the highest character, of its actual 
value from most or all of these States and Territories, 
which unite in the position that its abolition would greatly 
mar, if not actually destroy, the unity and efficiency of 
the system. But I will cite one authority in which the 
statement is so clear, and the argument so forcible, as to 
compel conviction. The State Superintendent of Missouri, 
in his report of 1873, sententiously says: 
“Are the country. schools to combine for any purpose
-P-A-G-E-12
14 
whatever, or shall each struggle independently of every 
other, find its own teachers, take care of its own school 
funds, and reach out a feeble hand to seize the necessary 
elements of development from the passing current of pro- 
gress, as a poor woman snatches a billet of wood from the 
river's edge? If the schools are to combine for common 
purposes, that combination must center in a head man or 
supervisor. If they are to act independently, and still make 
progress, or rather live, each school will find it necessary 
to have its own agent or supervisor. Is this practicable ? 
Is it the part of economy? Just here the farmer’s move- 
-ment toward combination affords.a useful lesson, Alone. 
and retired, acting upon his limited experience of the 
world, the farmer found himself the easy prey of every 
other industry. Why? He met combination by inde- 
pendent and individual force alone. The shape, quality 
and price of the implements necessary for this industry 
were fixed by others, while he retained no power to fix the 
price of his own products. How does he seek to extri- 
cate himself from this embarrassment? He joins with 
his fellow-farmers for common purposes, They have 
crops to sell and goods to buy. The very first step to- 
wards making a combination effective was to employ their 
common agent.. The agent or supervisor, acting upon the 
principle of division and concentration of labor, thinks, 
studies, reads, observes, experiences, not for one farmer, 
but for all who are joined by association. This is the 
method of progress; this is the method of economy. 
The schools lie precisely in the same category. It is 
better and cheaper to have a common agent to do their 
guarding, watching, thinking, devising, planning and ex-
-P-A-G-E-13
15 
ecuting, than it is for each district to watch, think, devise, 
plan and execute for itself. The argument lies in an 
axiomatic principle; if we drift away from this principle 
we must eventually drift back again. To my thought the 
abolition. of county supervision would be attended with 
grave results to the county schools and to the entire in- 
terests of our farmers. The schools would degenerate 
and farms would depreciate in value. Cities and villages 
of course would continue their present system of carefully 
graded and minutely supervised schools, and every farmer 
who has children to educate and means to make the shift, 
would abandon the farm for the city. Civilization, which 
depends more upon education than upon any other force, 
would withdraw from rural scenes and concentrate in cities 
and populous centers. The foregoing suggestions are 
made in the earnest belief that if carried out, they will 
result in what is best and least costly for the schools and 
for the development of the State.” 
I will cite only an additional authority in conclusion of 
this important branch of this report. 
The Superintendent of Pennsylvania says, in the report 
for that State in 1868: “The County Superintendency is 
a fixed fact in Pennsylvania. It has existed in this State 
since 1854. No one who has carefully watched its work- 
ing would be willing to see the act establishing it repealed. 
No statement is needed to make known the good it has 
done, Its fruits speak for it. It has been called, and with 
good reason, the ‘right arm’ of the system.”

SCHOLASTIC POPULATION. 
The scholastic population of the State, (between six 
and eighteen years), according to the returns to this office, 
from the enumeration taken in June last, exclusive of 
Lewis county, from which no return was received, is 
425,986. The scholastic population of Lewis in 1874 was 
626, which, added to the returns from the other ninety-two 
counties, sums up 426,612. Unofficial information re- 
ceived at this office accounts for the failure to make 
returns by the fact that the County Superintendent had 
removed from the county. And here I would respectfully 
suggest that the slight difference between the returns of 
1874 and those of 1875 warrants an amendment to the 
law fixing the period for the enumeration of population 
triennially, or at least biennially. The cost of making the 
enumeration is considerable, as will be seen by glancing 
at the column of expenditures, under the head of “ other ex- 
penses,” a very large proportion of which is chargeable to 
the expense for taking the census. In some cases which 
have come to my knowledge, exorbitant and unwarrant- 
able sums were charged by District Clerks. But even 
when these charges are reasonable, the amount. is such 
as to make a large item of saving, where the reason is 
not apparent for an annual enumeration.

viz: Cocke and Hickman, reported average attendance, 
without enrollment, and two reported enrollment without _ 
reporting average attendance, to-wit: Grainger and Put-. 
‘nam. Of these two, Grainger reported enrollment and. 
average attendance as the same, which was evidently a. 
mistake, as they are never the same. 2

RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES. 
The receipts of school mogeys in the various counties 
are derived from the reports of County Superintendents. 
The classifications they have made of the sources of rev- 
enue from the State and county are not accurate. District 
Directors, in many instances, were unable to report to the 
Superintendent whether their receipts were from the State 
or county, because of a defective or careless system of 
book-keeping by some County Trustees. The law makes 
it incumbent on the Trustees to keep separate accounts 
of State and county moneys, but they seldom do so, In 
other cases the one mill-tax levied by the State, and the 
State poll tax, for the support of schools, are classified as 
a county tax in the returns. And again the authorities 
are under the necessity of negotiating Comptroller’s war- 
rants at a discount to pay teachers their dues, which makes 
an apparent reduction in the amounts returned as re- 
ceived from the State. It is much to be desired that these 
warrants could be met more promptly, which cannot be 
done unless greater punctuality were observed in the pay- 
ment of taxes. An effort will be made to remedy these 
irregularities and inaccuracies in the returns, by issuing 
more detailed instructions to County Superintendents than 
has hitherto been done. :

  There are three causes which have mainly contributed . 
to the falling off, indicated by the foregoing comparative” 
statistics, of the enrollment i in the public schools. These’ 
are: “
-P-A-G-E-18
20 
First:. The postponement of the collection of the taxes 
of 1874 by the General Assembly until November. This 
postponement rendered it necessary to shorten the terms 
of many schools, and thus to preclude the enrollment of 
_such as could attend at that season of the year. 
_ Second. The financial pressure prevented many from 
enrollment who would have otherwise attended. The 
short crop of 1873 created an absolute necessity for every 
available hand in the farms in the subsequent year. 
Absolute poverty.and want thus cut off the attendance. 
| Third. The reckless miscalculations of the school offi- 
cers in some counties, in 1873-4, involved them in an 
indebtedness which made it impossible to open their 
schools until the debt was first paid to the creditor teach- 
ers, In one county alone an indebtedness was incurred 
of about $28,000, according to the report of the present 
incumbent of the County Superintendency. 
In these counties the money received had to be appro- 
priated to liquidating the indebtedness. Soon after enter- 
‘ing upon the duties of the office; in a general circular, 1. 
called special attention to this abuse, and directed that all 
indebtedness incurred be first cancelled before reopening 
the schools, as a measure demanded for the very preser- 
vation’ of the system. This advice has been invariably 
heeded and acted on, as has been that which accompanied 
it, to be more circumspect in reference to the financial 
estimates for the current and future years, so as to avoid 
. a similar dilemma hereafter. It is, therefore, believed that 
no such barrier to progress will hereafter exist. It is true 
that teachers may be compelled to wait too long for their
-P-A-G-E-19
21 
pay, but this will be in consequence of the delay in the 
collection of taxes. It is to be regretted that the schools 
have not been opened at a time to succeed, ‘instead of 
precede, the collections. Prudent management may alone 
gradually bring this to pass, . 
To these special causes may be added the general one, 
heretofore alluded to, resulting from the fact of the 
County Courts failing or refusing to allow sufficient com- 
pensation to the officers whose duty it is to infuse unity, 
efficiency and vitality into the schools, who, if left to per- 
form their work, untrammeled by private occupations and 
ares, would induce many a thousand to attend the schools 
who now absent themselves, and who could give a wiser 
direction to the expenditures than are now given by to- 
tally irresponsible boards of directors. It is also believed 
that there is some deficiency in the reports of attend- 
ance upon the schools by reason of the enforced failure 
of Superintendents to make full reports in the counties so 
manipulated as to show no systematic returns, 
Notwithstanding, however, the reduced averages of en-’ 
rollment on scholastic population, and the reduction shown 
‘in the number of teachers and of schools, as compared to 
1873-4, it appears that by leaving out of the calculation those | 
eighteen counties which have not reported average attend- 
ance, the per cent. on scholastic population is the same as 
in 1873-4, viz. .38. So that, with all the drawbacks and 
disadvantages resulting from the postponement of collec- 
tion of taxes, the reckless and over-sanguine estimates 
which led to indebtedness, and the very great scarcity 
of currency, and poverty, the schools have maintained their
-P-A-G-E-20
22 
average attendance. We may fairly conclude from this. 
fact, and from the spirit everywhere manifested by the 
friends of the schools, that. henceforward there will be a 
real and substantial progress, both as to the numbers 
receiving the benefit of the schools, and as to their quality 
. and efficiency. , . 
This condition of progress may confidently be calcu-. 
lated on in the counties where the local authorities, appre- 
ciating intelligently their advantages in encouraging im- 
migration, improving the society, and enhancing the value 
of real estate, shall supplement the State tax by levying a 
sufficient county tax to continue the schools at least five 
months in each year, and shall employ a capable and ener- 
getic Superintendent to organize, strengthen, and unify 
them. Ih this connection it is proper to notice the fact 
that in too many of the counties the fund at their command 
is frittered away by the multiplication of schools in every 
neighborhood, thus dividing the available amount among a 
half-dozen teachers in each district, where two, or at most 
three, teachers in an average district would accommodate 
the whole scholastic population, and thus enable them to 
--employ more competent teachers at better salaries. In 
the present depressed financial condition of the country this 
commends itself as the most practicable means of elevating 
- the character and efficiency of the schools ; and unless they 
shall be thus elevated, they will scarcely win or merit that 
confidence which is indispensable to permanent success. 
The utility of a thorough system of supervision and inspec- 
tion here again is seen. For without the advising and di- 
recting judgment of a Superintendent, it is certain that
-P-A-G-E-21
28 
many of the school directors, inexperiericed and careless ag 
they often are, will continue to waste the fund in vain efforts 
to plant a school-house at nearly every man’s door. — 
Another measure of true economy, and tending to ele- 
vate the character of the schools, may be adopted by the 
districts, when advisable, availing themselves of the wise 
provision of the law which permits ‘the organization of 
CONSOLIDATED SCHOOLS, 
or schools which are free as to the branches of instruc- 
tion prescribed by law, but where tuition may be collected 
from those pursuing other. and higher studies. I have 
specially recommended the generous fostering of such 
institutions as being fitted to attract the support of the 
most intelligent citizens, who would be enabled to build up 
institutions for more advanced instruction at their imme- 
diate homes, and thus save the heavy cost of sending 
their sons and daughters to distant localities. In this way 
the public fund is virtually increased, a higher order of 
instruction introduced, better teachers employed, and the 
system elevated and popularized, at a comparatively small 
additional cost, and that falling on those who choose. to 
advance their sons and daughters beyond the free school , 
curriculum. One hundred and seventy-four of such con- 
solidated schools were in operation during the school- 
year, averaging nearly two in each county. The number 
might be multiplied indefinitely by the zealous co-opera- 
tion of the County Superintendents and of the School 
Directors, and thus the popularity and efficiency of the 
school system be greatly strengthened. Such schools are,
-P-A-G-E-22
“4 
or should be, of the best character of graded schools, and 
when properly supported, employ two or more teachers. 
In every neighborhood where intelligence and public spirit 
prevail, one of these schools should be established, and 
I trust that within the next year their number will be 
largely increased, Especially when men of intelligence 
complain of the low condition of the schools, this is the. 
practical way opened to them, by a little effort and ata 
small additional cost, to secure the services of the best 
qualified teachers, and elevate their schools to the highest 
grade of excellence. Any school system that exists, or 
can exist, demands the enlightened co-operation and assist- 
ance of the most intelligent and public-spirited citizens. 
It must languish and droop without such active co-opera- 
tion. And especially is this the case where the fund for 
sustaining it is comparatively so limited as is the fact in 
Tennessee. Every economical measure must be resorted 
to to keep it alive in full vigor and usefulness, which is 
consistent with the ancient maxim that “the laborer is 
worthy of his hire.” : 
The following table shows the per cent. of attendance 
on scholastic population and on enrollment in thirty-three 
counties, the per cent. of the aggregates being .49 on 
population, and, .73 1-3 on enrollment. This statement 
shows that more than one-third of the counties of the 
State have preserved a good average, despite the diffi- 
culties and embarrassments before detailed, and in the 
midst of a year of unprecedented monetary stringency.   2

PRIVATE SCHOOLS, 
No educational statistics can be complete, and there- 
fore none can effectually exhibit the state of progress, 
without reliable and accurate returns from the pri- 
vate schools. I have endeavored, by every means con- 
nected with the functions of this office, to collect such 
. Statistics for the last year. The result is, that I have com- 
plete returns from twenty-six counties, and partial returns 
from seven counties, but from the latter no reliable dada | 
can be given. It is desirable to know what proportion 
of the school population of the State has attended these = 
schools, and what the comparative cost of operating them | 
has been. It is much to be regretted that there is no fixed | 
system, sanctioned ‘by law, by which these statistics can be | 
collected and consolidated in this office.. The principals of 
these schools would cheerfully furnish them, it is believed, 
if there was a strictly legal demand. There is no rivalry 
in any sense between. them and the public schools. The 
organization of free public schools has brought about — 
a movement which throws to the front the enlightened 
educator in every department. And if the private schools + 
could enroll in their catalogues all the children of the ~ 
State, there would be no demand for public schools, save 
what is gained by a great organization that cheapens ed- | 
ucation, and by the superior system introduccd and the 
general discussion of methods, both of discipline and in- 
struction; which have brought about a higher efficiency, a 
renewed vitality, and a progressive movement for univer- | 
sal enlightenment ; and is one of the marvels of our age, 
It is true that the exception has crystalized the public ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
27 
school system in popular sentiment. But the statesmen 
of our period well know that it is necessary to invoke 
every assistance in the great work of educating the people, 
which is now universally regarded as the most efficient 
police measure or preventive; the necessary means to 
sustaining a government based upon the intelligence of 
the citizen; and the indispensable measure of progress 
in the increase of wealth, enterprise and social advance- 
ment. 
The following statement shows tolerably complete re- 
turns of private schools from twenty-six counties. Partial 
returns, but not useful because so deficient, were also 
received from the counties of Davidson, Fayette, Ham- 
blen, Humphreys, McMinn, Weakley and. Williamson, 
which show the average cost of tuition in private schools 
in those counties, per pupil, per month, to be $3.24. Com- 
plete or partial reports of the cost of tuition in private - 
schools in all the counties (33) reporting, completely or . 
partially, show the average cost of tuition per pupil, per 
month, to be $2.84, while the cost of pupil per month, 
in the public schools, was .86 31-100, as elsewhere shown. 
In the twenty-six counties from which complete returns 
of private schools were received, there were 10,083 pupils 
attending during the school year. The scholastic popula- 
tion of these twenty-six counties, according to the late 
enumeration, is 99,715. If, therefore, the attendance in 
private schools in the remaining counties.in the State was 
in the same proportion, in a scholastic population of 
426,612, there were 43,138 pupils attending the private 
schools, which added to the enrollment in the public

schools, will sum up 241,223, attending either public or

The failure to levy a tax by any county indicates a 
great indifference to the spirit of the law. The interest 
‘on the school fund, apportioned to the counties, forms a 
basis upon which the counties may build a liberal system, 
of free instruction. But it should be supplemented by a 
county tax sufficient to continue the operation of the 
schools not less than five months; otherwise it may be 
characterized as almost a waste of the fund, unless, as 
in some instances, the schools. are prolonged by gen- - 
erous private subscriptions, But these subscriptions 
are not reliable for a definite period, and the County 
Courts would, in every case, consult the true interest 
of the people by levying such a tax as will make the 
schools vital and efficient. The immediate benefit of 
the schools, without reference to their influence upon the” 
coming generation, will be the improved value of farms 
and town lots, and the: securing a greater abundance and 
consequent cheapness of labor. Immigration of the best 
character will be attracted to counties which provide good 
free schools, and will be instantly repelled by the igno- 
rance which attends their absence. Nothing is better 
established, in the history of new settlements, than this 
fact, and 1 commend its consideration to the County 
Courts. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Under the provisions of an Act passed by the General 
Assembly March 23, 1875, entitled “An act to prdvidé for 
the establishment, and to prescribe rules for-the govern- 
“ment, of a Normal School or Schools in the State. of 
Tennessee, in connection with the Public School system
-P-A-G-E-34
38° 
people has become an absolute necessity, a fact equally indis- 
pensable and inevitable.” 
- The public school system of Tennessee was established 
upon this idea, that as civilization is, in its present pro- 
gressive stage, “the education of the people has become 
an absolute necessity, a fact equally indispensable and 
inevitable.” Without it, Tennessee must fall back from 
the ranks of an enlightened State, and the very foundation 
of her political system—universal suffrage—must rot and 
decay, and its superstructure, therefore, totter to its fall. 
Nor is it less true that it is incumbent upon our states- 
men. to see to it that this “new and influential force,” 
which, having “entered the world,” “can never be ex- 
pelled,” should receive the assistance of the most broad 
and generous training, that it may be well and not ill 
directed. That it may be “turned to profitable account,” 
the force should be directed and engineered by skilled 
hands, and the whole system should be elevated, so as to 
command the confidence and receive the support of the 
most intelligent and leading minds in our State. This can 
only be done by preparing the teachers systematically, 
and by the highest methods known to educators, for their 
grand.and beneficent work. In this manner, and in this 
alone, can we make the free educational force a blessing 
to the children of the State, beyond any that could be 
conferred upon them, and a bulwark of the State itself, of 
more strength and durability than any other which human. 
hands can construct or human brains conceive. 
I do not hesitate to invoke, through your Excellency, the. 
favorable and fostering care of the General Assembly to.
-P-A-G-E-35
39 
this first effort to establish popular education in our State, 
upon such a firm and substantial basis as‘may elevate it to 
the highest standard of efficiency and excellence which it 
has attained in the most civilized states and nations of 
the globe. And I would most respectfully and earnestly 
invoke your own influence and good offices in its behalf, 
as being one of the most signal services; which the privi- 
lege conferred- upon the Executive by the Constitution, to 
recommend such measures as shall\geem conducive to the 
public welfare, enables him to perform.. It should not be 
forgotten that the Normal University, in its present organ- 
ization, is provisional and limited, It is an experiment for 
the purpose of attracting the attention of enlightened cit- 
izens to its manifest and great advantages. It is justly 
regarded as indispensable to an elevated and useful public 
school system. It will, therefore, require some legislative 
aid to make it a permanent feature. But I will not doubt 
that when it shall have demonstrated, by its own operation 
and influence, the necessity for its support, the State will 
move with all its power, both to its moral and to its ma- 
terial aid. : 
COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
In connection with the establishment of a Normal Uni- 
versity, which it is believed will eventually lead to the 
creation of others in gradual succession, the question of 
Normal Institutes, in each county of the State, assumes 
“greater importance. No provision has been made. by law 
to foster these useful institutions for improvement in the 
art of teaching.. But they are used as auxiliaries, in all 
countries where the public school has taken rank, as the
-P-A-G-E-36
40 
chief instrumentality in improving the social, industrial and . 
political condition of the people. That the profession of 
teaching is greatly elevated, and its capacity for useful- 
ness increased by their means, there can .be no doubt. 
They are training schools for teachers of the highest value, 
and such schools only as many teachers can reach, I 
know of but one country where the Normal Schools have 
attained to sufficient growth as to be able to provide near- 
ly all the teachers for the free schools; and even in Prus- 
sia, many teachers are furnished from the Universities and 
other institutions, which can graduate pupils of equal or 
higher qualifications with the Normal Schools. Switzer- 
land, indeed, has world-famed Normal Schools, the founda- 
tion of whose excellence is justly ascribed to the philan- 
thropist-educator, Fellenberg. But they are not sufficiently 
numerous to supply the wants of a free school system’ 
which has attained the destderatum of educating every 
child in the State of sane mind and sound body. In our 
State, where teaching is not recognized as a profession, 
and where few have adopted it as a permanency, it would 
be next to impossible to supply the annual demand fora 
fresh supply of teachers from these institutions. It has, 
therefore, become a necessity to adopt the next best ex- 
pedient by resorting to the Teachers’ Institute. I would 
recommend, therefore, that every County Superintendent 
organize a permanent Institute in his county, and decline 
to recognize as a teacher of the first grade any candidate 
who shall contumaciously refuse to attend these Institutes 
whenever it may be in his power to do so. In answer 
to a circular of inquiry, addressed to the County Superin-
-P-A-G-E-37
41 
tendents from this office, with the view of ascertaining the 
number of County Institutes already organized, nineteen _ 
affirmative responses were received, and it was found that 
several other Superintendents were taking the initiative to- 
ward the establishment of Institutes. : 
During the past year I attended two District Institutes, 
and called together a third, which I was providentially 
hindered from attending. These Institutes were held res- 
pectively at Morristown, Hartsville and Troy, the first 
being conducted by Superintendent H. Presnell, of Wash- 
ington county, and Prof. Z. C. Sharp, of Blount county ; 
the second by Prof. C. W. Callender, of Sumner county ; 
and the last by Superintendent W. F. Shropshire, of 
Obion county. They were severally attended by the 
ablest educators in the surrounding counties, and were 
productive of decided good results, both to teachers and 
to the cause of free schools. 
INTER-STATE CONVENTION. 
‘An Inter-State Teachers’ Convention was held at Chat- 
tanooga on the 30th of June, continuing three days. 
Superintendent Mallon, of Atlanta, Ga. was appointed 
President. An address of welcome was delivered by Col. 
George Washington, of Knoxville.. Able and profitable - 
papers were read by Superintendent W. P. Harris, of the 
St. Louis city schools, Prof. Briggs, of the Northwestern 
University, Evanston, Illinois, and Maj. W. J. Davis, editor 
of Home and School, Louisville, Ky.; and several interesting 
discussions were had. This convention was well attended 
by the teachers of East and Middle Tennessee.and ‘North- 
ern Georgia. The following resolutions were adopted:
-P-A-G-E-38
42 
1. That the Convention permanently organize under the 
name of Inter-State Teachers’ Association. 2. That the 
next meeting be held at Memphis, Tennessee, the time to 
be left to the Executive Committee. 3. That the teachers 
and educators in Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Missis- 
sippi, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri and Kentucky, and all 
other States wishing it, be invited to become members. 
Before adjourning a permanent organization was effect: 
ed by the election of Prof. B. Mallon, of Georgia, Presi 
dent; Prof. Z. C. Graves of Tennessee, Maj. W, J. Davis 
of Kentucky, Mr. G. A. Woodward of Alabama, Rev. M. 
C. Briggs, of Illinois, Prof. W. T. Harris of St. Louis, 
Missouri, Vice Presidents; Prof. W. R. Garrett, of Ten- 
nessee, Secretary. Executive Committee, Dr. J. B. Linds- 
ley, Dr. R. W. Mitchell, Prof. A. Pickett, and Prof. M. C. 
Butler. 
It was one of the most successful and advantageous 
conferences of educators ever held in the State, its incep- 
tion, and much of its success, being due to Dr. J. B. 
Lindsley, President of the Tennessee State Teachers’ 
Association. The citizens of Chattanooga dispensed a 
liberal hospitality, through the Chairman of their local 
Committee of Arrangements, Maj. L. S. Marye. The 
Convention adjourned to meet at Memphis at some day 
during the year 1876. 
THE CENTENNIAL. 
Although no requirement of law indicated any obliga- 
tion to arrange for the exhibition of school-work at the 
Centennial Exposition, to be held in the city of Philadel- 
phia, during the year 1876, yet I considered it my privilege,
-P-A-G-E-39
43 
if not my duty, to make an earnest effort to place the 
Tennessee free schools in their proper position on that 
opportune occasion for marking the advance we are mak- 
ing in that direction. I accordingly sought the aid of the 
Executive Committee of the State Teachers’ Association, 
to bring the matter properly before the educators of the 
State, and was met in a liberal and enlightened spirit both 
by that body and by Superintendents S. Y. Caldwell, R. W. 
Weakley and John R. Dean. 
The principal obstacle which we had to encounter was 
the want of funds to make the necessary preliminary 
preparations at the exposition. An effort has been made 
to meet this difficulty, but with doubtful success. Refer- 
ence is made to the circulars sent out from this office for 
the details of the action taken. 
GRADED SCHOOLS. 
Earnest efforts have been made by the most enlightened 
and efficient Superintendents, in counties where there 
was any occasion for effort, to establish graded schools, in 
accordance with the positive spirit of the public school 
law. From the reports received at this office, there are 
now in the State about ninety of these schools in the rural 
districts, The aid offered by the Peabody Education Fund 
has contributed very materially to encourage the estab- 
lishment of these schools, which are now known to be 
indispensable adjuvants to efficient instruction, thorough 
discipline, and. economy in expenditure. The counties 
which have been in the advance in this movement are 
Bedford, Bradley, Davidson, Hardin, Jefferson, James, 
Knox, Madison, McMinn, McNairy, Montgomery, Polk,
-P-A-G-E-40
44 
_ Warren and Washington. It is only in well populated 
districts that they can be thoroughly successful, and every 
effort should be made to increase the number, and when 
the population will not’ admit their success, such classifi- 
cation should be adopted as will approximate to them as 
nearly as the circumstances will admit. 
NEW SCHOOL-HOUSES. 
There have been 138 new school-houses erected in the 
State during the year, as reported to this office in answer 
to a circular of inquiry. Answers were received from 
only 54 counties. The majority are reported to be plain, 
substantial frame structures, a few of a better quality, and 
some of an inferior character. As is well known, a large 
number. of the country school-houses are of a very in- 
ferior fashion, not being adapted for any known purpose, 
unless it be to house cattle. The least Teflection will sat- 
isfy any mind that the structures where children are 
taught should be well warmed, well ventilated, with ample 
light and space, and furnished with convenient modern 
seats and desks, blackboards, maps, charts, etc. There 
should also be play-grounds attached to them of sufficient 
extent, at least one or two acres, with shade trees, and sup- 
plied with pure water. The site should be selected for its 
healthfulness, and to some extent for its sightly landscape. 
Neglected as have been these considerations in the past, 
they are beginning to exert their influence in the erection 
of our school-houses, where the smallest modicum of 
taste and intelligence prevails. They are now undeniably 
regarded as the essential preliminaries to progress
-P-A-G-E-41
45 
in educational results; and while the school-house and 
“surroundings cannot supplement poor teaching, it is an 
accessory to good instruction, which will ever hold a high 
place in the estimation of the patrons and directors of the 
school. Our.fund is too small to afford much assistance 
in the erection of these improved school-houses. Indeed, 
I have doubted whether the District Directors ought, in 
any case, to appropriate any portion of the fund to this 
purpose. There ought to be public spirit enough in every 
or nearly every school district and neighborhood to pro- 
vide, by private subscription, for the purchase of the sites, 
the erection, of the buildings, and the furnishing of 
the necessary appointments. The effort which is required 
to make these improvements from private means, would _ 
have a tendency to increase the interest and arouse the - 
pride of the citizens in their schools and in the progress 
of the pupils, by giving every man a personal interest in 
the district school and in its progress. Citizens who will 
interest themselves and appropriate their means to such 
an object, will manifest ‘an ever-increasing interest in the 
cause of education itself. 
It is regretted that no reliable statistics exist of the 
character and value of our common school property. 
Measures will be adopted, during the next year, to ascer- 
tain with exactness these facts, and County Superintend- 
ents, it is hoped, will make it a special object to procure 
reliable. data on these points in their respective coun- 
ties, in due time for the next annual report from this office.

UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 
Though not appertaining to the special functions of 
this office, I have deemed it appropriate to solicit such 
facts from the authorities of the Universities and Colleges 
‘of Tennessee as would give a reliable and interesting 
view of our system of instraction in. these higher schools. 
Our State has been fortunate in having attracted the 
favorable judgment of five leading denominations ' of 
Christians in the Southern States in favor of the location 
of great Universities, where its refined society, genial 
climate and striking landscapes could impress the heart 
and strengthen the physigue of their pupils. The councils 
and ‘synods of these churches have decreed that munifi- 
cent endowments should be raised to provide the grounds, 
buildings and appliances, where the priceless treasures of 
learning should be offered, not only to the youth of our own, 
but also of sister States; thus projecting, in the near future, 
a group of great, Universities which is likely to result in 
making our State the universityecenter of the South. 
Appropriate sketches of these institutions have been sup- 
plied and printed in the appendix, together with that of East 
Tennessee University and State Agricultural College, at 
Knoxville, and the other colleges of the State. Such a 
broad and generous system of higher education can not 
fail to act with stimulating power upon our elementary 
and secondary schools, infusing into them some part of 
that high enthusiasm which the spirit of education, when 
abroad, cannot fail to inspire in all communities. At the 
same time, our common schools will be the nucleus of 
many an aspiration in youth which will not be suppressed.
-P-A-G-E-43
47 
until it shall reach the highest rounds of the ladder of 
learning in the university. 
PEABODY SCHOOLS, * 
In consequence of the large and disproportionate appro- 
priations from the Peabody Education Fund in the past to 
graded schools of a certain class, the allowance made to 
the schools of the State for the present year has.been per- 
. ceptibly diminished. In the spring, whei sit Wad! ‘believed 
that the fund would be larger, an appropriation of $1/5c 
was given to the Shelbyville High 2 Sckgol. As has beer,’ 
stated, $6,000 was appropriated to the: stile: ‘Normal Uni ) 
versity. And the sum of $1,500 was! ‘appropriate ‘bur.

The able, learned and distinguished general agent of 
the fund, Dr. B. Sears, has afforded to this office not only 
the material aid above stated, but has, in every way, ex- 
tended encouragement and assistance in the arduous work 
which has fallen upon it. 
Impelled by a sense of official duty, and encouraged by 
the support thus extended to me, I have made many visits 
to various counties in the State, and delivered addresses 
wherever they seemed to be demanded by the sentiment 
of the people, or public invitation. I have, in every in- 
stance, been received kindly and hospitably, and have 
been listened to with respectful attention, for which my 
warmest thanks are due to the intelligent, and, in many 
instances, sympathetic audiences I have addressed.

COLORED NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Mr. Yardley Warner, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has 
devoted a large portion of his time and influence to col- 
lecting funds, and appropriating them to the support of 
colored schools in East Tennessee, in connection with the 
free schools. The contributions which he has solicited 
and received have been from the Society of Friends in the 
Northern States and in England. Mr. Warner has twice 
visited England on his philanthropic mission, and the re- 
sults are shown in his operations at Jonesboro, Athens, 
Maryville, and other places. A full detail of his opera- 
tions and their results more fully appears in his statement 
made to this office, and in the report of Superintendent 
Presnell, of Washington county, where he has. purchased 
with these funds a commodious building, and endowed a 
colored Normal School for the education of colored teach- 
ers, which is a desideratum in our State. The Central 
Tennessee College and the Fisk University, at Nashville, 
have supplied a number of colored teachers heretofore, 
but the demand has been far greater than the supply. It 
is believed that hereafter the field will be much better 
occupied than heretofore, in consequence of the benevo- 
lent and active exertions of Mr. Warner and his asso- 
ciates, and of the extended facilities afforded by the insti- 
tutions above referred to. 
CITY AND COUNTY SCHOOLS, 
The separate reports of the! city schools of Nashville, 
Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga and Edgefield, which: 
constitute an important part of our general system, deriving 
4 . e . 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
50 
their support in part from the State and county taxation, 
which is supplemented with taxes levied by the city author- 
ities, is referred to as constituting a noble living monu- 
ment of the enlightened public spirit of the cit'zens of 
those municipalities. These schools, mostly conducted as 
they are, on the most advanced principles of educational 
progress, adapted to the genius of the people by whom 
they are sustained, and conservative of all that is valuable 
in the treasured traditions of the past, with every improve- 
ment that is useful, while rejecting all that is merely new- 
fangled or novel, may be regarded as landmarks for guid- 
ance in the earnest effort being made to spread their 
blessings into every portion ofthe State. In this light, 
they are a study td the practical educator, and their meth- 
ods, discipline, organization and details should: form an 
inductive basis upon which to build the future superstruc- 
ture of our free school system. Whether we regard them 
with reference to the blessings they have directly. con- 
ferred, to their internal economy and management, or to 
the material benefits merely, of which they have been the 
controlling cause, they are alike models for study and an 
acquired vantage ground for our. encouragement. I trust 
it will not be deemed invidious to mention, as pre-emi- 
nently entitled to approbation, those of Nashville and 
Memphis, since they are an example of what may be at- 
tained by popular sanction and support, without reference 
to parties or classes, though they have not reached as far 
as can be desired, and since they have been founded ‘and 
sustained by the sentiment and action of the most enlight- 
‘and the purest of their citizens.
-P-A-G-E-47
51 
There may be some who: doubt whether the system of: 
organization, which has been so successfully carried out in 
the establishment of urban schools, applies with equal’ 
force to-the rural districts. The ground. for such a doubt 
is limited to the idea alone, that a sparse rural population 
cannot organize a system of schools as successfully as the 
densely populated city districts. It may be granted that’ 
the organization can not be as complete and the system as 
perfect; and yet it does not follow that the same general 
organization may not be formulated in counties or districts 
with the view to unity of plan, both as to discipline and 
methods of instruction, and to utilizing the power of asso- 
ciated effort and interchange of experience, just as the 
guilds of cities and the patrons of the country are doing— 
to give momentum to their movements and power to their 
decrees. Leave an’ obscure district school out of such 
association tq struggle without sympathy or aid, and it is 
like the single drop descending upon the parched earth, 
to be ‘swallowed up and disappear as: soon’as it falls: But 
take the same school, constituting one of many which 
exist and move together, by a common: impulse and sym- 
pathy, with common visitation, supervision and govern- 
ment; and if more nearly resembles: one of: the myriad 
drops which pour down from the’ full cloud to fertilize: the: 
thirsty earth and add accumulated ‘strength to the streams 
which. water and make it glad. , 
The district schools thus organized may never attain to 
the full growth and wide influence of the city schools, but in 
their sphere they are destined to exert equally as health- 
ful’ and elevating influences, and to build up the “waste
-P-A-G-E-48
  52 
places,” attracting immigration of the best class, enhancing 
the value of realty, improving social advantages, increas- 
ing the security of life and property, and multiplying and 
making labor cheaper, and at the same time, more skilled, 
dignified and honorable. The railroad, the press, the tele- 
graph—quick transit and the speed of intelligence—have 
vastly facilitated the diffusion of organized effort, as they: 
have assimilated the prompt habits of business in rural 
communities with those in cities, thus drawing the country 
in close proximity to the city in enterprise, in intelligence, 
and in moral power. Organized effort and union in asso- 
ciation, thus ramify their benefits into the remotest parts 
of the country. Fashion and haBit are seen to be daily 
more closely approximated, and homogeneity of manners, 
ideas and action are most distinctly felt. In other States, 
and to some extent in our own, the school methods and 
organizations, like other great movements of ithe age, are 
becoming less distinct and more harmoniously blended in 
communities wide apart. Hence we see in sections far 
removed from cities, the graded school, the most modern 
school structures, the improved furniture, and the best 
apparatus, as well as capable and accomplished teachers, 
and managing, directing and harmonizing all—a common 
head or supervisor. The only practicable way by which 
these advantages may be thus enjoyed in remote commu- 
nities is by their adopting the same organization, and 
availing themselves of similar well-tried and altogether 
successful agencies. The people of the rural districts 
can not send their children directly to the city, schools 
because of the enormous cost of boarding and transpor-
-P-A-G-E-49
53 
tation. But they can do far better. They can establish 
the same systems of education at their very homes, where 
they can have their children shielded beneath the parental 
roof-tree, and not alienated by absence and other associa- 
tions, through the same well formulated instrumentalities, 
system of supervisorship, and methods of organization, 
‘discipline and responsibility. The municipalities have led 
the way in this movement of progress, because of the 
superior facilities for mobilizing the masses of their chil- 
‘dren by reason of density of population. But the country 
will be much at fault if its enterprising and intelligent 
leaders do not follow closely in this procession of ad- 
vanced intelligence,.and-thus solve the difficult problem of 
retaining in agricultural, mining and mechanical pursuits 
among them intelligent, virtuous and skilled laborers, as 
well as the useful and enterprising proprietors themselves. 
As a practical illustration of the necessity thus felt for 
country schools, it is a well known fact that it is becoming a 
frequent occurrence for farmers residing in districts where 
the facilities for educating their children are not satisfac- 
factory, to rent or lease their lands and remove to the city . 
of Nashville or Edgefield, for the sole purpose of giving 
their children the advantages of a better training. In the 
new order of civilization, in these Southern States, it is 
not so serious a business to leave the country homestead 
as formerly. These examples will become contagious un- 
less the means at hand are utilized, and schools of equal — 
advantages are organized in the rural districts of the State. 
It will prove a fatal error to “suppose that this organiza- 
tion can not be effected. It can be done by exhibiting
-P-A-G-E-50
  54 
equal enterprise, system and liberality. The counties can 
supplement the State tax by a county levy, just as the 
cities have done bya city levy. They can employ efficient, 
active and capable Superintendents to discipline and gov- 
ern their schools as the cities have uniformly done. They 
can provide, by getting an amendment to the State law, 
for an enlightened Board of Education to direct the policy 
of the schools, economize the fund, and devise and adopt 
such regulations as will insure the employment of able 
men, and procure the erection of suitable school-houses. 
There is not one feature of city organization which may 
not, by enlightened enterprise and liberality, be made 
applicable to county organization. Added to this, the 
‘healthful air and simple habits of country life are more 
favorable. to the healthy growth of youth, both in good 
morals and physical perfection. The city is every year 
recruited in business, mechanics and professional men 
from the country. The mountain, the stream, the forest, 
every aspect of nature, impress the young mind with ele- 
vated aims and virtuous ambitions. Many of our greatest 
statesmen, most successful merchants, and most eminent 
clergymen, lawyers and physicians have been’ the sons of 
farmers, and have received their early training in the 
country school. When a country neighborhood has the 
‘advantages of excellent schools, competent teachers and. 
devoted clergymen, the youth who are there reared be- 
come useful and distinguished members of society—and 
the society to be found in it is the most charming and 
agreeable which is known to our country. Every neigh~ 
borhood, every district, can have such advantages by all
-P-A-G-E-51
55 - 
citizens co-operating and availing themselves of the nu- 
cleus which is at hand in our common schools, and_ by 
managing and organizing them as before explained. 
BENEVOLENT SCHOOLS. 
The State has liberally provided for the proper training 
and education of the blind, within her borders, by erecting 
a beautiful and commodious building in the southern pof- 
tion of the city of Nashville, situated on a picturesque and 
commanding site, (the gift of Hon. John M. Lea and wife,) ~ 
for a school and home for that unfortunate class of her 
children. This institution is presided over by Mr. J. M. 
Sturdivant, a graduate of Dartmouth College himself, a 
most distinguished example of the capacity of educational 
processes to reach minds darkened by blindness. It is. one 
of the most serious drawbacks tothe usefulness of this 
institution that there has never been a complete and re- 
liable census of the blind, which could be taken as a guide 
in adopting measures to secure attendance at the school. 
It is very desirable that all of these stricken children in 
-the State should be induced to avail themselves of ‘those 
advantages which rescue them from | a life of mental dark- | 
ness and dependence. 
The Deaf and Dumb School at Knoxville, situated in 
the midst of beautiful grounds, also deserves some special 
mention as one of those institutions of the State which 
throws its sheltering protection over. the unfortunate deaf- 
‘mutes, by educating and training them for lives of useful- 
ness and rational enjoyment. The same defect exists with - 
regard toa census of the deaf-muteés, as has been ‘referred
-P-A-G-E-52

56 
to in the case of the blind. The sketches of these two 
institutions, in the appendix, will furnish more particular 
~ accounts of their history and progress. 
STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association 
was held in the Capitol, at Nashville, January 2oth and 
21st, Dr. J. B. Lindsley, President of the Association, pre- 
siding. The Convention was opened with prayer by Rev. 
W. A. Nelson. The welcome address was delivered by 
Gov. James D. Porter, in which he expressed full sympa- 
thy with the cause in which the Association is engaged. 
He pledged his personal and official co-operation in this 
‘cause. Ténnessee needed an efficient common’ school 
system. He paid a high tribute to Dr. Philip Lindsley, 
father of the present President of the Association. The~ 
Secretary, Mr. R. W. Weakley, read the roll of members, 
The meeting was largely attended, and was full of life and 
spirit. 
Ex-President Andrew Johnson being present, was called 
on to address the Association, and excused himself from de- 
livering an address, but said that his whole life gave evi- 
dence that he favored the cause of education. He would 
be glad, on some future occasion, to address the Associa- 
tion more fully on education. 
The President announced the Memorial Committee, with 
Ex-Gov. Neill S. Brown as chairman. 
The State Superintendent’s Report was read by Mr. B. 
Cornick, his assistant, in which it was stated that the 
Peabody Education Fund had assisted schools in the
-P-A-G-E-53
57 
amount of $36,800, which was apportioned to fifty-three 
graded schools, with an attendance of 9,410 pupils. 
The following resolution, introduced by Mr, A. B. Mar- 
bury was fully discussed : 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this Association -that 
any interference with the offices of County or State Super- 
intendent, looking to the abolishing thereof, will be: de- 
structive to the public school interest of. the State of Ten- 
nessee, and that we favor the maintenance of the present 
system of State and County Superintendency as a matter 
of economy. 
Dr. B. Sears said that the resolution proposed con- 
cerned the interests of the Peabody Fund very closely. 
During the past year $36,000 have been expended in 
Tennessee. It had been contributed for the purpose of 
building up a permanent system, and not merely for the 
purpose of carrying on the schools aided for ten months. 
The work of a State Superintendent was to arouse the 
people and set the schools going, and was worth many 
times the salary paid him. The Superintendent of In- 
struction should grow into his work, and be a man espe- 
cially adapted to it, full of life, possessed with power to 
set in operation every force. It was exceedingly bad 
economy to dispense with these offices. If these offices 
were abolished, he thought it would be better to expend 
the entire amount of the Peabody Fund in other States 
where good systems are in operation. Tennessee is the 
pride of the Trustees of the Peabody Fund, because of 
the advances the State has made, and now should the 
work be given up?
-P-A-G-E-54
58 
Hon. H. A, M. Henderson, State Superintendent of In 
struction of Kentucky, was called upon, and said he wa 
surprised to hear such a question discussed. The Rubico1 
was passed in Kentucky, and the success of the schoc 
system there was secured: The salary of the Superin 
tendent was $2,000, but the passage of a bill had bee 
secured raising it to $3,000, The effect was most salutar 
in securing Teachers’ Institutes, building school-house: 
and the promotion of the cause. Any progress in schoc 
legislation must be suggested by intelligent school met 
It will never be done by the politician. The Count 
Superintendent is necessary to the successful managemel 
of schools in the several counties. 
The discussion was continued by Superintendent H. 
Presnell of Washington county, Dr. Wm. Shelton of 
Davidson county, Ex-Superintendent C. W. Callender of 
Sumner county, Rev. W. B. Rankin of Greene county, 
Superintendent John R. Dean of Bedford county, and Ex- 
Superintendent W. R, Garrett of Giles county. 
At the afternoon session, Prof. J. W. Shearer lectured 
for half an hour on a system of phonetics, which he had 
devised to assist lexicographers in expressing sounds. 
Superintendent Presnell, of Washington county, again 
addressed the Association, when he advocated the ne- 
cessity of the Couuty Superintendency, and alluded to 
the fact that the entire County Superintendency of Ten- 
nessee cost only six per cent., being the cheapest super- 
vision we can find. If the law be repealed, money capital 
enough would be driven out of the State to sustain the 
schools for five years.

Col. Jolin Frizzell introduced the following resolution as 
an amendment to the one under consideration : 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this Association that no 
material change of the present school system of the State 
should be made, and the Memorial Committee be instruct- 
ed to carry to the General Assembly, now in session, in 
such manner as the Committee may determine, the views 
of this Association on these subjects. 
Mr. Frizzell then addressed the Association on the 
necessity of State and County Supervisors, saying that in 
no other way can such complete statistics be collected. If 
we give up this supervision, we give up the whole system. 
You will also lose the ‘Peabody aid, which amounted to as 
much as the cost of Supervisor. 
Brief addresses were made by Dr. W. P. Jones, Dr. 
Alex. Hamilton, of Missouri, Prof. Wm. A. Smith, Super- 
intendent John R. Dean, Mr. J, O. Griffith, and Superin- 
tendent James H. Wilks, in concurrence with the resolu- 
lutions; which were unanimously adopted. 
At the night session, Dr. A. Hamilton, of Missouri, Hon. 
H. R. Buchanan, of Davidson, Hon. Luke. Finley, of 
Shelby, Hon. Horace Polk, of Hardeman, Hon. E. A. 
James, of Hamilton, Hon. L. S. Marye, of Hamilton, Hon. 
Mr. Gibson, of Campbell, delivered entertaining addresses. 
The session of the 21st was occupied by Dr. Lindsley, 
President of the Association, in a “Plea for Normal Col- 
leges,” being a full, forcible and learned argument on the 
necessity of schools for training teachers ; and an address 
on common school education by Hon. H. A. M. Hender-

son, State Superintendent of Kentucky, in which he ably 
and eloquently set forth the strong points for permanent 
State systems of education. 
PROGRESS, 
Within the year just passed, I feel that much progress 
has been made in the public schools. The County Super- 
intendents, who have pretended to discharge their duties 
at all under the law, have been active and intelligent, and 
many of them have exhibited a marked devotion to the 
great cause of free elementary education. There are none 
of them whose compensation could have determined their 
zeal and activity, and had they not been animated by the 
highest motives, they would have been content with mere 
routine work. But they have done much more than this, 
They have given to their labors the benefit of all their 
ability and experience, and in many cases have succeeded 
in building up snch excellent schools in their respective 
counties, as to challenge the approval of all the most in- 
telligent citizens; and have thus virtually silenced opposi- 
tion. This is the great step gained in consolidating public 
sentiment in favor of the system, and thus making it per- 
manent and unassailable. The schools must make an 
advance towards meriting public confidence before they 
can receive it in good measure. At the same time the 
pronounced friends of the cause expect the system to be 
a growth of slow and patient labor. They do not antici- 
pate sudden and immediate success at all points. . Neither 
do they expect at once to enjoy all the advantages of old’ 
and well-tried systems. Nor are they hasty to adopt 
every suggestion of improvement which may come to”
-P-A-G-E-57
61 
them, even if they had the means. They will be governed 
by the maxim, “to prove all things and cleave to that 
which is good.” Undoubtedly, every people have their pecu- 
liar genius and prescriptive ideas, which must be carefully 
weighed in forming their institutions. A system. which 
_ would admirably answer in Connecticut would never take 
root in Virginia, and vce versa. Perhaps there will be 
many trials and disappointments before we shall reach the 
great desideratum of providing good elementary schools 
for all children in the State, which is a necessity in a gov- 
ernment that pre-supposes intelligence as its base. But 
we shall not despair on that account. For we know that 
a permanent republican goverment and perpetual freedom 
can only be secured by successfully attaining this end. And 
what is so valuable, so necessary to the perpetuity of our 
institutions must not be abandoned lightly. There is enough 
to encourage us in the confidence that the public senti- 
ment of the State is unalterably fixed for the success of 
the system, and that one or two amendments, not radical. 
in their character, will give to it such an impulse forward, if 
seconded by the co-operation of school officers and people, 
as shall remove it fromthe border land of debate and 
crystallize it in the sentiments and affections of all intelli- 
gent men. 
There are many questions that are the subjects of 
anxious discussion, in other States, connected with the wel- 
fare and progress of the schools, which I have passed over, 
as not of immediate practical importance at the present 
stage of our progress. I have confined both my-labors 
and discussions to such subjects as promised immediate
-P-A-G-E-58

results. It will be time to. touch on others when they may | 
properly claim attention. 
_ ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. 
I take pleasure in making grateful acknowledgments to 
the following gentlemen for their valuable aid in preparing 
sketches of the Universities, Colleges and benevolent ~ 
schools of Tennessee, viz.: President Humes, of East 
‘Tennessee University and Tennessee Agricultural College ; 
Prof. Granberry, of the Vanderbilt University; Hon. 
Nathan Green, of Cumberland University; President Shel- 
ton, of Southwestern Baptist University; Prof. Shearer, of 
Southwestern Presbyterian University; Dr, J. B. Lindsley, 
Secretary of the Board of Education; Superintendent H. 
Presnell, of Washington county; Prof. Z. C. Sharp, of 
Maryville; Prof. Sturdivant, of the Tennessee Blind School, 
and Prof. Ijams, of the Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School. 
It is due to. my able assistant, Mr. Franc. M. Paul, that I 
should here record my high appreciation of the valuable 
aid he has rendered. in the discharge of the multifarious 
duties of the office. His services have been signalized by 
constant zeal and great efficiency. 
THE PRESS OF THE STATE 
has contributed its valuable and powerful assistance in 
furthering the cause of free intelligence, and pushing on 
to success all efforts for its advancement. The might of a 
free press was never better vindicated than by its inval- 
uable contributions in this direction, by which it has proved 
its claim to be regarded as an indestructible force ina free 
State. Located at the capital, and looking with jealous
-P-A-G-E-59
63 
vigilance to all the agencies which are at work in giv- 
ing glory and prosperity to the career of the State, 
the Nashville American has ever been foremost in gen- 
erous and enlightened effort to further the cause. Espe- 
cial thanks are due to its editors for their unflagging 
support, whenever they deemed their assistance necessary. 
Finally, I am indebted to your Excellency for wise coun- 
sel and cheerful encouragement in every doubt and emer- 
gency. As the Executive of a great State, and personally, 
you have, on all occasions, exhibited your readiness to 
give your hearty and unhesitating influence to the great 
cause upon which rest the dearest hopes of humanity, and 
from which is destined to flow a large share of the future 
grandeur, prosperity and progress of our beloved State.

DIGHsST 
OF 
County Superintendents’ Reports. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
R. N. Baker, SUPERINTENDENT, Clinton. 
Several of the districts suspended their schools this year, in 
accordance with the recommendation of the State Superintendent 
to appropriate the first available funds to the liquidation of the 
indebtedness heretofore incurred. Where schools went into opera- 
tion they seein to be progressing as successfully as last year. Tol- 
erable uniformity has been attained in spellers, readers, grammars 
and arithmetics. There are no graded schools. in the county, and 
but few of the schools are furnished with blackboards, charts or 
globes. Very little interest is exhibited by directors, parents or 
citizens in visiting the schools. Teachers are considerably deficient 
as to competency. Discipline generally good. One new school- 
house of ordinary character has been erected during the year by 
private means. We have some good school-houses, and some poor 
ones. The majority of them, however, are comfortable. No 
teachers’ institute has been attempted this year. The lack of suffi- 
cient means to carry on the schools a sufficient length of time, to 
exhibit a marked advancement of the pupils, and to secure a better 
grade of teachers, and pay them promptly, is the leading obstacle 
to the success of the public school system. For lack of this, public 
sentiment, although on the average favorable to public schools, does 
not seem to be increasing, but perhaps flagging.
-P-A-G-E-76

BEDFORD COUNTY. 
Joun R. Dean, Surerinrenpent, Shelbyville. 
The Superintendent reports as follows: “The progress of 
schools, as compared with last year, in every way favorable, ex 
as interfered with by sickness. Enrollment much larger, and a 
age daily attendance would have been much larger, but for 
ness, which prevailed among the children throughout the. w 
county. We have made considerable progress in the way of um 
formity of text books in the county; have four strictly graded 
schools, and all of our schools approximate, more or less, the graded 
system in their organizetion. All of our schools have charts and 
blackboards; no globes. Our Directors have displayed consider- 
able interest in most instances by visiting the schools; so also have 
the parents in some localities. The character of our teachers for 
competency is generally pretty good, sixty or seventy-five per cent. 
of them ranking pretty well. There have been seven new school- 
houses built duting the year, mostly pretty good. _ They were built 
in nearly every instance, I believe, of public and private means 
jointly. Character and condition of our school-houses not as good 
as they ought to be, but probably as good asin most of the counties 
in the State. We have a County Institute which meets twice a 
month. The character of exercises is such as usually obtains 
in well regulated institutes—methods of teaching, with, in some 
cases, class drill. I think it is doing a great deal of good as it is, 
but would favor compulsory attendance on the part of teachers, 
either by making it part of the contract with them, or one of 
the conditions of license. About fifty per cent. of the teachers ~- 
have attended these institutes. We have a colored institute, too, 
for the colored teachers, under the management chiefly of the Prin- 
cipal of the colored school here. The chief obstacle in the way.of 
the progress of the schools is the lack of a little more money, and a 
little more of interest on the part of teachers, directors and people, 
Public sentiment favorable to free schools, and increasing. Diseip- 
line of the schools pretty good. Most of our schools opened latter 
part of July and first of August. The High School and colored 
school at Shelbyville open the first of September. The reason why 
‘ the difference between the number ‘examined’ and the number 
‘licensed,’ in my statistical report, is so small, is that many who
-P-A-G-E-77
81 
were examined, and in the first place rejected, were finally licensed . 
on the recommendation of the parties fur whom they were intend- 
ing to teach, under the rule which allows County Superintendents 
to license in such cases. I would recommend that. this rule be 
changed so as to require parties recommending to certify that not 
only the ‘applicants’ qualifications are sufficient for them,’ etc., but 
that they can get no one more suitable to teach their school. In 
this. way I think that what, in some instances, amounts to a serious 
evil, might be prevented. In addition to this, for the further im- 
provement of the teachers, I would recommend that in future two © 
classes of certificates be adopted—one (the first class) to be good 
for two years—the other (second class) for one year; the first to be 
granted to those who make a general average of eighty-five or 
ninety per cent on all things examined, the second to those who 
make less than eighty-five or ninety per cent., as the case may be, 
and yet make sufficient to entitle them to a certificate; or you 
might carry the distinction a little further, and perhaps with advan- 
tage, too, by adopting three classes of certificates, makitg the first 
as above described, the second to embrace all who fall between 
seventy-five and eighty-five or ninety per cent., and the third to 
“include all who fall between fifty and seventy-five per cent., the last 
two to be good for ore year only. In this way, I think, you would 
do much to stimulate the teachers to a high attainment, and give us 
an efficient means of grading the salaries. In my school work in 
the county, I have attempted to introduce the graded system. 
throughout. I have succeeded very well. Many of my district 
schools are as well graded as the public school in Shelbyville. 
Nearly all of them conform more or less to the graded system in 
their organization. I can see no reason why the graded system 
should not be made practicable in our country schools as well as in 
. those of towns and cities. We cannot have as many teachers, it is 
true—one for each grade—but we can have as many as we have 
now, and we will have more of method and system. Method in 
teaching is everything.” og

BENTON COUNTY. 
J. M. Castine, SUPERINTENDENT, Camden. 
No public schools were opened in this county after the fall of 
1873, until August last, when some good schools were commenced, 
but were very soon compelled to close on account of the general 
prevalence of sickness. No tax has been levied by the County 
Court. 
BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
Tos. O. Brown, SUPERINTENDENT, Robertson’s X Roads. 
The Superintendent makes the following special report : 
“The schools in Bledsoe for 1875 opened in July and August. 
Owing to some uncertainty as to how the school tax, under the new 
assessment law, would compare with the tax of the previous year, 
indeed under strong apprehensions that it would be considerably 
less, many of the schools were closed by orders from the Directors 
sooner than was necessary, as the funds will over pay the teachers. 
As to the progress and efficiency of the schools, as compared 
with those of 1874, they were better, so long as they continued, a 
greater interest being manifested by parents and pupils. There has 
been but little complaint as to a want of uniformity in text books, 
“the same series being used in all of the schools. All of our teach-— 
ers are supplied with blackboards, and some use charts, but I do 
not remember to have seen any globes in any of the schools. Our 
Directors have generally been faithful, and have promptly dis- 
charged their official duties. ‘T'wo-thirds of the teachers are men 
and women of good educational attainments, and have been suc— 
cessfully engaged in teaching for several years. The remainder 
have had but little experience, but have respectable qualifications 
otherwise. One-third of the school-houses are comfortable, and 
well arranged. The remainder are generally very inferior, and 
entirely unfit for schools in the winter. Three new school-houses 
have been erected during the year, two for white schools, built by 
private enterprise, and one for a colored school, built with public 
funds. I atiempted to organize a County Institute in the fall of 
i 
p
-P-A-G-E-79
"83 
1874, but the attendance of the teachers was so small that I was 
‘discouraged. Our teachers have shown some backwardness in at- 
tending and participating in anything like a teachers’ association, 
and I am inclined to believe that most of such backwardness pro- 
ceeds from a want of confidence in their own ability to fill the 
expectation that they imagine exists in the minds of others. I 
shall make as strong an effort as I can to organize an institute next 
spring. I think that when once fairly put in motion, it would soon 
be well attended, and productive of much good. I would not favor 
a compulsory rule, yet I believe that teachers who would stubborn- 
ly refuse to attend well conducted institutes might be justly cen- 
sured. , 
I consider the distrust which exists in the minds of the people as 
to the certainty of the County Courts laying a sufficient school tax 
to run the schools five months in the year, to be one of the leading 
obstacles in the way of sucsess to our public schools. Let it once 
be fully understood that free schools are permanently established, 
and that the means to sustain them will be certain, and the people 
will rally to their support with an interest hitherto unknown in our 
State. With such assurances the public schools, already popular in 
Bledsoe, would soon be ‘universally. appreciated by all her citizens. 
On account of the sparseness of the colored people in our county, 
and the incompetency of the teachers, their schools have effected 
but little good. . : 
The government of our schools has generally been satisfactory, 
and the teachers have been faifhfal in keeping their records, but 
they are entirely too negligent in keepjng themselves posted on the 
educational progress of the country. Very few of them subscribe 
for and read any of the many valuable school journals, which I 
regard as unfavorable to the success of teachers of the present day. 
There are three graded schools of a high order in the county: 
The People’s College, located at Pikeville, under the supervision of 
Prof. J. P. Dickey, who is a graduate of Emory and Henry Col- 
lege. The college building is large, and constructed on one of the 
‘most improved plans of modern architecture. Bledsoe Institute, 
located twelve miles east of Pikeville, with Prof. W. E. Stephens 
as principal, has accomplished great good in that section of the 
valley. Sequatchie College, located eight miles southwest of Pike- 
ville, built in 1861, has, perhaps, educated more young men and 
dae
-P-A-G-E-80
84 
young ladies than any institution in lower East Tennessee. The 
College was accidentally burned in 1873, but was immediately 
rebuilt, which is a fact that speaks well for the energy and public 
spirit of the people of the surrounding country. This institutiom 
was chartered in 1869, and students are allowed to graduate in arm 
English and mathematical course. The study of the languages is. 
optional with the student. A. F. Moore has been President for 
the last nine years. The free schools have been consolidated with 
these institutions for the past three years. 
  
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
W. H. Hewyry, SupeRiIntenvent, Maryville. 
The Superintendent reports: “On taking charge of my office TE 
found, as reported by my predecessor, ‘this county somewhat behind 
as .to school operations.’ Oppressed by other taxes, the County 
Court refused to levy any tax for school purposes, and the people 
had repeatedly voted it down; besides, the money which had accu- 
mulated for several years was all expended during the year just 
closed. Under this gloomy aspect I issued a circular, addressed to 
the Directors and people of the county, and sent it to each neigh~ 
borhood. I then canvassed the county, addressing the people at 
nearly all the school-houses, and visited the citizens at their homes, 
urging them to vote for a school tax, which they did by a hand- 
some majority. I also urged the necessity of building good school— 
houses, and can report eight comfortable buildings erected during- 
the year. With one exception they ,were built by private enter- 
prise. The seventh and tenth districts deserve special mention in 
this particular. A series of teachers’ institutes was next com= 
menced, ia which Professors Collins, Hastings, Sharp and others, 
rendered valuable assistance. I have now the satisfaction to report 
a better class of teachers and more pupils enrolled in the schools 
than at any other time during the history of the county. There 
are, however, yet many difficulties to encounter, which only time 
and labor can remove. 
In compliance with the requirement of the sixth par 
your circular dated October 29th, I respectfully submit th 
ing report : 
      of 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
85 
1st. I regard the progress of the schools in the county as very, 
encouraging, especially in the following particulars, viz: the teach- 
ers are of a higher grade of scholarship, the pupils are more regu- 
lar in attendance, the patrons manifest a deeper interest in the 
schools. 
2d. In some of our schools there is a uniform system of. text 
books in use, and in many others we are approximating to uniform- 
ity, gradually, as we can supply the books and induce the patrons 
to buy them. 
3d. There are four graded schools in the county. 
4th. Only the graded schools have charts and globes, but all, or 
“nearly so, have blackboards. 
5th. In some of the districts the Directors haye shown consid- 
erable interest by visiting the schools, but a majority of the Direc- 
tors have not yet shown much interest in the discharge of this 
important duty ; the patrons have not yet exhibited much interest 
in this respect ; many of them do not seem to understand that it is 
their privilege and duty to encourage teacher and pupils by fre- 
quent visits to the schools. 
6th. There is still considerable deficiency in the character of 
many of our teachers as to competency, although there has been 
great improvement within the past year, perhaps fifty per cent. are 
deficient, and a much greater per cent. lack a thorough training for 
the work. . 
7th. There have been nine school-houses erected in the county 
during the past year; seven of them are substantial, commodious 
. and convenient; three of them are supplied with desks, black- 
boards, etc.; all were erected by private means, except in one 
instance a part of the school fund was used to complete the house, 
and the school has been supplemented by subscription by.an amount 
much larger than the amount of school funds used in building ; the 
school-houses in the county are of an inferior character; there have 
been several new houses projected lately, some are now in course of 
erection. I hope next year to be able to report twenty new houses 
in addition to those herein reported. 
T established a county institute in June last, which met once a 
week for four weeks in different districts—when I took billious
-P-A-G-E-82
86 
fever, and have not yet recovered from the attack sufficiently to- 
resume that part of my work ; my deputy, and others in the county, 
competent to render aid, have been encumbered with private busi- 
ness, so that I could not expect them to assume the entire control 
of the Institute. I hope, however, to re-establish our Coynty 
Institute during the Christmas holidays. There was only a small 
per cent. of our teachers who attended regularly, but there has 
been an increased interest among teachers in regard to the Institute.. 
Our exercises were conducted after the manner of a school in ses~- 
sion; classes being formed in the different branches of study, a 
competent professor assigned to conduct the exercise in each of 
them, and illustrate practically his method of teaching; it has cer- 
tainly been of great advantage to those teachers who attended. I 
am decidedly of the opinion that every teacher of public schools 
should be required to attend these institutes. 
- 9th. There are yet many obstacles to the success of the public 
schools in this county, some of which are, a want of comfortable 
houses, a lack of competent teachers, the great want of a uniform 
system of text books; the school Jaw prohibits school officers from 
handling school books, and there is no inducement to business men: 
to take an agency of that kind. 
10th. There is at least a respectable portion of the citizens of the 
county who lack confidence, not so much in our public school sys- 
tem as in the management of it by the school officers. It, however, 
affords me pleasure to state that such a lack of confidence is disap- 
pearing, and the interest in favor of free schools is increasing. 
ith. On account of protracted illness I have not visited many 
of our schools personally, but from inquiry, written and oral, T 
conclude that the discipline in the schools is better than has been. 
common in the county. I am also satisfied that most of the-teach- 
ers—if not all—are keeping daily registers. School-houses tol- 
erably comfortable. 
12th. The schools in the county opened generally during the. 
month of September.
-P-A-G-E-83
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
W. 8S. Care, SUPERINTENDENT, Chatata. 
Under date of December 1, 1875, the Superintendent writes : 
1. “I think the schools of 1875 are some better than the schools 
of 1874, though perhaps the average length will not be quite so 
great. The teachers of 1875 are of a better grade in some respect 
than those of 1874. 
2. I have recommended a uniform course of text-books, but 
little has been done towards a general introduction. 
3. There are six graded schools in the county. 
4. Sixteen schools have blackboards, and five schools have globes. 
5. Some Directors have visited the schools, while others give but 
little attention to them. In some localities the citizens have ex- 
hibited an interest in the schools, but in a majority of cases they 
give but little attention to them. 
6. The character of competency of the teachers is, with few ex- 
ceptions, good, except in theory of teaching. About five per cent. 
_of the teachers of white schools I consider deficient. Of the teach- 
ers of colored schools, at least eighty-five per cent. are deficient in 
qualifications. 
7. I know of no new school-houses. There are fourteen good 
houses in the county; some of the others are ordinary, while a 
number are very indifferent. 
8. No institute this year. I would ‘favor a rule enforcing a 
compulsory attendance at these institutes, upon teachers.’ Attend- . 
ance last year ten per cent. 
9, Theleading obstacle to the success of the schools is, a more 
direct controlling power in the hands of the Superintendent, and 
efficient district Directors. I say this on the supposition that the 
present is the best law. 
10. Public sentiment is favorable to free schools, and is, IT think, 
on the increase. 
11. The County Court has notified me that they do not expect: 
me to visit schools, and that they will not pay a Superintendent to 
do so.
-P-A-G-E-84
88 
       
   
  12. Schools have-generally opened this year on the first Monday 
in August. 
In addition to the above, I. would state that Chatata Seminary 
one of the graded schools, has a nucleus for a library, in which 3 
the Teachers’ Library, published by Barnes & Co., which is is acce 
ible to the teachers of the county. 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
Frank RicHarpson, SUPERINTENDENT, Fincastle. 
No written report has been received from the Superintendent. 
His statistical report shows the schools to be in a satisfactory com— 
dition. Thirty-eight schcols—thirty-seven white and one colored 
were in session during the year, employing forty-one teachers, 
the average number of months taught being three and one-third. 
The suspension of the collection of taxes by the Legislature affected 
the schools in this county quite seriously, 
. 
CANNON COUNTY. 
A. G. Branpon, SUPERINTENDENT, Readyviile. 
The Superintendent reports $977.46 due to teachers, which was 
caused by the suspension of the payment of taxes by the Legisla~ 
ture, which action, he says, “has and will continue to result. im 
evil, not only to teachers, but to the people generally.” The pub- 
lic schools were all in operation, and no private schools were 
opened in the county during the year. The progress and success 
of the schools were better than last year. Little or no progress has 
~ been made towards uniformity in text-books, the people being slow 
to lay aside their old worn out books and buy new ones. There is 
not a graded school in the county, and none of the schools hawe 
globes or charts. About one-half have blackboards. Directors 
have shown considerable interest in the schools, but parents“ and 
citizens have exhibited but little. There is considerable deficiency
-P-A-G-E-85
89 
in the competency of teachers. There is no institute in the county. 
School-houses mostly inferior in character; two new ones were 
erected the past year. The leading obstacles to the success of the 
public schools in this county are poor school-houses and the non- 
attendance of the students, or rather those who ought to be stu- 
dents. About one-third of those who are entitled to the benefit of 
the schools never enter them. Public sentiment is favorable to the 
schools, but this feeling, it is feared, is decreasing. Schools opened 
the last of July and first of August. 
CARROLL COUNTY. 
A. F. Esves, SUPERINTENDENT, Huntingdon. 
The Superintendent accompanies his statistical report with the 
following remarks: “But little has beén done in this county du- 
ring the year just closed in regard to public schools. In view of 
the fact that a proposition to levy a tax on the county for school 
purposes had been voted down on two occasions, our County Court 
declined, at least failed, to submit the question to a vote. It has 
been a matter of considerable difficulty to get the school officers to 
do their duty. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
H. C. Boyp, SuperintenpDENT, Carter’s Depot. 
A large proportion of the school money credited to this county 
in the statistical report is raiséd from the levy of one mill on the 
dollar made by the State, the only county tax for schvul purposes 
being fifty cents on’polls, which yielded $550.00. The number of 
pupils enrolled in the schools and in attendance shows an increase 
over former years, Nearly a uniform system of text-books has 
been adopted, and two graded schools established. Very little in- 
terest is exhibited by Directors and citizens in the schools, which is 
a matter of serious regret on the part of the Superintendent. The
-P-A-G-E-86
90 
character for competency of the teachers is above medium, and the 
discipline of the schools good. A few school-houses have been 
erected during the past year from the School Fund, but the condi-— 
tion of the houses is not as good as it should be. A meeting was 
called in December for the purpose of organizing a County Insti- 
tute; and the Superintendent is in favor of a rule enforcing the 
attendance of teachers upon its meetings when organized. The 
want of funds to carry on the schools for at least five months in 
the year is the great obstacle to the success of the schools. Schools 
open in September and October. 
CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
Grorce F. Murrr, Surerinrenpent, Ashland City. 
No public schools were opened in this county during the past 
year. The school money received was used in the payment of 
teachers for 1874. The County Court refused to levy a tax for 
school purposes, and there is no interest manifested in the county 
upon the subject. A few private schools were commenced, but 
were soon discontinued, on account of the scarcity of money. 
“CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
J. A. Irwin, SUPERINTENDENT, Tazewell. 
Public schools in this county, as compared with last year, speak 
very favorably. They were kept open only two months, for lack of 
means. The County Court refuses to levy any tax for school pur- 
poses, and the entire dependence of the people for the means of 
education is upon the funds derived from the State. The Superin~ 
tendent says that if the county would furnish a sum equal to that 
furnished by the State, the schools could be kept open five months 
in the year, and hopes the Legislature will pass a law compelling 
the counties to do so. A uniform system of text-books was recom- 
mended by a committee in December. There are no graded schools © 
in the county, and none of the schools have charts or globes, and
-P-A-G-E-87
91 
but few have blackboards. Directors and citizens do not take that 
interest in the schools they should. Great need of competent 
teachers is felt. There are some well qualified teachers, and all the 
teachers are men and women of good natural ability, but need 
training in the art of teaching. The discipline in the schools ‘is 
generally good. Several school-houses have been erected during 
the past year, mostly by private means; only one being built out 
of the public funds. There is no Teacher’s Institute in the county, 
but an effort will be made to establish one. The absence of enter- 
prising educational spirit in the people, and the lack of sufficient 
means, are regarded as the leading obstacles in the way of the 
public schools. The public sentiment is about equally divided as 
to public schools, the sentiment in favor of ‘the system being on the 
increase.. It has been the aim to open the schools on the first 
Monday in August, but in consequence of the difficulty of procur- 
ing teachers, the instructions were not complied with in full. There 
are no private schools in the county. 
CLAY COUNTY. 
GrorcE W. Sreeuens, SUPERINTENDENT, Celina. 
For the number of schools opened, the progress is fully up to 
that of last year. Some progress has been made towards a uni- 
formity of text-books. No graded schools in the county. All the 
schools have blackboards, with but one exception, none have charts 
or globes. Parents and citizens exhibit some interest by visiting 
the schools, but Directors are much too negligent on this score. 
The discipline in most of the schools is good. There is consider- 
erable deficiency in the competency of teachers, at least twenty- 
five per cent. being deficient in qualifications. Two school-houses 
were erected during the year, partly by private and partly public 
means. There are some good school-houses in the county, but the 
majority of them are inferior, Want of good teachers, deficiency of 
means, and neglect of parents to see ‘that their children attend, are 
regarded as the principal drawbacks to the success of the schools. 
A majority of the people are favorable to the ‘schools, and this 
sentinient is increasing slowly.

COCKE COUNTY. 
W. H. Suerrey, SuPERINTENDENT, Newport. 
Several of the districts in the county went recklessly in debt 
during the years. 1873 and 1875. The Superintendent writes that 
the number of schools would have been double the number reported 
if it had not been for. this fact. The debts have been gradually 
paid off, and schools will be opened in every district the coming 
year. The Superintendent writes, October 4, 1875: “Inu my 
visits to the schools, I find the mode of teaching much better than 
that of former years; but one spectacle still presents itself{—the old 
log school houses, with no blackbvards, desks or school furniture of 
any kind, to interest and attract the young. I fear this will long 
be the case unless the School Directors and people take more in- 
terest in the public schools. It would be safe to say that not more 
than one-fourth of our scholastic population is in attendance on our 
public schools. I have often thought that if our law was more 
compulsory in its nature it would be much for the benefit of a 
portion of our people. The out-door work done by the Superin- 
tendent will necessarily be small under his limited salary of one 
hundred and fifty dollars. The county has levied no tax for school 
purposes, neither on polls, property or privileges.” 
COFFEE COUNTY. 
T. J. Witson, Surrrintenpent, Manchester. 
No report of school operations in this county has been received. 
Schools were in session a portion of the year, but no statistics could 
be obtained, owing to the failure of Directors to perform the duties 
required of them by law. At the January (1876) term of the 
County Court, Prof. T. J. Wilson was elected County Superintend- 
ent, and the following extracts from a letter of his, dated January 
8th, will best explain the condition of matters in the county : 
“The County Court, on Monday last, elected me Superintendent 
of Public Instruction for Coffee county, and I have agreed to serve 
upon condition that, at the next Quarterly Court, a reasonable sal 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
93 
ary shall be allowed me. In the meantime I have entered upon 
the discharge of my duties, and shall strive to put our school mat- 
ters in better shape than they are at present. My predecessor, 
Prof. Parker, from the fact that he lived remote from the county 
seat, and had all his time occupied in the school-room, did not, and 
could not give his attention to the duties of the position—and he is . 
to be excused in some degree for his failure. The County Court 
elected him, in the face of his protestation that without an adequate 
salary he could do no more than examine applicants, and would not 
promise to perform the duties of the office farther. He was dis- 
tinctly told by the County Court that. the only use they had for a 
Superintendent was to examine teachers, and the fee allowed was 
all he must expect. So, feeling under no obligation, and being con- 
fined to his other duties, he did not give his attention to the duties 
devolving on him as County Superintendent. 
Now that the duties are imposed upon me, I intend to try to put 
a little more interest into the matter, intend to try to get our Court 
to vote a county tax for school purposes, and to do better generally. 
To this end I have called a meeting of all the Directors of the 
county, at Manchester, on the 29th inst., and shall try to stir up 
greater interest in our public schools, so as to make them, even 
here in Coffee, what they ‘are intended to be. Prof. Parker tells 
me that he was unable to make his annual report because of the 
delinquency of the Directors. This I know to be so, having acted 
ag his deputy to report the scholastic population, as a matter of 
-kindness to him.” : 
’ CROCKETT COUNTY. 
J. P. Parker, SUPERINTENDENT, Bell’s Depot. 
All the drawbacks considered, the success of the schools was 
quite satisfactory. Sickness interfered considerably with the schools 
during the summer. Some of the districts had effectually crippled 
their school interests this year by continuing the schools too long 
the year previous, thereby incurring liabilities to teachers. A uni- 
form. series of text-books has been recommended, and whenever 
new books are needed, those recommended are purchased. Yet the 
t
-P-A-G-E-90
94 
books used in the schools are various, as most families have a sup- 
ply of old books on hand. Uniformity does not seem practicable 
until the State furnishes the books for the public schools. There 
are no graded public schools in the county, and none have charts or 
globes. About two-thirds have blackboards. Comparatively 
little interest is shown by Directors, parents and citizens in visiting 
schools. Most of the teachers have sufficient knowledge, but are 
wanting in ability to impart what they know, to the pupils’ All of 
them would be very greatly improved by a short course ins the 
Normal School. No new school-houses have been erected this year, 
and most of those in use are not sufficiently comfortable to teach in 
during the winter. The discipline in the schools is generally good. 
There is no regular period for opening the schools, and they are 
commenced at various times during the year. The lack of suffi- 
cient means to run the schools five months in the year is regarded 
as the chief obstacle in the way of their success. The county levies 
no additional tax to support the schools, on account principally of 
an onerous court-house tax which is now upon them. 
CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
Tuomas C. Center, SUPERINTENDENT, Crossville. 
‘Schools were opened about the Ist-.of August, and their progress 
and success equal, if not ahead, of last year. Entire uniformity in 
text-books has been established. There are no graded schools, and 
none of the schools have charts or globes, but nearly all are sup~ 
plied with blackboards. But little interest has been shown by 
Directors and parents in visiting the schools. ‘Teachers are. tol- 
erably well qualified for their calling, and the discipline in the 
schools is good. The school-houses are not comfortable, and im- 
provement in this regard is hoped for. The people are becoming: 
alive to the importance of good schools, and public sentiment is. 
favorable towards the system, and this sentiment is increasing in 
the community. ‘
-P-A-G-E-91

DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
R. W. WEAKLEY, SUPERINTENDENT, Nashville. 
The Superintendent makes the following full and interesting 
report: “In commenting upon the status of the public schools of 
this county, I confine myself to that of the county districts, as 
coming under my immediate supervision, referring you for inform- 
ation in regard to the public schools of Nashville to the report of 
Superintendent S. Y. Caldwell, and for information concerning the 
public schools of Edgefield, to the report of Superintendent W. P. 
Marks. 
As compared with our condition last ‘year, I have no marked 
improvement to report. Our schools having been in operation for 
several years, our progress must necessarily be gradual. 
Previous to the adoption of the present school law, in 1873, the. 
schools of this county were in full blast, with rales and regulations 
prescribed by a County Board of Education, and a course of study 
uniform throughout every district. Since the present Jaw has been 
in operation this uniformity has been invaded by a multitudinous 
host of text-books that had long Jain upon dusty shelves, and in 
many instances serious inroads have been made, and in this regard 
I believe our former state better than our present state. County 
Superintendents are especially instructed by law “to suggest such 
changes as may from time to time be advisable, with a view to 
securing uniformity in the course of study throughout the county ;” 
but suggesting will not do, and I undertake to say that with school 
distriets acting as they now do, in an individual capacity, uniform- 
ity cannot be secured or maintained in any county of the State. 
False ideas of economy and a time-serving policy will prevail 
through an isolated district system—the section above quoted from 
becomes a dead Jetter, and our school interests will be void of that 
effectiveness thut comes from unity of purpose and of action. 
Suffice it, to say, in my humble judgment, county unity is greatly 
to be desired, and to this end County Boards of Education should 
be legalized and empowered to legislate for the schools of the 
county, with the County Superintendent an ex-officio member and 
- executive officer. 
In the distric:, adjoining the city of Nashville, where the popu- 
lation is sufficiently dense, graded schools have been established,
-P-A-G-E-92
96 
and elegant schoo]-houses have been erected—models of architec 
ture in their line, and finished with desks and other modern schoo 
appliances ; and in this connection I would mention Watkins’ Sena 
inary, situated in the 13th district, and Thompson’s Seminary, 1) 
the 16th district. In the town of Goodlettsville, situated in the| 
20th district, graded schools have been maintained for several 
years, and conducted with much success. 
In all of our schools can be found blackboards, and in many, wall 
maps and good modern desks, ete.; but few schools that I hawe 
visited are properly furnished with those indispensable aids to good. 
teaching, such as globes, charts, numeral frames, etc. I have from 
time to time made proper suggestions to the “powers that be,?” 
with reference to these things, but from lack of funds in many 
cases, and apathy in others, we are yet behind in this regard. 
Many Directors are characterized by zeal and fidelity in the dis~ 
charge of the functions of their office—many make school interests 
secondary and subordinate, entrusting to the teachers the whole 
management of affairs, while they are engrossed in their private 
business. Under the provisions of vur law this office is one off 
potency, and should be filled by the wisest and best men of the 
community. , 
On the part of parents and citizens remarkable apathy obtained > 
and has obtained—since 1 first saw a school-house—in regard to 
visiting: schools, and stimulating teachers and pupils with their 
presence. ‘Trne, spasmodic interest can be awakened by school 
exhibitions, etc., and the house “ filled to repletion,” but every-day 
practical interest is Jacking in this country, and in every other por— 
tion of our country that it has been my fortune to visit. 
We have many good teachers, some not so good, and others of @ 
still lower grade. An average of 5 to 7 entitles the applicant to a 
certificate of the third order; of 7 to 8} of the second order, an@ 
8} or more of the first order. Though good teachers are not ag 
* numerous as desired, still we have not felt great deficiency in. thig 
direction. I have been. fortunate in securing competent teachers 
for the colored schools, from Fisk University and Central Tennessee 
College, and to these institutions I desire to express this indebte@— 
ness, and commend their pupils to the favorable consideration of 
school officers needing teachers in the colored schools.

Two new houses have been erected during the scholastic year, 
one of which was built by an academy fund, and is an excellent 
building, in which is now being taught a “consolidated school,” 
the other a substantial frame house, built with materials bought by 
public funds of the district, the citizens raising the building after 
the manner of an old-fashioned “ house raising.” 
Having a large county to traverse, and many schools to. visit, I 
have led the life of an itinerant, endeavoring to visit each school 
during the term of five months, and each district twice a year. 
My plan is to stay at least three hours at a school, inspect the teach- . 
er’s register, note carefully the: methods of instruction, observe 
closely the discipline. Sometimes assuming the teacher’s position 
and conducting the recitations, after a manner intended as a model 
for the teacher. In fine, striving by word and example to lift 
methods of teaching and of discipline from the lower and mechani- 
cal to a higher and intellectual plane. 
Ihave generally found the schools well ordered, and the pupils 
respectful and attentive. Sometimes the reverse of this is the case, 
and have invariably delivered short lectures of commendation in 
the one and of condemnation in the other. 
Ihave recommended to Directors the plan of assembling’ a ta 
designated school the other teachers of the district, and the pupils, 
too, when practicable, so that in the light of contrast each teacher 
and each school could determine its status, thus begetting a gen- 
erous rivalry which invatiably eventuates in good. This plan has 
been adopted in some instances with success. 
I have not adopted a more enlarged plan than this, nor estab- 
lished a County Institute. I would prefer for the present a series _ 
of institutes analogous to what are called in some States, Town- 
ship Institutes, and propose during this scholastic year to divide 
this county into sub-divisions, in which I will hold institutes, and 
insist upon the attendance of not only teachers, but school directors 
and citizens generally. I think some system for holding institutes 
should be provided by law, and attendance on the part of teachers 
made compulsory. 
The first Monday in September is the time prescribed for open- 
ing the schools, and upon that day most of the schools began. We 
have two terms—the first ending the last Friday in January, and 
the second the third Friday in June; but when, in the opinion of
-P-A-G-E-94
we the Directors of a district, the interests of a majority of the patrons 
require it, these prescribed terms are changed. 
. In some districts schools are continued for the two terms, in 
other districts about one term and half the next, and in a few dis- 
tricts one term only. 
In my visitations I found irregularities in the school fund of one 
district, and took measures for the proper adjustment of the same. 
I feel that our school interests would be enhanced in this county 
by the establishment of a Board of Education. Through this 
instrumentality I believe every adjunct would be supplied to the 
‘mechanism of the system, and a proper amount of steam to run it. 
Such Boards, composed of the three Directors from each district 
would be too bulky, and I would suggest as an outline, that all the 
Directors: meet in convention once a year,.and elect from this num— 
ber three or five as an ‘‘ Executive Board,” to whose guidance and. 
control should be committed the educational interests of the county, 
with power to call the parent Board together to ratify and adopt 
such regulations as they may have adopted, which regulations, 
when so ratified, to be enforced through the County Superintendent 
as executive officer and general supervisor.

“No detailed written report has been received from this county, 
but the statistical report of the Superintendent shows the schools to 
be in excellent condition. The following remarks by the Superin- 
tendent accompany his report; “ By reference to the journal of 
the last General Assembly you will observe that Dickson was one 
of the counties in which there was a failure of crops from drouth. 
The Ex-Revenue Collector failed, and the school fund coming 
through him has not been realized, but the judgment against his 
sureties will be collected. None of: the school districts owe large 
amounts; most of them have small balances on hand, and all of 
them can liquidate the entire indebtedness with the means now due 
from the State, in¢luding the Spencer T. Hunt fund, for which” 
there has been no warrant received by the County Trustee for this 
year.”

The progress of the schools in this county, as compared with last 
year, is much better. Some progress has been made towards uni- 
formity in text-books. One. graded school has ‘been established, 
and many of the schools are furnished with charts, globes and 
blackboards. Much interest has been manifested by Directors and - 
citizens in visiting the schools. Many of the teachers are somewhat 
deficient in qualification, but are generally. able to teach the 
branches required. Some new school-houses have been erected, 
and others repaired. This has been done partly by public and 
partly by private means. About half the houses are in comfortable 
condition, while the other half are in sorry plight; but the people 
say they must repair the old and build new ones, and this sentiment 
will soon result in making all the school-houses comfortable. ‘The

Superintendent has established a County Institute, which holds 
monthly meetings during the time the schools are in session. The 
exercises consist of speaking, reading compositions, and lessons in 
orthography, reading, arithmetic, grammar, etc. The slowness of 
tax collectors in collecting and paying over the school moneys, and. 
the delay in realizing on the warrants issued by the Comptroller for 
the interest on the school fund, are regarded as the leading obstacles 
in the way of the full success of the public school system in this 
county. The sentiment in favor of the schools is growing stronger. 
The discipline in the schools is reported as excellent. Schools 
opened in July’ lant ‘Avigust. 
The Superintendent accompanies his report with the following 
remarks: 
“The receipts and disbirssments of school moneys have been 
light, owing to thie! actiow of the last General Assembly suspending 
the collection of taxes. Weyl hold State warrants, on which the 
money has not been paid, and the amount collected on the county 
levy for'1873 has not all Been paid over, while the tax on polls and 
property for 1874 is mostly unpaid; but when all is collected and 
disbursed, our whole indebtedness for the schools for those years. 
will be discharged. Our schools are now in operation upon the 
money derived from the taxes of 1874, and-are doing well. I have 
a good set of school Directors, and they are doing much better than 
at any time heretofore. 
DYER COUNTY. 
Wx. Harrison, SupERINTENDENT, Dyersburg. 
In consequence of the great amount of sickness prevalent in this 
county during four months of the summer and autumn, the public 
schools were in many instances suspended. This condition of 
health applied as well to teachers as to pupils. There is a growing 
interest manifested by the people in the success of the schools, 
which is highly gratifying to every friend of the cause of: ‘popular . 
education, and which cannot fail eventually to insure their perfect 
success. The Superintendent writes, November 23, 1875: 
“In accordance with request conveyed in your circula 
ult., T annex answers to the questions contained therein, | 
, convenience sake, do so categorically :   
-P-A-G-E-97
101 
1. The progress of the schools in this county is, in the highest 
degree satisfactory. During the last year, although sickness pre- 
vailed to an alarming extent, yet the interest in the system has 
materially increased, and I can report a very favorable advance- 
ment in their usefulness. 
2. A series of books was adopted by my predecessor in office, 
and those books are now in general use throughout the county. 
3. None of the schools in this county are graded. 
4. Some five or six of the schools are supplied with charts and 
globes, while every school is supplied with a blackboard. 
5. Ihave to report that the Directors of the several districts 
have exhibited an interest in the success of their schools, which, to 
say the least of it, is very gratifying. ' 
6. I have no reason to complain of the incompetency of teachers. 
In some cases, it is true, I have been under the necessity of em- 
ploying teachers who, though not actually incompetent, are yet not 
exactly of the calibre I would select were 1 in a position to do so. 
7. Three new school-houses have been erected during the past 
year by private funds or public subscription. 
8. A County Institute exists, but owing to sickness, and a year of 
general discouragement, it has not been regularly attended. I 
would be disinclined to favor compulsory attendance, firstly, be- 
cause the teachers of this county divide their labors between this 
and the counties adjoining, and hence their inability to attend the 
sessions regularly ; and secondly, because the area of the county, 
and the consequent distance to be traveled over by many of. the 
teachers, would not admit of that regularity of attendance so essen- 
tial to the welfare of an institute. 
9. The uncertainty of the levy by the County Court of a tax for 
school purposes, and the consequent unstable character of the 
resources on which the schools are dependent, I find, are the great 
‘obstacles to the success of the schools. 
10, The public sentiment is in favor of the system, and this sen- 
timent is yearly increasing. 
_ 11. In my inspection I have found the discipline good and the 
registers well kept by the teachers. With one or two exceptions I 
have found the school-houses comfortable and in good repair.

12. The schools generally open immediately after cotton planting, 
and continue until the maturity of the crop, when they are closed. 
They aré opened about the middle of November, and continue in 
operation as long as the funds will permit. 
13. There has been no misappropriation of funds by treasurers im 
this county. 
  
FAYETTE COUNTY.: 
R. W. Prrman, SUPERINTENDENT, Somerville. 
There is a tharked increase of interest manifested in the public 
schools of the county, but the fund has been too small to continue 
the schools beyond two and a half months during the year. There- 
is considerable opposition to any additional tax for school purposes, 
yet a general desire to prolong the schools. The Superintendent 
says: “‘ We have suffered a ruinous discount upon our State war-. - 
rants, having been forced to se]l at about seventy-five cents on the. 
dollar. This loss should be remedied by the proper , authorities. 
Our system must acknowledge that ‘money is power’ as well as. 
knowledge.” : 
  
FENTRESS COUNTY. 
SrerHen H. Pine, SuperRINtENDENT, Pall Mall. 
The Superintendent, under date of September 28th, 1875, writes = 
“This county has failed to levy any school tax for three years. 
We got in debt for schools taught in 1873, and are not out of debt - 
. at this date, on account of the failure of the proper officers to col- 
lect. The one-mill tax for school purposes, levied by the State, has. 
not been collected for two years. We have about twelve subscrip- 
tion schools in the county, but no free schools.” 
  
FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
W. G. Hampton, SUPERINTENDENT, Cowan. 
A number of the schools in this county were continued too long 
last year, and some of the districts are in debt in consequence. By 
advice of the Superintendent, schools were discontinued in districts: .   
-P-A-G-E-99
103 
which were in debt, until they could pay out. The schools which 
were taught gave general satisfaction, and the people are becoming 
more interested in the subject of public education. One graded 
school has been established, and a few of the schools have charts, 
and all of them are furnished with blackboards.. Directors have 
shown more interest than usual in visiting the schools, but parents 
and citizens manifest but little interest in this way. Twenty-five 
per cent. of the teachers are deficient in their profession. One 
frame school-house, 40x22, has been erected during the year. The 
houses generally are very: indifferent, and a majority of them 
wholly unfit for use in winter. No Teachers’ Institute was held 
this year, but it was proposed’ to organize one in December. The 
schools are opened at different periods of the year, owing to the

GIBSON COUNTY. 
W. C. Ovrver, SUPERINTENDENT, Rutherford Station. 
There have been no public schools in this county for the past 
year, having been suspended on account of indebtedness incurred 
by keeping the schools open for a continuous period of six and a 
half months The present Superintendent writes that on taking 
charge of the office on the 31st day of March, 1875, he found both 
Directors and teachers demoralized, and many of them opposed to 
thé public school system. The schools had been kept ‘open six 
months and a half, and the debt incurred on account of the same 
amounted to over eighteen thousand dollars, to which had been 
added over seven thousand dollars by a few weeks of schools, in 
the autumn of 1874, which were nevér reported, the schools having 
suddenly closed because of the discovery of the immense indebtéd- 
_ hess outstanding. On account of the suspension of the collection’ - 
of taxes by the Legislature, no money was received until the fall 
of 1875. The amount received up to the closing of the statistical 
report of the Superintendent--$10,588 95—was all used in the 
_ payment of the debt of the school year ending August 3ist, 1875. 
The Superintendent reports, November, 1875: .“I have sug-
-P-A-G-E-100

gested the use of series of text-books, which I hope will be adopted. 
Our schools are generally supplied with blackboards, but few with 
globes or charts. We have but few competent teachers—there is 
great deficiency, fully fifty per cent. I have not yet established a 
County Institute. When established, I would favor a rule en- 
forcing compulsory attendance upon teachers. The greatest ob- 
stacle to the success of public schools is the want of sufficient 
funds. Public sentiment is growing in favor of free schools, and I 
think if the subject of levying a school tax is left to the people, a 
large majority will favor the levy of a larger tax than we have had 
heretofore. Our debt, on account of public schools, is yet unpaid. 
"We will have few schools in operation this winter.” 
GILES COUNTY. 
R. P. Yancry, SuPERINTENDENT, Pulaski. 
The County Court and the people both failed to levy an addi- 
tional tax for the support of schools The Court, in conformity to 
law, referred the question to the people, who voted against levying 
atax. This, it is believed, was owing in a great measure to the 
“hard times.” Owing to the want of funds caused by this action, 
the schools were of shorter duration than heretofore. Some of the 
districts decided not to open schools during the summer and fall as 
usual, so as to have more means next year. Everything consid~ 
ered, the schools have done very well. There are no graded 
schools. Nearly all the schools are furnished with blackboards, 
and some have charts. Considerable interest is shown by a portion 
of the Directors in visiting the schools, but parents and citizens do 
not exhibit the interest they should in the schools. The teachers, 
as a class, are competent, and there are more applicants than-there 
are positions to fill, The discipline in the schools is very good. 
Two good frame school-houses were erected during the year from 
the public funds. Quite a number of the ‘houses are commodious 
and comfortable, but some are in bad condition. There is no. 
Instifute, but the Superintendent contemplates the organization of 
one in each district. The sentiment of the people generally is not 
in favor of public schools. There are quite a number of. good.

private schools in the county, and the tendency of the public schools 
is to break them down, or to so cripple them that they are not 
generally doing so well as heretofore. The Superintendent thinks 
that if power were given in the law to appropriate the public 
money in aid of private schools in certain cases, and under certain 
restrictions, there would be but little opposition to levying a school 
tax. Schools generally open in the months of July and August.

The Superintendent says: ‘The present system is more satis- 
factory to the friends of common school education than any system 
within the last decade of years. The increasing interest in the 
cause is manifest in public expression, and the appreciation of the 
results is shown by the earnest and laudable efforts of many of the 
prominent and reliable citizens to promulgate the almost inesti- 
mable gift of free and universal intelligence. We trust a fair and 
prosperous dawn is breaking upon this great and noble work.” 
GRUNDY COUNTY. 
Joun Scruces, SUPERINTENDENT, Tracy City. 
There were but two small public schools in the county during 
the first half of the scholastic year, the public money being used to 
liquidate indebtedness incurred the previons vear. The seventeen 
schools reported in the statistical tables were commenced during 
the latter part of the year, and are in a healthy condition; public 
sentiment is favorable to free education, and the schools are under 
good management, and promise to grow in favor and usefulness.

HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
H. M. Suerwoop, SUPERINTENDENT, Whitesburg. 
October 1, 1875, the Superintendent reported: “The schools of 
this county are now in a flourishing condition. Some have funds 
on hand with which to commence operations this year, while others 
are somewhat in debt. A considerable amount of the school tax is 
yet uncollected, enough to pay off every indebtedness, and leave us 
something over. Public opinion is decidedly in favor of the public 
schools, and I think that if we can carry them successfully on this 
year, we shall have nothing more to fear from opposition.” 
December, 1875, the Superintendent says: ‘The schools are 
more successful than heretofore, for several reasons. We have more 
money, our teachers have had. better advantages in the way of 
Institutes, and the people are manifesting more interest. We hawe 
done very little toward uniformity of text-books, though I thinl: 
we will be able to arrive soon at something like uniformity. We 
have now no graded schools in the county. There are charts in 
about half the schools of the county, blackboards in nearly all, but 
no globes. The Directors in some of the districts have shown con— 
siderable interest by visiting the schools, but in most of the dis— 
tricts this has not been the case. It is very hard to convince the 
people they can do any good by visiting the schools. There are a 
few excellent teachers in this county, about half very good, the 
rest are deficient. There has been but one school-house erected im 
the county during the year, and that is a very poor one. It was 
erected by means from the school fund. Most of the schoo]— 
houses are too small, and only a few are in first-rate condition. We 
have a County Institute, and have found it highly profitable to 
teachers. About half the teachers attend. I would favor a rule 
enforcing attendance. We have no stated times to meet; it being: 
fixed at each meeting where and when we shall meet again. I re- 
gard a lack of thoroughly competent teachers for all the schools as 
the leading obstacle to the success of schools in this county. 
Public sentiment is decidedly in favor of public schools in this 
county, and the sentiment is increasing. I have found the diseip-— 
line tolerably good. I have found very few registers in the schoo]- 
room, the teachers generally saying they thought it best, in order to 
heep the register neat, to keep a rough in the school-room, and tran~
-P-A-G-E-103
107 
scribe at leisure. I have urged the teachers to keep their registers 
in the school room, and to mark directly in them, thinking that the 
surest plan to get a correct record of what is done. I have also 
requested them to show on their registers the number of times they 
are visited during each month by the Directors or others. Our 
schools opened in July and August. I have heard of no defalea- 
tions on the part of treasurers.” 
HAMILTON COUNTY. 
W. M. Buenn, SurerinrenDENT, Sale Creek. 
The following is the special’ report of the Superintendent made 
November 26th, 1875: : 
“Tn the rural districts of the county there are but twelve public 
schools this year. They have, as a general thing, been supplied 
with a better grade of teachers than they were last year, and have 
consequently been more successful. They were well attended up 
to the time of year for taking fodder, after which the decrease in 
attendance has been at least fifty per cent. 
I have thought it best to make haste slowly in recommending 
text-books, preferring to inform myself thoroughly as to the wants 
of the schools, and grade of text-books required.. I have recom- 
mended a series of grammars and readers, and.will at an early day 
recommend text-books on all the sciences required to be taught in 
our common schools. In visiting the schools I found some of the 
teachers laboring under considerable embarrassment from want of 
uniformity of text-books. Every effort possible will be made to 
obviate this difficulty next year. 
Pleasant Grove Academy, at Tyner, is the only graded public 
school in the county. It is supplied- with charts, globes, black- 
boards, and all other necessary apparatus, and doing a good work. 
Some of the other public schools of the county are supplied with 
blackboards; none with charts and globes. 
Directors, as a general thing, are to be commended for their 
punctual visitations upon the schools. Parents and citizens are 
taking less interest in that direction than they should. If teach- 
ers would introduce monthly reviews in their schools, and use the
-P-A-G-E-104
108 
    proper efforts to induce parents to attend on such occasions, it 
confidently believed that they would soon take a lively interest, 
and, as a consequence, our schools would be much better attended. 
Of the twelve teachers employed this year, but one has had the 
advantage of practical drilling in the theory and practice of teach—- 
ing, in a Normal School. The others have had no special training 
for the profession. The average grade of those employed this year 
_ is seventy-six and one-third. It took me two months to supply 
these twelve schools with teachers who could stand the required 
test. How I am to supply-forty-odd schools next year with com — 
petent and practical teachers, is a question of no little moment. 
There has been one school-house built the past year at the ex- 
pense of the school fund. Tt is incomplete, of the ordinary style, 
and seated with benches. Most of the schools are being taught in 
churches, which are very illy suited to the business. The schools 
are so scattered, and have been so irregular in commencing, that I 
have not thought it advisable to establish a County Institute the 
present year. I shall divide the county into four divisions next 
year, and establish an institute in each. Jam in favor of a rule 
enforcing compulsory attendance at these institutes upon teachers. 
I consider a lack of competent, live teachers as being the greatest 
drawback upon our public school system. There are several ob- 
stacles, however, which operate directly against the schools by tend-— 
ing to cool the ardor of young men and women, who would other— 
wise take pains to fit themselves properly for the profession. One 
of these is an almost entire want of properly constructed and well 
furnished school-houses. Another is found in the disposition of 
Directors to pay the same price for teachers whether they grade 
fifty or one hundred per cent. Still another is found in the uncer~ 
tain amount of funds likely to be placed in the hands of Directors 
for the support of schools from year to year, by the action of the 
County Court. This is generally insufficient to justify young men 
and women in qualifying themselves properly for the business, even 
if Directors were inclined to pay them according to qualification, 
It is hoped, however, and confidently believed, that the County 
Court will come nobly to the front in support of our public schools 
by levying.a sufficient tax to support the schools at least. five 
months each year. An action of the Court, expressing a determai— 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
09 
nation to do this, would have a powerful influence for good upon 
our schools. To make our system a success, it must first be cleared 
of all uncertain sounds, and duties which now seem only directory 
must be made positive. 
I regard the public sentiment of the county as being decidedly 
favorable to the schools, and as being on the increase. In a ma- 
jority of the public schools I found most excellent discipline. In 
a few the discipline was not altogether satisfactory, but not of suc 
a character as to be seriously objected to. I found the teachers in 
two schools not keeping any registers except in memorandum books, 
the Directors having failed to supply them with registers. The 
remaining teachers were keeping their registers daily. My schools 
have opened this year at various times, from the 12th of July to the 
13th of September. 
Tam happy to say that I have found no defaulting treasurers, 
and no misappropriation by them of the school fund during the 
year. The one-mill tax for the support of public schools, required 
by the 38th section of the School Law, has been regularly col- 
lected. . 
HANCOCK COUNTY. 
A. J. Smaz, SUPERINTENDENT, Sneedville. 
The Superintendent reports as follows, December, 1875: 
. Our schools have been ten per cent. better this year than last. 
. No progress has been made in uniformity of text-books. 
» No graded schools in the county. 
. Schools generally have blackboards. 
. Directors have shown but little interest in visiting the schools. 
. There is great deficiency in the qualifications of teachers. 
- One new school-house (log) has been erected by public funds 
this year. School-houses generally in bad condition. 
8. We have no County Institutes. 
9. The leading obstacle to the success of the schools is lack of 
money. Our school terms have been shortened this year, to > enable 
us to pay off indebtedness to teachers.

HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
8. J. Cox, SUPERINTENDENT, Saulsbury. 
The Superintendent writes, September 25th, 1875: “I have 
tried to do the best possible with the amount at the command of 
the schools. There would be but little opposition to the public 
school system if it had been properly managed at the beginning—T 
mean in this county. Most of the districts went overwhelmingly 
in debt at first. However, the next apportionment from the State ~ 
will put most of the districts out of debt. We have private schools 
in every district, and they are well attended. I think after the 
first of January, 1876, we will have public schools in every district. 
HARDIN COUNTY. 
Rev. James M. Waker, SUPERINTENDENT, Savannah. 
Owing to financial pressure, and the great amount of sickness 
prevalent during the year, schools in this county are not so good as 
last year. A uniform series of text-books was adopted in October. 
There are two graded schools; one with charts, two with globes, 
and about four-fifths have blackboards. Directors manifest but 
little interest by visiting the schools, and parents and citizens less. 
Teachers are deficient. Discipline in the schools is tolerably good. 
Four new school-houses were erected during the year by private 
and public means combined. Many of the houses are deficicat in 
comfort and conveniences for school purposes. A County Institute 
has been organized, which meets quarterly. About one-half of the 
teachers attend its meetings. The exercises are interesting and im- 
structive, embracing the studies prescribed in the school law, and ~
-P-A-G-E-107
lil 
are certainly very advantageous to teachers. The Superintendent 
would favor a rule making it obligatory on teachers to attend insti- 
tutes where they are established. The leading obstacles to the suc- 
cess of the schools is want of sufficient means, and carelessness on 
the part of those most deeply concerned. Double the amount of 
school muney, and the system will be a success. Public sentiment 
in favor of the schools is increasing, but the means are not suffi- 
cient to enlist the interest of the more influential members of the 
community. The schools open about the 15th of July. 
HAWKINS COUNTY. 
Exuis Cocke, SuPERINTENDENT, Rogersville. 
The Superintendent writes, September 29, 1875: “ Of the 5,524 
scholastic population of this county, only 3,379 had opportuuity to 
attend the public schools, as over one-third of the scholastic dis- 
tricts failed to have schools, owing to their indebtedness to teachers 
for former services rendered. The number of sckools in the county 
amounted to about the same as last year, though all save forty-eight 
were carried on by private subscription. Tho amount received 
from the State is really greater than stated in my statistical report, 
as the payments were made by warrants, and they had to be cashed 
at five and ten per cent. discount. . 
HAYWOOD COUNTY. . 
W. T. Byars, SUPERINTENDENT, Brownsville. 
The public schools in this county are in much better condition 
than they were last year. Some of the schools were nearly broken 
up on account of sickness, but the districts are out of debt, and a 
better feeling exists among the people on the subject of free schools 
than at any time heretofore,-and the opposition and prejudice that 
have existed are gradually giving away. It is confidently expected 
by the friends of public education that a great deal, more will be 
accomplished in building up the schools the present year than has 
been before.
-P-A-G-E-108
112 
The Superintendent reports, November 3, 1875, as follows: 
“We have adopted a uniform course of text books for the county, 
’ but times have been so hard they have not been introduced into all 
of our schools as they ought to have been. We have but one 
graded school in the county, and if it can continue as it started, I 
think it will accomplish more for public schools than anything we 
could have done. We have charts and blackboards only in our 
graded school, and nut as many in that as we need. Some of the 
Directors of the county are taking great interest in their schools, 
and are discharging their duties as they should, while others give 
them no attention whatever. Parents and citizens very seldom visit 
the schools. Most of the white teachers in the county are very 
competent and well qualified, but the colored teachers are mostly 
inefficient ; some few of them, however, are qualified, and are 
making successful teachers. We have done nothing in the way of 
building school-houses in the county. We use for free schools 
churches and any out-house that is proffered us by the community. 
As a natural consequence, our school-houses are in bad condition. 
We have been trying to organize a County Institute, and have held 
two or three meetings ; but for some cause or misunderstanding we 
failed in having any attendance at our last meeting. We meet ouce 
every month. Some of our teachers are taking great interest in 
the meetings, and there is no doubt, if they will attend, they will 
be beneficial to all. I would most assuredly favor a rule enforcing 
attendance. The want of funds, and adverse public sentiment, I 
regard as the leading. obstacle to the success of public schools. 
Public sentiment in this county has been very unfavorable to free 
schools, but I am glad to be able to assure you that this opposition 
is giving away, and that our people are more favorably disposed to- 
wards public schools than formerly. Discipline in our schools is 
very good under the circumstances. Teachers are very negligent 
in keeping their registers, and houses are mostly uncomfortable. 
We have no set time to open our schools, but try to open to suit 
the community.”

Levi S. Woops, SuPERINTENDENT, Lexington. 
The County Court of this county failed to elect a Superintendent 
at the time required by law. Levi S. Woods, Esq., the former 
Superintendent, kindly consented to act in making the report, but 
on account of the failure of district Directors to discharge their 
duties, the facts reported are very meagre and unsatisfactory. 
Schools have been opened during the year in many, if not all, of the 
districts ; and recent action of the County Court in electing Mr. 
Woods Superintendent is a promise of better things for the future. 
HENRY: COUNTY. 
W. B. VanCueave, Jr., SUPERINTENDENT, Paris. 
In addition to the matters reported in the statistical tables, only 
the following has been received from the Superintendent of this 
county: 
“Some of the district Directors did not have any schools taught 
this year, waiting for the next apportionment, so as to have more 
money and longer schools; while others went in debt last year, ex- 
pecting to get more money from the county than they did, and.con- 
sequently had to take this year’s apportionment to: pay the debt. 
This reduced the number of our schools. The public school sys- 
tem is gaining favor in this county.” . 
. 
HICKMAN COUNTY. 
No ‘report has been received from this county. The Superin- 
tendent elected in January, 1875, removed from the county last 
fall, and the following letter from him, dated Savannah, Tennessee, 
December 16, 1875, is inserted here as the only information as to 
school operations in that county it has been posvible to obtain. 
“J have not been in Hickman county for sore time. Am sorry 
am not able to make my annual report. I - ‘ied to get reports
-P-A-G-E-110

from the district clerks and treasurers before I left Centerville, but 
failed. The following will approximate correctness, Forty-five 
schools in the county ; average daily attendance of pupils, twenty- 
five to the school; average pay of teachers per month, thirty 
dollars ; average length of schools, three months; salary of County 
Superintendent, nothing. There js very little interest taken in 
public schools in Hickman county. A large majority of the people 
are opposed to the present school Jaws, which causes them to throw 
every obstacle n the way that they possibly can.” 
  
HOUSTON COUNTY. 
J. M. Parcament, SUPERINTENDENT, Cumberland City. 
The Superintendent says: “I regret to say we have been so far 
behind in paying up our teachers for last year’s services that we 
could not have public schools this year. The money on hand is in 
State warrants, and we cannot use them until cashed, consequently 
we concluded to have private schools this year, and public schools 
next year. Very nearly all of the districts are in debt for last 
year’s schools. I think when the taxes are collected we will have 
money enough to accomplish some good. 
HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
J. C. Tunioss, SUPERINTENDENT, Waverley. 
On account of indebtedness but few schools were in operation in 
this county during the year. The prospects for the future, how- 
ever, are quite encouraging. 
JACKSON COUNTY. 
R. H. Wasupurn, SUPERINTENDENT, Gainesborough. 
The Superintendent of this county makes the following. report, 
November 29, 1875: 
“ Having collected only a few ofthe district reports in regand.to 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
115 > 
school operations in this county for 1874-5, I cannot make you a 
precise report of the financial condition of the county, but it’ is 
sufficiently exact for all necessary purposes. We had no schools 
last year, hence spent no money for school purposes, except the 
County Superintendent’s salary, ($100), and the amount paid the 
district clerks and treasurers for taking scholastic population, blagk 
books, ete., which is as follows, as near as I can at present ascertain: 
Indebtedness for teachers for 1878..........066 deeeeeeeeeseeees $1,300 00 
County Superintendent’s salary, balance unpaid for ’74..... 75 00 
Amount due district clerks and treasurers for 1874—5...... 50 00 
$1,425 00 
Amount collected from State—taxes 18733 
Paid by Revenue Collector to Trustee... «$494 77 
Semi-annual interest. «. 584 88      
$1,079 65 
Which still leaves the county due teachers for year 73... $ 345. 35 
By referring to my report for 1873-4, you will find indebtedness 
of this county as herein stated for 1873. Hence it was thought 
best not to carry on any public schools during the year 1874, I 
learn that the County Trustee has in hands Comptroller’s warrants 
to the amount of $ , which cannot be paid off by the State 
Treasurer for some time yet, and the Revenue Collector of our 
county will soon have on hand a considerable amount, which I 
presume will be paid over as soon as collected. Our schools com- 
menced s0 late this year, as a general thing, that we will have to 
embody them in our next report—1875-6.” :   
Subsequently the Superintendent made the following special 
report : 
“T have the honor to submit the following report in regard to 
the schools of Jackson county, answering all the questions you 
submitted that could be done with accuracy : 
No public schools were taught in 1874. 
Progress and success of public schools better in 1875 than in 1873. 
One school-house built in 1875; some old ones: repaired. 
Parents and school Directors have manifested little interest, in 
visiting public schools—or any others.
-P-A-G-E-112
116 
Public sentiment has not been favorable to- public schools, but is. 
growing better and stronger in their favor. 
Good discipline generally in public schools. 
Teachers generally have kept their records daily. 
Very many school-houses are not well located for convenience of 
their respective pupils, and not at all suitable for winter schools. 
School-rooms not well furnished, generally, with good school fur- 
niture; seventeen have blackboards, two charts, none globes. 
One graded school in county, viz: Tannehill College, Gaines- 
boro, Tennessee. 
No Teachers’ Institute has been established, but wish one. 
. Thirty-eight public schools were taught fall of 1875; average 
paid teachers about $30 a month ; about same as 1873. “ 
Teachers average grade i in qualification, six and three-fourths ; 
theory and practice, six. 
During the year 1874, when no public ‘schools were taught, we: 
had fourteen private schools; average cost for each $1.50 a month, 
which is more than public schools cost per scholar by: at least one- 
half. 
Have three private schools, each pretty well furnished with 
buildings and school furniture, two of which are kept in operation 
ten months in the year, the other five months, and sometimes none. 
The leading obstacle in the. way of success in public schools is 
the want of necessary funds. Some counties (ours one) I believe. 
will not levy additional taxation even for that purpose, and if our 
State Legislature would take it in hand and make additional levy, 
sufficient to carry on five months session of public schools every year, 
then we might hope and expect public schools to prosper, and our 
own State to take rank among the foremost in educational interest. 
    
JAMES COUNTY. 
Dr. R. K. Warxins, SUPERINTENDENT, Ooltewah. - 
The schools in the county are doing very well. There is one 
school in: every district, while some districts have three or four. 
Some of the districts are using their public moneys to build school- « houses, but where that is the case there are good schools carried 
   
-P-A-G-E-113
117 
by subscription. Want of attendance is a fault much to be de- 
plored in some districts. The Superintendent reports under date 
of November 6, 1875, as follows: 
“We have made very little progress as to uniformity of téxt- 
books. There are two graded schools in our county. Most of ‘the~ 
schools have blackboards, but very few have charts, and none have 
globes. The Directors have shown very little interest. Hardly 
any of them visit the schools. Parents have exhibited some in- 
terest, but not so much as they should. The discipline in the 
schools is good. We have some very good teachers; but the sala- 
ries allowed in some of the districts are not sufficient to command 
good talent. There have been no new school-houses erected during 
the year. We have some good houses, while others are poor, but 
will average in this respéet with most of the counties in the State. 
The great drawbacks to the progress and success of our public 
schools are, first, the want of money to run the schools a sufficient 
length of time during the year, and the irregularity in attendance 
of pupils. The sentiment of our people is favorable to public schools. 
Schools open about the first of August. 
JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
Dr. Sam. ANDERSON, SUPERINTENDENT, Dandridge. 
The Superintendent writes, September 9, 1875: 
“T have just completed my first. visit to each school district in 
my county. I found fifty-five schools in session, the first having 
opened the first of July. Several more have opened since I visited 
the districts. I found 2,335 pupils enrolled, with a daily average 
attendance of 2,039. Of the number enrolled, 1,385 are males, 
and 950 females. Average monthly salary of teachers $24.60. I, 
each year, make three visits to all my schools. The first and most 
important business of a County Superintendent is to get the chil-” 
dren into the schools. Instead of trusting the work to inexpe- 
rienced clerks of school districts, I take all necessary items from 
the teachers’ registers with my own hand. Experience of more
-P-A-G-E-114
118 
than a third of a century in running the common school, the 
academy, and the college of East Tennessee, satisfies me of the 
propriety of perpetual out-door work.” 
To the thirteen interrogatories propounded in circular of October 
_ 29, 1875, from this office, the Superintendent made answers as 
follows : 
1, From July 1st to December 20th of last month, 69 free 
schools had been opened—52 white and 17 colored—enrolling 3,450 
pupils, with an average daily attendance of 2,031; average month- 
ly wages paid teachers, $25 96. From July 12th to 1st of Decem- 
ber, the present year, 3,411 pupils had entered in the free schools 
of our county, with average. daily attendance of 2,138; 66 schools 
having been opened, with average monthly wages paid teachers.of 
$24.07 6-16. Our teachers are small improvement over last year 
in capacity and experience in teaching. : 
2. No progress in uniformity of text-books has been made, save 
a partial move in favor of supplanting all series of readers by the 
“ten cent” Testament. A magnanimous move, this. 
3. We have seven graded schools in Jefferson county. 
4, None of our schools have globes, two or three have charts, 
and about seven-eighths have /blackboards. 
5. With five or six exceptions Directors have visited all our free 
schools. Parents visited two or three only. 
"6. Our teachers have been faithful, industrious and competent to 
their several demands, with hardly an exception. 
7. No new school-houses have been built during the present year, 
two or three have been repaired or completed, all from private 
donations. Our school-houses (for the whites), with six exceptions, 
are comfortable, not fine or fashionably seated. Our colored 
friends have six regular school-houses, the other schools are in 
rented cabins. 
8. We have no Teachers’ Institute. I made an effort in 1874, 
and it failed. My reverence for the golden. rule, my appreciation 
of pure, simple republicanism, and my love of sheer justice, all 
conspire to force me to disfavor any rule forcing teachers to attend 
an Institute. I should feel equally justifiable in favoring a rule.to. 
force teachers or pupils to enter any other particalar school or insti
-P-A-G-E-115
119 
tution. These nolens volens rules and coercives, in the absence of 
plain, urgent and demonstrative necessity, can neither obtain my 
sanction nor challen e my respect. 
9. This is a broad question, covering the whole ground ; its name 
is legion, yet simple, unique, But like every other general, it in- 
cludes many species or particulars of greater or less note. I pro- 
pose to touch only a few of the former. Being aware that some, 
perhaps all, of my ideas upon this subject are sure to be regarded 
by Young America as the fallen leaves of a past season, not worthy 
of citizenship in this fast age, I ask the liberty to take hold of. it 
(this subject) without the burnish of grammar or gloss of rhetoric. 
Ist. My answer to question 6 virtually places all our free-school 
ills and failures to our failing to get and retain the whole free- 
school population in said free-schools, to the consummation of which 
most desirable end our want of practical economy and prudence 
alone stand in the way. Drawback Ist, is too much pecuniary 
friction, growing mainly out of the use of school readers (so-called) 
by the series, with only here and away over yonder.a nubbin idea, 
confessedly not worth reading for the information they contain—at 
best a sort of literary truck, second-rate at that—an enfilading 
battery alike sweeping the Book of Books, (tent cent) Testaments, 
from our schools and the dimes from the pockets of the, poor— 
barring the knowledge of God from the hearts of. the masses, with- 
out the semblance of remuneration in either wit, morals or money 
to any save the book-monger. For instance, a set of McGuffey’s 
Readers, at retail, for each pupil which has entered the free-schools 
of Jefferson county since July 12th, 1875, would amount to the 
ruinous, paralyzing sum of $7,800 in round numbers. A ten cent 
Testament—more than a match for said series—for each of said 
pupils, costs only $341 in round numbers, and the Testament with 
Psalms, which I much prefer for some pupils, amounts to $952, 
making a saving to Jefferson county alone of $7,450 in the first, and 
$6,848 in the second, instance; and what would the saving be in the 
whole State of Tennessee. Simply tremendous. All the free- 
School needs in the book line is Webster’s Elementary Spelling 
Book, Testament with Psalms, one small, complete Arithmetic, say 
fifty cents, one English Grammar at forty cents, one Primary 
Geography or Eclectic No.1. To force series of readers, arith- 
metics, English grammars or geographies into the free-schools is
-P-A-G-E-116
120 
simply to crowd our schools with clogging trumpery, and the idea 
of attempting to introduce geology into the free-schools at this time 
is indeed thin. . 
To spell, to read and to write correctly our own language, and 
master thoroughly addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
and the per cents in arithmetic, is the sum total of a good free- 
school education—it is the practical lesson of life—a foundation 
firm and broad, upon which the pupil can without cost or the aid 
of the teacher erect as large a building as needs be. So far as 
making correct readers of a class is concerned, an arm-full of alma- 
macs is just as good as a wagon-load of costly series of readers... 
The multitude of books in school forbids the tarry of the mind 
upon any particular subject sufficiently long to obtain a clear 
idea, one that will stick. Let us plow deep with simple, cheap 
tools, few in number, instead of this wriggling over the half 
of a college domain. The free-school should be for the prattling 
young by the mass, not the class. To attempt to make critics in 
- free-school, is simply a willful prostitution of that benevolent insti- 
tution. I have no objection to, but favor, the use of history in the 
more advanced classes in our free-schools; simply as a reading book, 
where the pupil can bear “the expense. I protest against its use as 
a nolens volens free-school study—compel our destitute to use in 
school only the branches, to comprehend which they need an in- 
structor ; study of history they can prosecute at home at no cost as 
"well as at school, Finally, upon the book question, I wish to ob- 
serve, that our present free-school course is abundantly long to 
make critical men, did not its sapid literary condiment so much 
excel in quantity its solid stamina. The money paid for useless 
books, added to our present free money, would lengthen our schools 
to from eight to ten months in each year, and nobody hurt here. 
2dly. Graded society drives many from, and keeps more from, 
entering our free-schools—one calico dress of eighteen yards in 
school is full of fate to many an indigent girl’s intellectual culture, 
and I must be allowed to sigh for the good day when a patch neatly 
‘set to a bright boy’s clean pants will cease to elicit from any a dis- 
. paraging comment; but I will cut short this link lest I throw over 
some gentle reader a little warm chill. 
3dly. Abstract poverty keeps many from ever ontering school, . 
destituie of means to meet its shortest demands.

4thly. A disposition prevalent in this county to pass our own 
sons, daughters and old teachers, of known and' tried ability in the 
school-room, and take, at an inflated salary, a stranger blowing his 
own trumpet, with fair surface indications, ignoring the fact that 
brilliancy and versatility of mind are twin-sisters, and when the 
former is found without the latter, a monstrous. miscarriage has 
been—that’s all. 
10. Sentiment in favor of free-schools in my county is fair and 
on the increase. 
11. Discipline in our free-schools is generally good. Teachers’ 
registers well kept as a general thing. School-houses, with. few 
exceptions, comfortable, not fine or grand. 
  
JOHNSON COUNTY. 
B. W. Jenkins, SUPERINTENDENT, Taylorsville. 
The schools in this county have been kept open the usual length 
of time, and the enrollment and average daily attendance of pupils 
show a good condition and some progress. There is one graded 
school in the county, and Directors, parents and citizens manifest 
considerable interest by visiting the schools. About one-half of 
the teachers are competent, while the other half are somewhat defi- 
cient. Discipline in the schools is tolerably fair. Five new school- 
houses were erected during the year. About one-half of the school- 
houses are comfortable. The lack of regular attendance on the 
part of pupils is one of the greatest obstacles in the way of the 
success of the schools. Schools generally opened September Ist. 
  
KNOX COUNTY. 
H. M. Broruer, SuPERINTENDENT, Knozville. 
The Superintendent writes, October 2, 1875: ‘“ Much money . 
has been expended this year in building school-houses. This, and 
the indebtedness of the previous year, prevented the schools run- 
ning as long as heretofore, and as was intended. More than 
twenty new school-houses have been built within the last two years,
-P-A-G-E-118
122 
some of them models of excellence. Modern furniture has been 
extensively put in. We have had several institutes, which have 
done much good. The teachers’ standard has been much improved 
and elevated. We have established three Peabody graded schools 
outside the city, and it has been my object to secure one such cen- 
tral school for every civil district of the county, where the high 
school branches can be taught. While on the one hand we have 
had many drawbacks, on the other we have met with much encour- 
agement. Free schools have become to Knox county a public’ 
necessity and a fixed fact. They are growing into general accept 
-ance and universal favor. Nearly everybody is in favor of a law 
for compulsory attendance. The Peabody aid has been of incal- 
culable assistance to us. Nothing can supply. its place in building : 
up graded schools of a high character.” 
The following are answers to questions in circular letter of Oc- 
tober 29: 
1. Schools are more efficient this year than last. 
2. We have a uniformity of text-books, with few exceptions. 
3. Six graded schools. 
4, All schools have blackboards, one-third have charts, and a 
few have globes. 
5. In some localities much interest has been shown by Directors, 
citizens and parents. 
6. Teachers are improving in competency ; cannot give per cent. 
of incompetency. 
7. Eight houses have been built, one for a graded school; were 
built half by private and half by school fund. 
8. We have a County Institute which meets twice a year. I 
find it of great advantage. to teachers. I would favor compulsory 
attendance. 
9. Non-attendance is the greatest obstacle to the success of pub- 
lic schools in this county. 
10. The public sentiment is in favor of public schools, and this 
sentiment is on the increase. 
11. Ihave found the discipline moderately good, and teachers 
keeping their registers daily. .. 
12. Schools opened this year from middle of July to first of 
November.

LAKE COUNTY. 
L. Dowanpsoy, SUPERINTENDENT, Tiptonville, 
Under date of October 1, 1875, the Superintendent writeg: 
«There seems to be a growing popularity for the present school 
system, but it is not sufficiently understood yet in my county. I 
am of opinion that when it is fully comprehended and carried out, 
it will meet the wishes of our people and become a fixture. As 
one of the. evils of want of knowledge of the law, I find the dis- 
trict Directors are somewhat loose in their reports to me, owing in 
part to not having kept perfect records of their official acts and 
proceedings, and in part to the County Trustee not designating the 
different sources from which the school moneys paid to them were 
derived.” 
November 23d, 1875, the Superintendent reports : 
1. Schools are much better than last year. 
2. No uniformity of text-books yet, but I am endeavoring to 
correct this evil. 
3. No graded schools in the county. 
4. One school has charts, globes and blackboards. 
5. Directors have not shown much interest in visiting schools, 
but have done so to some extent. 
6, Public school teachers graded this year six and two- seventh 
on an average. 
7. One new school-house (log) in process of erection by private 
means. School-houses are only tolerably neat and comfortable, 
but not well suited for use in winter. 
8. We have no County Institute. 
9. I regard the want of knowledge of the school law, upon the 
part of Directors and people, as the only obstacle in the way of the 
success of our present system. | I find the better it is understood 
the better it is liked. 
10. I regard the sentiment of the county favorable to free schools, 
and growing more so. 
11. Discipline in schools very good, and teachers all keeping 
registers correctly. , 
12. No regular time for opening schools.

LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
H. T. Hanxs, SupERIntTENDENT, Ripley. 
* The Superintendent reports, December 13, 1875, as follows : 
“While the public school system has not been a failure in this 
county, it has not been as successful as it ought, by any means. 
Several causes have militated against it. In the first place, the 
educational standard is too low, and there is not enough general 
‘interest felt in education. Secondly and mainly, our county is 
_ burdened with a heavy railroad tax, without having any railroad, 
so that people could not be induced to levy an additional tax for 
any purpose now. Thirdly, the crop of 1874 was almost a total 
failure, and the overflow this summer past destroyed the crops in 
the river districts, so that our people are largely insolvent. AIL 
these circumstances have conspired to produce an apathy in the 
minds of the majority of our people that operates very severely 
against all educational enterprises now, public and private. I think, 
though, if we were once relieved of our railroad tax, or. had an 
immediate and reliable prospect for the completion of the road, that 
our people would then be willing to vote a liberal tax for schools. 
In reference to colored schools, there seems to be an improve- 
ment of feeling among the whites, and an increasing willingness to 
allew them to share in the blessings of education. The main diffi- 
culty in regard to their schools is the want of competent teachers 
- of their own color. The only ones, with one or two exceptions, 
who have shown -a tolerable degree of competency to instruct, are 
those who have been educated at the Tennessee Central College 
' and Fisk University. Someé of them compare favorably with many 
white applicants. But on the whole, we have been compelled, to 
employ a grade of colored teachers inferior to what they should be. 
The same objection indeed holds ‘good with regard to many of 
our white teachers. I have endeavored to raise the standard during 
the past year, and have made my examinations more rigid than 
formerly, rejecting one applicant last summer, to whom I had 
ven a certificate two years ago. I have endeavored to get upa 
Teachers’ Association in this county, for the purpose of conducting 
institutes ; have not succeeded yet, but intend trying the enterprise 
again with the opening of the year 1875. So far the County: Court 
has made no appropriation this year for my services, but if they
-P-A-G-E-121
125 
fail to do so, which is, to say the least of it, possible, I feel de- 
termined during the year 1876 to see if the educational interests of 
this county cannot be put on a better footing, for the pleasure of 
overcoming some at least of the difficulties which have been in the 
way, if for no better reason. 
And now for the failure to make a full report. I must throw 
myself on your indulgence, hoping that you will give due consid- 
eration to the difficulties which I have set forth here and hereto- 
fore, and feeling determined, if I live to see the close of the 
present scholastic year, not to depend on Directors to send me in 
meagre and imaccurate reports. I feel sure, however, that the 
Directors have spent the money, as they deemed it for the best 
interests of the common school cause.’ 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
W. J. Bucnanan, SurERInTeNDENT, Lawrenceburg. 
The written report of the Superintendent is as follows: 
1./ The progress and success of the schools in this county have 
been, materially reduced this year, in consequence of the refusal,of 
the ¢ounty to levy a county tax for school purposes. 
2, No progress has been made as to uniformity of text-books. 
3 No. graded schools in this county. 
4.) Twelve schools have charts. 
5.| The Directors have shown but little interest in schools, and 
parents and citizens absolutely none. 
6, There is a deficiency in the character of the competency of 
ers, amounting to about ten per centum of the same. 
7, Three new school-houses of ordinary character have been 
erected during the year out of the public means, The general 
chatacter and condition of the school-houses is bad. 
8, No institute has been established. 
9. A want of interest on the part of the people, and a lack ‘of 
motey, are the Jeading obstacles to the success of schools in this 
county. 
10. The sentiment in this county is favorable, but decreasing.

LEWIS COUNTY. 
W. C. Dass, SUPERINTENDENT, Newburg. 
No.reports whatever have been received from this county as to 
school operations. The County Court failed to elect a Superintend— 
ent in place of O. T. Plummer, whose term of office expired Jan— 
uary 1, 1875, until the October term, when W. C. Dabbs was 
elected. Lewis is the only county in the State where the scholastic 
popujation was not taken and reported, as required by law. 
  
LINCOLN COUNTY. 3 
W. A. Git, Jr., SuPERINTENDENT, Fayetteville. 
‘The schools in this county have been doing very well. Most of 
the teachers have been faithful in the discharge of their duty, and 
where such was the case, progress has heen good. The County 
Court, at its July term, 1875, levied a tax of ten cents on the kun- 
dred dollars worth of property for school purposes, which, how edver, 
will not be realized to any great extent before the first of Janul BEY, 
1876. The Superintendent reports, December 8, 1875: : 
1. The progress and success of the schools in our county Have 
been some better than lest year, though there is not much differ— 
ence in the two years. 
2. I have made no progress as to uniformity in text books, gut 
expect to have a uniformity in my schools next fall. 
3. There are no graded public schools in my county. 
4. About thirty of my schools have blackboards, about six have 
charts, and none have globes. 
_ 5, Directors, parents and citizens have all shown some interest, i in 
visiting the schools, but’ not as much as I would have them, 
  
-P-A-G-E-123
. 6. There is a very great deficiency in the competency of teachers; 
about thirty-three and one-third per cent. of same. 
7. There have been no new school-houses erected during the year. 
8. I have not established a County Institute. 
9. I regard the want of means to be the leading obstacle to suc- 
cess in my county. 
10. Public sentiment is about equally divided on the subject of 
public schools in my county. I think the sentiment in favor of the 
public school system is increasing. 
11. In my inspection of schools I have found the discipline tol- 
erably good, the teachers keeping their registers daily, as required 
by law, but most of the school-houses are uncomfortable. 
12. Most of the schools open the middle of July. 
LOUDON COUNTY. ° 
J. A. MircHeny, SUPERINTENDENT, Loudon. 
The Superintendent writes, November 17, 1875: 
“ There are but few schools in session this fall, and they are not 
so good on an average as last year. Very little progress has been 
made towards uniformity in text-books. Our Directors adopted the 
University Series, but the people are backward in purchasing the 
books. Old books are most commonly used. Only one graded 
school in the county. Several of the schools have blackboards, 
but none have maps, charts or globes. Directors manifest very 
little interest in the schools, and parents less. We have some ex- 
cellent teachers, but many are not so well qualified as they should 
be. No school-houses have been built this year, and most of those 
we have are in poor condition. Four of the schools are taught in. 
very comfortable church buildings. An institute was established 
in 1873, but was not well attended, while some of those who did 
attend were very backward in taking part in the exercises, which 
consisied in conducting experimental classes, and discussing ques- 
tions on methods and goverment. We have an institute every two 
weeks in the Loudon High School building, but it is poorly at- 
tended. I am not prepared to declare in favor of compulsory 
attendance on the part of teachers. Secret opposition to the school
-P-A-G-E-124
’ 128 
law and general indifference to educational interests are the main 
obstacles to the success of the school system. There is.a good deal 
- of opposition manifested in a quiet. way. Popular sentiment. in 
favor of the schools is, perhaps, increasing. Teachers are keeping 
their registers carefully, and the discipline in the schools in a large 
majority of cases seems to be good. Schools open in September 
and October. 
- MACON COUNTY. 
J. 8. Woorren, SUPERINTENDENT, LaFayette. 
Letter from the County Superintendent, October 1, 1875: 
“T regret very much that I cannot make a better report for 
Macon county than I have to make, but am glad that I can report 
as favorably as I do, and rejoice in the hope that hereafter the re- 
ports from Macon will show an increased popularity of the public 
school system, and that the good citizens of the county are alive 
to the interests of education; that they are sensitive of the fact 
that the public mind should be educated. We have-had no public 
schools for the school year past, and will have none the present 
year. The cause of this is the lack of money. 
I was first elected to the office of Superintendent in September, 
1874. Upon investigation I found the financial condition of the 
public schools dilapidated. The, districts were all largely in debt 
to teachers for services in the year 1873; besides this, teachers 
were holding claims against the county for services prior to 1873, 
to the amount of eight hundred or one thousand dollars, which 
amount the County Court, wisely, made an appropriation for the 
same out of the county treasury. 
The indebtedness for 1873 I advised to be paid out of the school 
fund received for the year 1874, which has been done. Now with 
the exception of one or two districts, we are entirely out of debt, 
with a small surplus in most districts, There not being a sufficient 
fund on hand to support the schools any length of time, I have 
advised the postponement of the public schools until the first of 
September, 1876; when we can commence anew, as it were, with 
the following financial view before us: The apportionments made 
by the Comptroller for the years 1875 and 1876, together with. the
-P-A-G-E-125
129 
, following county levy for the year 1875, (in addition to the poll-tax 
_and the one mill on the dollar levied by the State,) to wit: on all 
taxable property twenty cents on the $100; on merchants ad valo- 
rem, twenty cents on the $100; on marriage license $1; on all 
suits in the Circuit, Chancery and County Courts, one-half aniount 
of State tax; on each presentment or indictment,’ one-half amount 
of State tax ; which, when all summed up, according to the best 
estimate which I can make, will give us a school fund of seven or 
eight thousand dollars, provided the taxes are promptly collected. 
And I feel gratified to say that if the County Court of my county 
will act as wisely in the future as I think it has in the present year, in 
levying a school tax, and the Directors be judicious in the disburse- 
ments of their funds, that opposition to the public school system in 
Macon county will cease ‘to exist. The great source of opposition 
has always been the lack of means, and I will just say that I think 
the State levy of one mill on’ the dollar is too small, and ought to 
be increased. In fact, I think it would be more of a State system 
if the Legislature would levy a sufficient tax, so that an additional 
tax would not be necessary to be levied by County Courts, or. by 
vote of the people, and would thus secure uniformity. . 
The law requiring the taxes paid over to the Trustee of the 
county in which collected, I conceive to be a good law. It is sim- 
ply impossible to get teachers without money, so is it impossible to 
get money without a tax levy, and equally true is it that the publie 
mind cannot be educated without. public schools ; hence, we must 
levy a school tax or live in ignorance.” 
MADISON COUNTY. 
_. Dr. J. D. Mason, SUPERINTENDENT, | Jackson. 
From the meagre character-of the information which has reached 
this office as to educational matters in this county, it is impossible 
to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion as to what has been done, or 
the prospects for the: future. The County Trustee’s report shows 
receipts of school moneys from State and county to be $10,087.58, 
with an expenditure to seventeen school districts of $5,889. 24. 
The Sp berintendent writes, December, 1875:

“ Truly we have done nothing here. No interest is ta 
magistrates, and the character of the Directors is such th 
up no interest in their districts. Generally anybody,

On the first Monday in January our schools commence 
and I hope will move on with more spirit, and more to

MARSHALL COUNTY. 
W. W. Waker, SUPERINTENDENT, Lewisburg. 
October 1, 1875, the Superintendent wrote. as follows : 
“After a thorough tour over the county during the month of 
August, 1875, visiting and inspecting the public schools of this 
‘county, I am sorry to say that I am not.at all favorably impressed 
with the success achieved in those schools as yet, nor am I encour- 
aged to hope for the better in the future. Public or free schools 
have been a decided failure in this county so far; for which failure 
several reasons might be given. Public or free-schools have always 
been held in great disfavor with probably a majority of its people, 
or at least with a very respectable and considerable minority. A 
majority of the teachers ‘are rather inferior. While there are some 
very good teachers employed in the public schools, prices are so 
low, and there is too little money, without an additional tax to 
command the services of the best teachers from year to year. The 
people cannot be made to realize the importance of sending their 
children to these schools regularly. The attendance in these schools 
in this county is now, and has been, most lamentably irregular. 
They will send tolerably well for its first month, say, then begin to 
drop off, until the schools which numbered, from fifty to sixty 
pupils, dwindle duwn to from. twelve to fifteen. The people can 
not be aroused to take the proper interest in these schools. They 
seem to look at it in this light, that it does not cost them anything. 
But take the schools altogether, I think that a third of them, 
are doing tolerably well. The greatest obstacle in the way is the 
want of regular attendance. : 
The scholastic year, ending, as it it does, the last of July, makes 
it rather inconvenient for us here. The -custom with us is to teach 
the.public schools in the latter part of the summer and the begin- 
ning of the fall, which puts us to the inconvenience of dividing the 
sessions in our reports, part in one yearly report and part in the 
next. But this time of teaching the schools I think the best, as it 
suits the farmers, who compose the principal part of the patrons, 
better.then than any other time during the year. 
The school-houses and their furniture are rather bad, and the 
Directors cannot he aroused to see the importance of good school-

~ The Superintendent made the following special report: 
” 23, 1875: 
1. Public schools in this county are as good, if nol 
“year than last. 
2, We have'a tolerable uniformity of ‘text-books, 
alfogether uniform, 
3. No graded schools at all in this county.

9. I regard the irregularity of attendance at the public schools . 
the most troublesome obstacle in the: way of the success of the 
public schools, together with a want of interest. 
10. The public sentiment is rather unfavorable to free-schools. 
11. The discipline is good in some of the schools, in others not 
so good.’ I might say, generally, the discipline tolerable. A ma- 
jority. of the teachers keep their registers very well, while some not 
so well. School-houses generally not very comfortable. 
12. Generally our schools begin about the first of August.

Beyond the figures in the statistical tables, the Superintendent of 
this county has furnished no other information of school opera-__ 
tions for, the past year. . 
McMINN COUNTY. 
Rey. Josepn Janeway, SuPERINTENDENT, Mouse Creek. 
The Superintendent writes, October 21, 1875, as follows: 
“The attendance of pupils in the schools was good at the begin- 
ning of the sessions, but diminished after the first month and a 
half, as is usually the case with our public schools. The very per- 
sons for whom the free schools were intended, failed to send their 
children to. them, as they should. In traveling over the county, . 
visiting the.scbools, I have seen many children idle almost in sight. 
of the school-house, their parents seeming to take. no interest what- 
ever in their education.” 
November 24, 1875, the Superintendent reports: 
“The. progress and success of our schools this year are better, | 
thatijlast.. Some, progress towards uniformity in text-books has . 
been made, but not much. We have four graded schools. Thirty- _ 
one schools have blackboards, and two have charts. Many of the 
Directors have shown great interest in the schools, and we now 
have quite'a number of excellent teachers. The discipline in the
-P-A-G-E-130
134 
schools is good. Five good frame school-houses have been erected 
during the year from the public fund. Twenty-five of our school- 
houses are good—the balance bad. We have had a County Insti- 
tute, but it has not met this year. Only a few of our teachers at- 
tended. I would favor a rule making it obligatory on the part.of 
teachers to attend Institutes when established. Public sentiment - 
favorable to the schools, and this feeling is slowly increasing. 
Schools open about the first of August. 
McNAIRY COUNTY. 
Rey. T. F. Sanpers, SUPERINTENDENT, Purdy. 
The Superintendent makes the following report: 
“The progress and. success of the public schools were better than 
last year, as long as they were continued. Sickness interfered ma- 
terially with them. We have a uniform series of text-books adopt- 
ed, and in nearly general use. Three of our schools are graded, 
and twenty-five blackboards, but no charts or globes. Directors 
have shown some interest by visiting the schools, but parents have 
manifested but little. Teachers do not know how to teach the re- 
quired branches as well as they should. The deficiency is about 
forty-five per cent. The discipline of the schools is good, and 
teachers keep their registers correctly. No school-houses have 
been built this year. There are some good houses, but the major~ 
ity are common log structures, and most of them are not comfort- 
able. A Teacher’s Institute has been organized, and meets twice a 
. month. About twenty teachers attend. The exercises are instruc- 
tive and of great advantage to teachers. By all means let us ‘have. 
a rule enforcing. attendance on these institutes on the part of teach- 
ers. The leading obstacles to the success of the schools in this 
county are: uncomfortable school-houses, the need of money, 
more money, much more money. Public sentiment is favorable to 
the school system, but is neither on the increase or decrease. 
Schools open in July.”

Oe 136 : 
MEIGS COUNTY. 
V. C. ALLEN, SUPERINTENDENT, Decatur. 
The Superintendent writes, October Ist, 1875: 
“This county has, by the vote of her people, and through’ her 
County Court, repeatedly refused to do anything for the public’ 
school system, but the State aid is being made available by using 
the funds thus received in connection with private donations or 
subscriptions. We have one consolidated school in this county, 
which is a success. I think the present school law is becoming 
more popular with our people.” 
MONROE COUNTY. 
J. R. Srrapiey, SUPERINTENDENT, Hiwassee College. 
The following is the special report of the Superintendent: 
1. There has been. a decided improvement in our schools over 
last year—over 100 per centum. 
2, The most of the books bought this year have been of the uni- 
form course, though some have wilfully refused to purchase the 
same. Where there were old books they have not yet been ex- 
eluded. : 
3. No graded schools except Hiwassee College. 
4. None of the schools are furnished with charts and globes, but 
most of them are now furnished with cheap blackboards. 
5. Some of the Directors have visited their schools, and taken 
an interest in them; while there is at least one-half that have taken 
no interest in them. Parents and citizens have not visited the 
schools and shown the interest they should have done. 
6. The character of the competency of the teachers is good. 
From my observations in and out of the school-house, I have 
marked six out of forty-five as incompetent to teach—mostly fossils 
of the past. Some are inexperienced; yet the eagerness with which 
they strive to improve makes them hopeful cases. While I feel 
that I cannot speak in terms of too high commendation of a score 
or more of my teachers, male and female, for the skill,.zeal and
-P-A-G-E-132
186° 
self-denial they have manifested. Truly, if they could only be 
continued and maintained through the year, in our desolate regions, 
they would cause the “wilderness to blossom ag the rose.” My 
regret is. inexpressible at the discontinuance of services so much 
needed. 
Y. No new houses completed, but. nine are being built, or are 
under contract. Others will be built. The total destruction of 
sawmills prevented building sooner. Most of the buildings going 
up are frames, weatherboarded and ceiled, well lighted, seated, and 
to be furnished with stoves and blackboards. Dimensions 20x26 
feet. There were heretofore seven comfortable public school- 
houses in the county,-aside from those in Madisonville and Sweet- 
water and Hiwassee College. The remainder are miserable pole or 
log huts. Subscription used as far as it can be had, and work com- 
pleted with public money. Subsequent reports will show the pro- 
portion. 
8. We have a County Institute known as the Monroe County 
Teachers’ Normal Association, with written constitution and by- 
laws, a chairman, secretary, treasurer, etc. The County Superin- 
tendent is ex-officio president’ of the association. The association 
meets the last Saturday in each month, and has its semi-annual”: 
meetings, commencing the last Tuesday in December and June; and 
continues from day to day. About thirty per cent. of the teachers 
attend. Our exercises consist in recitation of lessons from the ~ 
public school course, conducted by the most competent teachers, 
with the’ aid of free criticism; written essays and discussions’ on 
subjects pertaining to the object in view, such as, the importance of 
good school-houses, lengthening the term of school, qualifications - 
of the teacher, best method of getting up an intesest among parénts 
and guardians with regard to schools, best method of statting little’ 
children to learn, economy of time in school-house, discipline of ~ 
school, morals of school, importance of co-operation among school ~ 
officers and teachers, essays on the importance of the study of the 
various branches of the course, etc. It is certainly very ‘advan-~ 
tagéous to teachers to attend these institutes. Some of the benefits -: 
are these : the less qualified teachers learn from the more thorough’; 
a thore uniform system of teaching is secured; a fraternal: feeling = 
is engendered ; the whole. body ‘is inspired with fresh: zeal; and a ° 
co-operation secured through which the Superintendent can ‘build *
-P-A-G-E-133
137 - 
houses, uniform books, increase county appropriations, prolong: 
schools, ‘and more effectually remove incompetent teachers. They: 
afford him the best of opportunities to judge of the learning and 
talents of the teachers, while they increase the. intimacy of ac- 
quaintance, and make stronger the bond of ‘union between the 
teachers, and between the teachers and the Superintendent.. It 
should also be taken into the account that a number of citizens 
visit the institute from time to time as they move from place to 
plaée, and catch the fires from our altars. From the view from my 
stand-point I would heartily recommend that attendance be made 
compulsory. 
9. We need good houses. We need uniformity of books, and a 
much larger supply of books and fixtures. -We need some means 
by which ignorant and inefficient Directors can be removed. We 
need to have more power vested in the Superintendency and less in 
the Directory. We need more money and longer schools. But 
above all, we need a law to compel parents to send their children 
to school. 
10. Twelve months since the sentiment of this county was op- 
posed to public schools, and especially to the Superintendency, but - 
a revolution is going on deep and‘ thorough. The public school 
cause is gaining ground rapidly. 
11. The discipline of schools is generally good. The teachers 
are keeping their registers better, I think, than heretofore. 
12. Most of the schools opened in the month-of August, but the 
most efficient ones in November. ‘ 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
N. L. Wurrrierp, Surerintenpent, Clarksville. 
The’ suspension of the collection of taxes by’ the Legislature: 
caused a deficit of $2,414.60 in the school fund of the county for 
the: year. Schools opened with~ increasing promise of success, 
Obstacle after obstacle is being steadily removed. .The hope of the 
Superintendent for the ultimate success of the ‘system is being. 
greatly strengthened by the growing sentiment: in its favor.. School:
-P-A-G-E-134
138 
officers are working zealously, and the friends of the system are 
bringing every means to bear to secure its permanent establishment. 
The following is the Superintendent’s special report of Novem- 
ber 2, 1875: 
"1. The advance in efficiency and interest has -been considerable, 
caused in a great measure by the increase in sentiment in favor of 
public schools by all classes, and the attention given to schools by 
school officers, amounting almost to enthusiasm. : 
2. A uniform:set of text-books has been adopted in nearly all 
the schools in the county. 
3. The graded schools in the county are those of Clarksville 
only, four in number. 
4, Nearly all the schools have. blackboards, but few have globes, 
maps or charts. 
5. Directors are impressed with the duty of visiting. schools, and 
generally visit weekly. 
6. All our teachers are deficient in methods. Teachers are se- 
lected to suit the capacity of the school on the certificate. The 
meagerness of the fund compels school officers to adopt this expe- 
dient. Teachers, generally, need normal training. 
7. Six new school-rooms have been erected for whites and six for 
blacks—twelve in all—three for graded schools. All were erected 
by private and. public funds, but are public school-houses. School- 
houses are generally miserably arranged, badly ventilated, and in 
many instances furnished poorly. 
8. A County Institute was started here soon after the system 
went into operation, and every effort was made by a few to make it 
a success; but teachers did not feel the necessity of attending the 
meeting, because the public did not demand it. In a published call 
for a meeting, it was stated that those teachers who attended would 
be favored in securing positions, but finding public opinion-averse 
to any changes in the ancient method of teaching, I failed to estab- 
lish a permanent Teachers’ Institute. I hope for better success in 
the future, and certainly favor compulsory attendance, not only in 
institutes, but also in schools. 
9. A want of funds sufficient to carry the schools on ten months 
in the year is the great obstacle in the way of success. As 
you are aware, the County Court has the fixing of the fund to 
supplement the state fund for this purpose. I have cause to hope
-P-A-G-E-135
139 
that this obstacle to our success will soon be removed by the press- 
ure of public opinion. : 
10. A school-tax of four mills would be voted by the people. 
11. The discipline is generally good. Registers and regulations 
for-the government of the school are promptly placed in the hands 
of every teacher, and he is required to keep the register according 
to the instructions given. School-houses are ordinarily .comfort- 
able. 
12. Owing to the delay in collecting occasioned: by the change in 
the assessment law, the Board of Education advised the opening of 
the schools on the first of September, where teachers were willing 
to take the schools and await the collections, without an increase of 
salary. In consequence the schools are opening irregularly.

No information besides that contained in the statistical tables has

the public schools are in rather a prosperous condition. 
  
MORGAN COUNTY. 
E. H. Booru, SupsrintenDENT, Wartburg. 
But few schools were in operation in this county during the year, 
owing to the fact that the funds had to be used to pay off debts

OBION COUNTY.

The Superintendent writes, October 1, 1875: 
“The suspension of the payment of taxes until November, by 
our last Legislature, damaged the public school system seriously in 
Obion county, as it threw our county in debt to the teachers, caus- 
eg

of fifteen to twenty per cent. on the “new issue (State Treasury: ;

we'ever have a good, practical. free-school system for. Tennessee, 
thatia: school law.must be devised and. planned by sensible, practi-.:.. 
eal school teachers, and: not. by lawyers, doctors, farmers and me+ - 
chanics, who know nothing in reference to an efficient school system, : 
We have done nobly in Obion, when we take into consideration all. - 
the difficulties under which we have labored. The:Lord has. assist- 
ed‘us., Our motto is Excelsior /. first, last, and all the time!” 
OVERTON COUNTY. 
Joun M. D. Mrrcueri, SuperinrenpENT, Livingston. 
Most of the money that was received in the last scholastic year 
was paid out on old school debts for the years 1873-74; and most 
of what was promised for the years 1874-5 is yet due and unpaid. 
Some of the school money for the year 1873 is yet in the hands of 
the tax-collector ; nearly. all: of that for the year 1874 is yet in the- - 
hands of the people, and will not be collected betore 1876, The:- 
Superintendent hopes, when all the money due is collected, there 
will be sufficient to pay the schools entirely out of debt. 
The Superintendent writes that there is a general uniformity of 
xt-books, but no graded schools in the county. Seventy-five per 
nt. of teachers are deficient in qualification. Public sentiment-in 
‘e county is favorable to free-schools, but is not on the increase, 
The people take but little interest in schools, and the proposition 
‘levy a tax for their support: has been voted down through the. 
tivity of a few enemies of the system, and the apathy of its pro- 
ssed friends.

' ‘parents or citizens. There is great deficiency in the competency of 
teachers ; not more than one-third being fully competent. No new 
“school-houses have been erected during the year. The houses are 
generally bad, and wholly unfit for winter use. The want of suffi- 
* cient funds is stated as the leading obstacle to the success of the 
schools. The public sentiment is unfavorable to free schools, unless 
‘the'State levies the tax. 
POLK COUNTY. 
' Rev. Jacop Mirzury, SuPERINTENDENT, Benton. 
Schools were suspended this year in the first. and seventh dis- 
“tricts of this county, and the funds used in erecting new school- 
“houses. ‘The schools in the eighth and tenth: districts were also 
suspended, owing to the unsettled affairs at Ducktown. 
‘The following’ is the special report of the Superintendent : 
‘1. In thé schools: opened there was great improvement-in pro- 
gress and success over last year, amounting to about twenty-five per 
cent. 
2. The University Series of text-books was adopted in 1873, and 
these books are used in four of the best schools, and partially in 
many others. : 
8. We have three graded schools. : . 
4, None of the schools have charts and globes. One-half (seven- 
teen) have blackboards. : 
5. Directors in a majority of the districts, and parents and. citi- 
zens in several, have: shown a laudable zeal-in visiting the schools. 
6. The teachers for the present year are. in general of fine moral 
’» character, ‘and of. very -passable ‘literary: qualifications, and of such 
grade of intellect as'to adapt them to the business. ‘Their greatest
-P-A-G-E-138
142 
deficiency is in manner of instruction and thoroughness of literary 
qualification. They lack system. So far as the branches required to 
be taught are concerned, they are more deficient in geography, his- 
tory and theory of teaching. 
7. Four new houses have been erected during this year, good 
and neat frame buildings, worth on an average about $250. Stoves 
and seats will enhance their value about $50 each. Total amount 
for new school-houses, when completed, about $1,200. 
8. No County Institute; would favor a rule enforcing their 
establishment and attendance upon them. 
* 9. In regard to the obstacles in the way of success of the public 
schools, you will allow me to suggest from a consciousness of .duty- 
and principle: 1st.-I regard a want of sufficient funds as primary. 
2. I regard a want of prompt payment to teachers essentially in the 
way. Young men of good minds and good qualifications will seek 
that business which will pay down. 3d. Too small salaries. Fine 
talents and moral worth command large rewards. Teaching requires 
our best men and women, and they should be well paid. 4th. I 
regard the principle of the law as good; its intention was to have 
the schools run five months; it has not furnished the means. It is 
true, it directs the people how to get it, but does not force them 
to act. If the State would give positive instructions in regard 
to the funds being used only in cases in which the law is fully 
complied with, it certainly would work better. I mean that the 
State pay over no money to any schools except such as have com- 
plied with the law. I insist on having the law complied with to 
the letter. Let the instructions be the full measure of the law, 
positively with no exceptions. Pay no money to any school that 
does not run five months. Make it emphatic. I made an effort 
last July to influence our County Court to tax the county enough 
to do this, but could not get them to do so. They would not even 
submit. it to the people. 5th. Diversity of text-books is another 
serious obstacle in the way. The State ought to adopt a uniform 
series. 8th. Our geographical lines are unfavorable ; our county 
is divided into mountains and flat lands—mostly mountains, with 
here and there a small settlement. In the flat lands there are two 
rivers which flow through the county, forming natural barriers ; 
these,-of course, cannot be removed, but they might be overcome 
giving isolated settlements,.schools, say.every two years. In.some
-P-A-G-E-139
143 
localities the population is too sparse, and the people too poor to 
run schools five months in the year every year, and the result is, 
they have no schools. I have been very particular to give you all 
the leading obstacles to the education of our people. There are 
some others, but they are peculiar; such, for instance, as the faet 
that some of the people of the county are really opposed to it, 
. 10. Public sentiment is favorable to free-schools, and is increasing, 
11. Discipline in most of the schools good; registers kept in all 
the schools ; school-houses generally sorry, great want of comfort. 
12. Schools opened generally first month in August; some later. 
Finally, an active experience of thirty years in the school-room 
in East Tennessee, has convinced me that success in educating the 
human mind depends mainly on system, the connection of ideas, 
and constant, though moderate, drill from the ages of six to eigh- 
teen or twenty-one years; the whole is generally accomplished in 
that time. If boys and girls are properly educated by the time 
they become twenty-one, they make good citizens, otherwise it is’ 
uncertain. By education I mean, physical, scientific and moral. 
PUTNAM COUNTY. 
H. 8. Boyp, SuperintrenDent, Cookeville. 
The Superintendent writes, November 3, 1875: 
“ Having had the county. redistricted last year, we have had some 
difficulty in putting the schools into good working order under the 
‘ new order of things ; but the people are becoming better acquainted 
with the new districts, and we think that difficulty will be nearly, 
if not entirely, obviated before another year. At the January term 
of our County Court, a tax was prescribed aud submitted to the 
people, but was voted down by them in March. This has caused 
our resources for school purposes to be very scanty this year; but 
we think the need of such help from the county is so thoroughly - 
felt and recognized, that our County Court will be induced to levy 
"a tax for school purposes next year. We are working to that end. 
~ Our schools have done exceedingly well, considering the great dis- 
advantages under which they have been conducted.”
-P-A-G-E-140
. 144 
The special. report of the Superintendent is as follows: 
1. The schools are equally as.good, and I think some better, than 
Jast year. , 
2, We have been examining and introducing some new books, 
but have not yet attained uniformity of text-books, but think it 
may be effected next year. We will try for it. : 
3. We have no graded schools in our county, and but one academy. 
4. About twenty-five, or two-thirds of our schools have black- 
boards, but none have charts or globes. / - 
5. Our Directors have given attention .to echools, and have at- 
tempted to have as good schools as they could under the cizgum— 
stances; but few have, been wantonly negligent. Parents and,citi- 
zens seem to desire good:schools. Some visit and try.to encoyrage 
schools; while the strong element that is continually waging, war 
- on the-common school system.seems to be weakening down consid- 
erably. 
6. The majority of our teachers are qualified to do good work in 
teaching, but with some there is a deficiency in qualification. 
7. There have been about. five new school-houses erected, two out 
of the school funds and three by private means. They are on a 
substantial but cheap plan. Some schools have been stopped in 
order to have money to finish houses. A great many of our houses 
are sufficiently comfortable for warm weather, but are not adequate 
to winter schools. 
8. A County Institute was organized in our county, but went 
down for want of interest on the part of those who should have 
attended it. It-never was attended by more than twenty-five per 
cent. of the teachers. We will attempt to reorganize next _year, 
and make it more useful. We desire to discuss the various,ques- 
tions touching upon school interests. If we can get properly 
organized we believe it would be highly beneficial to all concerned. 
in school matters, and’ to the public generally, as it would tend to 
. instruct and enlighten them, and that is what the masses: need at 
present. We believe that a compulsory rule on teachers to,attend 
the institute would he salutary, and would’ favor the same. : 
9. Our very leading obstacle: to the progress of schools, dp our 
county this year is the confused state. or, complicated. condition of
-P-A-G-E-141
145 
our school districts, on account of having the county redistricted 
in 1874, together with the want of school-money, as our county 
neglected to levy a tax, but submitted it to the vote of the people, 
who voted it down... 
10. Hitherto the public sentiment in our county has been ad- 
verse to free-schools, in consequence of which it has been rather an 
up-hill business to maintain good schools; but public sentiment 
seems to be changing slowly but surely in favor of schools and 
education. Debating societies are becoming more general, and 
public readings are being talked of. In short, the intellectual and 
moral tone of the people is becoming more elevated ; and I am 
satisfied the people only want to be instructed as to what is their 
best interest before public sentiment will be strongly in favor of 
free-schools. 
_ 11. Discipline in our schools has been tolerably good, and is 
improving. . The daily register has been kept, with few exceptions, 
admirably well. School-houses are not as comfortable as they 
should be, but have been improved some. 
12. Our schools opened Ist August generally, some few sooner, 
and some later. . 
RHEA COUNTY. 
Joun E. Pyorr, SUPERINTENDENT, Sulphur Springs. 
_ In its incipiency the school system was very unpopular in this 
county, but is now rapidly gaining public confidence. . All the best 
citizens endorse and approve it. The action of the County Court 
-in levying a tax in aid of the schools is heartily seconded by the 
people, and the tax will remain at what it is, or be increased. 
The Superintendent writes, November 30, 1875: 
“At first the school law met with violent opposition in this 
county ; now the people not only approve the Jaw, but are laboring 
zealously to sustain it. The county is divided into thirty scholastic 
districts, with a good, comfortable school-house within the reach of 
every student in the county, and nearly all of them have had 
excellent teachers this fall—fine working fellows they were, and 
labored for the interests of their patrons. In some instances the
-P-A-G-E-142
46 
schools were kept up five montlis; in others only three months. 
Closing out at three months was caused by the County Court failing 
to vote an additional tax for school purposes. This they refused to 
do until 1875, when they voted a tax of one dollar on the-poll and 
seven cents on the hundred dollars worth of property. This will 
enable us hereafter to have five months’ school in the year. We 
have no unitormity of text-book, which is badly needed; and’ as 
yet no Teachers’ Institute, but we will organize one some time this 
spring. Take all in all, I doubt whether there is a county in the 
State, away from the cities, excelling us. Iam proud of the pro- 
gress we have made. If there is any deficiency now, it is in me, 
and not in the schools, County Court, or the people. I will ask 
you, in your report to the Governor, if consistent with your views, 
to recommend that the teachers be graded through the whole 
English course, so that all English branches may be taught in 
public schools. 
Always enroll my county on the side of progress and advance- 
ment, so that if I have left out anything which was necessary for 
me to answer, my people may be placed on the right side. 
  
ROANE COUNTY. 
Cares F, Branse, SUPERINTENDENT, Kingston. 
The office of Superintendent of Public Instruction in this county 
has been filled by three different persons during the past’ year. 
This has prevented the making up of as full a report of school 
operations in the county as was desirable. For the same reason the 
interests of the schools have not fared as well as heretofore. Better - 
results hoped for the present year. 
  
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
James L. Warts, SUPERINTENDENT, Springfield. 
The Superintendent reports : 
1. The success of our schools is gradually growing from your to 
year. wes! 
   
-P-A-G-E-143

2. A series of text-books has been adopted and is being intro-- 
duced into the schools, as new books are bought. — 
3. No graded schools in the county. 
4, All schools have blackboards, or about all; none have globes 
or charts. 
5. Not much interest is manifested in the schools by Directors or 
citizens. 
6. About one-fourth of our teachers are well qualified; the qual- 
ification of about one-half is medium, and that of the remainder 
not good, or, in other words, poor. 
7. Several good new houses have been erected, partly from pri- 
vate means and partly from the school fund. The majority of the 
houses are good, but some are poor. 
8. Have no Institute. I would prefer those teachers who would 
attend an Institute to those who would not, and would favor such 
compulsion as that. 
9. Want of money is the great obstacle to success. 
10. Public sentiment in the main is favorable to free-schools, 
and is increasing in that direction. 
11. The discipline of the schools is good. 
12. Schovls open at different times during the year. 
RUTHERFORD COUNTY. 
A. J. Branbon, SUPERINTENDENT, Jordan’s Valley. 
The lowering of the school-tax, in January, from fifteen to five 
cents on the hundred dollars worth of property was very unfortu- 
nate for the public schools in. this county, especially for those in the 
town of Murfreesboro. The Superintendent writes that the public 
schools in. operation are doing well in the country and small towns. 
The teachers are well qualified, and every endeavor will be made to 
render the schools acceptable to the people.

SCOTT COUNTY. 
ALVIN Parker, SuPERINTENDENT, Huntsville. 
The Superintendent writes: 
« When I started out to organize the schools, I found nearly all 
of them destitute of blackboards and other conveniences for im- 
parting knowledge. ‘Directors, parents and citizens pay little atten- 
tion to the schools, and there is great deficiency in the competency 
of teachers. One school-house has been erected, and others re- 
paired, and all of our houses are being made comfortable for the 
next year. The want of sufficient means to‘'continue the schools a 
sufficient length of time to demonstrate their good effects in the 
education of the people, is the great obstacle in the way of their 
success. I am. warranted in believing that our County Court will, 
when the subject is properly presented to it, levy a tax for school 
purposes, to supplement the fund furnished by the State. The 
sentiment in favor of free public schools is increasing, and better 
things are hoped for in the future.” 
SEQUATCHIE COUNTY. 
Rev. A. D. Srewart, SUPERINTENDENT, Dunlap. 
The Superintendent writes, November 18, 1875, as follows: 
©The progress and success of the schools, this year, as compared 
with last, are about the same; I think a little better. A uniform 
series of text-books was adopted two years ago, and is still in use. 
Some interest is shown in the schools by Directors and citizens, but 
not enough. Our teachers are tolerably good;.no just cause for 
complaint exists on this score. There is no County Institute here, 
and I would not favor compulsory attendance of teachers if we had 
one. Lack of means and a want of light and interest on the part 
of the people, are the chief obstacles to success. The sentiment of 
the people of the county in regard to free schools is divided, some 
regarding them favorably and some unfavorably, I think the favor- 
able element on the increase. The schools opened this year in the 
month of July.” : : :

SEVIER COUNTY. 
D. G. Emert, SUPERINTENDENT, Sevierville. 
The attendance on the schools this year was fuller, and the prog- 
ress greater, than last, which the Superintendent attributes to im- 
provement in teaching. Considerable progress has been made in 
uniformity of text-books. There are as yet no graded schools. 
Directors and parents, in some districts, have shown considerable 
interest by visiting the schools, while in others this duty has been 
much neglected. There have been built five good frame school- 
houses during the year, large, and well put up. One was built en- 
tirely by public funds, and a small amount of public money was 
used in the erection of two others. About one-fourth of our school- 
-houses are wretched structures, but one-half are excellent buildings, 
and the remainder tolerably fair. The taxes are not collected and 
paid over promptly. This, with a lack of sufficient means to carry 
on the schools full five months of the year, is regarded as the main 
obstacle to entire success. A majority of the people are in favor of 
free schools, and are anxious to have them in operation at least five 
months. The discipline in the schools is reported very good. 
Schools open generally in August. 
SHELBY COUNTY. s 
Grorce B. Fierce, SuPERINTENDENT, Memphis. 
The Superintendent writes as follows, under date of December 
7, 1875: . 
“T think the interest in public schools is perceptibly increasing. 
Ihave much confidence in the success of the system, and its early 
popularity and firm establishment. Some amendments to the school 
law might be advantageously made, in my opinion. Ist. I think 
we have too many school Directors. One to the district. would be 
better than three. 2d, I think the County Superintendent should 
have more power, and district Directors less. For instance: the 
location: of school-houses, the salaries of teachers, and the selection 
of text-books, should be subject to the Superintendent’s approval.
-P-A-G-E-146
150. 
I will, some time soon, elaborate these views, and give you my rea- 
sons therefor. : 
“T have just begun my visitations, which, so far, are encourag- 
ing. My main .effort will be to popularize the school system, and 
_ to induce the people to regard it as a permanent and the educational 
system of the county—that upon which they must-rely for the in- 
struction of the children of the county. So far I am satisfied we 
have too many schools to the district. My policy is to establish 
larger schools and run them longer.” 
- SMITH COUNTY. 
W. T. Taytor, SuPERINTENDENT, Carthage. 
The Superintendent writes: 
““There is some antipathy to public schools in this county, an@ 
the County Court would not levy any tax for this year, but I hope 
to be able at the January term to succeed in getting a tax levied 
sufficient to carry on our schools at least five months. I think the 
best way to procure funds to carry on our public school system is 
for the Legislature to levy a tax sufficient, and hope this will be 
done at the next session.” 
STEWART COUNTY. 
IR. LavRENcE, SUPERINTENDENT, Indian Mound. 
The Superintendent writes, under date of October 1, 1875: 
“Our schools were opened under very favorable auspices, but. 
chills and fevers became prevalent soon after their opening, and 
nearly broke up some of them. But for this visitation there would 
have been a marked improvement over last year’s operations, I 
have the pleasure of reporting more enthusiasm on the part of. the 
people, and less opposition to our public school system. We ate 
confident that the people feel a deeper interest in the cause of edu 
cation in Stewart county than heretofore. We have a Teachers”
-P-A-G-E-147
151 
Association organized, and our most prominent educators are mem- 
bers of the same. We meet monthly. We are working harmoni- 
ously together, and are endeavoring to press onward and upward to 
the goal of eternal fame.” 
The following is the special report of the Superintendent: 
1. Our schools exhibit a considerable improvement over last 
yéar’s operations. There was an unprecedented amount of sickness 
in this county the past year, which greatly impeded the progress of 
our schools; but for that there would have been a greater improve~ 
ment. 
2.. We have nearly attained to uniformity in the use of text-books. 
A few districts are not yet-uniform. I think that in the course of 
another year we will attain to uniformity. 
3. No graded schools in our county. 
4, Nearly all our schools have blackboards, but no globes or 
charts. 
5. Directors, as a general thing, have been remiss in duty. Some 
few, however, have manifested considerable interest, and have been 
prompt in visiting schools. A few of our citizens and parents have 
manifested the same interest. 
6. As to teachers, a majority are below first-class, therefore the 
deficiency may be regarded as great. 
7. No new school-houses erected the last year. Our school-houses 
are generally in good condition. 
8. I succeeded, after many efforts, in getting a Teachers? Associa- 
tion organized, to meet once a month, About ten per cent. of the 
teachers attended a few meetings, but at present we can not get an 
attendance. Our exercises consisted in Essays and Orations, which 
would have been advantageous to teachers if their attendance could 
have been secured. I would most certainly favor a rule enforcing 
attendance on these institutions. 
9. Opposition to the school tax, levied for the support of public 
schools, and a want of interest in the schools, are the great obstacles 
in the way of success. 
10. Public sentiment is favorable to free schools, and this senti- 
ment is incréasing. , 
“11, In nearly all the schools the discipline is good. Teachers 
have kept their Registers correctly, and school-houses are generally 
comfortable.

152 
SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
- W. H. Gresimr, STPERINTENDENT, Union Depot. 
The Superintendent’s special report is as follows: 
1. Our schools are all crippled, I may say almost ruined. At the 
outset it was calculated that we would have about four dollars per 
scholar. Actual receipts fall more than fifty per cent. below that 
amount.. The result was, nearly all the districts were involved in 
debt. These things have rendered the system unpopular. Under 
the pressure of this unpopularity, our County Court failed to levy 
any school tax for 1875. Therefore the “ progress and success” of 
the schools of our county are not very flattering. 
2. But little progress has been made toward uniformity in text- 
books. It would be almost useless, at the present time, to attempt 
any thing of the kind. 
3. We have one graded school (Peabody). 
4. Some three or four of our teachers use charts ; none globes, 
and not exceeding twenty-five per cent. use blackboards. 
5. Very little interest has been manifested on the part of Di- 
rectors and parents in visiting the schools. 
6, The teachers who are now seeking for public schools in-our 
county are very deficient in every thing calculated to popularize the 
system. I do not include all; there are some exceptions. The best 
teachers have returned to the private system, or have quit the pro- 
fession. Those who teach in private schools can hardly live. 
- 7. Some school-houses of very creditable appearance have been 
built by private contributions, and some have been improved by 
using school funds. The general condition of our school-houses 
does not come up with the intelligence of our people. Many of our 
citizens aré ready and willing to build good school-houses, but will 
not do.so until we have sufficient tax levied to run the schools from 
five to ten months in the year, or have no distribution of money 
from county or State. : : 
8. We have established a County Institute, which aims to meet 
annually. In addition thereto we hold Primary Institutes. We 
met ip four points in the county during the last scholastic year. 
Teachers who attended found it very advantageous. Not exceeding
-P-A-G-E-149
153 
fifty per cent. of the teachers were present at these meetings. For 
the success of our Institutes I feel very much indebted to Prof. H. 
Presnell, of Washington county. J would favor a rule enforcing 
compulsory attendance at our Institutes, from the fact that those who 
most need drilling stay away as a general thing. 
9. I regard ignorance and deep-rooted prejudice as the chief ob- 
stacles to the success ef our schools. 
10. The public sentiment is not very favorable to free schools, 
and not favorably increasing. 
11. I found the discipline in most of the schools good. Many 
teachers are careless in keeping their Registers. Many of the school- 
houses are uncomfortable. Some have open floors, only the roof 
above, and very often no fire-wood, except that gathered by teacher 
and pupils. : 
12. No established time for opening schools. 
53. We have had some defalcation, and some misappropriation of 
funds. The salary of the County Superintendent (about $225 in 
cash) is not sufficient to enable him to keep up all these things as 
he should. It is to be hoped that our County Court will employ a 
man for this office, so that he can devote his time to it exclusively, 
and give him an office at the court-house. 
I would be in favor (and also many of our citizens) of levying a 
tax sufficient to run the schools for ten months in the year—have 
winter and summer sessions. Jet us have compulsory attendance. 
We invade the family circle and send the young convict to the pen- 
itentiary, or perhaps to the gallows, and why not take the child, 
place it in the school-room, and prepare it to avoid the former ca- 
lamity? 
We need a school law with life in it, and the Legislature must be 
the life-giving power instead of our County Courts. Less expended 
for pauperism and centennial demonstrations, and more upon the 
minds of the children. Let the school system be established upon 
a basis that will insure its success, and prosperity will be sure to 
follow.

The Superintendent regards the progress of the schools as very 
encouraging. There is partial uniformity in text-books, but no 
great progress has been made in this respect. There are several 
graded schools in the county, and a number of good school-honses 
have been erected. Great indifference and heglect on the part of 
Directors in the discharge of their duties, and lack of sufficient 
funds, are regarded as the leading obstacles to the success of the 
schools. 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
“Wa. Pagx, SUPERINTENDENT, Covington. 
The Superintendent makes the following special report : 
1. I cannot say what progress has been made by the schools over 
last year, as the former Superintendent made no report, and turned 
over no books or papers belonging to the office. My information, 
received unofficially, is, that they have greatly improved, how much 
I cannot say. 
2. A series of text-books was adopted some time ago, and now 
in use. : 
3, We have no graded schools. 
4. Fifty per cent. of the schools ate furnished with blackboard, 
but none of them have charts or globes. 
5. Directors have given but little attention to the schools, and 
parents and citizens less. However, much interest seems now to 
be manifested by: citizens in the cause of common schools. 
6. The deficiency in competency of teachers is great, say thirty- 
three per centum. 
7. Four new school-houses have been built during the year.; 
three from public funds, and one by private means. ‘They are good 
common buildings. . : 
' 8. [have tried to establish a Teachers’ Association. The attend- 
ance was poor, not exceeding ten per cent. of the teachers. The 
exercises consisted of the reading of essays on the different studies
-P-A-G-E-151
155 
required to be taught in the common schools. I cannot say whether 
I would favor a rule compelling teachers to attend institutes or not, 
as my mind is not made up on this point. 
9. Want of funds and want of competent teachers are the ob- 
stacles in the way of the success of the free-school system. 
10. Public sentiment is in favor of free-schogls, and this senti- 
ment is on the increase. : : 
11. Discipline in the schools is as good as could be expected. 
School-houses not all comfortable.

Special report of the Superintendent: 
1. The progress of free-schools is limited. There are but four 
schools opened for three months. Last year there were twenty-five. 
2. We have no uniformity with regard to text-books. 
3. Graded schools, none. 
4, Charts and blackboards, none. 
5. But little interest has been manifested by Directors and citi- 
zens in the schools. 
6. Character and competency of teachers but moderate. 
7. There have been two-school-houses erected the past year; one 
from private means, the other from the school fund. - 
8. We have no County Institute. 
9. I regard the leading obstacle to the success of the schools to 
be the lack of money. 
10, The public sentiment with regard to public schools is divided. 
Lam of opinion that a decided change in favor of the free-school 
system would take place if the means were furnished to carry on 
five months’ schools in the year, and school officers were prompt in 
the discharge of their duties. 
11. I have found the discipline in. some schools good, in others 
indifferent. Registers well kept. School-houses generally very 
indifferent. : 
12. Two of the schools in operation opened early in October, the 
other two in the present month.

UNION COUNTY. 
A. L. Mruuer, SuPERINTENDENT, Sharp’s Chapel. 
The Superintendent writes, September 28, 1875: 
“The present school law seems to meet the demands of the people 
of my county tolerably well. If the money could be collected in 
time to pay the teachers their salaries as soon as the schools are 
ended, we would -pronounce it one of the best of Jaws. The sus- 
pension of the collection of taxes by our last Legislature has gone 
far towards lessening the confidence of the teachers of this county. 
We need the money now due the county to pay off our indebted- 
ness at once that confidence may be restored.” 
The special report of the Superintendent is as follows: 
1. The progress of the schools in my county does not compare 
favorably with last year, owing to our indebtedness incurred by con- 
tinuing the schools too long for that year. There are no private. 
schools in Operation in the county. 
2. We have succeeded in establishing a uniform series of text- 
books. : 
3. No graded schools in the county. 
4. About one-half the schools have charts and blackboards. 
,5. Directors and parents have exhibited but very. little interest 
in visiting the schools. 
6. There is great deficiency in the competency of the teachers, 
say forty per cent. 
7. No new school-houses have been erected the past year. The 
general character of the houses is quite bad. Nearly all of our 
school-houses have been built by private means. 
8. No Institute has been established as yet, but we intend to 
organize one soon. 
9. T regard the inability of tax collectors to collect the funds in 
the proper time to pay the teachers their wages, as the leading ob- 
stacle to the success of the schools. We are one year behind, and 
have to wait for the money to be collected. 
10. The public sentiment is favorable to free-schools, and this 
sentiment is increasing every day. The present law i is fast gaining 
favor with the people.

11. In my inspection of the schools I have found the discipline 
tolerably good—much better than I had expected. The teachers 
have kept their registers in good style, as the law directs, and have 
shown great interest in the faithful ‘performance of their duties. 
At least two-thirds of the school-houses are poorly supplied with 
_everything necessary to render them comfortable.

VANBUREN COUNTY. 
G. B. Jouxson, SUPERINTENDENT, Rocky River. 
The Superintendent makes the following report: 
1. The schools are about as they were reported last year. 
2. As text-books, Webster’s Speller, McGuffey’s Readers, Pin- 
neo’s Grammars, Ray’s and Davies’ Arithmetics, are the books . 
generally used. 
3. We have but one graded school in the county. 
4. All our schools have blackboards, but none have globes or 
charts. : 
5. Directors have taken some interest in visiting the schools, but 
parents and citizens scarcely any. . 
6. The deficiency in the competency of teachers is about thirty 
per cent. 
7, There have been no school-houses erected during the year. 
The general condition of the houses is such that they wil] serve 
very well for summer use, but few of them are fit for use in winter. 
8. We have established no County Institute, but I think should 
have one, and that teachers should be compelled to attend in coun- 
ties where Institutes are organized. I would also be in favor of a 
law compelling parents to send their children to the public schools 
at least for three months in the year. 
9. The chief obstacle to the success of the schools is the indiffer- 
ence and want of interest in the people. 
10. Public sentiment is rather unfavorable to free schools, though 
I think it is gradually becoming more favorable to them.
-P-A-G-E-154

ers keep their registers daily. The school-houses have jbeen com- 
fortable for the season. 
12. Our schools open the first of September. 
  
WARREN COUNTY. 
R. R. Womack, SuPERINTENDENT, McMinnville. 
The Superintendent writes, October 1, 1875: 
“The present school law is growing in favor, and has many 
ardent supporters in our county. More interest has been mani- 
fested in the ptiblic schools than was ever before known. All sys- 
tems have heretofore been unpopular with us, but it is believed that 
if we will only give the present one a fair trial, it will prove emi- 
nently successful and satisfactory.” 
The following is the Superintendent's special report: 
1. The schools of my county have done much better this than 
last year; at least the people say so. 
2, There has been little change made as to text-books. 
3. There are a few graded schools in the county. 
4, About five schools have charts, and all have blackboards. 
5. Some of the Directors have evinced much interest, others not 
so much: Parents and citizens have taken more interest than ever 
before, but not half enough yet. 
6. We have some of as good educators as the State affords—some 
rather inferior, about ten per cent: 
7. About five good school-houses have been built during the 
year, by the conjunction of private and public money. A majority 
of our school-houses are in good condition, and new ones are now 
being built to supply the places of such as are not considered fit for 
use, . 
8. We have a County Institute, and it is a success. It meets 
every month at different points in the county. About thirty-three 
and a third per cent. of teachers attend the same, and are much 
benefitted. I would most emphatically favor a rule enforcing at- 
vendance upon these Institutes.
-P-A-G-E-155

9. Want of money is the only obstacle to the success of the 
schools. 
10. Public sentiment is int favor of schools in my county, and is 
decidedly on the increase. 
11. I have visited all my schools, and as a rule the discipline is 
tolerably good ; in a few schools very bad. The teachers kept their 
registers, as required by law. Most of the houses comfortable. 
Some schools have closed because their houses were not suitable for 
winter ; others because money is out; others, a few, are still in 
progress. 
12. Our schools open principally in July. 
WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
H. PREsNELL, SUPERINTENDENT, Jonesborough. 
The statistical report of the Superintendent is accompanied by 
the following remarks in explanation: 
“This report is incomplete. It does not show the actual amount 
expended in the public schools of the county. The report only 
shows that the amount received has been expended, whereas over 
twelve thousand dollars have been expended. The taxes have not 
yet been paid, and consequently a considerable debt is hanging over 
the county. The amount yet due the teachers ought to be embraced 
in the expenditures. I am assured that these debts will be paid at 
an early day. The schools had fair success, considering that the 
year was unfavorable in a financial point of view.” 
The general report of the Superintendent contains much valuable 
and interesting information, and is here inserted in full: 
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. 
We have not opened as many public schools this year as we did 
last. The schools, however, are better, and the teaching is better. 
The teachers are putting forth commendable effort. The postpone- 
ment of the collection of the taxes has given us trouble. The teach-
-P-A-G-E-156
160 
ers have not been paid, and of course there is more or less complaint. 
Every district has schools, either public or private. We have en- 
couraged the opening of private schools’ We deemed this necessary 
in consequence of an inadequate school fund. The teachers of’ the 
private schools keep registers and make their regular monthly re- 
ports, the same as the teachers of the public schools. They are 
giving satisfaction in most cases. Our object is to free the districts 
from debt, so that we can begin anew next year under the new dis- 
trict system. 
TEXT-BOOKS. 
We have adopted a uniform series of text-books for the county. 
It has cost much trouble to accomplish this, but the advantages to 
the teachers, to the schools, and to the people, are much greater than 
most persons suppose. We have been trying the graded system in 
the country schools, and with some success, too. Ten graded schools 
are in operation. In some of them the grading is not very close, 
but notwithstanding this much good has resulted from the effort. 
Reading Charts are found in a majority of the schools. Globes in 
four, out-line maps in eight, blackboards in nearly every school- 
house in the county. 
SCHOOL-HOUSES, 
Upon this subject much might be said, much ought to be said. 
Some of our school-houses are not fit to be occupied. Some of our 
people think any thing will do for a school-house, and act on this 
principle. School-houses are generally pretty good indexes of the 
educational sentiment of a community. If some of our neighbor~ 
hoods were judged by this standard, the conclusion would be that 
education was at a low ebb. The old log school-house is rapidly 
passing away. So isthe old slab seat. Hach hashad itsday. The 
new school-house, with its comforts, conveniences, and advantages, 
will take the place of the old. The new style of school furniture is 
gradually taking the place of the primitive seat. Ventilation is a 
subject of consideration now among the Directors.’ The new school- 
rooms have hat and cloak-rooms, ample, blackboard surface, wall 
maps and mottoes. In locating, building. and seating, great im- 
_ provement’ has taken place. The school system has wrought won-
-P-A-G-E-157

derful ch'anges. We get a glimpse of what might be accomplished - 
under favvorable circumstances. The school money has been spar- 
ingly used in building houses. The people in the districts prefer to 
furnish the means for building the house, and to expend the public 
fund in the payment of teachers’ salaries. 
SCHOOL DIRECTORS. 
We have fifty-seven of these officers in the county. Upon the 
efficiency of these officers much depends. The districts which have 
active Directors seldom fail to have good schools. It has been but 
a short time since school Directors could have been found unable to 
write their names. Even now many men fill the office who have 
but little idea of what a school is, or how it ought to be managed. 
One of our troubles is the inefficiency of these officers. The law is 
deficient in that it requires them to be elected. They ought to be 
appointed by the County Superintendent. A better class of officers 
would be secured in this way than can be obtained by the provisions 
of the law. Distriet supervision is a matter of great importance. 
There are certain times when every school needs a little care. The 
Directors are the proper ones to set things in order. 
SCHOOL JOURNALS, 
The Tennessee School Journal has a good circulation in the county. 
Each of the nineteen School Boards has a copy, and more than 
thirty teachers read it. Teachers are reading and informing them- 
selves. Teaching is still made a stepping-stone to something better. 
This, however, is not so much the case as formerly. Teaching is 
becoming a profession with many. Nearly every teacher in the 
county is reading some professional work. The number of incom- 
petent teachers is gradually growing less, but the number is still too 
great. 
TEACHERS’ IN! STITUTES. 
A well conducted Teachers’ Institute is indispensable to the suc- 
cess of our free-schvol system. It affords teachers an opportunity 
of self-improvement. It begets among the teachers 4 kind of esprit 
de corps which can be obtained in no other way at such trifling ex-":: 
pense. ‘Teaching is a science; and it must be taught as such. Lt 
is no less an art, and as such must be taught. How can the teach- 
11
-P-A-G-E-158
162 
ers be brought up to the desired standard? This is ag 
tion. We know of no means better adapted for this pur 
the Institute. In the absence of Normal Schools they are 
      
known sea. We have two Institutes annually, one in August and 
the other in January. ighty per cent. of our teachers attend. If 
we have had any success in our school operations, we are indebted 
largely to the Teachers’ Institute for that success. 
INCOMPETENT TEACHERS. 
Under this head we class most of our difficulties. Incompetent 
teachers are the great obstacles in the way of educational progress. 
This difficulty meets us on every hand. How can we improve the 
schools? If not by improving the teachers, how then? The idea 
that anybody can teach school still prevails in many localities. A 
good teacher in a community is like leaven hid away in a lump of 
meal: the whole neighborhood becomes leavened. The old school- 
house changes its appearance. The school interest grows strong and 
vigorous. The opposition to free schools disappears. ‘Life, energy, 
and activity prevail in the school and out of it. A good teacher 
seldoin fails to teach a good school, while an incompetent one rarely 
ever fails to teach a poor school. How can we secure competent 
teachers for the public schools? 
COLORED SCHOOLS. 
There are over five hundred colored children in the county. A 
large number of these is practically excluded from the public schools. 
These children are scattered over the county, a few in this and a few 
in that section. We have no colored teachers competent to teach 
even the rudiments. There are no school-houses. What we ought 
to do under the circumstances we are often at a loss to know. The 
amount of money due them is small. The difficulty of securing 
competent instructors for them is great. The necessity of educating 
the colored people is so apparent that. none will, for a moment, 
doubt the expediency of making all legitimate efforts for accom- 
plishing the object. So we have thought it best to call in all the 
money due the colored people, and expend it in two or three schools, 
Jonesboro, Johnson City, and Limestone. About sixty per cent. of
-P-A-G-E-159
163 : 
the population can be accommodated at these three points. We 
have ordered that no public schools be opened for the colored chil- 
dren except at these points. Our object is to concentrate our efforts 
and utilize our means. We have planned a 
NORMAL SCHOOL 
for them at Jonesboro. Mr. Yardley Warner has purchased the 
Holston Male Institute for this purpose. The building, including 
school furniture, cost $3,600. Possession will be given the Ist of 
January, 1876. The school will be opened at once, There are two 
objects in view: first, the training of teachers; secondly, the estab- 
lishment of a school to supply a local want. We think we are for- 
tunate in having Mr. Warner, who is doing such a noble work for 
the colored people, come to our relief. Without help from abroad, 
the condition of the colored people is almost hopeless. 
PUBLIC SENTIMENT. 
Free schools are popular in this county. Some men oppose them, 
but the opposition is rather an advantage than a disadvantage. Both 
our county papers, the Herald & Tribune and the Jonesboro Journal, 
have educational columns, There is a good feeling toward our 
schools. There is much room for improvement, of course, but we ~ 
have some encouragement after all. The office of County Superin- 
tendent meets with less and less opposition every year. The school- 
houses are in better condition, the teachers are doing better work, 
the people understand the school law better, and appreciate it more 
highly, and a better condition of things exists in every respect. The 
private schools are completely under the control of the school sys- 
tem, and look up to the public schools. 
OUR NORMAL. 
It is proposed to open a Normal School in Jonesboro next sum- 
mer. The demand for experienced teachers is such as to warrant 
the undertaking. We feel that some decided steps should be taken 
to exclude incompetent teachers from the school-room. To improve 
the schools we must improve the teachers. To elevate the standard 
of education, the teachers themselves must be lifted to a higher 
plane. Our teachers need models, for with many teaching is a kind 
of hap-hazard work. We need method, system, and intelligent effort
-P-A-G-E-160
. - 164 
in the school-room. Careless teaching leads to careless study. We 
can see the influence of it on our farms, in our shops—everywhere. 
Intelligent labor is our great want, but how shall we obtain it? 
- Good schools and efficient teachers will-have great influence toward 
inducing habits of industry, tlirift, and enterprise. The teacher is 
an important factor in our society. How important that he be a 
true teacher. . 
WAYNE COUNTY. 
C. M. Tompson, SupERINTENDENT, Martin’s Mills. 
The Superintendent accounts for the meagerness of his statistical 
report thus: “Only five districts reported the average daily at~ 
tendance ; five the average number of months taught, and five the 
average amount paid teachers. One district did not report at all. 
The other districts reported the scholastic population, and nothing 
more.” : 
'” Schools were opened during the year, we believe, in all the dis- 
tricts of the county; but with the exception of the figures in the 
statistical tables, and the above few words from the Superintendent, 
we have not been able to obtain any further information concerning- 
their operations. 
WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
B. J. Rogerts, SUPERINTENDENT, Ralston Station. 
The Superintendent writes, November 29, 1875 as follows: 
“In regard to our public schools, I have to report, that we have: 
had but few this year, as compared with last year, owing to the 
fact that most of. the Board of Directors went in debt last year in 
order to extend their schools. I have cautioned them against this 
course in the future. We have as yet made but little progress to- 
wards a uniformity of text-books; am doing my best in that direc- 
tion. We have had no graded schools in the county. Most of the 
schools have blackboards, but rione have charts or globes.
-P-A-G-E-161
165 
Directors and parents exhibit some, but not enough, interest in 
visiting our svhools. As a general thing our corps of teachers are 
competent for the work ; and those who are trying to make them- 
selves 80. 
No new school-houses have been built this year. Most of those. 
we have are very inferior, though we have a few very good ones. 
We will hold our first County Institute on the first Saturday in 
January next. 
T have failed thus far in my efforts to get a county tax levied for 
school purposes, but think with a little assistance I will succeed 
this time. I regard a want of funds sufficient to prolong our 
schools to four or five months each year ag the leading obstacle to 
our success, and the only cause of prejudice against our system. 
Public sentiment is very favorable to free-schools, and I venture 
the opinion that if our next Legislature would levy a tax sufficient 
to keep our schools in operation for five months in each year, the 
people would give it their cheerful support. As it is, the Legisla- 
ture being unwilling to shoulder the responsibility, has divided it 
with the County Courts, which in turn shifted it off upon the people, 
who, being ignorant of its importance, refuse to vote a tax upon 
themselves for school purposes. The result of this is, that our 
public schools, at least in this city, have not been a success. 
The discipline is not very good, and I find the teachers very 
careful about keeping their daily registers. We have no particular 
time for commencing our schools, each board of Directors selecting 
such time as will best suit the convenience of its own neighborhood.” 
WHITE COUNTY. 
Dr. W. 8. FinpLey, SuPERINTENDENT, Sparta. 
1. The public schools, as compared with last year, are much 
better, and their progress and success highly commendable. Our 
County Court levied a tax for ‘school purposes, in consequence of 
which our schools have continued longer, our teachers been more | 
hopeful of remuneration, and more attentive and energetic, and- 
their labors have been blessed with more rapid progress of the 
pupils.
-P-A-G-E-162
166 
2. No great progress has been made towards uniformity in text- 
books. Would it not be better for the State Superintendent to 
prescribe the text-books, and compel uniformity throughout the 
State; or at least make the recommendation of County Superin-. 
tendents obligatory, and thereby cause uniformity in the county ? 
The want of uniformity imposes great ‘unnecessary labor upon the 
teachers. 
3. One graded school. 
4. None of our schools are provided with charts or globes, yet 
we are looking to an effort to do so. Nearly all have blackboards.. 
5. Directors take but little interest in visiting the schools: in 
this, however, there is great improvement on last year—a few have- 
been quite diligent, and those schools have been the most efficient 
in the county. Parents and citizens, except in two or three locali- 
ties, seldom visit the schools, and take but little interest in them. 
Some improvement on last year in this respect. 
6. Our teachers, with one or two exceptions, have been energetic, 
faithful and efficient, and will compare favorably with those of any 
‘portion of the State. 
7. No new school-houses built this year; some little repairing 
has been done. About one-half of the school-houses are in good: 
condition ; some of the others wretchedly. out of repair. By the 
next school term I think the citizens will make repairs, and replace 
dilapidated buildings with new houses. Some of the houses are too. 
small, not sufficiently ventilated, and poorly lighted. 
8. We organized a Teachers’ Association early in August, which 
‘meets monthly during the school term, and every two months dur-. 
ing vacation. About half the teachers attend regularly, and seem- 
to be much interested ‘in the exercises, which consist in an address. 
and essay from one of the members upon some subject connected 
with the public schools, and the discussion of questions on school 
government, imparting instruction, and the interests of public 
schools generally. I find these meetings to. be of incalculable ad- 
vantage to the teachers, emulating them to good works, encourag- 
ing them to energetic efforts, and a source of improvement. I 
"think there should be a rule establishing institutes, and. compell- 
ing teachers to attend them, and that the rule should be general 
throughout the State. 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
167 
9. I regard the want of money, and an enterprising educational 
spirit, as the main obstacles in the way of public schools. Public 
sentiment is divided on this subject, but I think the sentiment is 
.turning in their favor. The State levy of one mill is too small; 
would it not be more of a State system if the Legislature would 
levy a tax sufficient, so that an additional tax by the county would 
be unnecessary? Teachers must be paid. It is impossible to get 
money without a tax-levy. Public schools must educate the public 
mind; hence there must be a tax levy, or we must live in ignorance. 
County Courts are generally slow to make county levies, and when 
made, they are generally insufficient. Our county levied a tax. 
We heartily thank them for it, and hope they will act as wisely in 
the future, and trust that their appropriations may be more liberal, 
and commensurate with the importance of educating their people. 
The tax-collector is slow getting up the tax and paying over the 
school fund to the Trustee, and the fact that the State does not pay 
the warrants issued by it, so that it may be distributed to the teach- 
ers, is discouraging to them and fatal to the school system. 
10. Public sentiment is opposed to free-schools, but is undergoing 
a change. 
11. Discipline in the schools good; registers kept regularly ; 
school-houses only tolerably comfortable. 
12. Schools opened from July 29th to August 2d. I am en- 
deavoring to ascertain the feasibility of commencing schools later, 
say ist November, instead of as before, in July. Protracted meet- 
ings, (many schools held in churches), fodder-pulling, cotton-pick- 
ing, as they have been running, interfere greatly, and, in some 
instances, ruin the school entirely. Houses could be made com- 
fortable at little cost and labor. 
WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
Rey. J. N. McDonaup, SuPERINTENDENT, Franklin. 
Unparalleled sickness during the school season very materially 
impaired the efficiency of the schools in this county. There are a 
number of first-class teachers in the county, but the demand far 
exceeds the supply. With all the disadvantages, however, the
-P-A-G-E-164
168 
Superintendent believes the efficiency of the schools will compare 
favorably with any previous year. 
Special report of the Superintendent : 
1. In some instances the length of school terms was shortened 
by the non-payment of taxes ; yet I think our progress and success 
have been equal to that of last year. 
2. We have adopted a uniform series of text-books, and they are 
being rapidly worked into the schools. 
3. Only one graded school in the county. 
4, One-half the schools have blackboards, but none have charts 
or globes. - 
5. About one-half of our Directors, are exhibiting deep interest 
in the schools, but there is very little interest manifest by parents 
and citizens. . 
6, About two-thirds of our white teachers are fully up to- the 
requirements of the law. Only about one-third of the colored 
teachers meet the requirements. We are making some progress in 
this respect. 
7. No new school-houses have been erected. While we.have 
| ouses, the majority of them are a reproach to an intel- 
ligent people. 
8. We have no County Institute. 
9. Want of funds and of thoroughly efficient teachers, together 
with the lack of punctual attendance on the schools by the pupils, 
are, in my judgment, the leading obstacles to success. 
10. I think the public sentiment in this county decidedly favor- 
able to free-schools, with a continued growing tendency. 
11 TI have the discipline in the schools generally good; yet | ina 
number of instances there is great room for improvement. I find 
much trouble in having the registers kept correctly. Many of our 
school-houses are wholly unfit for winter use. 
12. A large majority of our schools open in August and Sep- 
tember. 
  
WILSON COUNTY. 
T. H. Freeman, SUPERINTENDENT, Mt. Juliet. 
The County Court, at its adjourned April term, voted, by a small 
Pace: the levy of a school-tax of one dollar on the poll, one
-P-A-G-E-165
169 
mill on the dollar of property, and a tax on privileges equal to 
one-fourth of the amount levied by the State. Some dissatisfaction 
having arisen because of alleged irregularity in the proceedings, 
the chairman of the Court, though a zealous advocate of the tax, 
decided not to enforce its collection. 
The Superintendent makes the following special report : 
1. With fewer schools in progress, and less money to defray ex- 
penses, our schools have been equally as successful as those of last 
year. 
2. I have recommended a uniform course of text-books, and 
have advised its adoption in all the schools; but wishing to avoid 
any appearance of extravagance in our schools, I have not persist- 
ently urged it; therefore, but little has been done towards uni- 
formity.. 
3. There are no graded public schools in our county. 
4. About seventy-five per centum of our schools are supplied 
with blackboards ; none with charts or globes. 
5. Parents have manifested but little inclination to visit the 
schools; while Directors, especially treasurers, have shown increased 
interest. ° 
6. While at least fifty per centum of our teachers are deficient, 
either from a want of experience, or of proficiency in the public 
school curriculum, they have generally been faithful and industrious 
in the discharge of their duties. 
7. Two new school-houses of inferior grade have been built the 
past year; one by private means, and one from the school fund. 
But few of our school-houses are in good condition, while many of 
them are unfit for use in winter. 
8. I have established an Institute in our county, and do not 
believe it would be a success without the adoption of a rule enforcing 
compulsory attendance upon teachers, which I would certainly 
favor. : 
9. I regard the want of a fund sufficient to give our public school 
system a fair trial, the leading obstacle to its success. A fund 
sufficient to keep up our schools five months in the year will secure 
the services of a better grade of teachers, who can command the 
respect of the people, and wield an influence in favor of the public
-P-A-G-E-166
170 
school system, and many other results would naturally follow. A 
second great barrier to succeed in our public schools is a disposition 
on the part of the people to demand a multiplicity of schools, and 
a disposition on the part of Directors to satisfy that demand by the 
organization of an undue number of small schools, employing. as a 
necessity inferior teachers, at low prices, to the utter exclusion of 
better teachers and better schools. As a remedy for the above evil, 
I would respectfully suggest the adoption of a measure requiring 
the dismissal of all public schools falling under a certain average 
daily attendance, say twenty. Schools of doubtful stability would 
then be abandoned, and concentration would be the result. 
10. Public sentiment in our county is nearly equally divided, 
with a small majority, I think, in favor of public schools. 
11. In our inspection of schools we have found the discipline 
generally good. We have discovered several delinquencies in 
keeping the register, which we have studiously sought to correct. 
While we have found the school-houses generally bad, some are in 
very good condition. : 
12. Our schools, with a few exceptions, commence in the months 
of August and September.

EDGEFIELD. 
W. P. Marks, SUPERINTENDENT. 
The Superintendent reports as follows: 
“The scholastic population is 1,447, and of that number 1,060 
were enrolled in the-public schools. The average monthly attend- 
ance was 709. The aggregate cost of maintaining the schools for 
the ten months was $7,959 09, which gives the moderate sum of” 
$1 123 per scholar per month. Our teaching force consisted of 
twelve regular teachers, with one assistant, and one teacher of vocal 
music, Instrumental music was also taught to a large class of 
young ladies, they defraying the expense. At the commencement 
of the year our principal schools were opened in an elegant, com- 
modious building, erected at the expense of $15,000. : 
Our schools are yet comparatively young, and contending with 
many obstacles, yet a high standard of scholarship has been at- 
tained, and each year shows a marked advancement on the preced- 
ing. Our schools are steadily rising in public favor, until there is 
no discord on the great question of educating the masses at public 
expense. Their usefulness in preparing our youth for the great 
drama of life, is plainly visible, and if judiciously managed, they 
must become the great popular channel of education.”

fying to note the degree of zeal and energy displayed by the citi- 
zens in their liberal support of the schools, notwithstanding the 
“hard times’ and lack of commodious buildings and convenient 
school appliances, throw many obstacles in the way of rapid ad- 
vancement. One hundred thousand dollars might be well expended

as the growth of the schools require. So recent has been the organy

According to a census taken recently, by a detail from the police 
force, there are 17,103 white, and 9,911 colored people, in the city. 
The scholastic census shows that there are 5,759 white, and 3,092 
colored children, of legal school age, and there were 3,066 of the 
former and 932 of the latter enrolled in the schools. In other 
words, while something more than’ 33} per cent. of both the gross. 
and scholastic population is composed of blacks, less than 25 per 
cent. of the number enrolled in the schools are of that class.

A retrospect of the year’s work brings into view defects that may 
be remedied, perfections still unattained, serious obstacles to be 
removed ; but at the same time there are indisputable evidences of 
genuine progress. In punctuality, attendance, deportment, scholar- 
ship, enrollments, improvement in school buildings, and the increase 
of popular appreciation, the record of the year is brighter than any 
that has preceded it in the history of the schools. 
It is greatly to be regretted that a system so prolific of good 
results, and pregnant with the highest promise for the future, should 
be threatened with even temporary interruption from financial em- 
barrassment. Let us hope that this evil will be averted, and by 
means that may make it at last a blessing in disguise. Whatever’ 
brings home to those immediately benefitted by schools the respon-' 
sibility of maintaining and directing them, increases their efficiency 
and usefulness. 
Like governments, systems of education that are impressed upon 
a people by external power, or which are the creations of abstract 
theory, contain within themselves the seeds of early decay; but 
those which are founded on the practical needs of the time and 
place, and enjoy the full sympathy of the community, commonly 
last. Hence we are consoled in contemplating the weary progress 
made in establishing a system of. State public instruction. Better 
that it die in its inception if it do not contain the elements of per- 
manency and usefulness. But if it does, in the face of the opposi- 
tion of purblind bondholders and landlords, and in spite of the 
blundering of selfish politicians and impecunious office-seekers, it 
will at last triumph in the affections and strong support of the 
people. Daily the conviction is deepening that we must escape 
from our comparatively helpless and dependent condition by devel- 
oping our great natural resources. To do this, we must have intel- 
ligent and skillful operatives. To create such out of the pliant 
material furnished in our growing youth, as well as to attract them 
to our borders from abroad, we must have public schools. It is 
indispensable, too, that they be good schools—schools in which no 
sickly sentimentality, no fashionable ideas of respectability, no 
sickly taste for shoddy shams or empty honors are inculcated, but 
thoroughly practical schools, in which the pupils shall be led to the 
harmonious natural development of all their powers, and in which
-P-A-G-E-176
180 
they will be educated not only to realize the necessity for labor as- 
the present means of success, but to honor it as the essential con- 
dition of future progress. 
No nobler sentiment can inspire the hearts of parents and teach- 
ers, and no higher duty devolves upon them, than to cultivate habits 
of steady industry in children, and raise them to work; nor can 
they too often set before them as exemplars those 
“Who said not to their Lord, as if afraid, 
“Here is thy talent in a napkin laid; 
But labored j in their sphere, as those ‘who jive 
In the delight that work alone can give.”

CIRCULARS. 
‘CIRCULAR ADDRESS OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
STATE SUPERINTENDENT’S OFFICE, 
NasHVILLE, JuNE 1, 1875. 
EFFECT OF THE AMENDMENTS. 
The repeal of Sections 45 to 49 inclusive, of the School Law, 
leaves the Directors of school districts, as they now are, without 
power to levy any district tax for purchasing real estate and school 
furniture, for prolonging schools and building school-houses, and 
for payment of necessary school expenses. The effect of it is to 
throw the Directors upon the resources derived from State and 
‘county taxes, to carry out these objects. They may, and ought, to 
do any and all of these acts, with the funds provided for these pur- 
poses by the State and county, and apportioned to the respective 
districts. Thus, by Section 20, sub-section ’5, one of the duties of 
School Directors is declared to be, “to use the school fund, appor- 
tioned to their district, derived from donations or other sources, in 
such manner as will promote the interest of public schools in their 
respective districts.” 
It is believed that but few school districts in the State have here- 
tofore exercised this power, now repealed ; and, therefore, the re- 
pealing Act will not materially reduce the amount of available . 
school money. .
-P-A-G-E-178
182 
STATE POLL TAX. 
The amendment to the law which makes it incumbent on the 
Revenue Collector to pay over the State poll tax to the County 
Trustee (instead of ‘the State Treasurer), to be thence distributed to 
the districts, should stimulate those counties which have heretofore 
failed to pay into the treasury their pro rata, to hereafter collect 
theirjust share from their own tax-payers; and it will operate more: 
equitably upon such counties as have heretofore paid more than 
their pro rata, inasmuch as they will hereafter secure the whole. 
amount collected by them. 
UNEXPENDED BALANCES. 
The amendment which requires the County Trustee to place to- 
the credit of each district the unexpended balance of each year, 
allows said districts to use the same for school purposes, on the next 
year, thus giving to each district a fairer scope for improvement. 
The amendments do not impair the efficiency of the School Law ;: 
and though there are changes which might have been desirable, it 
is incumbent upon all who are officially connected with it, to exert 
their utmost energies in rendering all practical provisions contained 
in it, active and vital, during the next two years, with a view to 
procuring such further amendments hereafter as are necessary to. 
its complete success, and for the further purpose of commending it 
to the acceptance of the people, by extracting from it the utmost 
possible benefits contemplated by its framers. There is no law 
which is so dependent upon a favorable public sentiment for its 
successful operation, as well as for its continuance. It, therefore, 
behooves those who have in charge the execution of its provisions, 
to discharge their responsible duties with the highest and most con- 
scientious regard to the great and beneficent ends to be attained... 
With this view, I recommend and enjoin upon the County Superin~ 
tendents the following measures, viz.: 
CONSOLIDATED SCHOOLS. 
That, wherever practicable, they advise the district Directors to. 
“make contracts of consolidation with the trustees, teachers, or 
other authorities of academies, seminaries, colleges or private. 
schools, by which the public schools may be taught in such institu-
-P-A-G-E-179
183 
tions; Provided, that the branches of study designated in the 31st 
seetion of this Act, shall be taught, free of any charge, in such con- 
solidated schools; and, provided further, that the authority of the 
County Superintendent, district Directors, and other school officers 
over those studying such branches, shall be as full and ample as in 
the ordinary public schools,” as provided for by the 33d section of 
the School Law. 
Such consolidations as are contemplated by this section, will 
enable the Directors to establish “graded schools,” to which pre- 
ference is required to be given by the 32d section, when they could 
not otherwise, by adopting the pay-system in branches other than 
those provided for in the 31st section, thus materially increasing 
the efficiency of the whole system, when the taxation of the State 
and county does not furnish a sufficient fund for such purpose. 
Contracts may be made with teachers, who are qualified to teach 
the higher branches, allowing them the amount of the tuition fees. 
which may accrue from the same, but taking care to make the 
schools, in all instances, absolutely tree to all pupils who study the 
elementary branches required by the law, and to leave such pupils 
to the sole control of the public school officers. This proviso is. 
essential, that the schools may not lose their identity as Public Schools, 
and that freedom may be guaranteed to them in the elementary 
branches. It is believed that such contracts may be made in many 
districts, the efficiency of the schools greatly advanced, the cost per 
pupil reduced, and a higher class of teachers secured.’ I earnestly 
recommend this measure to the County Superintendents and district. 
Directors, as being an absolute necessity in winning the confidence 
of the people in the school system, elevating the grade of the 
schools, and securing increased interest from all quarters in their 
success. And when the recommendation is adopted, County Super- 
intendents are directed to make a detailed report, to this office, of 
the result of the experiment, the efficiency secured, the attendance 
at such schools, and the effect produced upon the sentiment of the 
district and neighborhood. Such yeport should accompany the 
regular annual reports, of the Directors, on the 15th of September 
each year, and of the County Superintendents on the first day of 
October.
-P-A-G-E-180
184 
SCHOOL ESTIMATES OR BUDGETS. 
Another measure, which I recommend to County Superintend- 
ents, is to make out each year, before any contracts are entered into 
with teachers, an estimate of the amount of the school money, from 
all sources, which will. probably be apportioned to each district in 
the ensuing year, or require the Directors to do the same, taking as 
a basis the actual apportionments of the preceding year, provided 
no change has been made by the county in the levy of taxes. If 
any change in the levy has been made, then the estimate may be 
increased or diminished accordingly. But it will always be more 
‘prudent to under-estimate the apportionment than to exceed the 
amount. There is scarcely any circumstance which contributes 
more to cast odium upon the system than unliquidated indebtedness 
to teachers, who have earned their salary by their services. And 
there can be nothing which so greatly discourages teachers them- 
selves, and dampens their ardor. After such estimate has been 
made, the amounts first recieved should be set aside to pay an 
accrued indebtedness to teachers or others, and contracts should 
only be entered into to consume the balance of the year’s estimate 
remaining, after paying off the indebtedness. 
If this system be strictly observed, all indebtedness will be can- 
celled, and the schools will hereafter be conducted free from the 
incubus of debt, which has proven the blight of both private and 
public enterprises. I am induced to make and urge this reeom- 
mendation from the numerous instances-which have come to my 
knowledge of gross carelessness in making contracts, reckless as 
they have proven of the rights of individuals, and tending to bring 
our: school interests into disrepute. County Superintendents are 
directed to make reports, under the head of “ remarks,” with regard 
to the indebtedness of any districts in their counties, (designating 
the districts), and whether this recommendation has been observed. 
EXAMINATION OF TEACHERS. 
The instructions issued by the late State Superintendent, with 
reference to the mode of examining and licensing school teachers 
and their qualifications, are hereby adopted and re-issued to County 
Superintendents, with this modification, that when, after examing- 
tion, the grade of the applicant in any branch of instruction pre-
-P-A-G-E-181
185 
scribed by the law for the schools, falls below jive, the applicant 
must be rejected. The former instruction was, that when the 
average grade falls below five the applicant should be rejected. 
This modification is made in order to advance the standard of qual- 
ification each year. The number of persons secking employment, 
as teachers, is believed to be larger now than two years ago; and 
those. who have heen employed as teachers for two years, failing at 
that time to reach the grade in every branch, and who have not 
now qualified themselves more thoroughly, so as to stand the re- 
quired test, should be rejected as unworthy of receiving a license. 
A more strict examination than formerly should also be pursued, 
in order that the applicant may be convinced that serious work and 
preparation are required. These regulations are adopted with the 
view of approving and carrying out the cardinal idea of my prede- 
cessor in the organization of our schools, that “the ultimate teach- 
ers’ standard, in this State, must be attained by gradual approaches.” 
The rule prescribed, requiring examinations to be made and licenses 
to be issued annually to each teacher, is also re-adopted. It can 
work no hardship on the best qualified teachers, and will stimulate 
those who are indifferent to more exertion and a higher ambition. 
This regulation can only be dispensed with when the State shall 
have secured a sufficient corps of well-trained teachers to occupy 
the field, and elevate the profession of teaching to the proper stand- 
ard of-excellence. The’ general instructions referred to, will be 
found on page 180 of the Annual Report of the State Superintend- 
ent of Public Instruction, 1874, to which County Superintendents 
are referred for their guidance, with the modifications here made. 
ANNUAL REPORTS. . 
The annual reports of the District Clerks and Treasurers to the 
County Superintendent, are required to be made for the year end- 
ing 31st day of August preceding, on the 15th day of September, 
on all subjects indicated in the blank forms, which will be supplied, 
which can readily be done, if the Teachers’ Registers and Account 
Books and Records of the Clerk have been kept aud posted accord~ 
ing to Jaw, and the enumeration of population completed at the 
time required. The County Superintendent’s annual report to this 
office is required to be made on or before the Ist of October, which 
can also be made at the proper. time, without the least embarrass-
-P-A-G-E-182
186 
ment, it being simply a consolidation of the district reports, with 
such remarks as to the condition, efficiency, and needs of the county 
schools, as circumstances may suggest. These reports will be re- 
quired to be made strictly at the time prescribed by law. The 
County Superintendent is instructed promptly, without Joss of time, 
to avail himself of the provision of the law authorizing him. to 
employ a substitute, where there is any delinquency in making the 
reports from districts. This strictness and promptitude are de- 
manded that the consolidated annual report of the State Superin- 
tendent may be complete at the time required by law. It is hoped 
that no delays or omissions may occur in the forthcoming reports, 
and that all may be animated, by an honorable emulation, inspired 
by zeal to serve the great cause of popular education which is en- 
trusted to our hands. 
In connection with the reports to be made by District Clerks to the 
County Superintendents, on or before September 15th, I cannot too. 
earnestly impress upon County Superintendents the duty of urging 
that they be promptly made, and that these returns be full and com~ 
plete, taking care that the clerks be instructed in the manner of 
filling them out, when they so desire. If not propetly made out, 
they should be returned for correction, promptly, and a corrected 
report demanded, without delay. The same care should be exer- 
cised in requiring the census to be taken according to law. The 
blanks should be at once distributed, and the clerks instructed as to. 
their duties. It is very doubtful whether districts which have not 
complied with the law, in making these enumerations of scholastic 
population, are entitled to the benefit of an apportionment of the 
school money, as there will be no standard by which an apportion- 
ment can be made, if no census be taken. Three or four counties. 
have failed to comply with the law, by electing County Superin- 
tendents. The-County Courts, at their July term, are respectfully 
notified of the delinquency, and requested to remedy the same. If, 
however, they persistently refuse or fail to comply with the law, in 
this particular, legal steps will be taken to compel their compliance, 
It. is also believed, that the failure to elect a County Superintendent. 
will deprive them of a share of the school fund distributed semi~ 
annually by the Comptroller, as all the date upon which said distri- 
bution is made are required to be furnished by that officer. It ig. 
his duty to see that the census is taken by the District Clerks and
-P-A-G-E-183
187 
Treasurers, and to consolidate the same and transmit them to this 
office. If there is no Superintendent, how can he perform these 
duties, which are the preliminary steps to the distribution of the 
fund to his county? If the County Courts of the four counties 
which have failed to elect, will discharge their duty at the July 
' term of their respective courts, there will be time for them to dis- 
tribute the blanks so as to take the census in July, as required by 
law. The County Court Clerks of these counties are. respectfully 
requested to give notice to this office of the election of, or failure 
to elect, the County Superintendent, as soon as practicable, after the 
July terms of their respective courts; and the necessary enumera- 
tion blanks are herewith sent to them, with the request that they 
will hand them over to the County Superintendent elect, together: 
with this Circular. . 
COUNTY TAXES FOR SCHOOLS. 
In gonsequence of the postponement of the collection of taxes. 
until November, and the passage of the new assessment law, the 
County Superintendents, in counties which have levied no addi- 
tional tax for prolonging the schools for five months, are urged to 
respectfully call the attention of the County Courts to the necessity 
of making the necessary levy. The schools are established by law, 
which seems to be fortified by a sentiment so strong, that they may 
be regarded as fixed. It will be almost a waste of the public money 
to attempt to carry them on with the interest on the school fund 
and the State levy on polls and property alone. The Quarterly 
Courts at their July term, ought, therefore, to be urged to make 
them equally as efficient as those counties of a more advanced sep- 
timent have done, who have levied additional poll, privilege, and 
property tax, the latter, some of them, at the rate of twenty cents. 
and twenty-five cents on the $100. To fail in this important duty 
is nearly to throw away or waste, as useless, the State fund appor- 
tioned to them. It would be just as unwise and unpatriotic to 
refuse levies of soldiers, and means and munitions to support them, 
in time of war, as for local authorities to refuse to make levies of 
taxes to educate the children of the counties, in time of peace. The 
man who would refuse to become a soldier, when his services are 
needed, would be regarded as disloyal to his country. Why 
should he, who refuses to be taxed. to mould good citizens in peace
-P-A-G-E-184
188 
and war, be regarded as any better? If the young men of the 
State were to refuse to serve the State, when the law demands their 
services, they would be hissed and execrated. Why should good 
citizens, then, refuse to be taxed, in a small sum, to educate those 
who are to become the stay and support of the fabric of State? 
Let this question be presented to the Quarterly Courts, with the 
earnestness and force which it demands, and there are none, I be- 
lieve, who will refuse to impose the light burdens necessary to sup- 
port the schools for at least five months in the year. There is no 
measure, that can be presented, which involves more deeply the 
relative standing and prosperity of the respective counties. Those 
counties which now stand back will be left behind in the race of 
progress, both intellectual and material; while those which have 
made the forward movement, even now exemplify the high advan- 
tages to be derived from popular education. Much depends on the 
activity, intelligence, and zeal of the County Superintendents -in 
presenting this important question properly to the County Gourts, 
where the desired action has not already been had. They should 
work with energy, and yet with patience, in removing prejudice, 
meeting objections, and gathering and citing those facts which irre- 
sistibly refute the logic of those who stand in the way of enlight- 
ened action. Triumph they will, in the end, when they come to 
array a line of well organized schools against the armies of be- 
nighted ignorance and stolid retroaction. 
EFFICIENCY OF DIRECTORS. 
I will not close this Circular Address, without most earnestly 
urging upon the County Superintendents to confer frequently with 
the District Boards of Directors, upon whose wisdom and discre- 
tion ultimately and closely depend the efficiency and success of our 
schools. They should be advised with, as to their specific duties, 
because, being occupied with their private business, they often 
neglect the interests of the schools, whose immediate administra- 
tion ‘is entrusted to their special charge, for want of counsel to 
point out the functions of their important office. They should be 
advised frequently to inspect the schools themselves, and to appoint 
inspectors to visit them from the most intelligent and zealous of the 
citizens of the district. They should interest themselves in their 
government and discipline, without intermeddling or officious inter.
-P-A-G-E-185
189 
ference, but sufficiently to give general direction to the principles of 
their management, always giving preference to paternal authority 
over violence and the driving system, where at all practicable. 
They should enforce the utmost economy, system, and forethought 
in the management of accounts, so as to avoid indebtedness and to 
discourage giving warrants to teachers on the County Trustee, 
when there is no fund to their credit, thus embarrassing that officer, 
and creating false hopes with creditors. To avoid the latter evil, 
they should draw no warrants against the Trustee excepting for 
amounts to their credit in his hands, and then only to be collected 
by the Clerk and Treasurer himself, and immediately converted by 
him to the liquidation of orders previously issued against him for 
services. The following form of warrant on the County Trustee is 
recommended to be used by the Directors, printed blanks having 
been provided, so as to make them uniform : —

These warrants should be signed by all the Directors, if practi- 
cable, but if not, at least by the Chairman and Clerk and Treasu- 
rer. The County Trustee will make an apportionment monthly, 
that the current expenses may be met as they accrue. 
The Directors should be advised to consult, as near as they can, 
the interests and harmony of the district in the location of schools, 
provision for neatness and comfort of school-houses, and proper 
efforts to induce a general attendance at the schools from all the 
children entitled to the benefits of the same, and such other things

as circumstances or their own observation and reflection may sug- 
gest as desirable and proper to promote efficiency, secure success, or 
win satisfaction for their efforts. 
EFFICIENCY OF TEACHERS. 
I will bring this address to a close by a timely word to County 
Superintendents in behalf of the interests of teachers, without 
whose entire devotion to their duties, no good whatever can be ex- 
pected from all our labors. They are emphatically the mainspring 
of the whole movement, and every effort should be made to instruct, 
encourage and render justice to them. Though their calling is not 
‘such as continually attracts popular applause and admiration, yet in 
the obscure and humble cabins, where, generally, their unnoticed 
labors are performed, the highest missions of humanity and of 
human elevation are achieved. They should be well chosen, and 
when elected to their high calling, they should be most heartily 
cheered, as St. Paul did with the apostleship, to magnify their office. 
I would respectfully suggest, therefore, in addition to the private 
encouragement to be given to them by doing them justice, both in 
their reputations, and the exact meting out to them of their. dues, 
and the most generous recognition of their merit—that, when prac- 
ticable, Teachers’ Institutes be organized in each county, under the 
authority of the County Superintendents, during the summer 
months, in which schools of training shall be exercised, according 
to the most approved methods, and by the most experienced teach- 
ers, and essays or lectures be read on subjects appertaining to school 
government, methods of teaching, and moral discipline. At least, 
let Teachers’ Conventions be held in each county, which will arouse 
in the teachers an esprit de corps, and a worthy ambition to avail 
themselves of every opportunity to improve their own methods, and 
to qualify themselves more perfectly for the high and honorable 
duties to which they have been assigned. 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
By the enlightened co-operation of the Board of Trustees of the 
University of Nashville, and of the distinguished General Agent 
of the Peabody Education Fund, Dr. B. Sears, the one lending the 
magnificent grounds, buildings, and income of the University, ang 
the other contributing the annual sum of $6,000, under the super-
-P-A-G-E-187
191 
vision of the State Board of Education, the State Normal School 
will certainly be put in operation during the ensuing Fall, as I am 
enabled to announce. The terms upon which the pupils will be 
admitted will be announced by a timely circular from the Board of 
Education. It is destined to prove the most auspicious event in 
our annals for the encouragement and complete success of our pub- 
lic school system. It may be at least fairly assumed, that’ no longer 
shall the bounding energies and aspiring talent of our youth be 
restrained by the metes and bounds of other trades and professions, 
in which so many languish and fail. But the whole boundless do- 
main, in which so many honest and capable workers are needed, to 
cultivate the mental and moral faculties of the rising generation, 
are henceforth to be opened to the youth of Tennessee of both 
sexes. From such a creation there rises up before the imagination 
a very fairy land of promise; and in sober, practical reality, there is 
presented the opportunity for honorable usefulness to merit and 
genius on the one hand; and the halls of public elementary educa- 
tion are opened on. the other, on so attractive and successful a scale, 
that all opposition will speedily disappear, as all cause of cavil, cen- 
sure, and complaint will have surely been removed by the munifi- 
cent foundation of thé State Normal College. 
LEON, TROUSDALE, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
To County and City Superintendents, School Directors and Teachers: 
Ata Convention of Superintendents and Teachers held at the 
Capitol, in this city, on the 4th inst., the whole subject of making 
an educational exhibit, by the institutions of learning and public 
- schools of the State, was referred to a committee, which reported 
back resolutions that were unanimously adopted. The resolutions 
are as follows: 
Whereas, from a variety of causes, a general system of public 
instruction has not been in operation continuously in this State for a 
sufficient length of time to justify any attempt to collect from all 
the counties educational material for exhibition at the Centennial 
Exposition at Philadelphia; and,
-P-A-G-E-188
192 
Whereas, it is most desirable that the progress made in some of 
the cities and counties should be shown as an indication of the pos- _ 
sibilities of our State system and of the results hoped for when it 
shall become generally operative; therefore be it resolved, 
1. That County and City Superintendents, school Directors and 
teachers, and the faculties of institutions of learning generally, be 
earnestly requested to prepare educational material for exhibition at 
the National Centennial Exposition, in accordance with the rules 
and directions hereinafter given, and that they forward said material 
to the State Superintendent at this place, to be sent by him to the 
said Exposition. 
2. That said school officers.and teachers shall proceed, by colleet- 
ing 5 cents from each pupil and 25 cents from each teacher, or by 
such other plan as may be thought most judicious in their respective 
localities, to raise the necessary funds for paying freight and other 
expenses on such shipments to this point, and from here to their 
final destination. 
3. The different school products to be exhibited shall consist of 
~ drawings, and views of buildings and school grounds, school reports 
and blanks, and the work of pupils, which shall be prepared under 
the following rules: 
1, Plans and views of school buildings and grounds shall be pre- 
pared in portfolios, lettered with the designation of the State, county, 
city or town, and the name of school or institution, and accompanied 
with the description of peculiar features, cost of erection, material, 
architect, capacity, ete. 
2. From 50 to 100 copies of local schoo] reports should be for- 
warded with copies of other educational documents, school blanks, 
etc. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction is hereby re- 
quested to embody in his annual report, all matters of interest in the 
historical and statistical status of institutions of learning in the State, 
both public and private ;. and, with a view of his doing this effect 
ually, the Directors and Managers of said institutions are urged to 
communicate to him all such facts, without delay. 
3. Ata written examination, to be held in the schools in the month 
of January, five questions shall be presented on each of the branches 
of study pursued, which shall be reproduced, with the answers, in 
good style by the pupils, on paper of the ordinary letter size, and 
five of the best papers prepared in each branch by the different
-P-A-G-E-189
193 
classes shall be selected and clasped together without folding, the 
papers on each branch to be arranged together in-the same parcel, 
and all of the clasps thus formed in each school shall be bound to- 
gether in such style as may make them convenient for reference and 
examination. 
4. During the same month, specimens of map drawing and free 
hand drawing shall be prepared by the pupils on sheets of. paper as 
nearly as practicable 10x12 inches, from which the best five shall be 
-chosen and disposed of in the same manner as those above. 
5. Any paintings (unframed) or other ornamental work, banners, 
-ete., suitable for shipping conveniently, may be prepared at same 
time by the pupils, and banners showing briefly educational status 
of schools, may be prepared by the different localities, district, town, 
city, county or State. 
6. Such product shall be plainly marked so as to easily determine 
the school, and locality from which they come, and shall be securely 
packed in a neat box, and forwarded prepaid to Superintendent 
“Trousdale here, at furthest by the Lith day of next February, with 
an approximate amount to pay freight on them to Philadelphia. 
‘Your committee respectfully present the foregoing as their report 
upon the matters referred to them. 
Respectfully, 
8. Y. CaLpweE tt, 
Lon. TROUSDALE, 
Joun R. Dean, 
R. W. Weak ey, 
J. B. KInuesrew, 
, Committee. 
Having been designated by these resolutions, as agent of the 
‘schools, to receive at Nashville and have shipped to Philadelphia, 
such products as they may furnish in accordance therewith, I here- 
by earnestly urge upon all Superintendents, Officers and Teachers, 
to arrange for preparing their work, according to the above rules, 
and for raising and collecting the amounts necessary to handle and _ 
transport, in the manner suggested, or such other mode as may be 
most feasible. If any surplus amount shall be collected, it will be 
used in paying’ the necessary expenses of a Commissioner to take 
charge of 3° products at the Exposition. oy "
-P-A-G-E-190
194 
The following institutions may properly be expected to make am 
exhibit: 
1. Public ungraded schools, as may have made such proficiency- 
as they shall deem may be creditably exhibited. 
2. Graded schools, including all Peabody schools. 
3. City schools. 
4, Universities and Colleges. 
5. Professional schools. 
6. Schools of the Blind and of the Deaf and Dumb. 
7. Kindergarten schools. 
It will be noted that the examinations must be had during the 
month of January, and as soon as completed forwarded to this office, 
transportation prepaid, and an approximate amount. for transporta- 
tion to Philadelphia sent. No package will be received unless pre- 
paid, accompanied with the said amount, there being no other funds 
for paying the expense of the same. 
It is respectfully recommended that Superintendents of counties. 
and cities, forward to this office, as'soon as can be ascertained, the 
amount of the work they propose to exhibit, with all particulars. 
they can command. 
A circular will be issued from this office, as soon as the rates can 
be ascertained, giving the probable cost of transportation from this 
city to Philadelphia. It is hoped and confidently believed that all 
educators throughout the State, will cordially co-operate in promot- 
ing the objects of this circular. 
. Respectfully, 
LEON. TROUSDALE, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

Nashville, Tenn., September 16th, 1875. 
Dear Sir:—The 31st Section of the Public School Law pro- 
vides, that, “in every Public School shall be taught Orthography, 
Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar, Geography, Elementary 
Geology of Tennessee and History of the United States; and Vocal 
Music may be taught therein.” OFFICE or STaTE meee}
-P-A-G-E-191
195 
The study of “ Elementary Geology of Tennessee” has hitherto 
been dispensed with, because there has been no text-book on that 
branch of instruction. 
The language of the statute, however, is imperative, and makes 
it incumbent on the officers, whose duty it is to see that the law is 
faithfully executed, to provide for its introduction at the earliest 
possible moment. 
A suitable text-book has been compiled and published, and is now 
ready; and another is announced as forthcoming. 
County Superintendents are therefore instructed to give notice to 
teachers in the Public Schools that they will hereafter be examined 
on this branch of the Public School course, and to request that they 
will prepare themselves for such examination as soon as practicable. 
The same average of proficiency (5) will be required as in other 
branches. 
It is not designed to compel such examinations until the regular 
examinations preceding the next school term; but those teachers 
may be examined sooner, who shall announce themselves to be pre= 
pared; in such cases they will be entitled to a special certificate of 
qualification. 
Very respectfully, . 
LEON. TROUSDALE, 
State Superintendent. 
OFFIcE oF SratE ef 
“ Nashville, October 29, 1875. 
I. County Superintendents, who have not forwarded their Annual 
Reports, are hereby notified that a longer delay, in complying with 
their daty under the law will not be granted. It is absolutely ne- 
cessary that no longer postponement be allowed. Unless this rea- 
sonable demand shall be promptly attended to, Chairmen of the 
County Courts will be advised to withhold the salaries of defaulting 
Superintendents, and a person will be appointed, in accordance with 
law, to make their reports. 
‘II. Where the public schools of the county have been or may be 
suspended for one year, whether for indebtedness, or other cause, 
Superintendents are directed to collect and prepare, full statistics of
-P-A-G-E-192
196 
the private schools kept in operation in the county, during the time 
-of suspension, which shall show the number of schools, average 
number of pupils in attendance, number of teachers employed, cost 
of tuition per pupil, and aggregate cost of same. The purpose of 
such statistics is for comparison with the cost of public schools for a 
similar period, and, therefore, County Superintendents are urged to 
collect these facts as completely and accurately as possible, and re- 
port them as soon thereafter as practicable. It is believed that in 
the counties where this requirement is made, Superintendents, hav- 
ing been relieved from the duty of visiting and inspection of the 
public schools, by their suspension, will have ample opportunity to - 
obtain the facts desired. 
III. It having been reported to this office that District Directors 
have misappropriated the school fund, by paying off debts which 
accrued before the passage of the present school law, County Super- 
intendents are hereby instructed to take care that no such misuse 
of the fund shall hereafter be made. The Directors, under the 
school Jaw, have no legal power or authority to make such an appro- 
priation, excepting in cases where the school fund has been increased 
from back taxes collected within the years when such debts were 
contracted. And even in the latter case, they are not the parties 
authorized by law to audit and allow such claims, as by a late act, 
Chairmen of the County Courts are created the auditors of such old 
claims. 
TV. County Superintendents are instructed to inquire and report 
to this office forthwith, whether the one mi]] tak, for the support of 
public schools, required by the 38th section of the School Law, has 
been regularly collected, and if not, why the law has not been com- 
plied with. This inquiry is rendered necessary by the default to 
collect in at least one county in the State. 
V. All County Superintendents will at once collect and report to 
this office, the statistics of all Universities, Colleges and private 
schools, within their respective counties, during the past year, set- 
ting forth number of professors or teachers, number of pupils in at- 
tendance, average cost per pupil, when it is practicable todoso. In 
most cases.a simple request in writing, to the principals. of such 
_ schools, will seeure the information. When no such schools are in 
existence in a county, the fact will be so reported.
-P-A-G-E-193
197 
VI. County Superintendents are further instructed to report to- 
this office, on or before the 1st day of December next, answers to 
the following questions in as full and accurate a form as possible. 
These questions are such as come under the cognizance of the Super- 
intendent himself, and require no other reports for their prepara- 
tion: 
1st. What is the progress and success of the schools in your 
county, as compared with last year ? 
2d. What progress have you made as to uniformity in text-books 
in your county ? 
3d. How many graded schools are there in your county? 
4th. How many of your schools have charts, globes and black- 
boards ? : 
5th. How much, if any, interest have your Directors shown by 
visiting the schools, and have parents.and citizens exhibited such 
interest ? 
6th. What is. the character of the competency of. your teachers ; 
is there great deficiency ; and what per centum of same? 
7th. Havé"any new school-houses been erected during the year, 
and of what character? Were they erected by private means or 
from the school fund, and what is the general character and condi- 
tion of your school-houses? 
8th. Have you established a County Institute in your county? 
- If so, how often does it meet? What per cent. of the teachers at- 
tend the same, and what is the character of exercises? Do you find 
it advantageous to teachers as it is conducted? Would you favor a 
rule enforcing compulsory attendance, at these institutes, upon 
teachers? 
9th. What do you regard as the leading obstacle to the success of 
public schools in your county? . 
10th. Is the public sentiment in your county favorable to free 
schools, and if so, is this sentiment increasing or otherwise ? 
11th. In your inspection of schools, have you found the discipline 
good or otherwise? Have you found the teachers keeping their 
Registers daily, it being one of your first duties to inquire and see 
that this is done? Have you found the school-houses comfortable 
or otherwise ?
-P-A-G-E-194
198° 
12th. At what time have your schools opened during the present 
year? 
13th. In your visitations, during the year, have you known 
of any defalcation of the Treasurers, or any misappropriation by 
them of the school fund; and, if so, have you duly reported the 
same and prosecuted the defaulter? 
Answers té these questions are deemed important to the interest 
of the public schools. If full and accurate answers are given, we 
shall have in possession much valuable information for future guid- 
ance. It is believed there is not one question here noted, which 
may not be answered promptly by an intelligent Superintendent. 
All.are urged to take the utmost pains in giving due attention to 
each one of them. 
Respectfully, 
LEON. TROUSDALE, 
State Superintendent.

The small amount apportioned to Tennessee from this fand for 
the current year, necessitated the cutting down of the sums given to 
the schools aided to the above low figures, while many deserving 
applications could not be granted. -The recommendations for this 
aid have been made after the most cateful and conscientious study 
of the'merits of the several schools making application. 
Under instructions from the General Agent of the Fund, I give 
notice to all interested, that no part of the above, amounts will. be 
paid until the close of the full ten months’ terms of the schools, nor 
until certificates are received at this office that all the conditions im- 
posed have been fully complied with. These certificates will be 
forwarded to the proper officers of the schools aided when applied 
for by them. 
. L earnestly request that all schools, now or heretofore aided from 
the Peabody Fund, contribute something towards the educational 
exhibit to be made by Tennessee at the coming Centennial Exhibi- 
tion. Pupils’ work is specially requested. All contributions should 
be sent to the State Superintendent, charges paid, not later than 
March 1, 1876, Full directions for preparing educational material 
for this purpose are contained in a circular from this office, dated 
November 10, 1875, which can be obtained from ywur County Su- 
sperintendent.

State NorMAL UNIVERSITY. 
The opening exercises of this institutution were held in the Hall 
of the House of Representatives, at, the Capitol, on Wednesday 
evening; “Deembet’ fy 1875. The following account of the pro-- 
ceedings is taken from- the report contained in the Nashville Amer 
ean ofthe next day: 
«<The opening exercises ‘v the State Normal School, in the Hall’ 
of the House of Represpntatives, Jast night, were witnessed by a 
large assemblage. A noticeable feature was the large attendance of 
young people, who manifested" the keenest interest in all the pro- 
ceedings... Among the audience here and there were to be seen 
well-known educators and advocates of popular education. 
Rev. Dr. T. G. Jones opened the exercises with prayer. 
After “My Poor Heart is Sad,” from Norma, and the Apollo 
Quickstep had been given by the Post Band, Gov. Porter, Presi- 
dent ex-officio of the State Board of Education, came forward and 
said: 
Ladies and Gentlemen: As President of the State Board of Ead- 
ucation, it gives me pleasure to announce to you that addresses will 
now be delivered by Col. Leon. Trousdale, State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction, President Eben S. Stearns, of the State Normal 
School, Judge Samnel Watson, of the Peabody Board of Trust, and. 
Hon. Edwin H. Ewing, President of the University of Nashville. 
SUPERINTENDENT TROUSDALE’S ADDRESS. : 
The following address was then delivered by State Superintend- 
ent Trousdale: : 
It ‘was in the indulgence of no Utopian dream that your General 
. Assembly,-on the 15th of March, 1873, passed an act to establish 
' a uniform system of public schools. Nor was it the mere logical  
-P-A-G-E-197
201 
sequence of our charter of self-government, which imposed upom 
the people the duties of citizenship, with all the rights, powers, and 
responsibilities appertaining thereto, however much the obligations 
of all are enlarged thereby. These correlative obligations had 
been so long postponed or pretermitted by our legislators, that the 
often repeated principle that virtue and intelligence are absolutely 
necessary to self-government and liberty, came tobe challenged, if 
not positively denied, in some intelligent quarters. The dogma 
‘that ignorance and vice are as compatible with a free constitution 
as virtue and intelligence, was never pointedly or openly promul- 
gated. But indifference on the subject of public education had 
engendered, with many, an apathy, and thence aroused an opposi- 
tion quite as fatal.” : 
In the midst of this apathy our General Assembly, stimulated by 
the earnest and intelligent zeal of a few persevering educators, 
looked around them and saw all the Governments which claimed to 
be civilized, and some that we class, in our assumption of superior 
enlightenment, as semi-civilized, establishing free-schools in every 
part of their dominions. Not only the great civilized powers, who. 
are the leaders of our enlightened era, were exerting their energies 
and taxing their resources to achieve a superior civilization, by at- 
tempting universal education, but we find secondary States—classed 
secondary in progress—wisely aiming at the same result. The roll 
of progress was not confined to Germany, Switzerland, Austria, 
France, England, Ireland and Scotland. Ttaly and Spain’ had 
united in the onward march of development, and even the Czar of 
Russia, on one extreme of Europe, the Khedive of Egypt, on the 
northern extreme of Africa; and British India and the Mikado of 
Japan in the far East, had joined the universal crusade against 
ignorance and its resulting barbarism. Some of these governments 
are autocratic, most of them despotic. There are but two republics 
and one constitutional mixed monarchy on the roll. The cycles of 
history have brought it around that education is no longer an appa- 
ratus for-the few to govern the many, with more ease, as has been 
said, but must now be used to elevate the many to the dignity of 
true manhood and to the useful mission of applying skilled labor to 
the arts and vocations of life. 
It became then, a necessity that Tennessee should establish a 
uniform system of public schools, if her citizens willed to keep.
-P-A-G-E-198

pace with other civilized States, not to be in the ranks of barbarism. 
But the General Assembly did not adopt the corrollary to this 
wise and beneficent measure of progress, as all the other States 
of the world have done. By the establishment of this system of 
free-schools, a demand was created for an average of sixty compe- 
tent teachers in every county of the State. Now, there is not an 
average of the half of sixty of either of the learned professions—_ 
the law and medicine—demanded in every county of the State. 
And there is no enlightened person who would trust the conduct of 
an important lawsuit to a lawyer whom he believed unlearned in 
his profession. Nor would he employ an ignorant or unlearned 
physician to discharge the delicate duty of ministering to the dis- 
eases of the body. . 
Why then should: he be willing to entrust the training of his 
young child to an incompetent or untrained head and hand. This 
question suggests the principle which constitutes the problem to be 
solved by those who are to direct our public schools. It must be 
evident to every one, who has seriously considered this problem, 
that competent and well-trained teachers are necessary to the. ulti- 
mate usefulness of our public school system. The universities and 
colleges can supply but few of them; because, first, they have con- 
nected with them no training school for teachers; and second, a 
large majority of those who are graduates in them, enter the pro~ 
_fessions and pursuits of life which offer more tempting inducements, 
either of ambition or bread-winning.. The teachers then must be 
ereated by and recruited from the common school and the high 
school, aided by the Normal University and the Teachers’ Institute. 
The Normal School or University cannot supply the whole demand, 
and can, therefore, only act as an educator of a class of normal 
teachers, whose high mission it shall be to train the common school 
teacher, through teachers’ institutes and other instrumentalities. I 
‘do not hesitate to suggest that the teacher who refuses to improve 
himself through some of these instrumentalities, normal schools, 
institutes, teachers’ libraries or school journals, can never meet the 
‘demands of education as they exist at the present day. I mean, of 
course, those who have not preyiously qualified themselves for 
teachers by a long course of discipline and experience. There is, 
besides these instruments of qualifying one’s self, a peculiar fitness 
for the great duties of his calling, and an earnestness and enthu-
-P-A-G-E-199
; 203 
’ siasm for his work, which no teacher can become eminent, without 
possessing. 
Although the General Assembly failed to supply the true comple~ 
ment to their work in the establishment of public schools; in March 
of the present year, they established a Board of Education, with 
His Excellency, the Governor, as chairman, and which is composed 
of some of our most distinguished and enlightened citizens, with 
power to organize normal schools from such donations as might be 
tendered to them by corporate bodies or individuals. In accord- 
ance with this act, Dr. Sears, on behalf of the Peabody Education 
Trust, tendered $6,000 per annum for two years, and the Trustees 
of the University of Nashville at the same time loaned their in- 
come of $3,000 per annum, and that of the Montgomery Bell 
Academy, also amounting to $3,000 per annum, together with their 
substantial and commodious buildings and grounds, for the purpose 
of establishing a Normal University. These donations give the 
University an income for two years of $12,000 per annum, and 
ample conveniences for teaching and lodging pupils. In the ar~ 
rangement, consummated, the Academy continues in operation as a 
free training or model school, and each county in the State is in- 
vited to supply one free pupil to the Normal School. 
These liberal provisions have been made. after long and patient 
consultation and investigation, and reflect the highest honor upon 
the parties who have entered into them. A corps of instructors 
has been secured with the sole aim to high qualifications and thor- 
ough efficiency. And the President, who has been induced to 
leave his native State, and a position of the highest usefulness, 
that he might enter upon a career of greater usefulness among us, 
comes not as a stranger, because he comes crowned with the bays of 
the ripe scholar, the experienced and efficient normal teacher, the’ 
true gentleman, and, the conscientious Christian. 
PRESIDENT STEARNS’ ADDRESS. 
Superintendent Trousdale was succeeded by President E. 8. 
Stearns, of the State Normal School, who delivered the following 
address: - .
-P-A-G-E-200
204 
Gov. Porter, State Superintendent Trousdale, Trustees of the Nashville - 
University, gentlemen of the State Board of Education, teachers and 
friends of education generally: 
“ What an ever-glorious morning is this!” exclaimed the revo-— 
lutionary hero, as the morning sun. of April, 1775, ushered in, in 
all its splendor, the grand epoch of American freedom! What an 
ever-glorious day is this, may we too exclaim, which has dawned 
upon us, to mark a new era in our educational history, and to con- 
secrate one of the noblest and most beneficent of enterprises ! 
I congratulate you, gentlemen, who, for so long a time, and 
amidst so many obstacles and disappointments, have labored with 
rare courage and persistence, to prepare the way, that the great 
work is at last to begin. 
I congratulate all friends of popular education, that there is now 
opportunity for the special instruction and training of those who, 
in schools and institutions of various grades, are to qualify the chil~ 
dren and youth of the land for the duties of men and citizens. 
I congratulate this great influential, heaven-endowed State of 
Teunesee, and the Sunny South, all ready to come forth adorned as 
a bride for her husband, in more than ancient beauty, that we ini- 
tiate to-day an enterprise which cannot fail to help every home and 
every person—powerfully aiding to banish ignorance, the cause of 
crime and bitterest woe—to discipline, instruct, enlighten the rising: 
generation, and to prepare it for the high duties of society and. 
American citizenship. 
I congratulate the people everywhere, for this is to be eminently 
and pre-eminently their own institution, doing work for every man, 
woman and child, more than almost any other. 
Finally, I congratulate you, teachers and students, pioneers in 
this noble undertaking. On us, indeed, will fall the heat and bur— 
den of the day, and we shall, doubtless, be subject to labors, incon 
veniences and embarrassments, which those who come after us, in 
no very remote time, may be spared. But to you will belong the 
glory of founders—men and women, in this most responsible office, 
laying deep and broad the foundation stones, and forever to be 
honored for the good you will do and the character you will give 
this work.
-P-A-G-E-201
205 
And now, ere we launch the ship and spread her good sails to the 
breeze, let us stop for a moment and contemplate the enterprise in 
which we are engaged. . 
The Normal School, an institution designed for the professional. 
education of teachers, is of foreign origin, and was introduced into 
this country chiefly through the agency of Charles Brooks, George 
B. Emerson, Henry Barnard and others, gentlemen of great learn- 
ing and culture, and for many years practical teachers. The first 
nornial school on this continent was established at the old, historic 
town of Lexington, in the summer of A. D. 1839, It opened in 
the face of great prejudice and opposition—indeed, under discour- 
agements which would surely have daunted less bold and intelligent 
men. But it won the confidence and active support of some of the 
most eminent citizens. Horace Mann, on the one hand, urged it- 
on with the full strength of that fiery zeal for which he was re- 
nowned, and Edward Everett, then Governor of the State, brought 
to.its aid his cultured pen and soul-entrancing oratory, and in his 
messages to the Legislature, and his addresses to the people, pressed 
upon them its claims. Every ‘possible means was resorted to by 
these and many other influential men, and by the press generally, 
to secure a sufficient number of students at the outset to give it eclat. 
But when some-of the most distinguished educators and statesmen 
were met to witness the glories of the opening, three modest young 
women only were found to have responded to the great efforts 
which had been made. Grief and mortification, but not despair, 
were the result. Rallying almost at once from the shock of this 
great disappointment, the institution was opened with these three 
students, one teacher constituting its corps of instruction, and an 
old, cracked globe, the accidental legacy of some district school 
which had occupied the premises, its apparatus. But the numbers 
slowly increased, and notwithstanding its humble beginning, it soon 
began to make itself felt. Its great capacity for usefulness to the 
schools was acknowledged, other similar institutions were estab- 
lished, the State gave them her name and liberal support, and set 
an example long since followed by many of the States, and now all _ 
over the country. No institutions command so readily and liberal- 
ly the people’s money for their support, because the people feel that 
of all institutions, this is their own, and the money required, an. in- 
vestment which pays a dividend into every family.
-P-A-G-E-202
206 
No State, it seems to me, has before it a grander future than 
Tennessee. Its geographical position points it out as a center of 
prosperity and influence. Set like a costly gem in a coronet of 
wealthy and powerful States, with a climate alike free from the 
rigors of Northern winters and the scorching rays of a tropical 
sun; almost everywhere delightful and healthful; traversed by 
noble rivers which connect her with the gulf and the ocean; her 
railroad systems opening to her trade and commerce the markets of 
South and North ; resting one arm upon the slopes of North Caro- 
lina and the other upon the Father of Waters; her own pure 
mountain air breathing like a perpetual benediction upon, and 
cooling and invigorating her valleys; with a soil of matchless fer- 
tility to reward the tact and skill of the agriculturist, let him seek 
what crops he will, from Northern or Southern staple, with mineral 
treasures of coal and iron and marble, and the precious metals in 
almost boundless profusion; she is, indeed, favored of heaven. 
Beautiful, beautiful for situation as the “City of the Great King,” 
yea, beautiful as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, it shall be the joy of 
the whole country. Her famed mechanics, merchants, professional 
men and statesmen are well regarded all the country over, whilst 
her military men, whenever the sword has been drawn in earnest, 
have exhibited a chivalry Saladin might have envied, a bravery 
Cceur de Lion never surpassed. . 
Three times has the Nation bestotved upon a son of hers the 
highest office in her gift—Johnson; Polk, whose accomplished 
widow has long graced the highest circles in this city, as she did 
the salons of the White House; and that grand old warrior, that 
dauntless President, the lion-hearted Old Hickory. 
And yet, not a tithe of the wonderful resources of this noble 
State have been developed, and nothing to a reflecting mind is more 
evident than the fact, that if this development is to be accomplished, 
if the State is to become populous, wealthy and powerful; if it is 
to take the proud stand amongst the States to which it is entitled, 
it can be only through the skilled labor and the educated intelli- 
gence of its citizens; and if these citizens in city and county, in 
village and hamlet, are to become capable of this work, it can only 
be through the agency of such schools as shall reach 4ll classes. 
Private schools and institutions, sustained at great expense as they 
must be, can reach but a small part of the community, and often
-P-A-G-E-203
207 
leave uncared for much of the best and most practical talent. The 
only way, let me repeat, in which you can hope to develop the vast 
resources of the State, is by intelligence brought into full exercise 
by common schools, so organized as to reach every child, and so 
conducted as to educate every child’s highest powers. The nations 
of the Old World understand this full well, and when the great 
Russian Empire was compelled by sheer exhaustion to cease from 
the conflict, make peace with her two powerful antagonists, and 
close the war of the Crimea—almost the first thing she did to re- 
euperate her strength, was to establish schools for the people every- 
where. Not disheartened by losses or discouraged by the sparse- 
ness of her population even, she estabiished free-schools of every 
grade, and, of course, a system of normal schools, to supply them. 
with teachers, increasing the number of the normal schools from 
fifteen in 1871, to forty-one in 1873. Prussia and Prussia’s great 
success in her recent war with France, is a notable example of the 
effects of popular education. And it is upon this that the great 
German Empire rests to-day. 
It is admitted that these peoples’ institutions must be supported 
by the people—but only in proportion to their means. It is a most 
interesting and significant fact, that the institution which we are 
inaugurating to-day, has for its most intelligent advocates and sup- 
porters a large proportion of wealthy men—men shrewd enough 
to know when they are making a wise investment—men as ready 
and as willing to pay the tax required as they are to leave the grumb- 
ling to those who pay little or nothing. At all events, the experi- 
ence of every community proves that nothing is so expensive as ig- 
norance, and that it is far wiser to pay for its prevention than for its 
appalling effects. It is sheer folly to say with Cain, “Am I my 
brother’s keeper?” Let those who wish their children educated pay 
for them. Could we each live the isolated lives of hermits and not 
as members of organized society, this might be plausible; but we 
are so interconnected and interwoven together that the condition of 
each affects more or less all the rest; we cannot escape; the good of 
our neighbors and citizens benefits us, and the bad inflicts upon us 
a curse. The only wise, the only safe thing for us to do, is to pro- 
mote the general welfare by all possible means. But it is not enough 
to establish schools for all, and to be willing to support them; they 
will be of little use, and may be productive of serious and lasting
-P-A-G-E-204
208 
harm, unless they are in the hands of men and women who know 
what their duties are and are qualified to perform them. A thor- 
‘oughly educated and trained teacher is a blessing to any community, 
a bad teacher one of the worst of curses, whilst “every badly con- 
ducted school tends to create a distrust of all education.” Partial 
preparation and low qualifications only mitigate the evil. But these 
facts are so evident that it would seem unnecessary to dwell upon them 
at all, and yet there are persons, alas, they are many, who would on 
no account entrust a young horse to any but a skillful trainer—who 
would be scarcely satisfied with a mouse-trap unless a skilled work- 
man had made it—who would unhesitatingly commit their own 
offspring, with all- their capacities for usefulness and happiness, or 
for crime and misery, to the developing and training of the meanest 
workman, leaying it to him to shape and control the child’s destiny 
for all time. , parental intelligence, parental love, whither has it. 
fled, that children, born in the image of the great and good God, 
continue to be thus accursed ? 
The question here comes up, how shall a supply of competent 
teachers be secured? Now, to be very brief, teaching is a profession, 
like that of law, medicine or divinity, and persons who fulfill its 
requirements must have special qualifications. Some of these are 
‘gentleness, patience, self-control, firmness, love of children, love of 
instruction, ingenuity, tact, good common sense, a wide and accurate 
knowledge of the branches of knowledge to be taught, general 
knowledge, acquaintance with human nature in its early develop- 
ments, a knowledge of best method of education and skill in im- 
parting instruction, together with discipline, management, means by 
which schools may be made not only useful but popular amongst the 
the parents, State educational laws, the duties of good citizenship, 
ete., ete. , 
Now, if the professors of law, medicine and divinity require their 
special schools for instruction and learning, how much greater is the 
demand that those who furnish the basis for these very schools, and 
for all the callings and business of life everywhere, should be sub- 
jected to a thorough and systematic training for their duties. 
It is to meet this want, this necessity, that the State Normal Uni- 
versity has been established—to supply this demand, that the Trus- 
tees of the time-honored University of Nashville have devoted their 
buildings and funds, and, aided by a generous contribution from the
-P-A-G-E-205
209 
enlightened managers of the Peabody Fund, represented to-day by 
one of your most honored citizens, and with the sanction and co- 
operation of the State Board of Education, now throw open their 
doors and give an hearty welcome to ladies and gentlemen from 
this, and every other State, who wish to prepare themselves for tRis 
noble profession. 
In this important result, if it is pot invidious to allude to individ- 
uals where so many have so zealously labored, we are more than any * 
other indebted to to the far-sighted wisdom of one who, himself one 
of the most distinguished teachers of the age, has made his benign 
influence felt all over the, South, and is rearing for himself an im- 
perishable monument of gratitude in the hearts of a great and 
generous-spirited people ; and when the cause of popular education 
has triumphed everywhere, as it surely will, and the normal schools 
and universities shall send forth annually vast armies of teachers, 
no name shall be mentioned with more honor than that of Dr. Sears. 
The State of Tennessee, as I have said, destined to become one of 
the grandest in the Union, already begins to see that teachers, more 
than any others, have her destinies in their hands, and with that 
enlightened public spirit which has ever characterized her people, 
will, it cannot be doubted, speedily grant us both her countenance 
and her money, so that the legitimate work of the institution may 
be carried on from year to year without let or hindrance. 
To attain this result we shall not, I am persuaded, have, like most 
institutions, to present ourselves in the attitude of suppliants for favor, 
but shall ask her to make for herself the wisest and best invest- 
ment—to place a portion of her funds where the income will be large 
and sure; nay, more, we shall go as confiding children and ask at 
our parent’s hand that which we are entitled to, and shall meet no 
grudging response. 
Our wants will indeed be many and great. We must have, of 
course, the-best corps of instructors that can be secured—men and 
women capable of the most varied and extensive instruction—per- 
sons who, for their qualifications, natural and acquired, will com- 
mand the highest respect of the most intelligent and appreciative 
of the student teachers present, who in all their characteristics shall 
be examples of excellence, and whose impress, lasting as it must be, 
will be only good. Such persons are rare, and can only be had for 
14
-P-A-G-E-206
210 
so much money as will induce them to labor for us rather than for 
others, for “the laborer is-worthy of his hire.” 
We must have a professional library—we need it at this moment. 
Pardon me, my friends, is there not some one even here who would 
dglight to give us the few hundred dollars it would require to lay 
the foundation? Is there not some one who would glory in having 
it called by his name, and thus usefully perpetuate his memory in 
“connection with this important stitution? 28 
And here I am reminded of an incident which occurred in con- 
nection with the first Normal-School. Though well tried for more 
than a century abroad, the Normal School was regarded at first as 
an experiment, and was indebted to private munificence for the rent 
of the building it occupied. On the expiration of a short lease, no 
suitable place for it could be found, and its friends at length became 
exceedingly afraid it would’ be turned out of doors. After much 
anxious search, an old, dilapidated academy building, long before 
forsaken, was found in the neighboring town of West Newton, which 
the owner would be glad to sell for a mere trifle. But there was no 
money with which to purchase. The case was, however, laid before 
Mr. Mann, then Secretary of the Board of Education, who had 
begun to despair of finding a home for the new institution. Mor. 
‘Mann was elated, and, with characteristic zeal, and in the midst of 
his excitement, rushed into the office of his friend, Josiah Quincy, 
shouting, “Who wants to buy the highest seat in the Kingdom of 
Heaven!. Who wants the highest seat in the Kingdom of Heaven, 
for it is to be had for fifteen hundred dollars?” Quincy, although 
he probably never expected to buy that seat or any other in those 
blissful regions for money, was amused and interested, and at once 
drew his check for the amount and thus, by this simple act of private 
generosity, the first Normal Institution established on the continent, 
of America obtained a fixed habitation of its own. : 
But we shall need many things, books of reference, maps, philo— 
sophical and chemical apparatus, collections for the study of the 
natural sciences, etc. 
We want to make the buildings we are to occupy more conve-— 
nient and more attractive to the eye. -We ought to have -+~~+' 
ample and beautiful grounds laid out with taste and skill, 
adorned with every tree and shrub which the climate will bear 
we may so blend the useful with the ornamental as to exert ¢
-P-A-G-E-207
211 
finence that shall enhance the value of every man’s property. So 
that, notwithstanding we have great and confident hopes of what 
the State will do for this University, there will always be a place 
for private generosity. Nowhere can private bounty be more wise- 
ly and safely bestowed. Nothing can come amiss, and none should 
be prevented from doing what they can because they cannot do all 
they would. 
In closing, let me add that it is. to assist in organizing and con- 
ducting this great enterprise that I have been invited to come 
amongst you—to assume a position and to attempt the discharge of 
the duties of an office which I could not, under any circumstances, 
have sought, and from whose great responsibilities, delicate and 
trying labors, I might well have shrunk. But having undertaken 
the task, I shall bring to it all the strength of body and mind with 
which the great Creator has endowed me, and consecrate to the 
work all of acquirements I have made, all of talent I possess. 
But, neither I nor any other man can succeed alone, and next to 
the help I hope to derive from almighty power—the wisdom from 
Him who has promised to bestow it liberally, and the lessons of the 
‘Great Teacher, I must look to you and the friends of education 
generally, for sympathy and active support. If I can feel that our 
State officers and legislators are with me, if I can feel sure, as I 
know I may, of the advice and assistance of the accomplished and 
unwearied State Superintendent of Education and the County Su- 
perintendents; if the professional men, teachers and intelligent 
citizens support me, I shall, in the midst of human weakness be 
strong to labor and successful in the undertaking. I bespeak, most 
earnestly, a continuance of that hearty co-operation of which I 
have had so many evidences already. Let the Alumni of this 
ancient University of Nashville—who have so often reflected upon 
it the glories of their own success, in medicine, law and divinity, 
as jurists, statesmen, orators, and men of business—take a new 
pride in Alma Mater. She is not dead. We are not celebrating 
her obsequies, or putting her aside. We are simply clothing her in 
new garments, so that she may once more take her place amongst 
us and exhibit her graces anew to her admiring sons and the world. 
Let her Alumni, I say, continue to take an hSnest pride in her 
welfare, and contribute to her prosperity, assured of as hearty a
-P-A-G-E-208
212 
welcome under the new order of things, as they ever enjoyed in 
the past. : 
Let the gentlemen of the Press, than whom no community can 
boast a more enlightened and earnest corps, help us still, as they 
have always so kindly and efficiently done, and let all classes feel 
that this is more than any other the people’s college, and it wilk 
prosper beyond your most sanguine expectations. 
But I have done. ‘The State Normal University of Tennessee is 
from this day forth an established institution. Whatever it may be 
now in the days of its infancy—the swaddling bands will soon be 
burst, and, as Minerva sprang, all-armed, from the head of Jupiter, 
go shall it, almost at a bound, acquire the strength and manliness 
of mature years. Yes, it shall be the pride of Tennessee, the glory 
of the South, the admiration of the whole country. And, when 
our citizens turn toward this capitol, as the pilgrim towards Mecca, 
and they cry God save the Commonwealth, a still more earnest 
prayer shall arise in their heart of hearts—that God will bless the 
people’s University, and make it perpetual. 
JUDGE SAMUEL WATSON’S ADDRESS. 
President Stearns was followed by Judge Samuel Watson, who 
said: 
1 presume that it is known to most of you here present, that 
there is a fund called the Peabody Fund, given to aid the education 
of the children of the South. This fund was given by George 
Peabody, a native of Massachusetts. He commenced his business. 
life at the South; and in Baltimore he laid the foundation of his 
large fortune; removing from there to London, where he passed. 
most of his days, and ended his life. While a resident of the 
South he formed a strong attachment to its people, and after our. 
civil war ended, seeing the desolation of the South, and believing 
the true source of her future prosperity to be the education of her 
children, he gave for this purpose the sum of two millions of dollars. 
This was invested in various securities, and yields now an annual 
income of about one hundred and thirty thousand dollars. In ad- 
dition to this, he gave one and a half millions of bonds of States 
which have failed, for some years, to pay their interest. But Mr. 
Peabody believed that these States would eventually pay the interest 
on these bonds, for they had always admitted their legality, and
-P-A-G-E-209
213 
yecognized their obligation to pay them. His trustees still hope 
that these States will at some future time commence the payment of 
the interest on these bonds. If they should, it would make the 
full amount of the interest-paying fund given by Mr. Peabody, 
$3,500,000. 
Judge Watson went on to xay that he did not believe these facts 
with regard to Mr. Peabody’s gifts were known throughout the 
South ; if they were, they certainly had not been fully appreciated. 
Such an act of generosity and benevolence as exhibited by him, in 
giving to the South from $2,000,000 to $4,000,000, to aid in the © 
education of our children through all future time, certainly had no 
parallel in history. The income of this fund, amounting to 
$130,000 now, was not distributed amongst all the States of the 
South, for Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky and Missouri did not 
share it, but it was distributed amongst the nine remaining South- 
ern States. This income was distributed, as far as possible, with a 
view to encourage the establishment by the States of pnblic free- 
schools, so that all the children might be benefited by it. The 
wisdom of this course could have been seen by its results in Ten- 
nessee, in which upwards of $100,000 had been distributed. The 
share of Tennessee, in the annual income, if divided according to 
its population, would be about $11,000, but during the past two 
yeats this State had received about $30,000 per annum. This was 
done to foster a growing interest in public free-schools, and if Ten- . 
nessee would successfully establish a good system of such schools, 
her sister States would follow her example. 
The same course had been pursued towards Virginia, and she- 
had now an admirable system of free-schools permanently es- 
tablished. In distributing Tennessee’s share, the Trustees had 
gone into communities where they had shown a willingness to 
establish free-schools, and given them such aid as their necessities _ 
required, and their means would justify. Edgefield, Knoxville and 
Meniphis had thus received $2,000 each, and a school district in 
Davidson county, $1,000, and other communities sums which varied 
from $300 to $1,500. The result had been as hoped for, but it 
would still require the earnest and united efforts of its friends to 
give it permanence and success. Give to the school districts of 
Tennessee such admirable schools as existed in Nashville, and men 
of property and intelligence would rally to their support, and they
-P-A-G-E-210
214 
would become the objects of the pride and affection of all. To 
meet the want of competent teachers, Dr. B. Sears, Agent of the 
Peabody Board, tendered to the State, at the last session of the 
Legislature, $6,000 annually in conjunction with the Peabody 
Board of Trustees, and with their united means they had estab-. 
lished a Normal School, which they had just assembled to inaugu- 
rate. In conjunction with the Normal School, they would maintain 
an Academic School for preparing boys and young men for the 
different pursuits of life, and for entrance into our own, and the 
_other Universities of other States. He then recounted the benefits 
of such a school, and urged the importance of helping the enter- 
prise. There was great need of a Normal School here, for of the 
present laboring population of Tennessee, three-fourths of them 
can neither read or write. One person from each county in the 
State would be educated a teacher free, and those who were too 
poor to pay for tuition would receive it gratis. 
The women of Tennessee were more deeply interested in the 
welfare of the schools than any other class. ‘Teaching was the only 
profession to which woman was welcomed, and the only pursuit in 
life where she was adequately rewarded for her talents and services. 
Already had States in the Union passed laws requiring female teach- 
ers to be paid the same compensation for educational services as 
men, and he trusted the day was not far distant when such a law 
_ would be passed in Tennessee. Judge Watson closed with an earnest 
appeal for the support and encouragement of the school. 
HON. EDWIN H. EWING’S ADDRESS. 
The next speaker was Hon. Edwin H. Ewing, President. of the 
Board of Trustees of the University of Nashville, of whose remarks, 
the following is a synopsis: 
It seems to have been.expected that I, as President of the Uni- 
versity and a member of the Normal School Board, should say some- 
thing upon the present occasion. Indeed, looking back for a long 
time upon the changing fortunes of the Institution, as an Academy, 
College, and lastly as a University, my age and experience but ren- 
der it appropriate.that I should address a few remarks upon the 
inauguration of another enterprise.
-P-A-G-E-211
215 
More than fifty years ago, in my green boyhood, I still see before: 
me Dr. James Priestly, the grim disciplinarian, the Roger Ascham 
of his day. Before that, even, the college flourished under the mild 
sway of Wm. Hume, a rare man, learned, conscientious, and unas- 
suming; but he is dead, but has left no better man behind him. 
And then, when the University was born, came another cast of man, 
a man. of genius, of learning, of world-wide views, of lofty pride, 
but Roman pride, who warred against the high and spared the 
humble; one who sought to reach the mass by teaching the instruc- 
tors. He was above his day and generation. He held the views 
which were regarded as visionary by the mass, but by the sagacious 
few.as prophetic—Dr. Philip Lindsley, clarissimum nomen. With 
his departure the glories of the University became dimmed. For 
many years it led a life obscure, but in many respects like a fallow 
field. The University, though not what it might have been, was 
not without its glory. Some of its alumni who have passed away, 
may well have memorial tablets in Tennessee, with haud tmmemor 
written upon them, and some who are still living are not a disgrace 
to their venerable mother. Eheu! fugaces labwntur anni! How 
few sons of Alma Mater remain! , ‘ 
Old men look upon the past and the young sigh for the future. 
The wisdom of the one should complement the energy of the other. 
The past of the wise man should be but the pedestal of the future. 
Sentiment makes the old Laudatores temporis acti of the ancients 
true. But if the ancestors were always better, then the race is on a 
descending scale. I hope not, Eden and original sin to the contrary, 
I look forward to the full redemption of the human race. True it 
is, there were “many brave men before Agamemnon.” So there 
have been many men of huge learning before the savants of our 
day. In times past, learning was accumulated like piles of lumber, 
like hoarded gold; but now learning has begun to be distributed. 
Its use was but for individuals, comparatively. The middle ages 
. could not claim men of vast learning. Names may demand our 
admiration, but still nothing can be said in their praise.’ There 
were no schools, colleges, nor book stores in those days, but univer- 
sities only for the affluent which panned out great men. Distribution 
exhausts the source to some degree, as to the ore in the mountain 
and the coal’ in its bed. The instructor multiplies his own knowl 
edge by communicating it to others. The stream rises above the
-P-A-G-E-212
216 
fountain. Instead of confining learning to ourselves, we should’ 
distribute it, and mankind would be benefitted in some degree. 
This institution, which we have met to inaugurate to night, is a 
new departure for Tennessee. I know, and learned through the 
able President of the school, that Tennessee ranks high in the scale 
of ignorance, and we certainly deserve a diploma for our laudable 
endeavors in that regard. Iam almost afraid to make the compari- 
son, but we are prepared to contest the palm with any State, when 
the question of ignorance is revived. We are ashamed to make re- 
turns for our high preferment. Our venerable University, though 
mossy with time and seared by lightning, has still some vigorous 
boughs remaining. Her medical department is the equal of any in 
the South, if not on the whole continent. It is now about to put 
on a new branch, and we are to establish for the first time in Ten- 
nessee, with the countenance of the State, a systematic school for 
the education of instructors. The desultory efforts made heretofore 
could be traced; now, by a happy concurrence of circumstances, the 
means are found to build upon a plan. The funds of the University 
proper, the Montgomery Bell fund, a splendid series of college 
buildings, and last and best a magnificent portion of the Peabody 
fund, are now to be placed at the disposal of the Normal School 
Board, in presenti, with hope of aid from the State when better off. 
Feliz austorum qui sit. 
Peabody said to himself, Homo sum, nihil humani a me alientum, 
He was a living, voluntary giver, who did not wait for death to 
extort his charity, not like him who 
“Left a name at which the world grew pale, 
To point a moral or adorn a tale.” 
Ought I not to say something by way of exhortation to all, to 
come up to the help of the University, especially to the rich, to save 
themselves and their posterity?. But enough. These generalities, 
which should have been the exordium, rather than the peroration 
of this address, have been supplemented and made practical by the 
able and learned President of the State Normal School, Mr. Stearns, 
whom you have already heard, and who comes to us with high 
testimonials, which I have no doubt he will sustain. 
At the conclusion of Mr. Ewing’s address, State Superintendent 
Trousdale said he believed the entire programme had ‘been carried 
out, and the assembly might consider themselves dismissed.

ELEEMOSYNARY SCHOOLS. 
NASHVILLE. 
TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
The first attempt to educate the blind of Tennessee, by establish~ 
ing a school especially adapted to their wants, was made at Nash~ 
ville in 1843. Some exhibitions of reading in embossed letters 
were then given, and at once attracted public attention: Benevo~" 
lent citizens immediately contributed for the purpose of maintaining 
a school for the blind. Some, not satisfied with their own contribu- 
tions, levied contributions from others. While one paid money, 
another subscribed an annual sum towards the support. of the 
school. Some gave furniture, and others provisions. This was 
something new under the sun, and it was good, to a certain extent. 
All were sure of this; few, if any, stopped to inquire, ewi bono? 
or stopped to count the ultimate cost. There was a general enthu- 
siasm which favored doing all that could be done for the blind, 
although not a tenth of the benefits that could be conferred upon 
them was known. Neither was it then known that the blind in the 
State could be counted by hundreds. But there was one evident 
fact, the blind could be taught to read by the sense of touch, and 
this was then sufficient to excite wonder and raise enthusiasm. At 
that time, under prominent management, there could have been 
established here a school for the blind, which, in a few years, might 
have been among the foremost in this country; but the enthusiasm 
was allowed to cool. 
The General Assembly of 1843-44 met.’ An appropriation of 
$1,500 annually, for two years, was made to support the School for 
the Blind at Nashville. Three trustees were appointed to take 
charge of the money appropriated, also of all sums donated by viti-
-P-A-G-E-214
  - 218 
zens. The cashier of the Bank of Tennessee was.made Treasurer. . 
In 1845 the Superintendent resigned, and the vacancy was filled 
by Wm. H. Churchman, a young man of energy and ability. He 
only lacked experience, and here was the school in which he was to 
gain enough of it to fit him for an honorable and useful career in 
after life. He found the school almost without money, and almost 
without pupils. Enthusiasm had been followed by doubt, and, in 
somé instances, disgust. Mr. Churchman took two bright blind 
boys, tanght them for a few months for a special purpose, without 
neglecting the others under his care. At,the same time he pushed 
inquiries in all directions concerning the blind children of Tennes- 
see, and having heard of more blind children in East Tennessee 
than in any other section of the State, he concluded to make a trip 
in that direction, and bring back as many as possible. As soon as 
the two boys had learned to read, and knew something about 
geography and arithmetic, he purchased a horse and carryall, took 
the two boys with him, and journeyed through hjls and hollows to 
Greeneville, showing the attainments of his two blind boys to the 
parents of blind children, and to other persons who would be likely 
to influence the parents to part with their children for the purpose 
of giving them an education.. After about forty days of tribulation 
and travel, Mr. Churchman succeeded in bringing to Nashville five 
or six blind children, who were to form the nucleus of his school, 
because nearly all of those previously admitted to the school were 
adults. Mr. Churchman appears to have been aware that the adult 
blind, who had grown up in ignorance and idleness, learned with 
difficulty, while the young learn rapidly, and with ease. He raised 
some money by subscriptions, and in 1846 obtained the passage of 
a law appropriating from the State Treasury $2,500 annually, for 
two years, for the maintenance of the school.. This General Assem- 
bly also gave the same charter of incorporation to the School for 
Deaf Mutes and to the School for the Blind. In the summer of 
1846, Mr. Churchman. became discouraged, and resigned his posi-~ 
tion. In 1848 the sum of $5,000 annually, for two years, was ob- 
tained from the General Assembly for the purpose of maintaining 
the school, purchasing grounds, and erecting buildings thereon. 
From 1847 to 1851 the school had four different Superintendents, 
The frequent changes retarded progress. Yet, in spite of many 
disadvantageous circumstances, there was some improvement. : In
-P-A-G-E-215
219. 
1852 and 1853 grounds were purchased, fenced in, and a large four~ 
story brick building erected for the use of the school, at a cost of 
‘about $13,000. From this time to 1861, additions were made to 
the main building, both were improved, out-buildings were con- 
structed, and the grounds ornamented with trees and shrubbery, at 
an additional cost of about $10,000. Early in 1861 the school 
contained forty pupils. Many of these could read well, and write 
~ legibly, and had a fair English education, Some manufactured 
brooms, seated chairs, and made mattresses. A few were skillful 
performers upon the piano, and good vocalists. The schools, as a 
whole, was just ready to convince the citizens of the State, beyond 
the shadow of a doubt, that it was not only deserving of all that 
had been bestowed upon it, but that it was worthy of still greater 
favor. Apparently all great obstacles to success had been over- 
come. There was seemingly a bright promise of prosperity and 
usefulness in the future, but in its stead came the devastation of 
war. The building, against the protest of the trustees, was first 
occupied as a hospital, and afterwards destroyedgso that there was 
not one brick left upon another. The school waé for a time car- 
ried on in two private residences, the boys in one, the girls in the 
other; this arrangement was discontinued when all the school 
money was expended. Those pupils who had homes, returned to 
them; those who had none, were cared for by the Superintendent 
until better days came. They were provided with food, shelter and 
clothing at different private residences in the country, and given 
such educational advantages, from time to time, as could be ob- 
tained. In 1865 and 1866, the Superintendent was. reimbursed by 
the General Assembly for his expenditures. It was claimed, how- 
ever, by the State Comptroller and Treasurer that they could not 
pay out any money for the maintenance of the school under any 
Jaw enacted prior to 1865, and that the maxim that in war laws are 
annulled, applied to all appropriations. 
The General Assembly of 1866 passed an act re-establishing the 
schoo], and making the appropriation as heretofore allowed by law. 
The school was carried on in rented houses until 1873, when the 
trustees were enabled to remove the school to its present location, 
by the munificent donation of John M. Lea and his wife, Elizabeth 
Lea. This donation was a large private dwelling house, and lands 
pertaining thereto. Mr. Claiborne, who was the owner of this 
'
-P-A-G-E-216
220 
property in 1860, then estimated its value at $40,000. ‘The tecent 
appropriations of the State for the purpose of worthily supplement- 
ing the donation of Mr. and Mrs. Lea, and establishing 4 first-class 
school for the blind, are too well known to require iiotive here, 
further than to state, that the General Assembly of 1872 determined 
that a building should be erected suitable for a first-class school for 
the blind, and appropriated as much money towards its erection as 
it was thought possible the State could then afford, intentionally 
leaving the work to be finished through additional appropriations, 
to be made by their successors. The General Assembly of 1874, 
although elected upon.a platform of reform and retrenchment, 
during a period of excessive drouth, made a liberal appropriation 
for the continuance of the work, specifying what portions of the 
work should be finished with the appropriation, looking to the 
next General Assembly for the appropriation of the remainder of 
the original estimate. The buildings, when completed, will be, for 
its special purpose, one of the best in the country, and if in the 
future it should b® thought advisable to divide the establishment 
into families of ‘ten or fifteen. members each, having nothing in 
common except the school-rooms, gymnasiums and play-grounds, 
thus following the family system ordained by the Creator, the 
present building can be used for that purpose without material 
alteration. In this respect the structure will, perhaps, be superior 
to any other used for the blind in the United States, except the 
Perkins’ Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind, now 
carried on upon the family system. ‘To accomplish this, the princi- 
pal building recently underwent considerable alteration, and four ~ 
new houses were erected at a cost of eighty thousand doilars. Our 
school is not now conducted as efficiently as it can be when our 
‘building is completed and properly heated. 
The number of pupils at the last quarterly enrollment was fifty- 
seven. Of those who have left the school, some have become 
teachers of music, some teachers of literary branches. Many have 
earned a living in whole or in part by manual labor or traffic. 
Three have been preachers, two have superintended institutions for 
the blind. Nearly all have been. made happier, and more useful 
than they could have been without an education—they havé exert+ 
ed a general influence for good—they have found a higher place in
-P-A-G-E-217
221 
the community where they have lived, and are living, than they 
could have done had they remained in ignorance. 
The annual appropriation is now the same per capita that it was 
in 1858, (See Public Acts 1857-8, page 79.) The cost of living, 
however, is nearly.doubled, and accordingly a special appropriation 
has been made, for specific purposes, of $5,000 per annum. 
KNOXVILLE. 
TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
This school is under the control of a Board of Trustees, of which 
John L. Moses is President. The intellectual department is in 
charge of J. H. Tjams, as Principal, assisted by six instructors. 
LOCATION, 
This Institution is located at Knoxville, the Metropolis of East 
Tennessee. The Institution buildings are situated on an eminence 
overlooking the city, and affording a commanding view of the ad- 
jacent country. A view of rare beauty is presented to the beholder 
- from the portico of the school building. At his feet lies the city ; 
in the rear foreground a glimpse of the Tennessee River is seen; 
immediately beyond rise the bold river bluffs, while in the distance, 
far away, the eye rests upon the lofty ranges of the Alleghany 
Mountains. The selection of such a site for an Institution for the 
Deaf and Dumb was truly a happy one, for in the beauty that the 
eye here on every side drinks in, some compensating pleasure is 
afforded to ears bereft of all sweet sounds. 
oe HISTORY. 
The subjoined history of this institution is an extract from the 
report of Jno. L. Moses, Esq., President of the Board of Trustees. 
It is taken from the Twelfth Biennial Report of the Board of Trus- 
tees to the Legislature: 
We deem it not inappropriate to present, in this convection, a few 
facts pertaining to the history of an institution which, under the 
signal blessings of Divine Providence, and the fostering care of the
-P-A-G-E-218
222 
State, has accomplished so large a measure of usefulness and taken 
so strong a hold upon the sympathies of our people. 
The School owes its origin to the benevolent impulses and prompt 
and persistent action of the late Gen. John Cocke, of Grainger, when 
a member of the Senatorial Branch of the General Assembly. 
On the 20th of December, 1843, a bill providing for the estab- 
lishment, in Nashville, of an Institution for the blind, being on its 
third reading before the Senate, Gen. Cocke moved to amend by the 
addition of a section providing for the appropriation of $2,000 for 
putting a Deaf and Dumb School in operation at Knoxville. After 
the substitution of $1,000 for $2,000, the amendment was adopted, 
and then the entire bill was rejected by a vote of 11 to 13. On the 
following day, this vote was reconsidered, and other amendments 
were adopted ; the vote on Gen. Cocke’ 's amendment was reconsid- 
ered by a majority of three, but it was again adopted by a majority 
of one, and the bill was finally passed in the Senate, « on the 21st of 
December, 1843, by a vote of 13 to 12. 
The bill went to the House, where, on its third reading, January 
25th, 1844, it was rejected by a majority of three, but the vote was 
subsequently reconsidered, and the bill—in the form in which it had- 
left the Senate—was passed in the House, January 29th, by a ma- 
jority of fifteen votes. 
The Governor of the State appointed, to constitute the first Board 
of Trustees, Messrs. R. B. McMullen, Joseph Eastabrook and D. R. 
McAnally, who met in Knoxville July 27th, 1844, accepted the 
appointment, and organized by electing Mr. McMullen, President, 
and Mr. McAnally, Secretary. 
These gentlemen immediately went to work with characteristic 
zeal, opening correspondence with officers of similar institutions in 
other States, obtaining information as to the number and situation 
of deaf-mutes in our own State, selecting the services of a compe-~ 
tent instructor of the pupils. — . 
Rev. Thos. MacIntire, of Ohio, was made the first Principal, and 
under his charge the exercised of the school were commenced in 
what was known as the Churchwell House, in East Knoxville, about 
the Ist of April, 1845. In the following November, Mr. .C. w. 
Myers was appointed an assistant teacher. 
By an Act passed January 31st, 1846, the General Assembly 
. recognized the existence of the institution, incorporated it under the
-P-A-G-E-219
223 
name of “The Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School,” made better 
provision for its support, and added Messrs. T. Sullins, J. H. Cowan 
and Campbell Wallace, to its Board of Trustees. 
It now became a leading object of the Board to procure means 
for the erection of more appropriate buildings for the purposes-of the 
school, which was vigorously prosecuted. The Board issued circular 
letters to the benevolent throughout the State, applied to Congress 
for a donation of public lands, established several local agencies, and 
fortunately placed in the position of manager of a general soliciting 
and collecting agency, Col. John M. Davis, of Knox county. The 
efforts of Col. Davis met with a gratifying success, and the energy 
and faithfulness he displayed in the prosecution of his duties, secured 
the approbation of the public and the gratitude of the Board. 
Individual generosity provided for the construction in 1846, of 
what now constitutes the eastern wing of the buildings, and money 
derived from the same source, supplemented the Legislative aid 
granted at different sessions during the period which has since 
elapsed, and entered into some of the commodious structures which: 
have meanwhile been erected. 
The grounds belonging to the institution were obtained at differ- 
ent times by gift and purchase. They now embrace about eight 
acres, lying in a nearly rectangular form, entirely surrounded by 
streets, and are handsomely improved and very valuable. 
In 1847, negotiations were opened with the late Calvin Morgan, 
Esq., of this city, for the two acres which constitute the site of the 
main buildings, and he was offered what was then regarded asa 
high price, (I think $800 per acre). He declined to sell, but gen- 
erously made a donation of the land. 
In 1852 the Trustees bought three and a half acres for $2,000, 
and iu 1858 two and a half acres for $5,800. 
Ten years ago, when, in consequence of the war, which was 
desolating the country, our operations were suspended, the present 
writer, in behalf of the Board, in a report he then submitted to the 
General Assembly, expressed the belief that so noble a charity as 
the Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School, although it had already more 
than realized the expectation of its founders, bad yet before it a 
career of still wider usefulness and much greater prosperity. 
That this prediction has been verified to the letter is not a matter 
of unauthorized assumption, but one of undeniable fact. The
-P-A-G-E-220
224 
school to-day, in. the number of pupils, the thoroughness and effi- 
‘eiency of its course of instruction, the care bestowed upon the moral 
and physical training of its inmates, the economy of its management 
and the harmonious co-operation of all who are in authority, oecu- 
pies an advanced position among the best of the deaf and dumb 
schools in the land. . 
“BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS. 
The buildings pertaining to the institution consist of the main 
building, an’ addition, used exclusively for school purposes, and 
erected at cost of some ten thousand dollars, the Principal’s resi- 
dence, a printing office and shoe-shop, a stable and a coal and wood 
house. The entire cost of the above enumerated buildings approxi- 
mates seventy-five thousand dollars. The buildings are capable of 
accommodating comfortably one hundred and fifty pupils. The 
grounds comprise seven acres, and are now very valuable. The 
grounds, since the resumption of the school after the close of the 
-war, have been, mainly by labor performed by the boys, improved 
and beautified to such an extent that they will compare very favor- 
ably with the grounds of schools of a similar character elsewhere. 
The. Institution buildings are much less pretentious and attractive 
architectually than those found in many of our sister States, but 
they serve their purpose admirably; and since the construction of 
the addition referred to the facilities for the care and instruction of 
the inmates of the Institution, are perhaps unequaled by those pro- 
vided by any other institution of the kind in the country. It is 
thought that the value of the buildings and grounds is about one 
hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. 
ATTENDANCE. 
The whole number of pupils admitted into the school since the 
date of its organization cannot be ascertained, owing to the fact that 
during the war its records and documents were destroyed. Since 
the date of the re-organization of the school (December 3rd, 1866,) 
the entire number of pupils under instruction has been 255. The 
school re-opened in. 1866 with an attendance of thirty-nine pupils. 
Each session since found the number augmented until now (Decem- 
ber 13th, 1875,) the number of pupils i in attendance is 129—males 
76, females 53.
-P-A-G-E-221
225 
The total number of deaf-mutes in the State is, according tc to the 
~ census of 1870, 570. 
SUPPORT. 
The school derives its support ‘almost entirely from the State. 
$5,000 is received as an annual appropriation from the State Treas- 
ury, and an additional amouht per capita is allowed for each indigent 
pupil admitted into the institution. 
THE SCHOOL. 
The school numbers 129 pupils, classified according to their attain- 
ments, without reference to the length of time under instruction. 
The number of classes taught is six. The method of instruction 
prevalent in this country, and practiced in this institution, is known 
as the French system, which was invented by De.L’Epee, improved 
by Lecard, his successor, and introduced into this country half a 
century ago by Thomas H. Gallaudet, since which time it has been 
diligently cultivated by men of eminent ability. This system, by 
means of a language of signs, imparts to the deaf and dumb the 
meaning of written language, enables them to communicate their 
thoughts by writing, and affords them the means of moral as well 
as mental development. ‘The sign language as a method of instruc- 
tion, has stood the best of all tests—that of years of successful use. 
To such a degree of perfection has. this language been brought that 
by it the most delicate shades of meaning may be conveyed and 
instruction imparted in any branch of education however difficult. 
Whilé such is its simplicity that our youngest pupils may be made 
to comprehend the existence of God, the story of our Savior’s 
sufferings, the difference between right and wrong; the happy results 
of the one, the evil consequences of the other. 
Another method of instruction for deaf-mutes is that of articula- 
tion and’ this method combined with that of the sign-language has 
been in use in thisschool for the past several years; but beyond 
some special instruction given toa few of the more promising pupils 
on the part of some of the teachers, nothing has been done. - It is 
the intention of the Board, however, speedily to inaurgurate some 
plan by which those of our pupils capable of receiving and being 
profited by lip-reading and articulation may enjoy the advantages 
of a thorough and systematic course of instruction.

The text-books in use with the exception of those used by the 
beginning classes, are such as.are used in other schools. The sub- 
joined compositions are introdued as serving to illustrate the use of 
our language as acquired by a deaf-mute of ordinary capacity, after 
having been under ‘instruction for a period of time as indicated 
below: 
A Bird.—A man shoots a bird with’a gun. He carries the bird 
home. A girl catches a bird. She keeps the bird ina cage. She 
feeds the bird in the cage. (George W. Sparkman, of Beginning _ 
Class, under instruction nine months. 
Flowers.—God made the flowers in the garden. There are a 
great many in the fields and the woods. When I wasin New York, 
I saw a great many flowers. There are a great many at home and 
’ ence I saw a bad man steal some. There are a great many flowers 
in Knoxville. Mrs. Jones has a great many'and she loves to’ work 
them. My. mother has flowers and when I go home I will help her 
to work with them. Flowers are very sweet and pretty, and I love 
to smell them.—(Moses Rosefeld, of Miss Davis’ Class, three years 
at school.) 
About Maud’s Crochet Work.—One day Maud thought that she 
would give a nice present to her little sister Carrie, because Carrie’s 
birth-day came soon. She intended to give it to her on her birth- 
day. When Carrie came down that morning she found: a beautiful 
tidy on her little chair, she guessed it was from sister Maud. She 
asked if she did that pretty crochet for her, but Maud would not tell 
her, so she ran to her mother and said, “ Did you make it for me?” 
Her mother said no, “It is your birth-day present from Maud. 
She made it for you.” So she ran to Maud and threw her arms 
around her neck and kissed her and thanked her again and again. 
She will prize it very highly because it was from her favorite sister. 
Mand thought that she would make the tidy becanse Carrie did not 
know how to do crochet work. Maud did not let any one know 
what she was doing but stole away and did her work secretly in the 
garden. The governess had taught her how to work them. It is so 
good for children to work crochet or do anything that will give others, 
happiness. —Kate W. Haslam, of Mr. Moses’s Class, five years at 
school.

RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION. 
When our pupils first come to us, they come with minds en- 
‘shrouded in gross mental and moral. darkness. It is our aim not 
only to educate their minds but to cultivate in their hearts those 
moral and religious principles which will teach them through life to 
abhor that which is evil, to cleave to that which is good. We 
would not only make of these afflicted ones independent, respect- 
able, intelligent citizens, but honorable, useful, Christian men and 
women. We persevere in this endeavor, bit with no sectarian 
spirit. The Bible is held up to them as the Great Sun around which 
all lesser luminaries must revolve. 
INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT. 
Recognizing the importance of the ‘introduction of trades, not 
only as a means of livelihood to our pupils after leaving the institu- 
tion but as a means of teaching them habits of industry while at 
school, the Board has recently established, in connection with the 
school, a printing office and a shoe-shop. Of course it cannot be 
expected that an industrial department can be made even self- 
sustaining for some time to come, but if we can succeed in making 
good workmen out of our pupils, a result of more value to the 
State shall have been attained than the money spent in having ac- 
complished of so worthy an undertaking. 
RESULTS. 
The results arising from the operations of this institution are 
glorious enough to compensate for all the labor and expense in- 
volved. Here there is shed into darkened minds the light of reason 
and religion, so that by means of an education these children of 
silence are Jed out of darkness into light, out of gloom into hap- 
piness; the duty they owe their Creator, themselves and their fellow- 
men is understood, and the rich return they make to the State as 
educated and law-abiding citizens and as. intelligent laborers are 
some of the results here effected. Our Savior, when upon earth, 
opened the eyes of the blind and unstopped the ears of the deaf; so 
that in the maintenance of this noble charity, the people of this 
State are imitating, in a human manner, the divine impulse to min- 
ister to the unfortunate, and in these ministrations. they but elevate 
and ennoble themselves.

  Universities, Colleges and High Schools. 
EAST TENNESSEE UNIVERSITY. 
East Tennessee College was chartered in 1807, as one of two 
beneficiaries of the grant made by the United States to Tennessee 
of lands derived from North Carolina. - But little was received 
by the College from the lands, for although they were sold, the 
Legislature of the State, at the instance of the purchasers, unjustly 
postponed the times of payment, and finally remitted the debts 
altogether. In 1838, the College, having no other resource, accept- 
ed of the State a half township of land in the Ocoee District in lieu 
of all claims. From that source about $40,000 were obtained— 
a sum far short of that which was really due. 
Blount College, chartered in 1792, was merged in East Tennes- 
nessee College in 1807, and transferred to the latter its small prop- 
erty. In 1846, University rights and privileges were conferred on 
the Trustees, and the name of the College was changed to the name 
it now bears, of 
EAST TENNESSEE UNINERSITY. 
The revenues of the institution were always very insufficient for 
its actual wants. The patronage upon which, in common with 
similar institutions in Tennessee, it had to depend for support, was 
generally small and uncertain, and at times almost entirely failed. 
In 1862 the war closed its doors. 
Before that time, a number of plain, but suitable and capacious, 
buildings had been erected on the beautiful site of the University ; 
the Faculty and Curriculum compared favorably with any other in 
the State, and the reputation of Knoxville for healthfulness was 
long established. So that up to 1862, although the institution had
-P-A-G-E-225
229 
not gained a brilliant name, it had become widely known as a good 
school of higher learning, admirably located, and only needing 
funds in order to develope it into one of the first rank in the coun- 
try. At one period, and for a succession of years, it had a consid- 
erable accession of students from Middle and West Tennessee, 
Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. 
At the close of the war the buildings were found to have been 
partly destroyed by military occupancy, and were unfit for use; the 
scientific apparatus and collections had been ruined or scattered ; 
the library was reduced to, perhaps, one-fourth of its former size ; 
the trees were cut down, the fences carried off, and the grounds 
turned into an entrenched camp and hospital. But, within a year or 
so, the Trustees had the remaining buildings repaired ; and in 1866 
the University was reopened. The beginning was very small. The 
work of education in the State had been interrupted for years, and 
there were, therefore, no pupils ready for College. The people 
were generally unable to educate their sons. But with the lapse of 
time this condition of things improved, until 1869, when 
: 
THE TENNESSEE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE 
was established in the University. Its endowment from the Uni- 
ted States was invested in 396 State of Tennessee bonds of $1,000 
each, bearing six per cent. interest. The new College was at once 
organized by the Trustees upon a broad and liberal foundation, and 
a full corps of able teachers was elected by them. Their first efforts 
to realize the ideal school for which their predecessors had longed 
and labored, were attended with difficulty. The interest on the 
College fund was withheld for some two years by the Legislature, 
and since then the State has failed, except for a time, to pay the in- 
terest on its bonds constituting the College endowment, Notwith- 
standing this serious obstacle, the success of the enterprise has been 
very gratifying. The institution is in a better condition than any 
college in Tennessee ever was before. A very. fine farm for its use 
has been purchased ; three large buildings have been erected; an 
excellent chemical laboratory has been provided and equipped; by 
the donation of $15,000 from the city of Knoxville, the means are 
secured for the purchase of a good library, and the grounds have 
‘been improved and adorned. Every year the number of students 
is increased from a wider sphere ; and the next Catalogue will give
-P-A-G-E-226
230 
the names ot between three and four hundred students from eight 
different States. Each year, also, the standard of scholarship and 
the tone of the institution are elevated. As the preparatory schools: 
of the country improve, and the public appreciation of the higher 
education ripens, the attendance of students will be enlarged, and 
the character of the school will strengthen and advance toward. 
perfection. 
The College is chiefly a scientific school, but its classical depart- 
ment is ably maintained. Special attention is paid, and prominence 
given, to studies which are related to Agriculture and the Mechanic. 
Arts. ‘The instruction in these sciences is now quite sufficient for- 
the occasion, and will be increased in all important directions. 
The government. of the institution is military, and is adminis- 
tered by student officers, under the direction of a United States. 
army officer, by whom the ‘students are taught military: tactics. 
The quiet, orderly and gentlemanly bearing of the Cadets elicits 
general commendation, and so far attests the good quality of their- 
training. 
UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. | 
Davidson Academy was incorporated by the General Assembly of 
North Carolina, December 29, 1785. It was endowed by the State- 
with two hundred and forty aeres of land, lying immediately adja-. 
cent to the then southern boundary of the town of Nashville. . Tt 
is now included within the compactly built and most beautiful por- 
tions of the city. This land, with the exception of about seven 
acres reserved for the site of the Academy, and since called the 
College Square or Campus, was sold by auction, in small lots, in 
1803. The total amount realized did not exceed twenty thousand 
dollars. It must be recollected, however, that the town then con-- 
tained a population of only about 400, that there was little prospect 
of its ever becoming the metropolis of Tennessee, and that steamers . 
had not yet been dreamed of for road or river. General James. 
Robertson and Rev. T. B. Craighead may be regarded as foster- 
fathers of the Academy, which again is the historic germ of the- 
present: wonderful educational development of Nashville and Middie- 
‘Tennessee.
-P-A-G-E-227
231 
Cumberland College was incorporated by the Legislature of Ten- 
nessee September 11, 1806, and in ‘it were merged the name and 
rights of Davidson Academy. This change was effected at the 
request of the Trustees of the latter, in consequence of a previous 
grant by Congress of one hundred thousand acres of land for the 
endowment of two colleges—one in East and the other in West 
Tennessee—as the two grand divisions of the State were then de- 
nominated. The West Tennessee of that day is now Middle Ten- 
nessee, 
The College was opened for the reception of students in Novem- 
ber, 1809; The Faculty consisted of Dr. James Priestley, Presi- 
dent; Rev. William Hume, Professor of Languages; and George 
Martin, Esq., teacher of the Grammar School. . These gentlemen 
were eminently qualified for their respective stations. The College 
“continued in successful operation seven years, or until October, 
1815. Its doors were then closed from the sheer want of funds to 
sustain it any longer. Its revival was attempted in November, 
1820, under the auspices of its former distinguished and respected 
President, but his lamented death on the 6th of February follow- 
ing, again prostrated the hopes and efforts of its friends. During 
the above period of seven years, ninetcen of the students were ad- 
mitted in course to the first degree in the Arts; Ephraim H. Fos- 
ter, John Bell, and other eminent men being among the number. 
May 12, 1824, the Rev. Philip Lindsley, D. D., accepted the 
presidency, which he had declined in 1822, and again in 1828. He 
had also previously declined the Presidency of Transylvania Uni- 
versity, and that of the College of New Jersey. He subsequently 
declined the Presidency of the University of Pennsylvania, the 
University of Alabama, ete., and devoted himself with singular 
steadfastness of purpose to the educational interests of Tennessee, 
amid every conceivable discouragement. He was a century in ad- 
vance of his contemporaries. He had a prophetic eye, and in some 
respects a prophetic fate. 
In 1825 a farm of 120 acres, near the College, was purchased at 
$60 per acre (total cost $7,200). Portions of this land were sold 
soon after for about $17,000, leaving thirty acres. In 1853 a few | 
acres of this land were sold at about $5,000 per acre, in order to 
complete the Medical and College Halls. Sixteen acres of the said
-P-A-G-E-228
232 . 
. f 
“farm” now constitute the University campus, nearly a mile with- 
in the city limits. And some six acres are held for lease. : 
“The University of Nashville” became the legal style and title 
of the College, by an act of the Legislature passed November 27, 
1826. 
The original grant of 50,000 acres of land by Congress was, by 
legislative management, for many years, rendered utterly unavail- 
able. Congress directed the whole to be located in a body, and not 
to be sold for less than two dollars per acre. The Legislature of 
Tennessee, violatirig both conditions, located the grant in small de- 
tached parcels south of French Broad and Holston rivers, and sold 
it on a credit for one dollar per acre. And even of this. mere 
moiety of the intended Congressional donation, very little was ever 
received. At length, after thirty years vexatious delay, the General 
Assembly, during the session of 1837-8, agreed to allow the Uni- ~ 
versity the half of a township, or 11,520 acres of land in the 
Ocoee District, then recently acquired from the Cherokee Nation, 
in lien of its claim upon the State for both principal (not less than 
$100,000) and interest, for thirty years—so long withheld for the 
exclusive benefit of the primitive occupants and their successors. 
This compromise yielded to the University about $40,000, and con- 
stituted its first and only source of annual revenue. 
In 1822, (August 26), by virtue of a compact between the State 
of Tennessee and the University of North Carolina, 40,000 acres 
of land were secured to Cumberland College, in the Western Dis- 
trict, one-fourth of which, as was then customary, was awarded to 
the locator for his services. The remaining 30,000 acres were sold 
in 1834 for thirty thousand dollars, with interest. About the half 
has been paid. 
During and after President Lindsley’s administration, the citi- 
zens of Nashville have aided materially in the erection of buildings. 
October 2d, 1850, President Lindsley’s resignation took effect. 
During his term 1,059 new students matriculated, all in the college 
classes, of whom 413 were graduated. In the history of Tennessee 
and the Southwest, the names of these scholars and graduates ap- 
pear prominently and honorably. 
The College was suspended until October, 1854, when it was re- 
opened in a handsome stone edifice, constructed during the two
-P-A-G-E-229
233 
previous years, under the supervision of Adolphus Heiman, archi- 
tect. 
In February, 1855, John Berrien Lindsley was elected Chancel- 
cellor of the University. The Western Military Institute was soon 
afterwards merged into the College, which, until February, 1862, 
was conducted somewhat upon the plan of the Virginia Military 
Institute. This feature has since been incorporated into all the 
Agricultural State Colleges created by act of Congress. 
From the fall of Fort Donelson until the close of the late war, 
the extensive college grounds and buildings were occupied as mili- 
tary hospitals. Never having been deserted or abandoned by its 
official custodians, the establishment was entered upon the Quarter- 
master’s Rolls of the United States Army, at an annual rent of 
$7,000; hence the University has a just claim upon the Govern- 
ment for a handsome sum, 
In 1855 Montgomery Bell, a wealthy iron manufacturer, be- 
queathed to the University $20,000, coupled with certain condi- 
tions. This bequest was accepted. In 1867, the fund now being 
$40,000 and more, the Montgomery Bell Academy was opened as 
the Preparatory Department of the University. 
In May, 1870, Dr. J. B. Lindsley resigned the office of Chan- 
cellor, and General E. Kirby Smith was elected his successor, and 
the College re-opened upon the military system. 
In 1875 General Smith resigned, taking position in the Univer- 
sity of the South. The Collegiate Department was again suspended, 
aud in its stead a State Normal School established. To this institu- 
tion the Trustees of the Peabody Education Fund contribute $6,000 
per annum. The Montgomery Bell Academy constitutes its Boys’ 
Model School. It is the only completely equipped Normal School 
in the late Confederate States, and its friends anticipate a career of 
brilliant and popular usefulness. Eben 8. Stearns is President of 
the State Normal School and Chancellor of the University. 
MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. 
October 11, 1850, Drs. John M. Watson, A. H. Buchanan, Wm. 
K. Bowling, C. K. Winston, Robert M. Porter, and J. Berrien 
Lindsley were elected Professors. Dr. Lindsley was Dean from 
this date until October, 1856. The building on the old Davidson
-P-A-G-E-230
  234 
Academy site was leased to this Faculty, and the entire control off 
the Medical Department placed in their hands. In 1851 they in+ 
vited Dr. Paul F. Eve, of Georgia, to.take part in the school, which 
was opened in October of that year. The Trustees have since twice 
extended the lease. The Faculty have contributed from their tui- 
tion fees for building and museum over forty thousand dollars, and. 
also met all the current expenses of the school on a liberal scale.

VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY. 
I congratulate the General Assembly and the people of Tennes- 
nessee on the happy opening of a new institution, the “ Vanderbilt. 
University.” Though not belonging to the State, but under the 
special care of one of the leading churches of the land, it deserves. 
mention in this report, because it will work not only in harmony 
with our system of public schools, but doubtless to their mutual 
benefit. The distinguished gentleman whose name it fitly bears, 
Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt, of New York, specified among the con- 
ditions of his original offer of $500,000 to found a University, that 
it should be located in or near Nashville. He had no local par- 
tiality to bias him, but his sagacity saw in this place all the elements 
necessary to the site of a University which should benefit the youth of 
the Southern States; for Nashville is central, accessible, of a tem- 
perate and healthy climate, and in a productive and beautiful coun— 
try. Nevertheless, our State can not fail to prize the honor and 
advantage of having at her capital “an institution of learning of 
the highest grade and on the surest basis,” where not only her own 
sons, but those of sister States, will gather to secure a literary, sei- 
entific and professional education, “to an extent as great, and in q 
manner as thorough, as their wants demand.” The impoverishe@ 
condition of the South enhances ‘the value of this benefaction from, 
our fellow-citizen of another section ; his generous gifts, amounting: 
now to near seven hundred thousand dollars, have enabled the 
Board of Trust to provide buildings, philosophical and chemica} 
apparatus, a museum, and other costly appointments of a Univer—
-P-A-G-E-231
235 
sity, and to reserve free of debt an endowment fund of $300,000, 
that by liberal and certain salaries they may obtain the services of 
able, learned and experienced educators. Already the grounds, 
comprising seventy-four acres, on an elevated site, and the substan- 
tial and elegant buildings, are an ornament to the city, and an at- 
traction to its visitors; and the University, numbering more than 
two hundred and fifty matriculates, is in complete and successful 
operation in its four departments of liberal, theological, legal and 
medical education. The department of philosophy, seience and 
literature is distributed into eight separate and independent schools, 
that there may be a choice of studies to meet the wants and tastes 
of the students. The course of instruction is divided into two 
parts; one collegiate, embracing two years, and one of the Univer- 
sity in its proper and high sense, embracing three years. The in- 
stitution thus provides for those who are prepared only to enter 
college classes, and also for such as have the means and ambition 
to seek more advanced scholarship and’ culture. The departments 
of Theology and Law are taught in the main building, each having 
three professors. The department of Medicine has its own ample 
college and hospital in the city, eleven professors, and every facility 
for clinical instruction. The Board design to establish, as soon as 
possible, schools of Civil Engincertng, Mining Engineering, Horti- 
cultnre and Agriculture, and the Useful and Fine Arts. Ina word, 
they aim to furnish at the Vanderbilt University all the requisite 
aids to the largest and most thorough intellectual culture, and also 
to special professional training. Among the liberal measures which 
they propose, I will mention iwo of great interest to the State and 
to the cause of public education, viz.: the offer of free tuition for a 
year to the prize seholar in each of a number of schools, private or. 
public, which the Faculty may select; and free scholarships to 
teachers, of at least one year’s standing, who desire to prepare 
themselves for more advanced work in teaching. ‘The conditions 
of these privileges will soon be published; meantime, I hail with 
pleasure these evidences of a policy which promises to stimulate 
the love of learning, and exalt the standard of private and public 
education.

UNIVERSITY OF THE SOUTH. 
This institution is located at Sewanee, Franklin county. General 
J. Gorgas is the Vice-Chancellor. There are fourteen professors 
and tutors, embracing some of the most distinguished educators in 
the South. The average number of pupils in attendance during 
the past year was 215, and the total receipts from all sources, 
$30,000. The University organization embraces ten schools, with 
grammar school attached. The degrees conferred are as follows: 
Bachelor of Letters, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, Master 
of Arts, and Civil Engineer. A good library, consisting of over 
five thousand volumes, has been already secured, and is open to. 
students at appointed hours. The location of the University is 
peculiarly favorable. It is on the remarkable Sewanee plateau, a 
spur of the Cumberland Mountain. Its elevation above the level of 
the sea is about two thousand feet, while it is about one thousand 
feet above the level of the surrounding country. 
The University of the South is under the sole and perpetual di- 
rection of the Protestant Episcopal Church, represented by a Board ~ 
of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is composed of the Bishops of 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mis-~ 
sissippi, Louisiana, Texas, Tennessee, and the Missionary Bishop of 
Arkansas, and of one clergyman and two laymen from each of the 
dioceses mentioned. ‘The senior Bishop is, ew officio, Chancellor of 
the University. 
The administrative head of the University is the Vice-Chancel- 
lor. He is assisted in the government of the University by the 
Hebdomadal Board, composed of all the Professors, so long as the 
number of chairs does not exceed twelve ; after that, vacancies in 
the Board are filled by the action of the Board of Trustees. 
Separate schools are established for each department of learning, 
The number of these schools is to be increased as fast as the re- 
sources of the University allow it, so as to embrace all branches of 
knowledge. Students elect such schools as best meet the ends they 
have in view. 
A diploma of graduation in any school is awarded to such stu- 
dents as, at the end of the scholastic year, shall have attained ‘a
-P-A-G-E-233
237 
satisfactory standard—to be determined by examiners appointed by 
the Hebdomadal Board. But no diploma may, be conferred, in any 
ease, until the candidate shall have passed 2 a satisfactory examina- 
tion in the English language. 
CUMBERLAND UNIVERSITY, 
LEBANON, TENNESSEE. 
This institution was organized in 1842, under the special patron- 
age of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. 
The act of incorporation, passed by the Legislature of Tennessee, 
grants it all the usual privileges and powers of a University. 
It was begun and carried on for several years as an academic 
school, nothing being taught except the usual college curriculum. 
In 1847 a department of law was established. A few years later 
a Theological School was added, and also a School of Civil En- 
gineering. 
Within a few years past a Commercial and Telegraphic Depart- 
ment has been in successful operation. So that now the University 
consists of . 
1, A Preparatory School, in which pupils are trained for the 
College Classes. 
2. The College Classes, or College of Avrts—The four classes are 
Freshman, Junior, Sophomore and Senior. In these the course of 
instruction corresponds with that of the older universities in the 
United States, and is almost identical with some of them.  . 
3. The Law School.—In this are taught all the elements of the 
Common Law, as well as Constitutional and Inter-National Law. 
The system of instruction in the Law School requires the pro- 
fessors to assign a portion of the text daily to each class, which they 
are required to prepare carefully. Upon this they are rigidly ex- 
amined, every student being specially interrogated every day. 
‘Lectures upon the law are not delivered, but dark passages are 
explained by the professors. 
Moot Courts are a prominent feature in the Law School. The 
students are required to prepare the various kinds of legal docu-
-P-A-G-E-234
238 
ments. They are drilled in practice and pleading, and gain consid- 
erable experience in arguing causes before juries of their fellow- 
students. 
4. The Theological School.—In this are taught the principles of 
Theology common to Protestant Christianity, as well as distinctive » 
doctrines appertaining to the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. 
Hebrew and Greek are also taught. 
Lectures are delivered by the professors, and students are, in 
addition, required to prepare 4 given portion of the text each day. 
5. School of Telegraphy.— Morse’s sysiem is taught. The stu- 
dent learns by sound, having the constant use of the instrument. 
When he thoroughly learns the alphabet he is placed at a point called 
an office, and sends and receives every kind of dispatch, under the 
supervision of an instructor. : 
6. The Commercial is intended, in a short period, to fit young men 
for business who are not able to take a college course. They are 
taught Book-keeping, Commercial Law, Arithmetic, Geography 
and Penmanship. 
7. An Agricultural Department has just been determined upon, 
and will soon be put in active operation. 
Time in which the course in. the Preparatory School may be 
accomplished, where the pupil can yead and write, is three years. © 
The four College Classes require one year each. 
The Course of Law may be accomplished in one year. 
Two years are required to accomplish the regular. Theological 
Course; but where students are well advanced in academic studies, 
they may complete it in one year. 
In the Telegraphic and Commercial Schools a diligent student 
may complete the course in six months. Civil Engineering requires 
two years.

Terms are twenty weeks, of which there are two in each year. 
- The first term begins early in September, closing the latter part of 
January. The second begins late in January and closes early in 
the month of June. 
Degrees are conferred in all the departmeuts. The degree of 
Bachelor of Arts is conferred only upon those who complete the 
regular College or Classical Course. . 
The degree of Master of Arts is given to such graduates as may 
complete the Post-graduate Course, and also to persons in the 
learned professions who have’ attained a good standing after three 
years from the time of graduation. 
The degree of Doctor of Philosophy is conferred where the can- 
didate completes a prescribed course, or distinguishes himself in 
Natural Science or the Knowledge of Letters. 
The degree of Doetor of Divinity is conferred upon worthy and 
learned men in the holy ministry. , 
The degree of Bachelor of Laws is granted to all who complete 
the Law Course. : . 
The degree of Bachelor of Divinity is granted to Theological 
graduates; and Master of Telegraphy and Master of Accounts, re- 
spectively, to those who accomplish the Commercial and Telegraphic 
Courses. / . 
A partial course, leaving out Greek, and accomplished in three 
years, entitles one to the degree of Bachelor of Science, in the 
Academic Department. 
An important feature of the University is that it proposes to edu- 
cate candidates for the ministry of all christian denominations free 
of charge, not only in the Theological, but also in the Academic 
Department. 
From its organization until now there have been in attendance. 
upon the different University Courses from twenty to forty young 
preachers annually. And many of the pulpits of the South and 
West are now supplied by these educated men. 
The Academic Department has also furnished to Tennessee and 
the neighboring States a number of noted men. 
From the Law School of this University have gone forth many 
of the prominent attornies.in the country.

It is a noticeable fact that five or six of the Judges of Tennessee 
and a number of Chancellors, and Judges of other States, five or 
six members of the present Congress, and the present Governors 
of Tennessee and Kentucky, received their legal training here. : - 
The Academic and Theological departments were partially en- 
dowed before the late war between the States, but, that coming on, 
the securities and investments failed, and the endowments were well 
nigh destroyed. 
The highest number of students ever in attendance was before 
the late civil strife, being four hundred and ninety-nine. 
During the year 1875, there were three hundred and ninety-oné 
students in all the departments. 
The number of graduates from the University approximates 
fifteen hundred, eight hundred of whom have been from the Law 
School. 
The Faculty consists, at present, of a Chancellor and six Pro- 
fesors in the Academie School, two Professors of Law, two Pro- 
fessors of Theology, and four teachers in the Commercial and 
- Telegraphic Schools. 
The University is controlled by a Board of Trustees.

The establishment. of this institution is the result of efforts put. 
forth during the past three years by the Baptists of the Southwestern 
States, to meet their educational wants in the higher departments. 
of learning. More than thirty years ago, Union University had 
been established in Murfreesboro, Tenn., under the Presidency of 
one of the most distinguished educators of the Southwest, Rev. 
Joseph H. Eaton, D.D. Up to the time of the late war, it was ore 
of the most successful instituions of learning in the State of Ten- 
nessee, having an average attendance of not less than two hundred 
students, and supporting an able Faculty of instruction, two of 
whom (Dr. Shelton and Prof. Jarman) are now members of the 
Faculty of the Southwestern Baptist University, while two other 
members of the Faculty (Professors Irby and Drupree) are alumni 
of Union University. But the result of the war, as in the case of 
so many of our other institutions of learning in the South, was the 
dispersion of the students, distruction of the buildings, librartes. and 
cabinets, and loss of the endowments of Union University. After the 
close‘ of the war, efforts were made to resuscitate the University, 
first under the Presidency of Rev. Duncan H. Selph, D. D., and 
then under the Presidency ‘of Rev. Charles Manly, D.D. But 
owing to the impoverished treasury of the University, in consequence 
of the great losses it had sustained during the war, these efforts 
proved abortive, and in the month of October, 1872, Union Univer- 
sity was suspended. 
Ata meeting of the Baptist General Association of Middle Ten- 
nessee and North Alabama, held in Columbia, Tenn., in October, 
1878, resolutions were unanimously adopted in favor of establishing 
a University for the Baptists of the Southwest, and a convention 
was called to consider the means of accomplishing the work. This 
convention. met in Murfreesboro, in April, 1874, and after mature
-P-A-G-E-238
242 
consideration, resolved to take the initial steps toward the establish- 
ment of such an institution of learning as the acknowledged wants 
of the: Baptists of the Southwest required. In carrying out this 
-purpose, the convention appointed a committee for locating the 
institution, and determining the best means of its establishment. 
This committee met in Nashville in July following, and, after re- 
ceiving propositions from various places, fixed the location of the 
University at Jackson, Tenn. 
Jackson had formerly been the seat of West Tennessee College. 
This institution was established and endowed, about forty years ago, 
by donation of public lands from the Congress of the United States, 
for the purpose of building up a seat of learning in West Tennessee. 
Before the war, it was a prosperous and successful institution, under 
the administration of able and accomplished Presidents and Pro- 
fessors, and many of the most distinguished citizens of the State 
claim West Tennessee College as their alma mater. In 1865, imme- 
. diately after the close of the war, Dr. William Shelton, now Presi- 
dent of the Southwestern Baptist University, was elected President 
of West Tennessee College, with B, W. Arnold, A. M., now Pro- 
fessor of Latin in Vanderbilt University, as Professor ‘of Ancient 
Languages, and B, L. Arnold, A. M., now President of Oregon 
Agricultural College, as Professor of Mathematics and Natural 
Science. Under the administration of Dr. Shelton and his Faculty 
of instruction, West Tennessee College was built up to a high de- 
gree of prosperity, so that it had a larger number of students than 
it had ever had before the war. In 1869, Dr. Shelton and both of 
his Professors resigned, when a new Faculty was employed: with 
Rey. E. L. Patton, D. D., as President. Under his administration 
West Tennessee’ College continued until it was merged into the 
Southwestern Baptist University. 
In August, 1874, the buildings, grounds and endowments of 
. West Tennessee College, estimated at ninety thousand dollars, were, 
donated to the Trustees of the Southwestern Baptist University, on : 
condition that an interest bearing endowment of three hundred 
thousand dollars be raised for the University within a period of ten 
years from the time of the transfer. Individual subscriptions were 
also made by citizens of -Jackson and Madison county to the amount 
of sixty thousand dollars, so that the whole amount contributed for
-P-A-G-E-239
243 
securing the location of the University at Jachson, aggregates one 
hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
At acalled meeting of the Tennessee Baptist Convention, held in 
Trezevant in August, 1874, the action of the Committee of Loca- 
tion was approved, a Board of Trustees was appointed, and prelim- 
inary iteps were taken towards obtaining a charter for the institution 
under the name of the Southwestern Baptist University. 
On the 14th of September, 1874, the Academic Department was 
opened at Jackson, in the buildings of West Tennessee College. It 
was successfully conducted during the scholastic year which closed 
on the 30th of June, 1875, with one hundred students. The Higher 
Department of the University was opened for the reeeption of 
pupils on the 30th of August, 1875, under the administration of 
the present Faculty, and it is dow going on with encouraging pros- 
‘pects of steady gfowth and permanent success. 
_ The University is organized by establishing two Departments: 
1. The Department of Literature and Science. 
2. The Department of Law. 
It is thé purpose of the Board of Trustees that other Professional 
Departments be established as they have the means of doing it. 
The Academie Department consists of a Primary School-and a 
Grammar School, in which the Course of Study is pursued on the 
same general principles that are adopted in the Public Schools of 
our cities; that is, they are GRADED SCHOOLS, in which pupils are 
classified according to their advancement, and pursue their studies in 
the order of the grades in which they are placed. 
The Department of Literature and Science comprehends the seven 
University Schools, which are denominated as follows: 1. Latin. 
2. Greek. 3, Mathematics. 4, Natuval Science. 5. Moral Science. 
6. English. 7. German and French. In these Schools the Course 
of Study is pursued on the principles that are adopted in the Uni- 
versity of Virginia and in the European Universities—that is, each 
is independent of the others, and students have the privilege of 
selecting the Schools which they desire to attend, and of graduating 
in them when found qualified by examination. 
Two Auxiliary Schools are also established: one for East Ten- 
nessée, at Mossy Creek, and one for Middle Tennessee, in Mur-
-P-A-G-E-240
244 
freesboro, which are component parts of the University, have their 
‘Course of Study homogeneous with that of the Academic Depart- 
ment of the University, and thus give to their students special 
preparation for admission into such of the University Schools, in the 
Department of Literature and Science, as they may desire to attend. 
Other Auxiliary Schools in other States of the Southwest may 
afterwards be established, as the wants of the University may de- 
mand, and the means of establishing them be provided. 
The Trustees of the University have determined to raise an En- 
dowiment of not less than. $300,000. The Tennessee Baptist Cen- 
tennial Committee has determined to appropriate to the Endowmen: 
of the University all Centennial Funds, not otherwise appropriated 
by the donors. In connection with the great Centennial Commemor- 
ation of the Baptists of the United States, the Trustees of the 
University and the Centennial Committee, acting in concert, pro- 
pose to raise as much of this Endowment as possible by the 4th of 
July, 1876—the one hundredth anniversary of American Independ- 
enee. They propose to do this asa Memorial of the Goodness of 
God to the Baptists of America during the first Century of Ameri- 
can Independence. 
In order to accomplish this object, they have determined: 
1. To solicit a donation of One Dollar from every member of 
every Baptist Church in the State, from each individual of their 
families, from each attendant on a Baptist congregation, from each 
member of a Baptist Sunday-school, and from all persons in the 
State who, though not Baptists themselves, are descendants of 
Baptist ancestors. 
2. To solicit larger contributions from all those to whom the Lord 
has given a larger share of wealth, acccording as He has prospered. 
them. , 
3.:To present to each contributor of one dollar or more a Memo- 
rial Certificate, engraved in the highest style of the art, with appro- 
priate devices and decorations. 
. 4, To record the names of all contributors, with the amounts, 
contributed, in a book prepared for that purpose, to be deposited, 
and preserved, as a perpetual Memorial in the Library of the South 
western Baptist University. :

FISK UNIVERSITY. 
BY PROF. H. 8. BENNETT. 
Fisk School, from which Fisk University grew, was: formally 
opened January 9, 1866, in Government buildings, west of the 
~ Chattanooga Depot, known as the Railroad Hospital, under the 
auspices of the American Missiénary Association of New York and 
the Western Freedmen’s Aid Commission of Cincinnati. 
The land on which the buildings were located was purchased. 
Rev. E. P. Smith, Field Secretary of the Association, Rev. E. M. 
Cravath, who had recently been appointed Secretary of the Middle 
West Department, and Prof. John Ogden, representing the Western 
Freedmen’s Aid Commission, becoming personally responsible for 
the payment of the notes. These notes were afterwards assumed 
by the American Missionary Association. 
Gen. Clinton B. Fisk was at that time in command of the Freed- 
men’s Bureau, and entered heartily into the work of opening the 
enterprise. The school took its name in honor of him. 
Under the efficient management of Prof. John Ogden, a normal 
instructor of national reputation, the school at once Became very 
flourishing. During the first two years upwards of twelve hundred 
pupils were in average attendance. : 
In August, 1867, the sschool took a step forward in its growth, 
and was incorporated as Fisk University. This step was rendered 
advisable by the fact that the city schools were opened about that 
time to the colored children of Nashville on the same terms with 
white children. About that time, also, Gen. O. O. Howard, of the 
Freedmen’s Bureau, donated from Bureau funds $7,000. to the-- 
school for educational purposes. It was then decided to incorpo- 
rate the institution for the higher education of youth of both sexes. 
It was accordingly chartered August 22, 1867, with a board of nine 
Trustees, three of whom were to be chosen each year, and were 
empowered “ to fill vacancies, prescribe courses of study, and confer 
all such degrees and ‘honors as are conferred by Universities in the 
United States.” : 
. EDUCATIONAL WORK, . 
The School and University were under the management of Prof. 
John Ogden, from the opening till 1870. From 1870 till the sum- 
mer of 1875, Prof. A. K. Spence was Principal. In 1875 Rev. E. 
M. Cravath was elected President, which position he now holds.
-P-A-G-E-242
246 
The idea of training teachers for the common schools of Tenne 
see was early developed. Prof. Ogden’s ability as a normal i: 
structor secured marked results in this directiou. ‘Teachers for t! 
colored schools began to go out as early as 1868. From that tir 
onward from thirty to one hundred and fifty pupils of the insti: 
tion have engaged in the work of teaching annually. During t 
past three years more than one hundred teachers have been th 
engaged, who have taught upward of ten thousand pupils in cl 
and Sabbath Schools annually. During the year 1875 one hund: 
and fifty pupils of the institution are known to have taught scho 
The University also furnishes the means of higher culture 
those who desire it. The college curriculum has been marked © 
and college classes are now in operation. The classes, thougn 
small, pursue the classical, mathematical and_ scientific studies 
usually taught in American Colleges. The Commencement Exer~ 
cises, in: May, 1875, were marked by the graduation of the first 
class from the college department. This class consisted of two 
young men and one young lady, who had begun their letters ten 
years before. Another young lady would have graduated with 
them, but w&s called away with the Jubilee Singers five months 
before graduation, 
Tn the summer of 1875 the Board of Trustees, at a meeting held. 
in New York, elected a college Faculty as follows: 
Rev. E. M. Cravath, M. A., President, and Professor of Mental 
and Moral Philosophy. 
Rev. H. 8. Bennett, M. A., Professor of Theology and Univer- 
\sity Pastor. 
Rev. A. K. Spence, M. A., Professor of Greek. 
. Miss Helen. C. Morgan, M. A., Professor of Latin. 
Rey. F. A. Chase, M. A., Professor of the Natural Sciences, 
Geo. L. White, Professor of Music. 
The importance of preparing young men for the ministry has. 
ever been recognized in the institution. Rev. H. 8. Bennett began 
the work of theological instruction as early as 1869, and has kept 
it up ever since. The classes have ranged from three to thirteen 
each year, Many young men have thus been taught for the im- 
portant work of preaching the Gospel to the people.

247 . 
RELIGIOUS HISTORY. 
Early in the spring of 1868, a church was organized. upon the 
most liberal basis, for the benefit of teachers and pupils. Regular 
preaching has been held from the beginning, and every year has 
witnessed the conversion of many of the students. The moral in- 
fluence of the school upon the hearts and lives of the students has 
been very powerful. ‘ 
THE JUBILEE SINGERS. 
Any complete history of Fisk University must give some recog- 
nition of the remarkable career of the Jubilee Singers, through 
whose instrumentality the permanency in the University was assured. 
Geo. L. White became music teacher in the institution during 
the first months of its existence. His untiring energy and rare 
skill in training voices produced marked results in the musical de- 
partment. Several concerts during successive years were given, 
which attracted much public attention. As Mr. White progressed, 
he culled out the best voices, and organized them into the choir of 
the University. 
About the year 1870 it was felt that the University must secure 
a new locatidn and erect new buildings, or be sadly crippled in its 
work. After much deliberation it was concluded that the only 
feasible plan to raise the funds was to send Mr. White north with his 
company of singers to give concerts for the purpose named. Mr. 
White had such an interest in the success of the University, and so 
much enthusiasm in the work, that he took the entire pecuniary 
responsibility of the movement upon himself, and started October, 
1871. After several months of almost-crushing difficulty the tide 
turned in the favor of the little troupe, and by May, 1872, they had 
netted $20,000. They were received with the greatest enthusiasm 
by the most highly cultivated audiences, and under the power of 
their quaint slave songs tears flowed like rain. : 
Another campaign, over the same territory, resulted in like suc- 
cess, and $20,000 rewarded their labors. In the spring of 1874 
they went to England and remained one year. There their success 
was even more remarkable than in this country. They were re- 
ceived with the greatest consideration by. the Queen and the Pre- 
mier, Gladstone, and Earl of Shaftesbury, and other dignitaries of 
Great Britain. While in England they cleared $50,000. In addi-
-P-A-G-E-244
  248 
. 
tion to the $90,000 they had thus secured above: all expenses, they 
received in donations of books, apparatus, furniture, ete., $10,000 
more, thus raising the net product of their labors to $100,000. 
They are now in England again, singing with their old success. 
Since their entrance upon their campaign in October last, they havé | 
sent home $30,000. ‘ 
With the funds thus earned, twenty-five acres of land have been 
purchased on and contiguous to the site of Fort Gillem, one mile 
northwest of the Capitol of Nashville, Tennessee, and Jubilee Hall 
has heen erected. 
The following deseription of the building we clip from the 
American of January 2, 1875, in a description of the dedication : 
The building is in the form of an “L,” and has an east front.of. 
145 feet, and.a south front of 128 feet. Including basement and. 
cellar it is six stories high, and is supplied with all the modern con- 
veniences of water, steam, and gas. It is heated throughout by 
steam, and each room has a yadiator. There are 375 gas burners 
in the house. The entire building contains 120 rooms. Jubilee 
Hall is to be the dormitory department of Fisk University, but 
until suitable college buildings can be erected, will be made to an- 
swer all purposes. The building is drained by a twelve-inch sewer 
pipe, which runs 1,500 feet to a natural aqueduct, which connects: 
with the river. The building is made of the best pressed brick, 
with stone trimmings. The'style isa modern English. The main 
entrance is on the South front, and is composed of a stone stairway, 
with pillars supporting a small stone balcony, which is to be adorned 
with a bust of Lincoln. Over this is placed, in gilded letters, “Ju- 
bilee Hall.” The iron door facing has the same upon it. .The front 
door is composed of black walnut of massive proportions, and hay- 
ing complete bronze trimmings. The side light and transom are 
furnished with richly colored glass. On the right of the hall are 
the reception rooms and parlor, one 16 by 32 feet, the other 20 by 
32, connected by large folding doors. On the other side of the hall 
is the office, and beyond the assembly room, about 20 by 32 feet 
proportions.’ Opposite this on thie cross hall is the library, adjoin- 
ing it the music room, and further on smaller rooms that are to be 
used as dressing rooms for visitors and transient guests. 
The ground was broken January 1, 1873, the corner stone was 
laid October 1, 1873, and the exercises of dedication took place 
January 1, 1876,

THE DEDICATION. 
The dedication of Jubilee Hall was a marked event. The audi- 
ence was composed of people of both races, some of the most promi- 
nent citizens of Nashville being present. The most cordial sym- 
pathy in the work which was being done by the University was ex- 
pressed by the speakers who represented the State. 
WANTS. 
The wants of the institution are many. Especially is it in press- 
ing need of a new building for general recititation purposes and en- 
dowments. The Jubilee Singers, under the management of the 
President, have a plan on foot for the erection of a new building, 
to be called Livingstone Hall. Whether that building will be car- 
ried forward to completion. remains to the future. . 
In closing this brief and imperfect history, we may fitly close by 
quoting a brief passage taken from the history of the dedication of 
the University, as published for the Trustees: 
“Such is the history of one of the institutions established and. 
fostered by the American Missionary Association of New York. 
That Society is sustained almost entirely by the Congregational 
Churches of the North. It has now seven chartered institutions 
like Fisk University in the South, in addition to twenty-five normal 
and other schools. In the last twelve years it has expended, in the 
South, in its educational and religious work, about $3,000,000. 
For the last few years it has concentrated its work more in its 
higher institutions and Churches. During the year just closed it 
has had under its care in the south 56 Churches, 48 missionaries, 
150 teachers, and nearly 10,000 pupils; but many of these pupils 
have, in turn, become teachers, and it is estimated that during the 
year no-less than 60,000 children were taught by those educated in 
the schools of this Society.” 
WASHINGTON COLLEGE. 
JONESBOROUGH. 
The history of this institution dates back’ to the earliest settle- 
ment of the couritry. Its foundation was laid in the wilderness, 
and among the Indians who wandered through the valleys and _
-P-A-G-E-246
250 
roamed over the hills. A complete history of Washington College 
would, to a great extent, be a history of education in Tennessee, 
and, in. part, in the whole Southwest. : : 
In 1780, Rev. Samuel Doak, one of the first graduates from 
Nassau Hall, under the presidency of Dr. Witherspoon, opened a 
school in a plain log building, erected for the purpose upon his own 
farm. ‘His school-house stood a little west of what is now Old 
Salem Church. The exact location is known, for some of the 
foundation stones are yet visible. Here the great “pioneer of 
learning and religion in. the West” Jabored and taught. His 
school was often disturbed by the Indians, who made expeditions 
into the neighborhood for the purpose of plunder. On one veca- 
sion he dismissed his school, gathered up his pupils, and went in 
pursuit of the Indians. Rev. Samuel Doak was a patriot as well as 
a scholar. : 
In 1785, the Legislature of Frankland, then in session at Jones. 
borough, passed an act for the promotion of education in Washing- 
ton county. Ramsey, in his Annals of Tennessee, says: “ Under 
the provisions of this act the foundation of Martin Academy was 
laid. It is believed that this is the earliest legislative action taken 
anywhere west of the Alleghanies for the encouragement of learn- 
ing. Rev. Samuel Doak, who had been a member of the Conven- 
tion, and, probably of the Frankland Assembly, and the apostle of 
learning in the West, was the founder and first president of Martin 
Academy. This was the first classical school established in the 
West, and received its name in honor of Alexander Martin, Gover- 
nor of North Carolina. The Academy, under the presidency of its 
illustrious founder, enjoyed eleven years of unexampled prosperity 
in the history of literary institutions. 
In 1796, the same year in which Tennessee was admitted as a 
State, Martin Academy was raised to the rank of a College, and 
received its charter from the first Legislature ever held in the State 
of Tennessee. . The charter mentions the fact that it was named in 
honor of George Washington, the Father of his Country. Washing- 
ton College continued to prosper under the administration of Pres- 
ident Doak. The plain log school-house, in which so many emi~ 
nent men received their education, become inadequate to the wants 
: _of the College. It had served a good purpose for twenty-nine
-P-A-G-E-247
251 
years; for a classical school five years; for Martin Academy eleven 
years ; for Washington College thirteen years. 
In 1809 a new frame-building was completed, it stood near the 
site of the present college building, and was quite an imposing 
structure. Here Rev. Samuel Doak, D. D., taught nine years. In 
1818 he resigned the Presidency of Washington College. He had 
led the school up from the humblest beginnings. It was now the 
leading College of the Southwest. The history of the school for 
the thirty-eight years of Rev. Samuel Doak’s administration is full 
of interest to every Tennessean. The character of this great man — 
sheds a glory over the State. The pioneer of learning and the 
apostle of religion in the West, has left for us an inheritance of 
which we may well be proud. 
In 1818, Dr. John W. Doak, son of Rev. Samuel Doak, D. D., 
became President, and served two years; after whom, in 1820, 
Rey. John V. Bovell was elected President, and filled the position 
for several years. Rev. Samuel W. Doak, D. D., succeeded to the 
Presidency, but was never in actual charge of the College. This 
brings us to 1829, when Rey. James McLain was elected President, 
which position he filled for ten years—to 1839. 
The present college building was erected in 1840. It stands a 
little east of the site of the “plain log school-house” erected in 1780, 
near the site of the frame building erected in 1809. It is a brick 
building 86x36 feet, and four full stories high. A grove of primi- 
tive oaks surrounds it. Rev. A. A. Doak, D. D., son of Rev. John 
"W. Doak, D. D., M. D., and grandson of Rev. Samuel Doak, D. D., 
the founder of the College, become President in 1840. For eight 
years Washington College had a glorious career. Students came 
in large numbers from all the Southern and Southwestern States. 
In 1848 President Doak resigned, and Rev. E. Thompson Baird be- 
came President for a short time. In 1851, Rev. A. A. Doak was 
re-elected President, and held the position till 1857, when he again 
resigned. His administration embraced a period of nearly seven- 
teen years. In point of ability, Rev. A. A. Doak, D. D., was in 
no way inferior to any of his illustrious predecessors. In 1857, 
. Rey. Samuel Hodge became President, and held the position until 
the breaking out of the late war in 1861. 
From 1861 to 1866 the college buildings were exposed, and con- 
-Sequently suffered much damage at the hands of the soldiers. The
-P-A-G-E-248
252 
libraries were carried away or destroyed. The apparatus was, also: 
destroyed. In 1866 the building was repaired, and Rev. W.B. 
Rankin, of Greenville, Tennessee, elected President, under whose 
administration a graded school has been kept up with varied suc- 
cess for several years. ‘ 
Washington, the oldest county in the State, has within her borders 
the oldest classical school west of the Alleghenies. Washington 
College has a name in history.. From her walls have gone forth 
many noble nien who have distinguished themselves in every de- 
partment of life. Among her alumni are found orators, atithors, 
jurists, legislators, Governors and divines. It is said that fourteen 
of her alumni were on the floor of Congress at one time. 
MARYVILLE COLLEGE. 
This College is situated in Maryville, Blount county, on the 
Knoxville and Charleston Railroad, sixteen miles South of Knox- 
ville. Rev. P. M. Bartlett, President, assisted by six competent 
and experienced teachers. The average number of pupils from 
September 15, 1874, to September 15, 1875, was ninety, and the 
receipts from all sources, $4,000.00, It isa mixed school, “for 
male and female, without regard to race or color, or previous condi- 
tion of servitude.” 
ORIGIN. 
Near the beginning of the present century, there came into East 
Tennessee a large number of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. With 
these emigrants there did not come an adequate supply of ministers, 
But among them was a young man named Isaac Anderson, whose 
father with a large family settled near Knoxville. This young man 
Yecame a minister of extensive usefulness and influence. He was 
in the habit of making long missionary tours through this region, 
preaching the Gospel with great power and effect in log cabins and 
barns and under the trees of the forest. He witnessed the mora] 
and religious destitution of the country, and by this state of things 
was deeply affected. His first attempt was to secure an adequate 
supply of educated and Evangelical ministers from the older States. 
But in this he failed.
-P-A-G-E-249
\ ‘ 
j 253 
He then game to the conclusion, that the only possible way of 
supplying this field with a well qualified ministry would be to train . 
and educate young men on the ground. 
This thought was a solution of the difficulty, but foreshadowed 
hard work. 
In the autumn of 1819, he presented a plan for the organization 
of a Theological School to the Synod of Tennessee, then convened 
at Maryville. / 
The Synod adopted the plan, and assumed control of the institu- 
tion, and named it “The Southern and Western Theological Semi- 
nary,” which in 1842 was chartered under the name of Maryville 
‘College. ‘The advantages of the institution were offered, without 
distinction, to pious young men of all christian denominations. 
The plan of the school, as adopted by the Synod, and, also the 
charter, empowered the Synod to elect the Board of Trustees. 
SPIRIT OF THE FOUNDER. 
The grand motive of the founder is best stated in his own words: 
“ Let the directors and managers of this sacred institution propose 
the glory of God and the advancement of that Kingdom purchased 
by the blood of His only begotten Son as their sole objects.” 
For thirty-eight years Dr. Anderson was the honored and able 
President of this institution; and, during this period, more than 
one hundred and twenty ministers of the Gospel, besides many edu- 
cated men in other professions, went forth from it. With safety and 
truth may it be said, that Maryville College has exerted a large and 
healthful Christian influence, especially in East Tennessee. 
After the death of Dr. Anderson, January 28, 1857, the Board 
of Trustees, on the 17th of March, 1857, elected to the Presidency 
of the Institution, the Rev. John J. Robinson, a fine scholar, able - 
theologian, eloquent preacher and thorough instructor. 
In 1858, the Synod of Tennessee transferred its control of Mary- 
ville College, to the United Synod of the Presbyterians in the United 
States of America, on the following condition: - “That the proper- 
ty, funds, &c., thus placed under the control of the United Synod, 
revert to the Synod of Tennessee if the United Synod shall ever 
cease to exist.”

EFFECTS OF THE WAR. 
At the beginning of the civil war, the Endowment ‘Fand of the 
College amounted to about $16,000... The real estate consisted of 
two half acre lots with three buildings, one wooden, one small brick, 
and a large brick unfinished. . 
The library contained about 6,000 volumes. 
The indebtedness of the College amounted to $1,000. 
‘As a result of the war, the College was disbanded in the spring 
of 1861, two thirds of its Endowment Fund were irretrievably lost; 
the smaller brick building was demolished by the Federal troops; 
the larger ‘brick building by the occupation of the armies, was 
almost to such an extent that it was no longer worth finishing or 
repairing ; many of the books of the library were mutilated and 
otherwise damaged, so as to be rendered valueless, and not a few 
qere scattered to the four winds. And just about the close of the 
war, what remained of the library and all the real estate were sold 
by order of the Court to satisfy the claims of creditors. 
And in August or September, 1864, the United Synod, the special 
guardian of the College, dissolved by its own act and ceased to have 
existence, and, according to the agreement before referred to, the 
College with its property and funds, reverted to the Synod of 
Tennessee. . / 
This Synod met in the fall of 1865, in New Market, not having 
met before for three years, and then resumed its control over the 
College. In the Synod the qnestion was asked: “ What has become 
of Maryville College?” Nothing hopeful could be said of it. Tt 
had a precious history and a noble record, and that was about all. 
The Synod resolved at once to take hold of the institution and do 
what could be done to save it from utter extinction. A new loca- 
tion, new buildings and all that is essential for a College became a 
necessity.    
  It was resolved to make an earnest appeal .to the friends of Christ- 
ian learning for help. For this purpose agents were appointed. 
The College was re-opened in the fall of 1866. 
By the prompt.and energetic action of the Treasurer of the 
Board, the property sold was redeemed, and a part of the .Endow- 
ment fund was saved. The property and funds now saved amounted 
to between six and ten thousand dollars, and all the debts against 
the College were satisfied.

. Appeals made to the friends of Christian learning in the North 
resulied favorably. From this source abont sixty thousand dollars 
were contributed, with which a beautiful College site of sixty-five 
acres was purchased, and three substantial, commodious Halls were 
erected, one exclusively for College purposes, the other two for 
dormitories, sufficient to accommodate 130 students, and afford 
ample room for a College Boarding Hall. 
To the College Library there have been added. 1000 volumes, 
chiefly the gift of the Rev. Thompson Bird, of DesMoines, Towa. 
Very recently the most valuable and complete apparatus ever 
brought to East Tennessee, has been purchased at a cost of $2,000. 
Many of the instruments are costly and superior. 
The number of students in the different departments aggregates 
one hundred and twenty. 
The entire charge for each pupil per year for tuition and furnished 
rooms, is $27.00. 
STEWART COLLEGE. 
CLARKSVILLE, TENN, 
About the year 1849 the Masonic Fraternity of Tennessee founded 
a school at Clarksville on the site of the Montgomery County Male 
Academy, under the nante of the Masonic University of Tennessee. 
This school was soon transferred to the Montgomery county Masons, 
and was conducted under the Presidency of W. F. Hopkins, T M. 
Newell, W. ‘A. Forbes, and Wm. M. Stewart, successively, until the 
year 1855, At this time the Masonic Fraternity made sale of the 
buildings, grounds, and appurtenances to certain parties in Clarks- 
ville, in the name of the Synod of Nashville (Presbyterian). The 
school was henceforth known under the corporate name and title of 
STEWART COLLEGE, 
which name was given in honor of President Wm. M. Stewart, who 
had heen and has continued to be a most liberal patron and friend 
of the institution. 
The Faculty was re-organized under him as President, and con- 
ducted by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Synod of Nash-
-P-A-G-E-252
256 
ville. He served as President until 1858, when Rev. R. B. Me- 
Mullen, D. D., was elected to succeed him, while he continued.te 
act as Professor of Natural Sciences. During the administration-of 
Dr. McMullen fifty thousand dollars were subscribed toward the 
endowment of the college, and was in part collected, and the. patron- 
age was rapidly i increasing, when the war supervened and the school 
was of necessity closed. 
During the war the libraries, cabinets, and apparatus were lost, 
and the buildings were entirely dismantled by the occupancy of 
Federal troops. In 1866~70 the buildings were repaired and. re- 
furnished with a necessary outfit at a cost of about $8,000. 
After some delay the Faculty was re-organized in 1870 with Rev. 
J. B. Shearer, D. D., as President, assisted by a competent corps of 
Professors. The school continued to grow in favor and popularity. 
Negotiations looking to concentration of effort among Presbyterians 
over a larger field were prosecuted diligently until, in 1875, a new 
corporation succeeded to the property and funds of Stewart College 
under the corporate name and title of the South-western Presby- 
terian University, of which the following is a report of progress: 
SOUTH-WESTERN PRESBYTERIAN UNIVERSITY. 
Report of Progress. . 
At the last meeting of the Board of Directors of the South- 
western Presbyterian University, the Executive Committee were 
directed to prepare, at their discretion, a report of progress, setting 
forth also the present condition and prospects of the enterprise, in 
order that the public may be fully informed of our work. In obe- 
dience to this order this paper has been prepared. 
The idea of a great Presbyterian University has been long cher- 
ished and ably advocated by some of our leading thinkers. It be- 
came evident, however, that such an institution must be, from the 
nature of the case, in a certain sense local, and it was suggested 
that contiguous Synods unite and thus supply, by co-operation. 
what no single one could furnish alone. In furtherance of this idea 
active negotiations began among the Synods of the South-west, in 
which region the want was most urgent. 
A meeting of Commissioners from five Synods was held in May, 
187 3. After a full conference a plan of co-operation was agreed
-P-A-G-E-253
  257 
upon unanimously, containing also a succinct and lucid outline of 
the proposed institution, This plan and outline was adopted in the 
autumn of 1873 by the five Synods sending Commissioners, to-wit.: 
The Synods of Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Nashville, and 
Memphis, and also by the Synod of Texas. The adoption was sin- 
gularly unanimous in all the Synods, a fact of no small moment 
when we. consider the distracting views which had for years divided 
our best men on the relations of the Church and the school, and in 
view of the distinctly avowed purpose to make a school more dis- 
tinctly Christian than heretofore. All parties are satisfied and all 
views harmonized by this plan and outline, and distracting ques- 
tions are at rest. This is a great point gained. : 
These six Synods the same year appointed each two Directors, to 
meet in January, 1874, and take charge of the enterprise. These 
Directors met in Memphis and found themselves face to face with 
numerous applicants for the location of the University, even before 
the Board themselves were assured of their ultimate success in 
founding the school. It was soon apparent to the Board that this 
question of location must be wisely met at the beginning in order 
to avoid the rock on which so many educational enterprises had al- 
ready split. Besides, a location seemed necessary in order for the 
University to have a corporate and legal existence, without which 
it was doubtful if the Directors could move,a single step in laying 
the foundations, or even solicit subscriptions in -such form as to be 
binding. 
A second meeting was held in May, 1874, and the various com- 
munities desiring the location made proposals, many of them ex- 
tremely liberal, and all indicating great confidence in the success of 
the proposed University. After a careful examination of all the 
proposals, the Board selected Clarksville as the location, and Stew- 
art College, with its funds and appurtenances, as the nucleus of 
future operations. This location is acquiesced in by all throughout 
our bounds, and gives increasing satisfaction, not so much because 
it was the first choice of every body, but because it was evidently 
the best we could do in view of all the circumstances of the case. 
This hearty acquiescence in a matter so delicate and difficult as this, 
is another great point gained. The Board at the same meeting re~ 
quested Stewart College Trustees to continue their functions until 
it should be convenient for the Directors to take full charge.. No 
li

  258 
active steps were taken to increase the funds of the University be- 
yond the amount given at Clarksville, partly because of failure to 
secure a suitable agent early in the year 1874, but mainly because 
of the great floods, droughts, and financial embarrassments which 
will not be soon forgotten in the south-west. Early in this year 
(1875) the Legislature of Tennessee perfected the laws necessary to 
enable us to secure such a charter as we desired, and for which we 
were waiting. The Board met, on call, at St. Lous in May, and, 
on its adjournment, met again in Clarksville in June. 
At these meetings the charter was perfected with the following 
corporators, who legally constitute the first Board of Directors under 
the style and title of the South-western Presbyterian University, 
to-wit.: Rev. T. R. Welch, D. D., Vice-President; B. M. Estes, 
Secretary; Rev. E. McNair, Rev. J. N. Waddell, D. D., Rev. B. 
M. Palmer, D. D. LL. D., Rev. J. A. Lyon, D. D., Rev. W. K. 
Marshall, D. D., Rev. D. MacGregor, Rev. C. A. Stillman, D.D., 
T. A. Hamilton, Esq., Rev. J. B. Shearer, D. D., and D. N. Ken- 
nedy, Esq. : 
The Board thus constituted took order for perfecting all necessary . 
titles, and took formal charge of our work. 
‘The former Faculty of Stewart College was continued provision- 
ally, and the school continued on the same scale as heretofore until 
such time as the way may be open for the formal organization of 
the University proper. This very adoption is to the public a guar- 
anty. of the confidence they may feel in the schools as at present or- 
ganized, while we aim at a yet higher development. 
The Board elected Rev. Dr. J: W. Hoyte special confidential 
agent to raise the contemplated endowment. He has accepted the 
position, and will take the field in October, with the promise of 
active co-operation from the members of the Board as far as practi- 
eable. Since the meeting of the Board $5,000 in part of a bequest 
has passed through his hands, which, we trust, is an earnest of the 
liberal things which will be devised for us throughout the South~ 
west. We proprose to raise, as speedily as possible, a half million 
of dollars as an endowment fund, besides whatever else may be nec- 
essary to success. : - 
The friends of the cause will contribute the more readily when 
they know that our present nucleus is a very handsome one, and
-P-A-G-E-255
259 
one of which we may be proud at this early stage in our enterprise, 
as will be seen from the following summary: 
1. We have in hand $100,000 of endowment fund safely invested. 
This is one-fifth of the amount we propose to raise, and the field 
has not yet been canvassed for a dollar. 
2. We have twenty-four acres of land well suited for grounds, 
and college buildings ample for class-room purposes for many stu- 
dents. These grounds and buildings have cost in the aggregate 
$50,000, 
3. We have a building fund subscribed which will go far toward 
furnishing us such additional buildings as will be absolutely neces- 
sary for some years to come. 
4, We have large and costly cabinets of minerals and fossils, the 
gift of Prof. Wm. M. Stewart, after whom Stewart College was first 
named. He has also given us his valuable scientific library, which 
we have reason to believe was unrivaled among private libraries of 
such a character. And since the last meeting of the Board he has 
given us his entire collection of modern shells, consisting of many 
thousand. The sum total cost of these gifts has been $25,000 or 
$30,000, and if destroyed they could not be replaced with money. 
5. Besides this nucleus of material and endowments, we have a 
suecessful school in operation reaching a patronage of one hundred 
and fifty last year, and having a corps of six professors. - - 
We thus present at the outset a success unhoped for two-years 
ago, and a success unsurpassed by many schools of greater age. Of 
money and material we have nearly, if not quite, $200,000. Of 
earnest good wishes and prayers for our suecess we have untold 
wealth throughout six Synods, and good will in many more. Of 
patronage we have the promise of large increase on the past. We 
- regard this measure of success as but the beginning of what the 
Church will, for the sake of Christ, give in response to the conse- 
erated labors of those who have taken this as a sacred trust from 
the Synods appointing them, and from the Great Head of the Church. 
under whom they serve in this cause. .

represented by our Board, J. B. SHEARER,

GREENEVILLE AND TUSCULUM COLLEGE. | 
Ys located at Greeneville, and has a regular college course and pre- 
paratory school. There is a thorough text-book study, and then a 
-review by subjects without regard to text-books, in the English 
studies. In ancient languages, there is a drill in ancient geography, : 
history and mythology, to accompany the study of the Latin and 
Greek authors. Hebrew, French, German and music are elective 
studies. There is also a commercial course, consisting of penman- _ 
ship, book-keeping and higher arithmetic. There are eighty-five — 
students in the college department and forty in the preparatory 
school, with seven professors and two tutors. The length of the 
session is eight months. There are three literary societies, and a 
library of 7,000 volumes. 
This institution is one of the nurseries of sound learning in Ten- 
nessee, having graduated in past times some of the most eminent, 
useful and exemplary men in Tennessee and in the South. We 
regret that we failed in our effort to procure a worthy sketch of its 
past history. 
  W. E. WARD'S SEMINARY FOR YOUNG LADIES. 
4 ! . 4 
Located in Nashville. Rev. W. E. Ward, Principal, with six- 
teen instructors in the various branches. The average number of 
pupils the past year was 244, and the receipts from patrons $22,000. 
This Seminary was founded by the Principal, September 1, 1865, 
and was chartered by the State of Tennessee in 1869. Soon after 
its foundation, it bought the elegant buildings now occupied by it 
on Spruce street, and from time to time has enlarged the same, so 
as to furnish recitation rooms, a fine art department, a French con- 
versation room, a large chapel for morning service and commence- 
ment occasions, and ample bed-rooms for one hundred boarding 
pupils and teachers. A large music department, separate from 
other parts of the house is filled with good pianos. 
_ Xn June, 1875, the Seminary had completed ten years of its ex~ 
istence. Over 1600 young ladies have studied within its walls, and 
355 have been graduated. Ten per cent. of these have become 
teachers, Many, the daughters of deceased or disabled ministers,
-P-A-G-E-257

have received gratuitious instruction in whole or in part. It requires 
five years to complete the Collegiate Cotirse. The classics are 
taught to all free of charge. Nearly every Southern State is repre- 
sented in its catalogues. 
The instruction is given by the most experienced teachers that 
can be procured, and is so thorough as to fit any pupil for teaching. 
The Seminary has abundant apparatus for Practical Chemistry, 
Natural Philosophy, Geology and Astronomy. : 
Reports are sent monthly to all parents. The Seminary is non- 
sectarian, each pupil attending the church of her choice with a 
teacher. 
A school has thus been built up at the State Capitol which ranks 
with the first in the United States.

corps of teachers numbers six, and the average attendance of pupils 
for the past year was 35. Gross receipts from patrons during the 
year, $10,000.00. : 
This School is beautifully located, having the advantage of charm- 
ing mountain views, and delightful freestone and chalybeate waters. 
No locality can surpass it in healthfalness and attractiveness. It is 
easy of access from all parts of the South. .

A private school under the care of the Society of Friends, is 
located at Friendsville, Blount County, Professor William Russell, 
Principal, and three assistants. Number of pupils enrolled last 
year, 126; average cost of board, ete., per year, about $100.00. 
  
Jonesporo, Tenn., Dec. 16, 1875, 
Hoy. Leon. Trovuspare, 
: Superintendent Public Instruction: 
The school building, Holston Male Institute, has been purchased - 
by Mr. Yardley Warner, who represents the Society of Friends 
Philadelphia. The title of the property will be vested in the proper: 
State authorities. This property is located in the eastern part. of
-P-A-G-E-259
263 
the town. The building is sixty-odd feet long by thirty feet wide - 
at one end, and forty-three at the other. Contains eight rooms, 
three on first floor and five on second; first floor 15 feet high, second 
13 feet, dining room and kitchen separate from the main building. 
Also, 1 stable, 1 large wood house, ete. On the lot are fruit-trees, 
shade trees, flowers, ete. We sell also school furniture, including 
bell, desks, and wall maps. Price, $3,600. 
Mr. Warner’s object is to co-operate with the school authorities 
of the State. A normal school will be opened for the training of 
teachers for the freedmen. ‘The higher department will be devoted 
to normal work, while the primary school will aim to supply a local 
want. The necessity for colored teachers is great. It is impossible, 
often, to obtain competent teachers for these people. Their schools 
are worse than inefficient—they are worthless, and ‘have a tendency 
to demoralize rather than elevate the colored race. We want teach- 
ers for them of their own race; we want a model school for the 
poor, degraded children of the freedmen. Both we have in contem- 
plation. 
Mr. Warner is doing a noble work for these people in the South. 
His Society expended last year, for teacher’s salaries, schoo] build- 
ings, books, $42,149.80 (forty-two thousand one hundred and forty- 
nine dollars and eighty cents). The manner in which it is expended 
adds much strength to the public school system... Mr. Warner will 
be on the ground and take part in organizing the school. 
Respectfully, H. PRESNELL. 
To the printed report of operations prior to this year, and to 
what H. Presnell may send, I append the following summary of the 
whole work done and proposed to be done.. 
There have been three aims in.my mission, viz. 
1. To train teachers on the spot, or near where "they are needed, 
and near where they live. 
2. To help and encourage State school officers, so as to enlist them 
heartily to co-operate in the provisions required (as buildings, sta- 
tionery, maps, school fixtures, ete.) for the efficient education of 
colored citizens; hoping also thereby to foster an interest in the ed- 
ueation of all classes. N
-P-A-G-E-260
264 
_ 3. To furnish solid reading matter, and, by supplying Sabbath 
Schools with Bibles, etc., and, by personal intercourse, to improve 
the worship and spiritual condition of the negro. About $4,000 
worth of books have, in this way, been gratuitously distributed, 
over and above the sums stated in my report. 
In order to carry out these aims two years were spent in Mary-. 
ville, Tenn., embracing other places, and founding schools in them, 
single-handed and uncommissioned, except by the “ Bible and Tract 
Distributing Committee of Friends’ Freedmen’s Aid Society, of 
Philadelphia.” Their. commission did not continue a year. A nor- 
mal class being organized, Indiana yearly meeting of Friends offi- / 
cially gave their moral support in 1871, and under their auspices © 
efforts were made and funds obtained by me from Friends of Phil- 
adelphia and elsewhere (of which over $20,000 were given by 
Friends in England and Ireland), so that not only the substantial 
and handsome structure at Maryville was erected, but at the same 
time over twenty schools were kept up from two to ten months each 
. year. Some wholly supported by the funds thus raised, others con- 
cinued by paying the tuition after public money had been used up. 
Though we have turned out about 30 teachers from the Maryville’ 
Normal School, the demand for teachers is such that we have been. 
working in the normal line at Athens, and now propose to do 0 at 
Jonesboro. It is proper here to state that the work having become 
so interlocked with State school work, and the funds coming almost 
entirely from the east, we cease to be auxiliary to the Indiana Com- 
mittee.. They have been joined by New England Yearly Meeting, 
and helped by sundry legacies and donations, so that the Maryville 
school is now not included in our supervision. In place of that 
concern comes in the normal work at Athens and Jonesboro, which, 
as fit centers of numerous and extensive school districts, we propose 
to make the recipients of the normal pupils from their surrounding 
counties, and supply those counties in turn with trained teachers, 
Three purposes will be met by these enterprises, viz.: Ist, the thor- 
ough training of teachers who need not go far from home to be. 
trained ; 2d, the setting of good examples in conducting schools, thus 
elevating ‘the standard of teacher’s qualifications; and 3d, the fur- 
nishing of a good school at each of these points to which may go 
any and all the colored children in reach of them.
-P-A-G-E-261
265 
Besides this normal work, we propose to go on supporting schools 
in the\ several counties in Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama, Georgia, 
ete., as\ heretofore. The property bought or buildings fitted up will 
be deeded in trust to County Trustees for specified uses, to revert 
in case of disuse or impossible conditions. All this work brings us 
so close to the County Superintendents that we now propose to ac- 
count to them, and depend on their auditing our accounts; also to 
decide on what compensation is suitable to us, for the services ren- 
dered the people and the State. Hitherto our services have been 
almost gratuitous, and this cannot so continue. 
We subjoin an extract from the Minutes of Indiana Yearly Meet- 
ing, showing the present condition of the Maryville Normal Insti- 
tute, also a statement of money raised and paid for the Tennessee 
work since our printed report. 
“ The Institute at Maryville has continued under the care of this 
Board. W. P. Hastings has acted as principal, he with his family 
living in the building, and taking boarders on his own account. 
The average attendance of colored students during the eight months’ 
school has been 873; average enrollments, 1153; number in nor- 
mal class, 283. ‘The Scriptures have been studied daily by all the 
students, and we believe the gospel principles, as held by us, have 
made a favorable impression upon many of the students, and some 
have joined our Society. 
As our funds were not sufficient to carry on this and the Helena 
institution, the Board concluded to send the Corresponding Secretary 
to New England Yearly Meeting. THe laid the matter fully before 
its Executive Committee, and the Yearly Meeting agreed to the fol- 
lowing arrangement, viz.: That the Freedmen’s Committee of New 
England Yearly Meeting should support the schools for three or 
four years, with funds now in their hands, at an expense not 
to exceed $1,500 a year, with the privilege of taking a deed 
at that time, if that Meeting should approve or direct, which 
arrangement was satisfactory to this Board. They ask for an agree- 
ment binding us or our successors to convey the property by deed, 
as suggested above, if desired, and we have prepared the same. All 
of which we submit to the Yearly Meetiug. 
The Executive Committee of New England Yearly Meeting re- 
quests this Board to continue its care of the institution for the pres-

CENTRAL TENNESSEE COLLEGE. 
(MIXED-—COLORED.) 
Located at 122 Maple Street, Nashville, is presided over by Rev. 
J. Braden, assisted by six teachers. The average number of pupils 
in attendance during the past year was 130. ' Receipts from patrons, 
$3,000.00; from donations, $3,400.00. The average cost per pupil 
for tuition and board, not including washing, is $8.50 per month. 
This school was chartered in 1866, and is now in its tenth year. 
It has organized but one College Class as yet. It has Preparatory, 
Academic, Normal, Intermediate and Theological Departments. 
The teachers have been supported by the Freedman’s Aid Society 
of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The current expenses, beside 
the teachers’ salaries, have been met by the students, The average 
number of pupils enrolled each year has been 240. The buildings, 
four in number, have been erected by the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, with some aid from the Freedman’s Bureau. The value of 
the buildings and lands is about $60,000.00. The permanent object 
of the institution, thus far, has been to prepare students to teach, 
and for the practical duties of life. In the Theological Depart- 
ment young men have received a training aiding them to discharge 
the duties-of the ministry. ‘

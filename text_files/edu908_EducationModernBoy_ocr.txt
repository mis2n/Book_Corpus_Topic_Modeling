INTRODUCTION 
Langour is not in your heart, 
Weakness is not in your word, 
Weariness not on your brow. 
—MartrHEew ARNOLD. 
So wrote the poet of his father, Dr. Thomas 
Arnold, the head of Rugby. Nor does it ex- 
press merely a filial tribute of appreciation: 
it breathes forth the idealization of a head- 
master by a schoolboy. Consider for the mo- 
ment the headmaster and his educational 
vantage point. He is the embodiment of 
time-shrouded traditions. His ideas, his in- 
fluence permeate the school’s entire life. 
Venerated and loved, he controls and guides 
the destiny of innumerable boys. And this 
privilege does not cease. at graduation. To 
the different colleges, to the remoter corners 
of the world the invisible thread extends. His 
Position is, indeed, unique and commanding. 
In these times, educational theories and 
practices are a bountiful source of discus-

journals contribute to the stream. Every

one becomes his own critic! And yet amid 
these healthy and desirable speculations one 
phase is little stressed—the headmaster and 
the problems of the preparatory school. 
Perhaps it is because he is geographically 
removed from the main current. The busy 
world may forget him temporarily in his 
country solitude, and he, perchance, forget us 
and our swiftly moving life. This should not 
be. In our giant age of progress, educational 
concepts, too, are in a state of flux. There 
is unquestionably greater need than ever for 
more sympathetic codperation between the 
school and the college. 
Difficult questions come to mind at once. 
Is there not, for example, too much of what 
we may call the professional organizing spirit 
creeping into our preparatory schools? Dr. 
Howe’s able chapter on the influence of ath- 
letics in the school strikes deep at this prob- 
lem. The intense competitive spirit which 
demands a victory at all costs, the increased 
physical proficiency, but the lowered stand- 
ards of sportsmanship, the disproportionate 
emphasis on mythical “championships,” the 
coach on the bench manipulating his team

INTRODUCTION ix 
like puppets—these are unnecessary evils 
recognized by every one. Certainly “the fun 
and relaxation” of the individual’s muscular 
prowess and initiative have rapidly waned. 
“Over-mental and muscular fatigue” sets in. 
Here perhaps is the weakest link in the ath- 
letic chain, for listless minds are directly 
contrary to sound scholastic policy. “The 
educational use of competition,” an excellent 
phrase borrowed from Professor Johnson of 
Harvard, has not been, it would seem, suffi- 
ciently studied. 
Other manifestations of the organizing 
mania are apparent. An open-minded ob- 
server may well be amazed at the extraor- 
dinary growth of radio clubs, camera clubs 
and similar organizations in the schools, all, 
to be sure, eminently fitting in their place, 
but inordinate time consumers. Where, one 
frankly asks, is any chance left for the 
masters to awaken and encourage an intel- 
lectual avocation, an intellectual interest, 
whether it be the collecting and classifying of 
lichens or writing poetry? The satisfying pur- 
suit of a hobby, in its broader implication, is 
in general unknown to the college freshman.

He is not even tolerably well-read for his 
age. “Browsing” is a pleasure untouched; 
the trampling steeds of romance are vague 
figures of an unexplored world. Sometimes 
the explanation lies in inadequate library fa- 
cilities. More often with considerable justi- 
fication the boy pleads lack of time. 
Let us, however, emphasize, with a cautious 
eye on the critic, that extra-curriculum activi- 
ties should not be brushed wholesale into the 
rubbish heap. .By no means. Beyond a 
doubt they make for the development of char- 
acter, such qualities as initiative, self-reliance, 
and perception—if handled properly! It is 
the bewildering richness of the feast spread 
before the eager eyes of the immature boy. 
There is the burning fact that one must - 
“make” at least some organization. Then, 
subtly swift, the fascination bites in: the 
desire to sprinkle the walls of the bedroom 
or study with numerous certificates of mem- 
bership becomes acute. The fervent wish of 
belonging to as many clubs as Jim or Jack 
may be fully comprehended only by the 
teachers and the boys themselves. 
One solution, just to all concerned, appears

ready at hand. The thought is respectfully 
ventured that this youthful abundance of 
energy and enthusiasm could be more intelli- 
gently directed by the accumulated wisdom 
of the school faculty than by the student 
unaided. If A, musically inclined, is a mem- 
ber of the Glee Club and of the Mandolin 
Club, should he also be actively engaged in 
the work of the Dramatic Club, the Debating 
Society, and the Radio Club, one wonders. 
Or take B, with distinct evidences. of dra- 
matic ability, acting in a Gilbert and Sullivan 
opera, undergoing long hours of rehearsal and 
forcing of necessity his normal routine into 
the background. He can hardly be expected, 
or even allowed, to carry on other energy- 
draining occupations. He, as in the case of 
his ambitious companions, must be protected 
from himself, for he is not sufficiently wise in 
self-protection. 
Nor is this a strange phenomenon unknown 
elsewhere. American life affords innumerable 
examples of feverish dabbling with commit- 
tees and clubs, excrescences on the regular 
occupation. The same problem vexes the col- 
lege official even to a greater extent than the

headmaster. President Angell of Yale, in his 
last annual report recently published, throws 
down the gauntlet in terms which admit of 
no misunderstanding. A faculty committee 
has been appointed to investigate the facts 
and to make constructive proposals. 
For the so-called “big man” has become a 
grave danger to his college and to himself. 
The young graduate steps blithely out from 
his alma mater with absurdly distorted no- 
tions of the number of irons which he is duty- 
bound to keep red hot in the fire at any given 
time. Unadorned statistics of the loads which 
eight or ten of the faithful and conscientious 
in every college generation are literally forced 
to shoulder would shock the thinking outsider. 
And these burdens are acquired on the same 
principle as the snowball gathering momen- 
tum. “Oh, give the chairmanship of the 
committee to Bill; he’s got a lot of other jobs 
and studying to do, but he always ‘comes 
through.’” Yes, but at what cost? Young 
men with haggard, drawn faces, weary eyes, 
hysterical tears, who are unable to sleep and 
to study are altogether too well known to the 
college doctor and the Dean’s Office.

INTRODUCTION. xifi 
There is a story, not a pleasant one, of a 
senior in a certain college who was a success- 
ful member of a major team. Being a capable 
student, he decided that a degree with honors 
was a worthwhile reward. Unfortunately it 
meant the severing of his connection with all 
athletics during the spring term. His course 
of action was officially made known to his 
coach. Anger and intense resentment, not 
only on the part of the coach, but also on the 
side of his teammates, greeted his announce- 
ment. Harassed beyond measure, he finally 
hit upon a-scheme. He went to the head of 
one of his courses and begged to be “flunked” 
at the next return of grades. 
The request was somewhat unusual. The 
astonished professor, recovering his senses in 
a few seconds, at last dragged out the account 
of the curious dilemma. He, possessed of a 
large acquaintance among the graduate body, 
went ithmediately to an intelligent, cool- 
headed alumnus interested in that particular 
sport, who quickly restored the ship to an’ 
even keel. The boy won his coveted honors! 
Confessedly, and thankfully, the affair was 
an extraordinary one. Nor is it a fair basis
-P-A-G-E-12

for hasty judgment or impulsive conclusions, 4 
It was not cited for that purpose. It does - 
perhaps indicate that pressure, unavoidable | 
and oftentimes intense, from one direction © 
or another, may hinder a student’s following 
his own strong inclinations. 4 
And yet, inevitably the damage caused by 
the complicated demands of the undergradu- 
ate’s life is partially done at an earlier period 
in his development. The seeds of the over- 
active, crammed existence are sown in the 
school years where the allurement is tempting 
and irresistible. They take root easily, for the 
soil is fresh and fertile. Again excessive cau- 
tion in the phrasing of such a statement is 
essential. No smug indictment is being thun- 
dered forth. 
But here is a golden opportunity for the 
preparatory school to take the lead, as in 
other matters to be brought out farther on, 
and to check practically at the source the 
headlong pace. College administrators are 
turning more and more towards the head- 
master and his faculty with the hope of gain- 
ing vigorous assistance. That is the crux of 
these foregoing remarks. 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
INTRODUCTION OX 
Another vexatious problem which bothers 
the school and college alike is the much- 
berated entrance requirements. And rightly 
so. There is a mutual and cordial dislike of 
certain phases of the examination system. 
Even the admission by certificate receives its 
share of the blows. Mr. Field’s thorough dis- 
cussion cannot fail to be illuminating and 
helpful to both camps, especially to those con- 
cerned with the higher institutions of learning. 
But can we ever hope to achieve absolute per- 
fection, to obtain indisputable fairness where 
human minds with their frailties of varying 
standards, different points of view and diverse 
conceptions of the important and the irrele- 
vant are the deciding factor? The struggle 
will be waged, but the correction of examina- . 
tions will always remain a rugged obstacle in 
the path of complete mechanical accuracy. 
To be envied are the smaller colleges which 
can afford time and teachers to study each 
individual applicant for admission, to investi- 
gate his intellectual potentialities by personal 
conference. A nearly ideal arrangement is 
this practice. The larger colleges now pride 
themselves on their increased ability to ob-
-P-A-G-E-14
xvi INTRODUCTION 
serve and to guide each student’s intellectual 
needs. And the time may come when the ° 
same painstaking effort may be spent in gov- 
erning his admission, though the difficulty of 
numbers is imposing. 
But much can be said, as usual, on both 
sides! The school master has his righteous 
grievances. So has the college instructor. 
Entrance examination “credits” are “too much 
thought of,” Mr. Field claims. The reck- 
oning of these units, he goes on to say, be- 
comes “unfortunate when it tends to give to 
students and their parents the idea that these 
quantitative symbols are the end and aim of 
school work.” Dr. Thayer, discussing the 
future of the preparatory school, goes further. 
“The journey (the school course) is only the 
process of reaching the desired country as 
quickly as possible. If there be short cuts, so 
much the better, for the journey has no bene- 
fits and delights of its own.” He deplores the 
undesirable fact, and he is not alone in his 
reproach, that the “college (entrance) exam- 
inations have become a standard by which 
the schools are tested and a goal toward 
which all intellectual effort tends.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
INTRODUCTION “xvii 
But need this be so? the college official 
may counter. And he has cogent arguments. 
It is common knowledge that about every col- 
lege president in the country is sorely embar- 
rassed by the multitude knocking at his gates 
and craving admission. The demand far ex- 
ceeds the supply. More and more it is becom- 
ing the school’s imperative and bounden 
duty to drill its students in what Mr. Field 
happily terms “the discipline of thoroughness 
in everyday tasks.” 
Both Dr. Peabody and Dr. Thayer state 
authoritatively that, in the exact words of 
Dr. Peabody, “the English schoolboy is one 
or two years ahead of ours and that in the 
upper classes of the English public schools 
they do work in classics, and in science as 
well, that is on a level with that of our sopho- 
more or junior classes at college.” 
What has happened? As the headmasters 
intimate, a competition, fully as keen as the 
alert competitive instinct in other sections of 
American life, has insidiously developed be- 
tween the schoolteacher’s wits, with the rapt 
interest of the student on the side lines, and 
the entrance examiner’s ingenuity. For we
-P-A-G-E-16
xviii INTRODUCTION 
must all appreciate, whether from the process 
of making out examinations or from the expe- 
rience of taking them, one incontrovertible 
fact. The passing of an examination does 
not always mean laborious preparation. It can 
too frequently be accomplished by a subtle 
combination of cunning, the possession of old 
examination papers, and an elementary knowl- 
edge of the law of probability. 
Facing the dangerous impediment of over- 
taxed facilities, the college, then, looks toward 
the school. The codperation of the school is 
paramount; it should recommend for the 
examinations only those boys who by serious 
and conscientious work throughout their last 
three years, say, have amply justified their 
worthiness and dependability. The intriguing 
game of getting a student through the en- 
trance examination in a subject which he 
wretchedly failed at school is a practice exhil- 
arating but out of date with modern condi- 
tions. Many cases could be found where a 
student is allowed to “try” the examination 
in Physics or French or Algebra, for example, 
where a shady passing grade is obtained, 
much to his delight. 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
INTRODUCTION xix 
The injustice is manifest. The potentially 
better man, unable to partake of expert pre- 
examination tutoring, may be just edged out . 
under any rule of limited numbers. Equally 
as bad is the fact that the student who 
slides into college is foredoomed to failure 
before the end of his freshman year. For the 
scholarship demands of the colleges have 
leaped ahead since the war. The increase is 
based upon a secure elementary foundation. 
And when such a boy falls by the wayside, 
the college has lavished its precious energy 
and time in a failure that might have been 
averted at the outset. 
A comparatively new school, not far dis- 
tant from Boston, is attempting a courageous 
stand which will receive the ungrudging en- 
dorsement of college administrators. When a 
student reaches the college preparation period 
his parents receive a letter which honestly 
and frankly states that “the school does not 
believe in what has been aptly called the 
‘storage battery’ type of education, nor does 
it propose to use the week between the clos- 
ing of school and the Board Examinations 
for an intensive tutoring period.”
-P-A-G-E-18
S x INTRODUCTION 
The responsibility is placed squarely on the 
shoulders of the boy. “We believe,” the let- 
ter continues, “we are aiding the cause of 
sound secondary school education by follow- 
ing the policy of not recommending boys who 
in our opinion have not striven for a college 
education.” It concludes by suggesting either 
the withdrawal of the boy if the parent does 
not subscribe to the policy or the ‘“whole- 
hearted codperation” from the parent and 
son. 
Surely a far step forward! It eliminates 
the “oh, the school will get us into college 
Somehow” attitude. The emphasis properly 
shifts. The question is not whether the boy 
can pass and help swell the school total, de- 
sirable as that may be in certain respects. 
Rather, has the boy gained through his early 
instruction sufficient mental power, endur-" 
ance, and poise to reflect glory on his school 
by his college record? And by that token, 
assuredly no furtive secret, a college official 
is more likely to judge the school’s success. 
These last paragraphs may allow the shift- 
ing of the emphasis to the parent. The higher 
institution humbly implores their assistance.
-P-A-G-E-19
INTRODUCTION xxi 
Administrative officers of the colleges have 
learned to view without enthusiasm a rock- 
ribbed conviction in the minds of many: 
parents: the belief that because a boy’s 
grandfather and father have gone to a certain 
college the boy is destined to enjoy that same 
privilege. Misfits are common; they are 
tragically pathetic as well. The small college 
or the larger institution; country or city;.a 
liberal, broad foundation or specialized train- 
ing, and so on. Despite the disappointment, 
the parent perforce should consider the boy’s 
temperament and physical strength. “Choose 
your college with due thought for the studies 
you hope to pursue, the friendships you hope 
to establish, and the traditions you intend to 
maintain.” No better doctrine than this of 
Mr. Field’s is possible. 
Implicit in some of these comments is his 
statement: “No admittance except on busi- 
ness must always be a rule of the college, as 
of the school.” The youth’s unaided con- 
ception of the “business” is refreshingly 
simple; generally it may be contained in the 
threefold division of custom, athletics, and 
friends. In the parent’s mind, the definition
-P-A-G-E-20
xaii INTRODUCTION 
often assumes unforeseen ramifications. One 
doting mother told her son’s dean that the 
boy was not returning in the fall although he 
had most successfully concluded his fresh- 
man year. She had found, her explanation | 
continued, that one full year’s attendance at - | 
college made the young man eligible for elec- 
tion to a certain Harvard Club and member- 
ship in that body was essential to his business 
interests! That was one benefit to be derived 
from going to college. Inconceivable as it 
sounds, business and social ends influence in 
many cases the choice of the college. 
A most inspiring challenge Dr. Stearns 
hurls out to parents in his chapter on the 
influence of the home on the impressionable 
boy. If there is a crying need for “mutual 
sympathy” between the school and the pat- 
ent, as clearly enough there is, that same 
urgent call exists when the boy strikes out 
into the higher educational venture. The let- 
ters which he cites are their own explanation. 
They run the gamut of tactful encourage- 
ment, stupid interference, and brutal disre- 
- gard. And parallel exhibits are not absent 
from the archives of any dean’s office. 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
INTRODUCTION | xxii 
As Dr. Stearns points out: “Our schools are 
far from perfect: but today they are being 
asked to carry much more than their proper 
share of the load.” The inference is obvi- 
ous; the call is a clear one. The path of 
least resistance as it may seem, it is hardly 
fair to either the school or the college to 
deposit a boy like so much baggage in the 
new, rather terrifying surroundings. No one 
will quarrel with Dr. Stearns’s assertion that 
the mother plays the “major réle.” On the 
other hand, do all mothers realize the foolish, 
unthinking part they sometimes take in addi- 
tion? It is not necessary to inquire of a busy 
dean, at the opening of the academic year 
when the drains on his time are enormous, 
whose duty it will be to see that her son is 
tucked into bed every night at ten-thirty 
promptly. It ought not to be the task of the 
college authorities to suggest the number of 
pillow cases, sheets and towels the well- 
equipped freshman should bring. Yet these 
questions have actually occurred. 
The attitude of the mother is indeed an 
important thing. She must have some confi- 
dence in her freshman son. It must be
-P-A-G-E-22
xxiv INTRODUCTION 
assumed that on entering college he has be- « 
come in part the man. Let the story of the 4 
poor frail widow which Dr. Stearns relates 3 
be the shining lodestar. Her son had griev- «4 
ously erred, and though she settled her home + 
in the university city to be near him when 4 
called upon, she remained unobtrusively in | 
the background, her eagerness, her resolute- | 
ness held severely in check. The final out- / 
come of his college career amply justified her | 
action. Passive, unassuming, but watchful — 
waiting is an intelligent policy to pursue. 7 
With clear vision Dr. Thayer peers into * 
the future of the preparatory school. His ; 
ideas are striking. He objects to the word © 
“preparatory” as signifying a certain limita- 
tion which has fettered schools in the past. 
He calls for a “declaration of independence 
of college (entrance) examinations.” With j 
its freedom, he argues, the school ‘must move . 
towards higher standards of scholarship.” He - 
stresses the “development of the boy of 3 
superior ability,” something that has been 4 
neglected in the past, for ‘the school period ° 
is the time for the making of the scholar, and 
‘not for preparing him to be made in college.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
INTRODUCTION ‘ xxv 
Dr. Peabody, too, feels the schools have not 
taken full advantage of their great oppor- 
tunities. . 
These are fine aims. They make the out- 
look encouraging. Methods and personnel 
are steadily improving. More college gradu- 
ates of the right sort are joining the teaching 
ranks, as Dr. Peabody asserts. There is, how- 
ever, one point, a vital point, which both 
these headmasters make,-that the community 
at large does not fully realize. In the final 
analysis, the preparatory schools are the real 
fitters for life. We must not lose sight of 
this goal. The thought unleashes the schools 
and leaves them free to forge ahead towards 
the high ends all headmasters fervently desire 
to attain. 
And so, if the preparatory’school can give 
our future citizens sound mental and physi- 
cal powers, can afford them a healthy, nat- 
ural religious sense and make them feel the 
comforting presence of God in the way Dr. 
Drury forcefully sets forth, can arouse and 
strengthen the lurking interest in the intel- 
lectual, largely by abolishing the college en- 
trance examination fetish, can curb the pro-

fessional spirit and can indicate the rational 
distribution of one’s talents, it will indeed 
serve the community and render in the years 
to come those distinct contributions to educa- 
tion which Dr. Thayer justly claims for the 
past. More specifically it will fortify the 
hands of the more advanced teacher in main- 
taining high standards of general excellence. 
One last word must be said. Original and 
refreshing as the conception of this book is, 
it possesses another gratifying merit. The 
voice of the headmaster is authoritatively 
heard. Tie suggestions and remarks of these 
gentlemen, distinguished leaders in their great 
profession, cannot fail to be enormously stim- 
ulating. For parents, for teachers of all 
ranks, for those only acquainted with the 
fascinating problem of education, these pages 
will provoke fresher interpretations and will 
provide food for riper deliberations.

HOME INFLUENCE 
THREE agencies above all others in our 
nation’s history have contributed to the shap- 
ing of American character and American life 
—the home, the church, and the school. Each 
has played its part, and a tremendously impor- 
tant part; but if we were forced to give up 
any two the home would be the last that could 
be spared. In western Christian civilization 
that still sheds its light on the earth’s dark 
places, that fills with courage and a new hope 
the hearts of the perplexed and oppressed, and 
that stands asa bulwark against anarchy and 
chaos, the home is the foundation stone. 
Alien and destructive forces have always 
recognized this and have directed their clever- 
est and hardest blows at this, the very heart 
and source of our civilized life. Small wonder 
that Russia, weltering in the tragedy of com-

munism should rage with unconcealed venom 4 
against the Christian home. 4 
In the thought of the average American 3 
the school is regarded as the chief instrument 
for the protection and perpetuation of our } 
most cherished national ideals. With our 3 
characteristic habit of developing an effective « 
instrument to accomplish an important task 4 
and then casually leaving that instrument to | 
achieve the results expected, we have devel- 
oped the school and have been too ready } 
to believe that in that process the desired | 
ends have been made secure. We have looked © 
to the school to supply evident lacks, to cor- j 
rect our mistakes, to impart knowledge, to } 
shape habits, to teach manners, to inspire ; 
ideals, and to develop character which in- | 
cludes all. In short, to the school has been j 
carelessly assigned the tremendous task of 
turning out good and worthy citizens fully 4 
equipped to grapple successfully with the hard 
problems of an increasingly exacting world. | 
- With exasperating indifference we ignore the 
‘other and so often more important factors : 
that must inevitably enter into the making : 
of citizenship, and when the results we hoped |

for are not forthcoming the school becomes 
the easy target of our vigorous abuse. This 
is manifestly unfair. Our schools are far from 
perfect: but today they are being asked to 
carry much more than their proper share of 
the load. The wonder is that they have done 
so well with the impossible task assigned 
them. 
The fact that the American people have 
so lavishly invested money, time, and thought 
in their schools is evidence enough that they 
regard with the deepest concern the welfare. 
of the child and desire to make it.a strong 
and effective citizen. The heart and pur- 
pose of the people are sound: what is lack- 
ing is a broad and clear comprehension of the 
various agencies that inevitably play their 
parts in the attainment of the end desired. 
Among these agencies none plays a more 
important part than does the home. A build- 
ing can be no larger or stronger than the size 
and quality of its foundations permit: and 
it is in the home that the foundations of 
character and citizenship are laid. Whatever 
is later accomplished by school and church 
and the tests of life itself will be definitely

limited by the nature of that earlier process. 
Home is a comprehensive term. It is not © 
easily defined. Its superficial characteristics 
are easily discerned, but not so those intan- 
gible but immensely real elements that give » 
the home its true character and shape its last-

and with people than are often allowed those 
of limited means. Yet a log cabin may serve 
better than a Fifth Avenue mansion to de- 
velop character, and a farmhouse better than 
a suburban estate may mould an effective 
citizen. City hotels and crowded apartment 
houses do not make ideal homes, and yet even 
under such evident and so often destructive 
handicaps one often senses the atmosphere in 
which are bred the highest types of character, 
an atmosphere that not even the quiet coun- 
try house can of itself create. Physical con- 
ditions alone will not produce the true home. 
The home after all is an atmosphere, an 
atmosphere created by and dependent upon 
those who as parents, as husband and wife, 
as father and mother, set its ‘standards and 
shape its ideals. Immediate surroundings 
may help or hinder, but parents who recognize 
their responsibilities and who accept gladly 
their high privilege will face these conditions, 
be they good or bad, and use them for the 
accomplishment of a high purpose and the 
attainment of an exalted ideal. Despite carp- 
ing critics this can be done. It has been done 
through the passing years: and it is being

done today by hundreds and thousands of | 
unselfish and high-minded parents who have 
never lost sight of their sacred obligations 
to their children and to humanity, and who 
count it life’s biggest and most important 
task to send forth into the world to serve 
the coming generation men and women fitted ~ 
to meet unflinchingly life’s hardest tests and . 
to accept serenely life’s highest joys. 
The standards and ideals of parents, then, 
are the factors that chiefly determine the at- 
mosphere that makes or mars the home. What 
must these be? Primarily the right objective. 
What that objective should be has been indi- 
cated above. The qualities that give color 
to the right atmosphere require next consider- 
_ ation. 
The American home is distinctly a product 
‘of our western Christian civilization. It can- 
not be interpreted, it cannot be understood, 
save on the basis of spiritual values. The 
discussion of religion is reserved for another 
chapter: but religion cannot be ignored in 
our consideration of the home. Without 
spiritual values. the home is an empty shell. 
The highest test of Christian discipleship is 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
HOME INFLUENCE 9 
love manifested in unselfish service and sacri- 
fice; and nowhere more truly than in the home 
are these qualities required. To the growing 
and impressionable child example more than 
precept is the potent influence. Unselfish- - 
_ hess, sincerity, idealism, practiced as well as 
professed, win its confidence and respect; 
while it detects with almost uncanny insight 
the note that is false or insincere. It will 
accept advice, respond to censure, and profit 
by discipline at the hands of those it trusts, 
but it will resent and be hardened by the same 
treatment from those in whose lives there 
rings a false or hypocritical note. Christian 
idealism is the great generator that supplies 
the force needed to make and maintain the 
home. Regardless of creed or sect Christian 
principles must control, Christian motives # 
direct, and Christian ideals prevail. Hourly 
service, daily sacrifice, self-restraint and self- 
denial are the inevitable lot of those who 
shoulder the sacred responsibility of parent- 
hood. Self-seekers and cynics would have us 
believe that such a life can mean only dreari- 
ness and pain, but Christian parenthood rises 
in its strength to protest and to proclaim from

Master Himself that he who serves rules, and © 
that only he who loses his life for the welfare 
of others truly finds it—and finds it here and 
now, not in some dim and uncertain here- - 
after. Nowhere more than in parents who - 
have fully and cheerfully accepted their God-. 
given responsibilities will one find a deeper — 
serenity of heart or truer manifestations of . 
the real joy of living. No wonder that they 
look with mingled feelings of disgust and - 
amused contempt upon the hectic antics of © 
their pleasure-loving brothers and sisters who — 
in their mad search for happiness as an end - 
in life find it only the shadowy and disappoint- - 
ing phantom that in the world’s long history 
it has always proved itself to those who have 
made it their goal. 
To a large degree the home is woman’s 
~ creation. Its color is chiefly of her making. 
In its helplessness the child instinctively leans — 
more on its mother than on its father. In its — 
need and its distress it is to the mother that 
childhood first turns for help and comfort. 
Gradually, as the maturer years approach, the | 
sterner hand of the father fills a larger place,

especially with the boys; but even then it is 
mother love and understanding that play the 
major rdle. Are there any of us, indeed, who 
have reached the years of middle life or be- 
yond, who have not had our moment of per- 
plexity and distress when our hearts instinc- 
tively cried out for that comfort and sympathy 
we knew in childhood and that only mother 
love could supply. If there are such, life has 
dealt cruelly with them and denied them its 
richest blessing. The home is woman’s realm: 
and man can claim no nobler. 
What has been said above must not be 
misinterpreted. Without denying that the 
immediate contacts and the most potent in- 
fluence in the home belong by right to the 
wife and mother we must clearly admit that 
the obligations that fall upon the husband 
and father are none the less sacred and real. 
Home responsibilities must be equally shared, 
home obligations mutually met. Bringing up 
a family is no easy task, but it can and should 
be made easier for the patient woman who 
hourly faces its routine and confinement by 
the glad contribution on the part of her mate 
of such interests and diversions as he is
-P-A-G-E-35
12. EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
privileged to provide. Cheer, and sympathy, 
and above all himself are his to give if he 
will; and these at least he should give in 
fullest measure. There can be no true home 
when the husband and father allows business 
or professional duties to consume all of the 
day and then seeks his relaxation in selfish 
indulgences apart from his home. The break- 
down of many a home begins at this point, and 
whatever the later developments may be it is 
not the woman who deserves the blame. 
Mutual love, mutual surrender, mutual sym- 
pathy and understanding are the foundation 
stones of every enduring home: and mutual 
respect for the bigness and sacredness of the 
responsibility deliberately chosen will prove 
a sure defense against whatever forces may

family circle. Here daily lessons are learned, 
problems solved, adjustments made, edges 
rubbed smooth, until the child as it emerges 
into the maturer years finds in the larger con- 
tacts of school, college, or the new world out- 
side conditions not wholly unknown and 
adjustments that are not forbidding. Herein — 
lies one of the greatest perils of the under- 
sized family. The only child deserves. our 
pity: and it is pathetic often to watch its 
clumsy and painful attempts at adjustments 
when the whole process is a new one never 
before permitted in its limited world. School- 
masters unite in testifying to the better poise, 
the greater self-reliance and control, and the - 
readier adaptability of those pupils who have 
been blessed with brothers and sisters to aid 
them in their earlier schooling. 
One is apt to take up one’s chosen work in 
life with some pretty definitely conceived 
notions as to how that work should be done 
and some distinct theories which he hopes to 
realize. With the experience of passing years 
many of these notions are discarded, most of 
the theories abandoned or modified. To a

Teachers and sensible parents are well aware 3 
that youth at its best is unstable and still in 4 
that formative period when mistakes are often % 
made and foolish acts. not uncommon. Im- % 
pulses are not always well directed and self- “|

the mistake or the foolishness that counts one 4 
fraction so much as whether it is to be turned 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
HOME INFLUENCE 15 
to good account or bad; and this will depend 
upon the way it is handled. Indeed it is not 
infrequently the case with wavering youth 
that a given false step if properly dealt with 
can be made the very turning point in the 
development of character and become the 
starting point towards a life of poise and self- 
control. But this happy outcome demands 
absolute and mutual sympathy between home 
and school. The attempt to shift the blame, 
to ignore the seriousness of the offense, to look 
for excuses, and to profess extenuating cir- 
cumstances means the loss of opportunity that 
may never return again. And it is because 
there are such parents still, in large if de- 
creasing numbers, that the schoolmaster takes 
heart and goes forward with his tasks, know- 
ing well that in time he will find his rich 
reward in the maturer lives of these same 
unstable youngsters for whose ultimate good, 
in codperation with sympathetic and sensible 
parents, it was his high privilege to labor. 
Extracts from several letters, prized beyond 
price, will indicate the character and spirit 
of parents of this high class. 
Here is one from a mother whose boy had
-P-A-G-E-39
16 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
' slipped out of town on a foolish but seemingly 
harmless lark and had been obliged to leave 
the school in consequence. 
“My boy’s letter came Saturday and yours 
Monday. Fred’s letter seems to indicate a 
right attitude towards the situation. A child 
cannot be disassociated from his home and 
parents, so his failure is a failure of all of us. 
“I rejoice now as always over any circum- 
stance that serves to jar us into seeing and 
acting more clearly, and feel we are a fortu- 
nate family in having such good friends as you 
and the members of the faculty. . . . 
“I regret immeasurably that we have given 
you and the school pain and difficulty. I hope 
that somehow we can yet make good. 
“The clearest statement I can make of my 
appreciation of your wisdom and kindness is 
to say that our boy, Jack, will be ready to 
enter Andover in September, 1926, if you are 
brave enough to try us again.” 
And this from a father whose boy had 
- Slipped in his work and been put on probation. 
“When George wrote us about being put on 
probation and made excuses we were rather 
inclined to wire him that we hoped he would

soon run out of gas. You and the faculty have 
done exactly right in putting him on proba- 
tion. I feel confident that you will cause him 
to improve. 
“By this time I am reasonably confident 
that his marks are improving and very shortly 
he will get back measurably into the good 
graces of his poor suffering teachers. What 
a trying life they must have at times and how 
little the boys appreciate them! The thing 
that troubles me is that when George peri- 
odically loafs he loses. However, it is, as I 
tell him, his life and not mine, and all we can 
do, you and I, is to point out that fact to 
him and point out the different ways of taking 
advantage of the opportunities given him.” 
From another father who faced a similar 
situation with his boy. 
“I have a letter from Jim telling n me he has 
been put on probation. You may be inter- 
ested in the enclosed copy of my letter to him. 
You are a pretty busy man, so you need not 
feel obliged to read it; however, I want you 
to know that I am trying to codperate with 
you in the interesting—if sometimes difficult 
~—job of developing the good points in a boy

who is, I believe, fundamentally sound and 
capable of doing something some day; and 
subordinating the qualities, of which he has 
a number, which sometimes exasperate his 
teachers—and his parents—to desperation. 
“I am doing this because it is my job and 
your job together.” 
The following extracts from this wise 
father’s letter to his son might well serve as 
models for many parents similarly harassed. 
“Thave your letter telling me that you have 
been put on probation and I have no doubt 
that you realize what a sorrow it was to me 
‘to hear about it and to have to tell your 
mother. 
“Your argument that injustice has been 
done you seems to be based on purely techni- 
cal grounds—as to what Mr. actually 
reported, what he said he reported and the 
like. I think that Dr. Stearns’s action was 
based on the whole situation, on a series of 
instances rather than just that one isolated 
event. I think you will find that Dr. S-——— 
keeps more in touch with each of the Poys 
than you can imagine.  
-P-A-G-E-42

“T agree with you that this particular 
offense does not, in itself, justify probation 
—it might possibly justify a spanking—but 
Andover is not equipped for spanking. Dr. 
S. has had a long experience with boys 
of all kinds, and so has Andover, and their 
success has not resulted from doing injustices. 
There is a pretty strong presumption that 
Dr. S knew what he was doing—and 
that he was doing what he thoughtfully con- 
sidered was best for the school and best for 
you. 
“It looks to me as if he felt that you needed 
to be brought to yourself with a round turn 
—that it was better for you to snap to with a 
jerk now than to let things go on till they 
might get worse. 
“Tt seems to be all a question of your own 
mental attitude, Son. I refuse to believe that 
you are not fundamentally sound, but you 
make your own trouble by being too stiff- 
necked—by your own unwillingness to accept, 
cheerfully, the restrictions that are necessary 
to any organization and by an inability to hold 
yourself in check when you see an oppor-

the front row when petty things of this kind 
are being done? 
“TI advise you to take your medicine just 
as I would expect you to take a ‘hard decision 
on the football field and play all the harder, 
according to the rules. If you sulk and act 
the part of injured innocence the authorities 
can only judge by externals, and they will 
probably say, ‘He’s still unwilling to play the 
game,’ and you may go on to something more 
serious. Take yourself by the back of the 
neck in both fists and say to yourself, ‘I will 
play the game! I will accept the rules and 
I won’t try to get around them or beat them 
or break them—and more than all else I will © 
be cheerful and act as if I liked them.’

you that counts. . 
“T am back of you with everything I have 
got, but I can only sit on the side lines—you 
are in the game—play it!” 
The wisdom and common sense of parents 
of this kind bring their inevitable reward, for 
the future success of their fortunate children 
can be predicted with little less than cer- 
tainty. / 
Incidents as well as letters constantly 
appear in school life to illustrate the signifi- 
cance of parental attitude of this character, 
and the passing years reveal clearly its wisdom 
and soundness. One may look with all human 
certainty in such cases to a future in which 
these once erring youths will have taken com- 
manding and respected places on life’s stage. 
Seldom if ever is such expectation unrealized. 
A widowed mother sat in the Principal’s 
office. Her boy had been caught stealing. 
She was a frail little person physically and the 
black veil that hung over her shoulders intensi- 
fied the pallor of a face drawn and set under 
the sting of this latest and cruel blow. Un- 
flinchingly she faced the hard facts. Then
-P-A-G-E-45
22 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
gathering her strength she said quietly, “This 
is a dreadful thing. I have not yet come fully 
to realize that one bearing my name could be 
guilty of it. But he is my boy and I shall 
never give him up. My plans for the next few 
years must be completely changed, for I must 
give him all my time now and help him fight 
his way out. My other children can spare 
me for the time, I think.” 
She was true to her word. Her boy the: 
next year was admitted to a university and 
the mother established her home in that uni- 
versity town. With greater tact and sense 
than commonly displayed by mothers similarly 
located she kept herself in the background 
watching from a distance but leaving her son 
to make his own friends and do his work 
unimpeded, and only allowing him to feel that 
she was near by to see him make good and if 
need be aid him in his hard task. For the 
four years of his college course she held to 
her self-imposed task accepting finally her 
richly-earned reward when she saw her boy 
graduated with Phi Beta Kappa rank, the 
recipient of many deserved honors,.and enjoy-

% There are tasks which none but parents can 
perform. There are relations which only 
parents can fill with their children. The 
questionings of childhood and youth can be 
answered safely only by wise parents who 
understand. The strength and idealism which 
youth requires as it faces its peculiar temp- 
tations and fights for manhood and woman- 
hood can be supplied only by fathers and 
mothers in whom strength and wisdom reside. 
Discipline wisely and justly administered in 
the home will largely forestall the necessity 
of discipline at school and will destroy the 
possibility of disaster in maturer years. These 
tasks cannot safely be delegated. They belong 
to the home; and if the home neglects them 
they will never be done. 
When we turn from those homes in which 
sanity controls and sympathetic codperation 
is never lacking we shall find homes of widely 
varying kinds, some that test our patience, 
some that deserve our pity rather than our 
censure, some that stir only righteous indigna- 
tion. If there is one quality that parents as
-P-A-G-E-47
24 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
well as teachers should possess, and in gen- 
erous amounts, it is the saving grace of 
humor. Without it our tasks are made infi- 
nitely harder and it becomes all but impos- 
sible to see life in its true proportions and 
to see it whole. The weaknesses in many 
homes and of a large number of well-meaning 
parents will often be found here. Much of 
the unwise and excessive devotion lavished 
by fond mothers upon their children would 
be curbed if only a larger sense of humor were 
in evidence; for humor serves to maintain 
balance and proportion without which the 
best results can never be secured. 
. By no stretch of the imagination can the 
writer of the following unique letter be said 
to possess this saving grace. 
“Dear Sir,” he writes, “I have just heard 
from my son that it has become more or less 
the common custom for the boys to call him by 
a nickname, which he designates as ‘Dutch.’ 
‘This expression is very annoying to me and 
furthermore I see no necessity for his carry- 
- inganickname. You would oblige me greatly 
should you discourage the use of this term 
entirely.”
-P-A-G-E-48
HOME INFLUENCE 25 
This lack is more often in evidence among 
mothers, and a schoolmaster’s files will pro- 
duce plenty of material to prove the con- 
tention. Fortunately not all mothers are 
poetically inclined. If they were, interpreters . 
would have to be added to the regular teach- 
ing staff, and especially those capable of 
extracting sense from so-called modern verse. 
The communication which follows was sent _ 
to enlighten a schoolmaster on the unusual 
qualities of a prospective pupil up to this 
point a stranger to him. Its interpretation is 
left to the reader. 
“To BILLY 
Child of Light, of Love, of Sweetness, 
With your buoyant joyous nature, 
You have delved the Heart of things, 
You know where the Humming bird nests 
You know where the Indian Pipe and

To equip your clear fine spirit—

With your clear song and note you will find 
A rarer Heaven, a sun-lit wall 
Covered with roses and sweet white lilies, 
You will hear the nightingale’s song— 
Be worthy, Child, be worthy.” 
Naively the mother adds an interesting but 
somewhat baffling postscript: “It tells more 
about him than I can at this time.” 
Not so easily understood or forgiven is the 
parent of another type. To these discipline 
and restraint are unknown, and even admoni- 
tion and advice are seemingly never factors in 
the family life. Sink or swim seems to be the 
guiding motto: and not many swim for long or 
far. 
It is customary at Phillips Academy to 
send notice to parents when a boy has accu- 
mulated five unexcused absence marks. This 
is a warning signal, for eight of these marks 
mean the severance of the school connection.

authorities in the attempt to drive home to the 
careless pupil the significance of the situation 
and the manifest danger involved. .To this 
appeal most parents respond promptly and ° 
vigorously, for pride as well as interest is 
touched. Such a notice was recently sent to a 
father. The reply was unexpected and un- 
usual. 
“Dear Sir,” he wrote, “I am returning here- 
with Mr. ’s report card. Please be so 
kind as to deliver the same to him, and in the 
future please deliver all other reports to him. 
He is the party at interest.” 
About a week after the receipt of this re- 
markable document the annual notices preced- 
ing the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays 
were forwarded to the parents and guardians 
of all the boys in the school. The notices 
carried the usual requests for instruction as to 
how the boys were to pass their holidays; for 
schoo] authorities at least are keenly alive to 
the special dangers that lurk in the paths of 
their pupils during vacation days. In due 
season a copy of this notice reached the writer 
of the letter quoted above and prompted this 
reply:  
-P-A-G-E-51
28 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
“Dear Sir: 
I am in receipt of your letter of recent date 
relative to the manner in which your students 
are to spend their Thanksgiving and Christ- 
mas recesses. 
“I attribute the receipt of this communica- 
tion from your institution to the fact that I 
am ’s natural father, and from which 
fact it. follows that I am also his legal 
guardian. 
“I recently requested you to take up all 
such matters directly with Mr. himself. 
I am as ignorant as Adam’s off ox in regard 
to any plans that he may have for his vaca- 
tion periods. 
“John is the eldest of my six children. He 
and the rest of them are always free to do 
as they please with their vacations. John 
has traveled over the larger portion of the 
western hemisphere during his school vaca- 
tions since he was ten years old. 
“Your vacation regulations are certainly 
surprising to me. I should feel that I was a 
failure as a parent if I could not trust a twelve- 
year-old child with a month’s freedom, 
“Trusting that you will appreciate the fact

that John is perfectly capable of handling his 
own affairs and that in the future you will 
take all such matters up with him personally, 
I beg to remain, etc,” 
By the time this letter reached the school 
the boy in question had been placed on proba- 
tion for stubborn refusal to do his school work. 
Every effort was made to bring him to see the 
danger and to encourage him to mend his 
ways. With no aid forthcoming from home 
these efforts were foredoomed to failure and 
in due season a potentially fine boy was 
dropped from the school. Whatever this very 
modern father may believe, any other out- 
come would have involved a miracle, and yet, 
as later letters” from this home show, the 
school is blamed for its inefficiency and for 
the final tragedy. 
From incidents such as those that have been 
given it is not a long step to those that reveal 
the fast crumbling home that is rapidly ceas- 
ing to function and finally—to the saddest 
Picture of all—the utterly broken home. In 
its stark and ugly nakedness the shattered

The picture there revealed is sad enough in

itself: but infinitely more tragic is that which 
so often lies concealed behind—distracted 
children denied their just birthright, mere 
playthings now in the hands of weak and 
selfish parents, facing unfair odds, wrestling 
with problems more difficult and complicated 
than they are competent to solve, entering a 
chilling and an unnatural life. Whatever 
their trials and disagreements, warring par- 
ents, could they but sense as a schoolmaster 
so often does the unutterable tragedy they are 
about to inject into the lives of innocent 
” children, would be slow to take this final and 
cruel step. 
“Why did you do this foolish thing?” was 
asked a boy who had run away from school 
and whose avowed object was to reach Man- 
churia where the struggle between Japan and 
Russia was then being waged. “Because,” 
was the reply, “my one impulse was to get to 
the other side of the world where no one had 
ever heard my family name and there make 
a fresh start of my own.” For some time 
this purpose had been shaping itself in the 
boy’s distracted mind and the final momen- 
tum had been supplied by newspaper reports

of the parental disagreements. The father 
protested that he had lavished on his son all 
that wealth could supply and was clearly sur- 
prised when told that all the wealth in the - 
world could not make good the loss of the one 
thing he had failed to provide—a home. 
“I don’t respect my parents. Why should 
I? They are not worthy of my respect,” said 
an impulsive lad to his college president who, 
in the endeavor to save him from the inevi- 
table catastrophe towards which he was fast 
heading, had sought to appeal to his sense of 
responsibility to his home. And the boy was 
right: for the parents in this case had for- 
feited their right to respect. 
So often one encounters in school life cases 
of seemingly unexplainable behaviour that

cise reasonable control will be found to be 
the broken or at least unstable homes that 
lie in the background. 
A boy had slipped away from school and 
made a night of it in a neighboring city. He 
was promptly expelled. The usual protests 
from parents followed. The school was 
blamed for its laxity and injustice. Appeals 
for the lad’s reinstatement were vigorous and 
prolonged. The seriousness of the offense was 
glossed over and even denied, When it be- 
came evident at last that the school authori- 
ties would not relent, father and mother gave 
full expression to their opinion of those who- 
had dared place this stigma upon an innocent 
child. Their letters are immensely interest- 
ing. “You expressed considerable sympathy 
for me,” writes the father. “I want to say 
to you that my heart is not in the slightest 
degree broken, that I am very proud of my 
boy, and that for many reasons, among which 
are his clean, good character, etc.” A later 
reinstatement is urged, and the letter con- 
cludes with this heroic offer of future codper- 
ation. “I promise to punish him for the
-P-A-G-E-56
- HOME INFLUENCE 33 
breaking of your rules by cutting his allow- 
ance in half.” 
But the mother must have her say too, And 
she does. “My son,” she writes, “a senior 
~—and about to graduate—has suddenly been 
expelled—by an autocratic ruling because he 
had broken a technical rule. My boy is at 
home in a fine Christian atmosphere——— This 
is a rather unusual case. Not the usual 
lament of disappointed mothers—— I am 
pleased with my son.” 
This somewhat significant correspondence 
had almost ceased before attention was 
attracted to the fact that father and mother 
signed different names. Then the truth was 
out, and it was the old story. A broken home: 
separation of parents: remarriage: and now at 
last “a fine Christian atmosphere.” 
One more illustration of this kind. A boy 
of marked ability had been slipping badly in 
his work. Efforts to arouse his interest had 
largely failed. The parents were appealed to 
for help, and the father bravely responds. 
Here is what he has to offer. “I have made 
considerable effort to send and keep Fred at 
Andover. He seems to be totally wanting

34 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
in appreciation and has assumed an attitude 
towards life that is most disgusting, namely 
that ‘it is his right.’ I do not want him to 
leave Andover. In fact it would hit me very 
hard. He must, however, be awakened to the 
fact of his obligations and that he must pay. 
Mrs. ——,, I am sorry to say, does not seem 
to appreciate the situation. I might say in 
this connection that we are not living to- 
gether. 
“I am therefore going to ask you to write 
me a strong letter—‘one that will get under 
the boy’s skin.” One that I can show to him 
and also to his mother. In writing please do 
not mention that you have written me for- 
merly, as I want it to appear that the one 
you will send me will be the first that I have 
received in connection with his stand. Will 
you date it June twenty-first. I am sorry to 
trouble you, but find that I must have strong 
backing from you if I am to pull the boy 
through.” 
The father’s letter bears date of June 
twenty-sixth and needs no further comment. 
Again the broken home; and as a starting 
point for the desired reform deceit and trick-

ery. And the tragic victim a naturally promis- 
ing boy. 
The cases mentioned above represent, of. 
course, extremes. Their number, while 
steadily increasing, is still comparatively 
small. Yet the startling records of our 
American divorce courts should shock us into 
a clear realization of what this growing ten- 
dency portends for the future and the com- 
ing generations. But even though these cases 
may be regarded still as the unusual, they 
are deeply significant in that they indicate 
pointedly what is going on beneath the outer 
and visible surface of American home life. 
Human nature naturally shrinks from the 
publicity and scandal associated with the 
divorce court, and most parents, for reasons 
of pride at least, hesitate to bare their quar- 
rels to public view. Disagreements will be 
concealed as long as possible, but disagree- 
ments cannot be concealed from the searching 
eyes of children, and the effects on impres- 
sionable youth may be just as distressing as 
if the facts were known to the world. A dis- 
tupted home may exist and just as truly 
spread its poison in the lives of childhood
-P-A-G-E-59
36 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
even when parents prefer to retain the tech- 
nical marriage bond. The home atmosphere 
has been destroyed and there can be no true 
home when this is so. 
Many agencies are today busily at work 
undermining the foundations of the home and 
rendering next to impossible the maintenance 
of conditions and relations without which a 
real home is impossible. City life with its 
hotels and apartment houses; the increasing 
speed of life itself in a material age; the 
exacting demands of business, professional, 
and social life; automobiles, movies, and 
jazz; and the new and wider responsibilities 
assumed by woman all hammer unceasingly 
at the foundations of the home. But worst of 
all is that modern and alien philosophy of 
life that of late years has reared its ugly head 
among us, preclaimed so blatantly and con- 
stantly by its votaries, and running counter 
to all the best of our American traditions. 
Tremendously alluring this philosophy proves 
to an indulgent people whose thought is chiefly _ 
of self and whose choice is regularly the way 
of ease and physical comfort. Boldly it seeks 
to delude us into the belief that restraint is
-P-A-G-E-60
HOME INFLUENCE 8 
odious, self-control silly, the virtues of the 
past foolish mistakes; while it urges us to 
make self the aim of life and self-indulgence ~ 
our chief business. Against the attacks of this |: 
pernicious philosophy the home, unless it be 
on its guard, will not be able long to stand. 
Indeed those who most loudly proclaim: this 
doctrine do not hesitate to level their hardest 
blows at this, the very cornerstone of Chris- 
tian civilization. Small wonder that in this 
deadly work these un-American iconoclasts 
‘have the sympathetic approval and enthusi- 
astic backing of all advocates of communism, 
anarchy, and chaos. 
Wherever homes crumble and break the 
presence of this poison can almost always be’ 
detected. Alluring and benumbing it breeds 
restlessness, creates imaginary ills, and dulls 
the senses to real and lasting values. More 
and more parents turn from the sacred obli- 
gations and privileges of parenthood to seek _ 
a passing and shadowy satisfaction in self- 
indulgence and physical pleasure. On every 
side encouragement is offered them. The 
modern novel, the stage, the movies, scores of 
pernicious magazines, and countless disciples
-P-A-G-E-61
38 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
of this degenerate philosophy continually 
crack their coarsest jokes over the home, 
hold up to ridicule the restraint and sacti- 
fice that parenthood demands, and scoff in 
clever but profane language at those virtues 
that passing generations have held most sacred 
and dear. Because they are clever masters 
of words they have been able to conceal 
from many their utter lack of soul and their . 
complete inability to understand those higher 
spiritual values that through all human his- 
tory have lifted man to life’s upper levels, 
have inspired to noble endeavor and high 
achievement, and have spelled progress for 
the race. 
A That the American home is not function- 
ing as it should today and that its stability has 
been seriously impaired no thoughtful student 
of existing conditions can deny. The subject 
has become increasingly popular in recent 
years as a theme for private and public dis- 
cussion. Books and magazine articles with- 
out number have been written upon it. Not 
all are agreed as to the extent and effects of 
this breakdown, but the heated nature of the 
discussion itself indicates clearly enough that
-P-A-G-E-62

something is radically wrong with the home. '. 
No one person can fairly claim a compre- 
hensive knowledge of conditions that obtain 
in all classes of society or in all sections of the 
country. Local colorings are bound to vary 
and to influence judgments. Extracts from 
two letters inspired by a recently published 
magazine article reveal how far apart such 
judgments may be. A woman from a far. - 
western city writes to the editor of the maga- 
zine as follows: 
“After having read Dr. Stearns’s article on 
‘Woman’s Biggest Job’ and your comment at 
the end, I wish to give my view on the sub- 
ject. 
“T live out of , a city that seems to 
give itself first and foremost to pleasure and 
carefree living; but from observations among 
my own friends, who are married couples rais- 
ing one or more children, and my friends’ 
friends, I find that only about one in fifty 
families would come in Doctor Stearns’s class. 
“There is a greater percentage than ever 
before who have shifted the responsibility of 
their children and who do things they would 
not want their children to do, if they took  
-P-A-G-E-63
40 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
time to think about it. But they are in the- 
hopeless minority and the real backbone of 
the nation, the middle class wage earner and 
his family, are living sane and clean lives, and 
assuming the full responsibility of their chil- 
dren and the institution of the home... . 
“Personally, I think most couples are living 
decently and doing the best they can by their 
children, and the nation is in no danger of 
going to pieces because a few, with more or 
less money, see fit to burn their candle at both 
ends. And boys and girls will grow up to be 
good, sensible men and women and found 
homes of their own as they have always done 
regardless of their training. It is their innate 
natures that are strongest in the end and those 
who go to the dogs would go anyway even 
though raised in the most Christian of homes.” 
And this from a mother residing in a city 
of the Middle West. 
“I have just finished reading ‘Youth—The 
‘Woman’s Responsibility’ in your July issue— 
and I know I shall never be able to express 
my appreciation of that article in this letter. 
I am a mother with three children; two boys 
—and a little girl of six years. I belong to

the Mothers’ Club of this city. We are affili- 
ated with the Women’s Civic Federation and 
at our last meeting our delegate gave a report 
of a meeting recently held by the Federation. 
At this meeting our Juvenile Probation Officer 
addressed the assembly on just such a subject | 
as is taken up by Doctor Stearns in his article. 
Some of her revelations were astounding. 
“Since hearing that report I have just 
wished I could sit down and write a far- 
reaching article, one that would reach the 
homes and mothers of little children, an article 
that would make mothers see their responsi- 
bility and put them on their guard, so that 
when their little ones grow up to adolescent 
age they would have a good strong founda- 
tion upon which to build the future dangerous 
years of their lives. . . . 
“TI only wish that I could write. Some of 
my few little experiences might do others 
some good. But Doctor Stearns has put my 
thoughts into words in a way that I could 
not have expressed them. . . . Doctor Stearns 
surely sees the situation as it really is... .” 
From their different viewpoints both of 
these writers are, in a sense, probably right.
-P-A-G-E-65
42 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
But the viewpoints invite analysis. The 
optimism of the former is that of one who 
admits herself to be something of a fatalist; 
for if, as she contends, “boys and girls will 
grow up to be good, sensible men and women 
—as they have always done regardless of their 
training—and those who go to the dogs would 
go anyway” we might just as well fold our 
hands, forget our anxieties, and relieve our- 
selves at once of all further responsibility as 
parents. Unfortunately experience will never 
justify this happy-go-lucky trust, and those 
who pin their faith to it are sure to have a 
rude and painful awakening some day. A 
fair and impartial judgment would seem to 
be permitted the schoolmaster through whose 
students contacts are made with homes in all 
parts of the land and among all classes, rich 
and poor alike. And on this basis it would 
seem that the second writer quoted had more 
nearly sensed the truth. 
However limited or biased personal opinions 
may be, there are many facts that stare us in 
_ the face today the significance of which can- 
not be ignored and from which very definite 
conclusions must be drawn. A careful analysis
-P-A-G-E-66
HOME INFLUENCE 43 
of these facts and their true meaning gives 
us food for serious thought. 
No one can deny that the extent of crime ° 
in the United States has reached a degree that 
is truly appalling. No other nation approaches 
us in this black record. Carefully prepared 
statistics compiled by bankers, insurance com- 
panies and the most reliable agencies reveal 
conditions that are too startling to be accepted 
with the smug complacency so characteristic 
ofusasapeople. They should be relentlessly 
driven home on the consciousness of the 
American people until an awakening takes 
place and with it an earnest determination to 
know and to correct the underlying causes 
of a national disgrace. Here are a few only 
of the facts that have recently been brought 
into the light. 
The American crime bill for the past year 
is figured by careful estimate at nearly five 
billion dollars. Of this huge total no less than 
three billion dollars represent the amount of 
Property actually stolen from its rightful 
owners and by methods varying from those 
employed by the clever swindler to those of 
the thug and gunman who do not hesitate if
-P-A-G-E-67
44 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
necessary to demand as well the lives of their 
innocent victims. 
During the year 1924-25 murders in the 
United States reached the frightful figure of 
7.2 persons per 100,000 of population. Italy, 
with its so-called hasty Latin temperament, 
comes second with a record of 3.6. Ireland 
shows only 0.9, England 0.8, and Switzerland, 
the lowest, 0.2. Of less violent crimes the 
record for this country is even blacker. A 
New Yorker, for example, is thirty-six times 
more likely to be robbed than is a Londoner; 
while six times as many persons were robbed 
in New York and Chicago alone as in the 
whole of Canada. 
Bad as these figures are, their sinister sig- 
nificance becomes more clearly apparent when 
we realize that the large majority of the 
worst crimes of today are committed by youths 
—not the mature and hardened criminals of 
the past, but more often mere boys, still in 
their teens and still young enough to be prop- 
erly subject to the influence and ideals, good 
or bad, of the homes from which they come. 
Here again we are confronted with ugly facts. 
The so-called crime wave in this country
-P-A-G-E-68
HOME INFLUENCE AB 
has prompted many painstaking investigations 
and surveys the results of which tell their own 
tragic tale. An investigation covering a wide 
territory in the State of Indiana produced 
figures which have been confirmed to a re- 
markable degree by similar investigations in 
various parts of the country. What. these 
figures show is this; that during the ten-year 
period from 1913 to 1923 the average age 
of criminals had dropped six to eight years: 
that today the hardened criminal is chiefly+ ~ 
found between the ages of seventeen and 
twenty-one. A reformed gunman, speaking at 
a public gathering in New York City recently, 
made the statement that the most reckless and 
desperate criminal of today is the youth of 
seventeen. , 
We are not so likely, of course, to find 
robbers and gunmen among the representa- 
tives of the gentler sex, but that the same 
poisonous influences are at work among the 
girls can easily be shown. The following 
newspaper report of statements made by the 
president of the Florence Crittenton League 
of Compassion at a public meeting in Wash- 
ington must have startled all who read it.
-P-A-G-E-69
46 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
“Washington, December 9. Declaring that 
girls now admitted to the Florence Crittenton 
homes are of the average age of 15 years as 
compared with an average age of 28 years a 
few years ago, Mrs. Kate Waller Barrett, 
national president of that organization, de- 
clared today at a meeting of the International 
Reform Bureau that ‘the facts have almost 
forced me to the point of questioning whether 
women are better guardians of morals than 
are men. I have six little girls under 10 in 
my charge physically and morally ruined,’ she 
said. ‘I am at a loss to understand the cause 
of this alarming change unless it be a national 
loosening of the standards in our homes.” 
For the purpose of checking the accuracy 
of this report, which as printed seemed unbe- 
lievable, a letter of inquiry was written to 
an officer of this well-known organization. In 
her reply this officer quotes from a letter of 
the national president written in answer to 
the request for accurate figures. This is what 
she says: 
“T have just recently gathered some sta- 
tistics from the various Florence Crittenton 
Homes in the South and I find they are
-P-A-G-E-70
HOME INFLUENCE 47 
having a tremendous drop in age. I hardly 
think we can say the majority are below fif- 
teen, but so many are thirteen and if you 
would eliminate a few of the older ones of 
the feeble-minded type, I am certain the 
average would not be sixteen. I have just . 
returned from where the figures are as 
startling as these.” / 
Undoubtedly it will be said that while the 
above facts are probably true they relate only 
to the lowest elements in our social life, and 
that we shall not find to any appreciable 
extent in either jails or reformatories the 
representatives of families which make up 
the solid and dependable bulk of our citizen- 
ship. This is a fair criticism if based only on 
the facts submitted above. But are these the 
only facts that confront us? Very evidently 
they are not. Let us examine others of a 
more comprehensive and a more widely repre- 
sentative character. 
A city high school certainly represents in 
its student body a fair cross-section of Ameri- 
can society. If, therefore, we can determine 
the character and standards of such a group 
as a whole we cannot be accused of limiting  
-P-A-G-E-71
48 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
our field of observation: and the judgments 
- we form from such a study will be neither 
narrow nor unjust. 
Through its Committee on Character the 
New York City Board of Education has for a 
year been making a special survey of moral 
conditions in high schools. Its report recently 
published should be read and reread by every 
parent and citizen of the United States; for it 
is fair to assume that the conditions revealed 
by this investigation may be said to exist 
throughout the country, at least in our cities 
and to a greater or less degree in smaller towns 
as well. A few extracts from this report 
should serve our purpose. 
“A cosmopolitan high school,” says the com- 
mittee, “is a cross-section of the city itself, 
including every element of society, every race, 
every color, every creed. As a result, the school 
disciplinarian has to deal with almost every 
conceivable kind of crime. He must fre- 
quently call on the police for help. To main- 
tain law and order he needs the training of 
a detective; he often wishes he had a finger- 
print expert, a psychologist and a psychi- 
atrist.
-P-A-G-E-72
HOME INFLUENCE 49 
“Fortunately this element constitutes but a - 
small fractional part of our high school popu- °.. 
. lation. The rest are interesting young people 
to know and to work with, full of enthusiasm” 
and energy and responsive to leadership. It 
is true that some of them are loud, ill-man- 
nered and overconfident. Others are of the 
flapper type, with the bobbed locks and ever-._ 
ready mirror, rouge, and powder puff. But 
this is only the exterior representation of their 
environment. They are, in reality, warm- 
hearted, generous-minded boys and girls, full 
of initiative, surprisingly free from prejudices 
and remarkably loyal in their devotion to an 
ideal to which they are pledged. 
“But,” adds the committee, “the shock 
comes when we learn their code of morals. 
These same delightful young people believe 
that it is all right if they can ‘get away with 
it’? They lack respect for parents and for 
authority. To copy home-work is. entirely 
honorable if they are not caught. Forging a 
signature is a simple way of saving a lot of 
trouble. ‘Cutting’ is to be commended if they 
can ‘get by.’ Thieving is a matter of almost 
daily occurrence. Cheating is no disgrace if
-P-A-G-E-73
50 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
the offender is not detected. ‘Shooting craps’ 
is an ordinary pastime among boys. When 
called to account they are seldom sorry that _ 
they have offended, but they are extremely 
sorry they ‘got caught.’ 
“Now this characterization does not apply 
to the whole high-school student body by any 
means, but it does apply to a large percentage 
of our boys and girls. They have adopted 
the code of the street because they have never 
learned a higher code of morals.” 
Commenting on this remarkable report the 
Literary Digest has this to say: “The great 
age of jazz, then, is damned by its fruits. 
Morality, in its wider sense, is placed in the 
attic of the mind, along with the discarded 
philosophies of a primitive age, and youth 
meanders down the primrose path, careless 
of immediate perils and oblivious of the pit 
that awaits it at the other end. In the New 
York high schools we have an example as 
ominous for the future as any that has been 
brought to public attention, and, dangerous 
as the literary vice of repetition is, this survey 
of lamentable conditions in the country’s 
greatest metropolis must be listed with all
-P-A-G-E-74
    HOME INFLUENCE SE 
those others which have been dinned into our 
eats. To begin with, the authors of the report, 
who have gone about their duties with pains- .. 
taking care and the zeal of crusaders, are 
forced to admit that at present the Church, as 
a direct moral agency, touches the lives of 
only a small proportion of our youth—a 
charge too often brought—and that ‘those who 
teach in New York City know too well how 
sadly lacking is the moral influence in many 
homes today’—further evidence of the sin 
of omission committed by parents. These 
teachers know indeed that in many homes 
the parent is no longer the controlling and 
directing influence.” 
Those who believe, with a writer earlier 
quoted in this chapter, that, regardless of 
earlier training and home conditions, boys and 
girls will regularly grow up to be decent and 
law-abiding citizens and that those who go 
to the dogs, foredoomed by an unkind Provi- 
dence, would do so anyway will be little moved 
by the startling facts revealed in the report 
of the New York committee. But the report 
has already served to rouse the thoughtful and 
intelligent and to inspire comments that
-P-A-G-E-75
52. EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
should be heeded by all. Through an inter- 
esting coincidence the New York report was 
given to the public just after the Literary 
Digest had published the answers to wide- 
spread inquiries made among the prosecuting 
attorneys of many large cities for the purpose 
of securing from these well-informed experts 
opinions as to the extent and causes of youth- 
ful delinquency. The replies received from 
this valuable investigation coincide to a te- 
markable degree with the findings of the New 
York committee, and both agree in placing 
the blame primarily upon the home and pat- 
Xents. Lack of religious training is again and 
again mentioned as an underlying cause of the 
present crimes of youth. But religious train- 
ing is primarily the responsibility of the home. 
It cannot be delegated. If it is not supplied 
there whatever agencies are later employed 
will furnish, except in rare instances, only at 
best a shallow and superficial veneer. 
We shall do well to study carefully and 
grasp fully the significance of these reports of 
experts and public comments upon them. 
The District Attorney of Philadelphia 
writes: “It is everywhere agreed that .. -
-P-A-G-E-76

the young men and women from eighteen to os 
twenty-one form the overwhelming propor- ©      
tion of active criminals today... . The” 
causes for this condition are many—bad home. ; 
conditions, the break-up of good home super- - 
vision, etc.” 
And this from the State’s Attorney: of 
Baltimore: “The laxity of parents, the appar- 
ent failure of heads of households to make the 
home attractive enough to compel the juvenile 
members to consider it more than a place to 
partake their meals, sleep and change their 
clothing, and the neglect of the male parent 
to establish a feeling of comradery, brotherly 
interest, and an understanding of the anxieties 
and vicissitudes of the growing man, are in 
great measure accountable for this alarming 
and recent juvenile menace.” 
“Home earlier in the evenings, more of the 
fireside frank discussions, and closer compan- 
ionship with the family is the only salvation 
for posterity,” is the opinion expressed by the 
District Attorney of Atlanta, Georgia. 
Summing up a vast amount of newspaper 
comment on the situation nearly all of which 
is of the same tenor the Literary Digest quotes
-P-A-G-E-77
54 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
the following from the Washington Star: 
' “Tt is in the last degree disturbing to find 
such a ghastly record of criminality on the part 
of the young piling up in the news reports. 
The present tendencies in juvenile circles are 
decidedly unwholesome. Something is at’ 
fault in the present system of child-training. 
The other day the Bishop of Washington, in 
addressing the diocesan convention of the 
Episcopal Church, declared that the parents, 
of today are derelict in their duty. He is 
sustained in this assertion by plain evidence 
of a breaking down of parental authority, by 
a weakening of home associations, by failure 
of the parents themselves to set proper exam- 
ples for their children. 
“It is a far search to find the causes of this 
condition, but the fact remains that society in 
this country at least is not as sound as in 
earlier days, that youth is less stable morally, 
and that unless the parents reassume the re- 
sponsibility for the moral welfare of their off- 
spring a shocking record of juvenile crime 
threatens to grow to the point of endangering 
the foundations of society itself.” 
Here then we have extensive investigations
-P-A-G-E-78
HOME. INFLUENCE 55 
and reports covering pretty fully the whole 
range of our American social life. Yet it will 
doubtless still be claimed by some that there 
are better and more cultured groups the chil- 
dren of which will be found chiefly in private 
and endowed schools and against whom our 
indictment of the home cannot fairly be 
pressed. Again we must face facts. Wealth 
and social position may add a superficial 
refinement to human frailties, but neither 
wealth nor position can change the innate 
nature of such weaknesses nor alter their ulti- 
mate effect on character; and the heads of 
schools that deal with these boys and girls 
from the homes of the well-to-do are as deeply 
disturbed and as keenly alarmed over the 
breakdown of home standards and influences 
as are their colleagues who guide the destinies 
of our high schools. In outward appearance 
their problems may be different; at their roots 
they are the same, and in some degree even 
worse; for wealth furnishes an added incen- 
tive to loose and careless ways with those who 
cannot count on the firm and restraining 
authority of high-minded parents. 
One need not dwell on the increasing fre-
-P-A-G-E-79
56 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
quency of published reports of strange and 
unseemly behavior among the children of the 
well-to-do. Indeed when complaint is made 
of the breakdown of the home of the present 
day the majority of critics are disposed to 
argue that this is true only of the homes of 
the wealthy. This is perhaps natural, even 
if unfair, because of the wider publicity regu- 
larly given to the homes and persons of this 
type. And yet, and just because they are more 
in the public eye, an added responsibility rests 
upon those of wealth and position to guard 
their actions with more than usual care. This 
they are not doing today. The utter and 
unpatriotic lawlessness of so many of the 
older generation, blessed with wealth and 
social standing, is one of the strange anomalies 
of the time. It is so frequently in the public 
eye, so flagrant and so blatant, as to lead one 
to wonder whether, after all, there may not 
be some truth in the saying of the ancients 
that “Whom the gods would destroy they first 
make mad.” Unfortunately it is innocent 
children who are the chief and tragic sufferers 
from the influence of such parental surrender.

That parents are the last persons in the world 
       
to be entrusted with the physical well-being

The selfish desire for pleasure, excitement, .

BOARDING SCHOOLS 
§1 : 
Dogs the modern boy daily increase in favor 
with God while he lives at boarding schéol? 
When he graduates is he a God-believing, God- 
fearing citizen of the kingdom of heaven on 
earth? Has the process of being educated, 
along with its manifold mental and physical 
blessings, done something indelibly beautiful 
to his soul? 
These may seem high-flying queries. They 
may sound too ambitious to be interjected’ 
into the trivial round and common task of 
going to school. The reader may fear, in 
seemly Anglo-Saxon reticence, that we are 
about to “talk religion.” Precisely. Let him 
beware, and if he feels that religion is not 
an integral part of education, let him retire. 
For we believe that it is normal to speak of 
religion as a happy. and expected part of 
education. It is not queer, or forced. We 
are not speaking of orchids in a garden of

cucumbers; nor trying to import something 
emotional into the commonplace. There is 
nothing commonplace about education any- 
way. Every phase of it is instinct with per- 
manency. Whoever cares for and knows 
about youth will agree that the second decade 
is in all directions a romance. You do not have 
to stir things up—they are always astir. You 
do not have to carry in religion—it is there. 
Boys are mystics: schools are bound to feel 
the pains and dreams of the spirit. You will 
not have half sensed the education of the 
modern boy unless you recognize him as a 
natural disciple of spiritual things; nor will 
you have grasped what schooling is until you 
realize that a school is a state of mind, 4 
sector of actual vivid life, in which religion 
is a wholly normal influence and-force. The 
school years are intensely sensitive years, 
aglow with religion or God-consciousness. We 
have a right then to investigate the schools, 
on behalf of our sons, and ask: What are you 
schools and schoolmasters doing to help my 
boy become a citizen of the kingdom of God? 
Not only what is, but what should be, shall 
be our theme. The future is as important as
-P-A-G-E-84

the present and as sacred as the past. All 
of us who are concerned with education, as 
parents or friends or teachers, should plan 
grandly for tomorrow, rebuilding failure or 
ineffectiveness into fruitage. In this discus- 
sion, therefore, there is contemplated no | 
reverent assent or sad capitulation to things 
as they are. Possibly religion in boarding 
schools may be beyond criticism, but probably’ 
it is defective and weak. We shall survey the 
religious influence of boarding schools with the 
avowed purpose of reform. How can schools 
improve in technique or in spirit, in order the 
better, the far better to serve the boys of our 
land? 
The religious life of our schools does not 
flourish. Too often it has been tolerated, 
patronized, used for prestige, or neglected. 
Why do school managements become ‘less 
religious than the adolescents they seek to 
lead? Where has a school chapel borne fruit 
an hundredfold? Where in its kind is the 
school chapel as enthusiastically used as the 
football field? Where do teachers regard 
Sunday’s praise as conscientiously as Mon- 
day’s stint? In what school, of all the charm-

62 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
ing or imposing foundations that dot our coun- 
try, is God central? Where is God daily 
exalted as the source of every blessing by 
pupils and teachers? The far opposite which 
we are used to is so common that we regard 
such a goal as chimerical. It is abandoned, 
and schools settle down to the cult of manly 
morals, calling that religion, which of course it 
is not; and go about their business of lessons 
and sports and all the activities that buzz on 
the heels of the curricula, without God in the 
school. 
A magnificent thought surely, the opposite 
would be—God in schools. Let that, and 
nothing smaller, be our theme. God and His 
children in a school dedicated to His glory 
and their gain—what could be as natural or 
as glowing with interest? Always that is our 
radiant central thought—God and the boy. If 
in these pages we review what schools do 
and should not do about chapel services, Bible 
lessons and missionary endeavor we dryly 
seem to be far from God, let it be remem- 
bered that in education Nikil longe Deo. In 
all problems concerning youth nothing is far 
from or to God. It is not the school charter
-P-A-G-E-86
  RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE. 63. 
or the pious past that makes a school religious, |: 
nor even the frequency of services or the talk 
about the Great Reality, but rather an atmos- 
pheric conviction that God is our centre. That _ 
school is religious which clusters its activities 
gladly about the fact that God is here; not in 
chapel only, nor at bedside prayer only, but 
in the Latin class, on the playing field, at the 
debate; present always in noble work or at 
gay play, ready to nourish and solace the 
pilgrim. It is this conscious centralization of 
all our activities around God that converts a 
school. It may not be named after a saint, it 
may not even be affiliated with a church, but 
if in it God be glorified and all living is cen- 
tralized in Him, that school is set towards its — 
main objective. 
For the first object of education is to know 
that God is, and the first privilege of a school 
is to teach that God is Father. The fear of 
the Lord is the beginning of schooling. This 
does not minimize the importance of all the 
other parts of school life. The parson must 
not snub and dub the other teachers as secu- 
lar, No: Christian development is all-round. 
‘Che holy man is the whole man.” Jesus

64 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
increased in four directions, but His educa- 
tion pivoted on God-consciousness,) Schools 
are ever confronted by a real problem, a per- 
manent clash of interests; nor can they solve 
it by pampering the sacred and curtailing the 
so-called secular. Rather should they break 
down any wall of partition, and let a natural 
divine influence flood over the whole life of 
the whole boy. When the bush blazed with 
divine glory, it was not consumed. A bush 
it remained, but a bush glorified. When “the 
conscious water saw its God and blushed” it 
did not evaporate, but it became richer. To 
become religious a school need perhaps not 
change one dot or tittle of its schedule; but 
it must change its spirit, and its direction. 
Alas! how we fail, the schoolmaster well 
may exclaim. With all the storied windows and 
dim religious light and ardent altruism exhort- 
ing boys to be good, how many fine boys go 
through school fancy free of the love of God! 
What a permanent loss to the boy himself; 
and how both church and country lose a cru- 
sader! No matter whose toes we tread on, 
let us assess general or particular defects with 
a reforming will. But at the outset it is

chastening, lonesomely to sit down in the 
presence of failure, and cast a bit of ashes. 
upon our unworthy heads. 
“Til e’en lie down and bleed awhile 
And then rise up to fight some more!” 
Consider this story. “What,” an inquiring 
friend asks the graduate of one of our most 
popular church schools, with a beautiful 
carved altar and a very long waiting list, 
“what did you get, religiously, from your five 
years at School?” The youth reflects. 
Grave and gay memories cross his honest 
face. “Well,” he declares, “I think the up- 
shot of it all was, the religion I learned at 
school was zever to let anybody get my 
goat.”* So our boy with five years of daily 
chapel summed his religion gleaned there as 
the determination to be calm and suffer fools 
gladly. Surely there isn’t much Jerusalem the 
Golden or Rock of Ages in that/ Had that 
boy ever climbed the slopes of Calvary or 
*It should here be explained to the sheltered few 
who know not slang that the expression “get one’s 
goat” means to cause one to be deeply annoyed; to 
create in another a resentment of inner disturbance; 
to knock one, in short, off one’s mental pins.

felt beneath him the Everlasting Arms? 
Apparently he had lived without God in the 
school, 
A lovely sight is a boarding school on Sun- 
day morning. An amazingly decorous, charm- 
ing, unworldly scene, with that pathos too 
that always clings to young things, making 
them still more beautiful. Let us suppose that 
one of those strange beings known as “a man 
of the world” has dropped down to visit his 
nephew for Sunday. He finds himself in a 
new undreamed-of realm. Is it Paradise? No 
dirt, but clean greenery: no noise, but gen- 
tlemanly decorum, and later hymns! no swear- 
ing or smoking, but fresh-faced, well dressed 
boys quick to say “Yes sir, yessir!” and laugh- 
ingly content with the best of all possible 
worlds. Then comes chapel, when the next 
generation pours in. Our visitor is thrilled, 
and softened. His satirical eyes are damp, 
he blows his nose, and thinks of his mother. 
“Bless my soul,” he sighs, “this place is d—n 
near perfect.” He revels in the clean, keen 
scene. There is a sermon—none of your 
theological stuff, mind you, but good rock- 
bottom sense, telling those young chaps that
-P-A-G-E-90
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 67 
the future is before them (and that’s true, 
you know!) and that society expects them to 
carry on and make good and play the game. 
Then comes the anthem! What heavenly 
melody! Are those rows of youngsters real 
boys or are they angels brought down just 
for matins and evensong? And the tall men, 
the basses, behind, they must be very fine 
men, if not angels exactly, they sing so deep! 
Well, it’s all grand; and whoever supposed 
there was such a place; and if a boy isn’t 
good and happy here, where will he be? and 
if he doesn’t learn his responsibilities here, 
where will he, eh? 
Let our visitor depart in peace. He is not 
wholly wrong. Nay, superficially, he is wholly 
tight. It is a glorious opportunity to be happy 
and good. It is a clean, melodious process. 
The significant point is that the school has 
these boys for most of each year for the forma- 
tive years. Was there ever a chance quite like 
it—for leading, for molding, for edifying? A 
celestial voice says to the school, “All things 
are yours,” but does the school seize the 
opportunity, or like the placid dreamer in 
Emerson’s “Days” “take a few herbs and
-P-A-G-E-91
68 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
apples,” letting “bread, kingdom, stars and 
sky that holds them all” go by? There 
could not be fancied a field more promising 
than these boarding school years, for incul- 
cating whatsoever things are true, pure, lovely, 
and of good report. Often and often these 
indelible nobilities are inculcated. Let that 
be heartily insisted on, and believed. Boys 
are converted and upbuilt at school. Many 
do come weak in faith and go happy, staunch 
believers; many come weak of moral fibre and 
. leave splendid specimens of physical and moral 
excellence. The spiritual and moral fruitage 
of the boarding school is in certain cases strik- 
ing, but it is queried whether the distinctively 
religious influence of these schools is nearly 
as great as it should be or can be. 
Religion means the practice of the presence 
of God. The Christian religion means com- 
munion with and grace from God through 
Jesus Christ, who is believed to be a real 
and living being. The problem and the 
duty is to bring up our youth to enjoy 
religion, to depend on God, to live and move 
and have conscious being as children of 
God. This is the most natural way to live in
-P-A-G-E-92
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 69 
this spiritual world. Boys are mystics; boys 
are religious; youth expects to be religious. 
Why then do so many boys either lose their 
religious impulse, or fail to find one, in our 
schools? May it not be because schools are 
conformists, having set up as their ideal what 
the world, and the parental world in particu- 
lar, wants? They have done a good job in 
attaining what they have aimed at; but they 
have aimed low. Schools will continue to 
fail as religious influences so long as they are 
worldly, and are afraid of opinion, and don’t 
dare to trust youth for high emprise. Youth 
is religious. But schools have been cold and 
formal. They must themselves be converted. 
They must centralize all around God. 
We shall now look the whole field over, 
facing facts and appreciating undoubted dif- 
ficulties — commending, condemning, recon- 
structing. Much that follows may have no 
appeal to those with only a general interest in 
schools or in religious education. They will 
do well to skip all sections now until the last, 
on page 101. The reader who is concerned 
with varied aspects of scholastic: engineering
-P-A-G-E-93

may be helped by what follows. For clear- 
ness, our survey will be divided under the 
following heads: 
(i) The second decade or the age of 
adolescence; (ii) Sunday in schools; (iii) 
Great personal influences in a boy’s life; (iv) 
A boy’s education in the Bible and the church; 
(v) Altruistic agencies in schools; (vi) What 
is it all about? 
The Second Decade. This program sounds 
rather long and dreary; but we shall hint at 
and often not exhaust the themes or the 
reader. We begin, then, by reverently scru- 
tinizing the nature of a boy of school age. 
Without knowing what kind of a boy a boy 
is, or what is the disposition of boyhood dur- 
ing boyhood, how can elders hope to bring 
any influences, religious or no, to bear upon 
them? All who have seen the play “Seven- 
teen” will recall the puzzles of this awkward 
age, the years of the second decade. Who- 
ever can put himself back to fourteen and 
candidly review himself for four years will 
know the merriment, the abundant resilient 
life, the dreams, the self-consciousness, the 
torturing reproaches, the ambitions, the fan-
-P-A-G-E-94
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 71 
cies, the loves, “the fightings and fears within, 
without” of those momentous days. Shake- 
speare in his seven ages gives the second 
decade two, the whining schoolboy creeping 
like snail unwillingly to school (a reluctance 
which progressive day schools on the one hand 
and wholesome boarding schools on the other 
have nearly abolished) and the lover, sighing 
like furnace. The poet condenses the second 
half of the second decade into one word, lover. 
If we can include love of sport, love of clean 
solitariness, love of dreaming, that word will 
do. It will do, also, if lover means an emo- 
tional being, sensitive, secretive, hoping and 
daring all things. The elder friend must know 
that, though the schoolboy is a lover of noble 
things, he is a reticent lover. It was always 
so, and always will be. Do not expect a boy 
to rhapsodize about the church, and if he 
does, suspect him! The giants of old began 
as reticent boys. Joseph, Samuel and David 
were all quiet lads. The boy may talk to his 
fellows, or quite rationally talk out a sub- 
ject to himself or commune with God on a 
country walk, but he will not often or volun- 
tarily begin the subject with a parent or
-P-A-G-E-95
72 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
teacher. It is as well so. We should not often 
intrude behind the barriers of youth’s re- 
ticence. 
Youth is the age of faith. The God-aware- 
ness is natural then. At about fourteen many 
boys want, find themselves wanting to “join 
the church,” to be confirmed. This is a simple 
step, and should be taken before those years 
of gloom, struggle and hesitation which come 
later on, and soon enough. If, moreover, we 
believe in grace, the privilege of communion 
will help the boy at the very period when he 
needs strength, when he craves idealistic bal- 
ances at a time of physical readjustment and 
mental ferment. “Joining the church” is of 
immense import, never to be thought of as 
an act of conformity or an evidence of school 
spirit. It means the dedication of the boy to 
his Lord. It is not a routine matter. When 
we speak of it as natural, we mean that this 
move upward is divinely planned and should 
not be thwarted by our human conventions. 
Youth is also an age of doubt. Many boys 
keep their simple childhood faith, but more 
lose it than complacent elders imagine. “We 
are all atheists here,” said a stalwart sixth-
-P-A-G-E-96
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE - 73 
former to a visitor at an English school.* Of 
course this was not so, but when boys congre- 
gate alone the exaggerated queries of one will 
set many a timid listener on the road to 
nowhere. It is a sorry experience, full of 
pain, but by many regarded in retrospect as 
a strengthening. How shall this not uncom- 
mon state of a boy’s mind be met? By sym- 
pathy, of course; and by expert handling. 
Not every older person can cope constructively 
with “honest doubt.” Humane clergymen are 
needed in every school, men who are not in a 
hurry, who can spend an evening before the. 
fire, who see as much usefulness in conferring 
with one as in exhorting the ninety and nine. 
The loss of faith is often temporary, due 
to a mental tangle, to the supposed obligation 
of believing all things with equal intensity. 
Simplification is heaven’s law. The great must 
be parted from the incidental and then we 
must bear witness to the great. Doubt is not 
resolved by negation. To tell a boy that 
after all almost everything is uncertain is not

-P-A-G-E-97
74 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
a constructive way to heal his trouble. It is 
like the perfectly successful operation under 
which the patient dies. We can urge a drastic 
simplification with these words: Let all faiths 
go but three. The first fundamental is that 
God, a personal loving Creator, exists. Can 
you hold to that? Then secondly the natural 
act of such a God is to show Himself in a 
Person whose word is God’s word, a Heavenly 
Leader here on earth. We have such in Jesus 
Christ. And last, as to ourselves and our 
destiny, let us credibly maintain that we are 
not creatures like the midge or the ox, but 
immortal spirits, destined for growth in a 
realm of timeless progress and personal com- 
munion. With some such definite doctrine as 
that (it must be definite, for youth) a boy’s 
doubts can be met, and finally helped. 
The submission to agnosticism by men in 
places of influence bodes ill for youth passing 
through (and it can be a passage through) 
this valley of shadows. A thin vagueness, a 
kindly tolerance, a deference to a Great Per- 
haps is chaff to hungry souls. The doubter 
needs bread, not stones; the nourishing nitro- 
gen of fish, not the secretion of scorpions, If
-P-A-G-E-98
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 75 
a schoolteacher is unable to provide this bread 
and fish he should sadly say so to his superior, 
but not blazon his doubts afar. The popular 
master, the redoubtable boy-leader who blat- 
antly shows his lack of religion is not a good 
builder in a school where faith and doubt are 
boutid to be permanently built into a boy’s 
religious belief. 
Religion is not practicable without creed. In 
helping youth, the adventure of creedal faith 
is essential: Youth craves creed, and is not 
intellectually competent to live by nuance or 
vaguely spiritualized interpretations. Doubt 
must be met and faith fed by definiteness; by 
a simple statement of what the Christian 
church has held from the beginning. The 
Apostles’ Creed is none too binding or definite 
for youth, and though leaders should have 
great sympathy with those who cannot in part 
accept it, the kindest guidance consists not in 
explaining it away, or reversing the miracle 
of Cana, or declaring that after all a good 
life, manly morals and a spirit of service are 
more important than what we believe. This 
mischievous and shallow notion should be cast 
out of all school chapels. It accounts for much
-P-A-G-E-99
76 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
of the failure of religious influence, the very 
field under discussion. To water religion down 
to humanitarianism is an insult to the children 
of God. In the world of the spirit, God is 
surely as grave a matter as man. If we tum 
ourselves and our brethren into gods, dwell- 
ing on our own needs and our own precious. 
development, the soul’s pilgrimage will lose its 
validity and its destination. “The kind of 
gospel which consists in weekly exhortations 
to behave like Christian gentlemen is power- 
less to attain the very object which it seeks. 
Christian practice has its roots in the Chris- 
tian verity, understood, believed, revered, and 
‘Kept in mind. We do not ask for formal 
lessons in Christian dogmatics, which are apt 
_ to be repellent to many; but we ask that 
sermons and instructions of every kind should 
awaken or reénforce the belief in a living 
and ever-present God.” So long as God- 
consciousness is anything but central in - 
boarding school religion, religion there will 
be thin and transitory. The only cure for 
godlessness is God;/the only nourishment, 
the only healing balm Tor the ups and downs

~ schools have been afraid of theology, and have 
made a god of morality. We must get back 
our perspective, our proportion, and yes, our 
sense of humor. Goodness is but one attri- 
bute of perfection—the others are beauty and 
truth. The good man is not the end of cre- 
ation. The good man communing with God 
is. So long as we neglect God in our schools 
there will be no true religion there. Let 
schools cease their tiresome and often need- 
less exhortation, “Be good, be good;” and let 
jaded elders smooched with the world’s coarse 
thumb heed the cry of youth: My soul is 
athirst for God, yea even for the living God. 
When shall I come to appear before the pres- 
ence of God? 
§ 2 
Sunday in Schools. Sunday, the day of rest 
and of religion, is the most necessary day of 
the week in boarding schools. Group life 
seems to run smoothest by routine, ali the 
members doing the same thing all together, 
and at the same time. We must contemplate 
with chagrin the inevitable cramping of cer-
-P-A-G-E-101
78 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
tain individualities by the synchronous and 
standardized methods of our schools. These 
masculine communities think that they have 
reached a sacred perfection, but they have 
oot their losses in individuality are large. 
“Boarding schools are the death of culture.” 
This group existence blesses more than it 
hurts, though forever it jeers at or suspects 
the non-team type of mind. The relief of 
such mob-tyranny comes on Sunday,‘a day 
which would have to be created, did: it not 
on valid basis already exist. 
‘he two major functions of this oasis- 
day are rest and religion, resting one’s soul 
and praising God. Work on Sunday is an 
economic blunder, and schools that permit or 
encourage it greatly err. We are built, the . 
world is, on the principle of {Sabbatical re- 
habilitation. The first day of the week should 
not be commercialized. If teachers would 
use Monday for unprepared recitations, if 
they could teach and cause pupils not to be 
parrots but thinkers and enjoyers, Sunday 
would be freed from the menace of secular 
routine. He who studies on Sunday knows 
not the peculiar freshness of attacking work

on Monday. All work on Sunday should be’ 
abolished from schools and for schools, 
Public worship centers in the chapel. In- 
creasingly, boarding schools have chapels of 
their own, though some employ and enjoy the 
wholesome contacts of a parish church, which 
normalizes religion and prevents any special 
presentation of the Gospel for boys, an 
attempt to be rightly avoided. School chapels, 
often beautiful, always beauteous with a 
hushed virile reality, are sources both of 
strength and sentimentality, of power and 
weakness. They tend to become shrines, or 
points of pilgrimage, perhaps nullifying wor- 
ship otherwhere. “I love chapel at school,” 
a boy asserts, “but I somehow don’t like 
church at home. They don’t have our hymns, 
and it’s all queer and different.” Being at 
school for most of his formative years, he 
makes the chapel his religious center, and 
becomes an alien in his father’s pew—if his 
father has a pew. The solution lies not in 
slacking the chapel’s appeal, but in proving 
that religion is all of a piece, that the need 
of it increases as life proceeds, and that the 
Prescription which we found of value in the
-P-A-G-E-103
80 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
chapel of youth, the man can have con- 
pounded, perhaps as a stranger, in any church 
of his persuasion, anywhere. We must fight 
this Goto“entricity, this sentimental stained- 
glass favorite-hymn type of religion which so 
dominates our church schools, The chapel at 
school should be integrated with the church 
at home. The day after a boy is confirmed 
at school (and there is much to be said in 
favor of his “joining the church” while at 
home) he should be transferred, and he should 
realize that his name has been formally placed 
on the books of the parish where he will per- 
manently reside, until removal causes another 
transfer. Schools should not produce nomadic 
disciples, but trained soldier-disciples with 
specific obligations. 
Surely the school chapel is a touching sight, 
an emotional scene, full of potency. Here, 
though not too often, visiting preachers will 
speak. They will bring a fresh impetus to the 
general Christian progress. The preaching 
usually should be of home production, fatherly 
and consecutive instructions by the head- 
master, or by clergy on the faculty. Boys 
should not become sermon-tasters, nor expect
-P-A-G-E-104
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 81 
week after week a brilliant expert to challenge 
their attention. Startling special sermons are 
in the mass of low nutritive value. Quiet, 
conservative instruction may not be what is 
wanted, but what certainly is needed. Boys 
crave reality touched with valid emotion. 
They resent being preached at or down to, 
but respond like thirsty growing plants to 
the water of life. That college president who 
warned the visiting preacher that “no soul 
is saved here after twenty minutes” was ner- 
vously silly. And faithless, too. For strength 
is not inversely allied to length. There. are 
short sermons that from the text on are arid; 
there are long ones where length is forgotten. 
Too much has been sacrificed to brevity. 
Visitors are, be it noted, apt to preach longer 
than the home pastor, and are necessarily 
devoid of consecrativeness. The boy at school 
should find in his chapel life nourishment, 
instruction, and daily strength for his daily 
need, not stirring appeals, embodiment of 
which the conditions of his life prevent. Bet- 
ter the homely homilies of pastors than the 
glitter of wandering stars. 
School chapels usually are beautiful. They
-P-A-G-E-105
82. EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
should be. Beauty is an attribute of God; 
and Nature, though no ritualist, sanctions not 
only decency and order but appeals to the 
heart via the senses. A moving and melo- 
dious loveliness should enshrine the Sacred 
Presence. At once the boy should sense his 
school chapel as a place of prayer, of dedi- 
cation, of spirited adventure. Here will be 
objects of beauty or use in happy memory 
of the departed and of the present, gay flowers 
upon altar or in window embrasure, the mel- 
low flicker of candles, perchance the incense 
cloud going up like prayers, and chords of 
noble music. With the Christian seasons the 
emotions of the chapel will vary. . For variety 
is the spice of worship. And it seems far 
easier of attainment in liturgical than in freer 
churches. It is a fact that historic liturgies 
can embody and achieve a wider variation 
than the untrained attempts of ministers intent 
on compacting fifty-nine minutes, nor more, 
with Scripture, prayer, hymns and sermon. 
Protestant services specifically for boys’ 
schools are dull. The boy on Sunday morning 
should not dread the drag of the predictable 
but feel the impulse that comes from expec-
-P-A-G-E-106
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 83 
tancy. Shall we have a litany, the Gospel 
read from the sanctuary, or morning prayer 
with readings from Old and New Testament? 
Attention is quickened by uncertainty. 
Compulsory chapel, abandoned or going out 
in colleges, will continue in schools. It is an 
integral part of the whole, and a boarding. 
school is a life, a state of mind offered to all 
and shared by all. Chapel attendance in the 
younger scene is not branded as compulsory 
~—it is a matter of course. Oh! wondrous 
docility of youth, how comfortable to elders, 
how overworked by elders on behalf of youth! 
Though chapel attendance be required of all, 
may not a relief from conformity be con- 
trived, and may it not forestall the catastro- 
phes of complete liberty later on? A lock- 
step in religion means revolt and neglect when 
the drill is done. If a voluntary element 
could be introduced into Sunday’s routine, 
would not Sunday become yet more, and in 
itself, a blessed safety-valve for a week fer- 
menting with too much and too much alto- 
gether? Could the boy, being trained as an 
independent disciple, be given the chance to 
choose when he shall worship? Would this
-P-A-G-E-107
84 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
disrupt routine? When tried, the voluntary 
or choice principle has produced results both 
bad and good—now a spirit of bargain, often 
a sense of freedom in the spirit. School 
authorities must endure the pains which 
always accompany growth; the crudities which 
go with freedom; the possible evil that snaps 
at the heels of the good. If our schools are 
to fit boys for life, a Christian, God-fearing, 
church-loving life, shall not the chapel phase 
admit of flexibility? Schools are not set to 
develop orchids in a hothouse, soon to be 
ejected into the common day of thaws and 
frosts, but to accustom young plants to sur- 
vive, yes to flourish, through all sorts of 
weather. 
The school chapel is used every day—it is 
no front parlor for Sunday’s dress-up. It is 
a natural place, a much used sacred center 
for the activities of prayer and aspiration. 
It is a power-house. On Sundays members of 
the school will be specially busied there. A 
reverent familiarity marks their duties. For 
boys will serve here, not leaving all ministra- 
tions to clerics whose mysterious business it 
is to propitiate the Deity. Boys can have
-P-A-G-E-108
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 85 
such queer or superstitious notions about a 
church or its usages that the more obviously 
natural its purposes are, the better. If God 
be in the school, let Him be naturally served 
and worshipped by His children who come 
into His courts with praise. Special and 
honorable duties will be taken by members 
of the school, who will try to be worthy of 
them. A large group will sing; others will 
serve in the sanctuary; others will take the 
collection, arrange the hymn boards, usher 
strangers in; and once a week an older boy . 
will be selected for the honor of reading the 
Scripture. Thus used to help in the school 
chapel, the youth of the land may transfer a 
will to serve and support to the church at 
home. 
Sunday must be a natural day, as the chapel 
is a natural place—both expressing the joyous 
naturalness of being with God in this His — 
world. His Sabbath must not be a dreaded 
day, nor a day of repression, but a glad free 
day, the best day of the week—and best not. 
because of liberty to do nothing or to follow 
our whim, but best because the impulse to 
lift up the heart finds opportunity, and the

and fed. 
§ 3 
Personal influences. Potent and indelible 
are the influences which in the second decade 
mold themselves into a boy’s life. Personal 
contacts before we are twenty help to form 
. our convictions about God and church and 
conduct. Consider, then, the religious influ- 
ence on a boy of (a) the school itself; (b) the 
teachers; (c) his friends and the school lead- 
ers; and (d) his home surroundings. 
The school is a state of mind, with a vary- 
ing atmosphere—a stamp now for good, now 
for ill. The school’s corporate and unspoken 
influence is perhaps the greatest power of all. 
If every day the school exalts God as its 
center, something will be silently happening 
in the heart of every scholar. To feel this 
pressure a boy should be with it and within 
it all the time. Residence is residence, as the 
staunch proverb puts it. How then can a 
school exercise a cumulative religious influ- 
ence if week-end leave is granted? Happily 
this bait to high marks and good conduct is
-P-A-G-E-110
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 8) 
being abandoned. To consider the school as 
a place merely for lessons and sport, to be . 
scuttled away from on Friday and returned 
to overfed and overspent on Sunday night, 
is to forfeit any real influence on the boy’s 
total convictions. 
Masters are, whether they will or no, of 
great argument in boys’ lives. Let them pon- 
der over Emerson’s “Little thistles in the 
field.” That they are useful in class, library 
and athletics is obvious—that they are, one 
way or another, of power in religion they not 
_ always vividly realize. How deeply can the 
teacher help the bewildered, often doubting, 
sometimés scoffing youth! The teacher who 
loves God, and who wills to grow in Christian 
stature, will carry by the very force of his 
example many disciples along with him. How 
vast can be the power of such men! Do they 
realize the scope and tremendous import of 
their mission? How their lives, which to them 
may seem drab and dusty with routine, can 
glisten. For “they that be wise shall shine as 
the firmament, and they that turn many to 
righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.” 
A complaint comes from many quarters,
-P-A-G-E-111
88 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
from England, too, the mother of boarding 
schools, that masters in such schools are non- 
religious, or are as Christian leaders ineffec- 
tive. This is true, and needlessly so. Most 
of these men are convinced, practicing dis- 
ciples of our Lord, yet timid in bearing wit- 
ness to Him. They seem to follow that 
wicked fallacy that preaching is the priest’s 
_ affair, and that to talk about one’s religion 
is unvirile. They should the rather rise up 
to their opportunities. Next door a boy is 
battling with problems of the first magnitude, 
fighting temptation, being beaten by it, 
wrangling fatuously over “fundamentalism,” 
writing verses, dreaming big dreams. Will 
not such laymen rise up to be true pastors? 
Will they persist in merging with the crowd, 
mature in years but not in head or heart, 
drifting supervisors, heeding the talk about 
baseball, pugilists and endless shallow, petty 
school gossip? Such men might be captains of 
venturous companies or saviours of wounded 
~ comrades. Some are, many are not. Who 
would . 
“Like Cato, give his little senate laws 
And sit attentive to his own applause.”
-P-A-G-E-112
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 89 
who would be a mere supercargo, when he 
might be a seer and a guide? 
A boy’s boy friends are religious influences. 
Roommates often make, and sometimes mar, 
one another. Rooming together can be a 
nutritive blessing, or a blight. Generally, the 
intense juxtaposition of unrelated beings is-of 
doubtful value. The single room is the spirit’s 
castle, and some solitude is essential to inde- 
pendence of mind. The leading boys in a 
school nowadays are usually prominent ath- 
letes, though there are exceptions and these 
may happily increase. If the leaders are 
modest and themselves independent, their 
admirers can breathe the air of individuality. 
“Many boys have had silly affectation 
knocked out of them at school, but more 
have had their individuality completely 
crushed. For the schoolboy it is proficiency 
in athletics, and not charity, which covereth 
a multitude of sins.” Most boys who become ‘ 
leaders are cast in an heroic mold. They do 
not lead their many unsuspected followers 
astray. They are usually of noble character 
—true disciples of Christ. And here is a - 
powerful asset for religion, a sacramental fact,
-P-A-G-E-113
90 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
the leading of boys by boys, which should be 
neither overworked nor neglected. 
The strongest religious influence on a boy, 
because the earliest and nearest, is his home. 
He may think that his big hero at school 
meant more to him in conduct and in creed, 
but deeper down than that is the spoken or 
_ unexpressed example of his parents. It is 
not our purpose here to follow the fashion of 
condemning parents. What is the good of 
locating blame? We are to build on what we 
find—and if one find stubble, to substitute 
solid stone. Being a parent is not simple, nor 
is it a sinecure. Doctrinaire bachelor uncles 
and visiting visionary aunts are the only ones 
who could run a perfect home. It is not easy 
to bring up children—it is a baffling thing, a 
continuous performance of problems and emer- 
gencies, as regards mind and body, let alone 
soul. There lies the point—the modern re- 
quirements for mind and body are so taxing 
that the soul és let alone. Parents are not so 
much irreligious as they are obsessed by the 
pressing dominations of teachers and doctors. 
Parents crave for their children the best 
in all things, and in a vague way the best of
-P-A-G-E-114
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 91 
all things. The church school often finds 
parents devoutly concerned for their boys’ 
spiritual welfare. It is also true that in some 
cases the ideals of the school, the chapel life 
and Bible study, find no response of sympathy . 
in the home. What a pathetic clash there’ 
must be, what confusion in the boy’s mind! 
At school he is or should be taught to center 
his learning and living about God; he is told 
that communion with God is the joy of life, 
service its method, veracity and nobility its 
very pulse; while at home the church is not 
used, morality not discussed. This division 
of loyalties can be a heartrending problem to 
a boy, who suffers therefrom more than elders 
ever know. 
§ 4 
Religious Education. There is a fairly | 
general ignorance among young people re- 
garding the Christian religion and the Bible. 
On admitting a boy at the age of fourteen, 
the school should assume that his knowledge 
of the Bible, in particular, is slight. It is 
useless, and a bit too sorrowful, to cite 
stories which show not only misinformation 
but blank ignorance about the Scriptures.
-P-A-G-E-115
92 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
Our problem is not to fix blame, or to scold 
parents, but to ask what provision do the 
schools, which seek to be all things to all 
boys, make to rear their pupils in the nurture 
and admonition of the Lord. What does the 
boarding school do to further personal re- 
ligion, belief in a creed, and a keen appre- 
ciation of the Bible? What is the system, if 
there be a system? Surely the opportunity is 
ideal. However unlearned when he comes, the 
boy should emerge from school an enlightened 
practicing Christian. / 
Religious education in our boarding schools, 
varying of course with the intensity of indi- 
vidual teachers or promoters, seems on the 
‘whole ineffective. Vague as a system, the 
results have been haphazard. Probably this 
is due to apathy or inexpertness. Less 
formal attention has been spent upon it, less 
enthusiastic faculty backing has been given 
to it, than other departments either of study 
or of sport. There is a poverty and weak- 
ness of good textbooks in religious education 
suitable for secondary schools. It is hard to 
teach young people without the aid of a first- 
class book. Every schoolmaster dreams of
-P-A-G-E-116
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 93 
the time when “Bible” or “sacred studies” or 
“teligious education” will come into its own in 
schools. One hears the cry: “If only we had 
the right books!” or “If only it could be taught 
with enthusiasm and dignity, and be believed 
in as a real subject!” What, let us ask, is 
done, and what should be done? 
The custom of daily chapel or religious exer- 
cise for the entire school provides, some main- 
tain, a familiarity with religion which thereby 
makes instruction in it less pressing. This 
is half true. Our impressions must be revised 
by instructions. Listening to Scripture, if 
one does listen, or joining in a responsive read- 
ing will not familiarize one with the Bible 
as a great library of personal religious experi- 
ence any more than one can construct a prac- 
ticable creed from bits of favorite hymns. The 
practices of religion, familiarity with the 
bonds which tie us to God, have to be taught, 
line upon line, as mathematics or history has 
to be taught. Very well—if that be agreed 
to, taught how often, on what basis, and by 
whom? : 
Regular classes of religious education 
should never come on Sundays, but in the
-P-A-G-E-117
94 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
working week, and at least once a week. In 
certain years of a course, presently to be out- 
lined, two classes a week will be needed. 
Bible lessons scheduled on Monday will help 
Sunday and themselves, by a free suitable day 
for preparation. Though on a par with other 
subjects, it need not come as often as they 
do. Though the subject is of vast importance 
it should not be commercialized by being made 
a college entrance examination affair. If 
Sunday services be nutritive, they will prove 
in their kind as potent as classroom drill, and 
thus the subject will be sufficiently in the 
fore. Spirited and loyal interest is needed 
more than the fictitious aids of marks and 
promotions to make the beautiful seem worth 
while. Yet to jack up laggards and eluders, 
the classes in religious education must be on 
the basis, as to rewards and penalties, of other 
courses. The teachers of this course need not 
be clergymen, but they must know their 
ground. Shoddy instruction is nowhere so 
permanently dangerous as in religion. A 
man’s creed may be forever warped,’ his 
earthly pilgrimage set askew by one wrongly 
taught lesson in Sunday-school or Bible class.
-P-A-G-E-118
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 95 
It isan immensely sensitive area. The faculty. 
can help the department of religious educa- . 
tion by buttressing it, dealing fairly by it, and 
by never allowing it to be scoffed at. 
What shall our boys ‘be taught in this 
religious instruction? Three things always. 
1. A learning and re-learning of the life and 
words of Jesus Christ. 2. A knowledge of the 
church, its present duty and scope, and how to 
be a happy member of the same. 3. A famili- 
arity with the Old Testament, and general 
Bible content. These are the principal 
themes, with the life and teaching of Jesus 
Christ as the greatest subject in the school, . 
always and everywhere. Some colleges will 
not grant a degree unless the senior can 
swim a hundred yards; the school might make 
one condition for its diploma: the ability to 
recite the Sermon on the Mount. Though 
courses in church history, ethics, modern mis- 
sions, and apologetics or comparative religions 
for older boys may well be used, the knowl- 
edge of the words and works of Christ and the 
privileges of membership in the Christian 
church are the great messages for the growing 
boy. In a four-year school course the life of
-P-A-G-E-119
96 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
our Lord should be twice taught, v7z.: Ist 
year, A Simple Life of Christ; 2d year, Cate- 
chism, Creed, Church Membership; 3d year, 
The Old Testament, by Characters; 4th year, 
The Life of Christ, by Studying the New Tes- 
tament. In a six-year course, the following 
plan is feasible, viz.: 1st year, The Life of 
Christ; 2d year, Catechism, etc.; 3d year, 
Old Testament Stories and Heroes; 4th year, 
Discussion on Christian Ethics. 5th year, The 
Life of Christ, with Reading on the Gospels; 
6th year, Apologetics, or Church History. 
Some one will say, on reading these sug- 
gestions: “I do not like it at all! It is too 
stiff, and churchy; it is too creedal; too defi- 
nite; there is no general atmosphere of free 
discipleship in it.” That may be so, but we 
have contended throughout for definiteness 
and for the necessity of creed, and for the 
inevitableness of doctrine in a boy’s life, which 
if it be not planted there as a true and guarded 
possession will grow there weed-like, fed by 
misinformation and prejudice. The “aver- 
age man,” the man in the street, is a conserva- 
tive, with a leaning towards narrowness and 
bigotry. The average man is uninstructed in
-P-A-G-E-120
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 97 
_ teligion. It is light that our growing genera- 
tion needs—light and definiteness and doctrine. 
The purpose of religious education is to con- 
vince the scholar of the validity of the reli- 
gious emotion, that God is real and the human 
soul is real, and that the longing to be with 
God is the most natural and valid desire of 
the human heart. Religious education in 
schools sets out to teach the fact that Jesus 
Christ is a Person, not just a Principle; that 
He is a present effective Master and Saviour; 
that the human pilgrim to bear a man’s part 
in the world’s work will commune with that 
Master in His church; that we must love 
as brethren, being pitiful and courteous; that 
God is all, our Father and our listening, loving 
Friend, who will never forsake His children, 
but stands waiting to hear the disciple say: 
Here am I, use me, lead me, send me, where 
Thou wilt, when Thou wilt, as Thou wilt. 
§ 5 
Altruistic Agencies. Youth is a time of fer- 
ment, of conviction, of judgment, often harsh 
and wrong, but a time of black-or-white con- 
viction. “It is true or false”; “he is a gentle-
-P-A-G-E-121
98 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
man or a bounder”; “that is right or wrong.” 
There is no haze about duty in youth—it is 
a clear-cut thing to do, or to neglect, but if 
neglected duty no less. What of good the 
heart prompts the hand itches to accomplish. 
Therefore the vital school will offer scope for 
these emotions in charitable societies, mis- 
sionary groups, and varied philanthropic clubs. 
The nascent believer and ardent young dis- 
ciple must have a channel for his altruism, for 
nothing is more nauseous than emotion with- 
out expression—the mere “Iuxury of cheap 
melancholy.” Following every call to high 
emprise comes an and therefore, which must 
be given a wholesome outlet. Schools should 
not stir up boys to do without letting them do, 
by bearing burdens and by giving up money 
or luxuries for the sake of others. All schools 
have societies, then, devoted to human wel- 
fare. These are windows out towards the 
great needy world of which the school is a 
part. For moral or social provincialism is no 
glory in a school, which is a state of mind, a 
pulsating period in the one life a boy has to 
live. A school must know itself to be, and 
proclaim itself as, a working part of the real
-P-A-G-E-122
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 99°. 
world—not a sheltered backwater, a protected 
paradise, but an armory where young soldiers 
and servants of righteousness are buckling on 
their swords. 
These societies of boys banded together for : 
outside usefulness should be truly popular, as 
easy of entrance as the athletic association. 
The missionary society or the Christian Asso- 
ciation in school, to be effective and to stay 
wholesome, should be just as large as an 
active membership will let it be. All boys 
who want to belong should belong, yet their 
membership should be a personal choice, not 
a school fiat. The petty ways of limiting 
membership can never taint God’s church or 
its agencies. Let all who want to, young or 
old, belong, and come and listen and give. 
The youngster, dropping in some Sunday eve- 
ning, and hearing a talk on the Sailors’ Haven, 
the schools of China, or medical work among 
the Esquimaux may get a world-view, a heart- 
blow that will make a man of him. ‘The sec- 
ond decade is an heroic age, keen to pay hom- 
age to whatever things are lovely and of good 
Teport. The best of boys are always ready to 
head or abet needy causes. They are not
-P-A-G-E-123
100 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
cautious or calculating or nicely balanced like 
their elders. The harder the cause, the 
greater seems its appeal. Youth will never be 
won to noble life because of a primrose path. 
Thus, in schools, lost causes and projects in- 
volving sacrifice win readiest support, because 
somehow they seem most like the experience 
of Jesus Christ. The school that would be a 
life and would offer to boys a real experience 
to grow in and to please God by, with all its 
duties and pleasures and services, can never 
neglect these philanthropic outlets for the 
generous hearts and willing hands of boys. 
There is one direction where these altruisms 
begun in school can be carried further to 
advantage. The Christian ministry, the hap- 
piest and neediest of callings, in every church 
must be increased. Not heedlessly multiplied, 
surely, by admitting the men of low and sur- 
face intellect, but by persuading the best 
graduates from school and college that selling 
bonds is in their case not as compelling or 
satisfying as serving the brotherhood. A 
quick and easy preparation of half-educated 
ministers, produced so readily at Bible col- 
leges, will not help the religious life of the
-P-A-G-E-124
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 101 
country. An illiterate ministry, however will- 
ing, is not a solution of the churches’ needs. 
Qut from our schools and colleges, as a glori- 
ous fruitage of their religious influence, might 
there not go, shall there not go, an increasing 
number of the best, the ablest in mind, body 
and estate, who will dedicate themselves to 
the ministry, showing by that act that the 
natural result of education is belief in God, 
and that the more educated a man is so much 
the more he wills to serve both God and man? 
§ 6 
What, then, is it all about? The boarding 
school undertakes a stupendous program— 
to be for the best part of every year of the 
most formative years teacher, parents and 
pastor to every boy within its charge. The 
Alma Mater with a very large family has 
heaviest responsibilities! If, as some one has 
said, parenthood requires all of the virtues 
and most of the talents, the parenthood 
assumed by the boarding school would seem a 
burden too heavy to be borne. And indeed 
it would be, if man were obliged to generate
-P-A-G-E-125
102 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
power to meet his duties or his dreams. No 
school, no institution or no person can by and 
of himself or itself win the battle of life, or 
cope with its emergencies. To interpret life 
as a self-supporting, enclosed sphere is to pro- 
pose a foregone tragedy. The lesson which 
the boarding school must learn for its own 
solution is the lesson most pressingly needed 
by its children, viz.: that we are not self- 
supporting, that we never have or never can 
generate power to live an acceptable, a suc- 
cessful life. Religion is the practice of the 
presence of God, and the religious life is the 
life which copes with duty by reason of power 
from God. That is the lesson for schools to 
learn and live by, and for scholars to Jearn and 
live by. 
The religious pressure on the boy by his 
school experience should be, it seems fair to 
claim, threefold. (a) The Christian life is 
Communion with God, (b) It is God’s will 
to give us power to live aright. (c) It is 
therefore possible here and now, in circum- 
stances obscure or prominent, simple or com- 
plex, for each boy and man to be and do 
right. This pilgrimage has validity. It is not
-P-A-G-E-126
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 103 
an experiment arranged by a trifler, but an 
experience designed by a loving Father for the 
bringing up of His children. Here and now, © 
in school, in the office, in college, in the home, 
in the uttermost parts of the earth the hand 
of God upholds His child. We can each of 
us be right and do right, here and now. Let 
us therefore in conclusion dwell for 4 moment 
on the three propositions which might be the 
bases of the religious influence of all our 
schools upon all our boys. 
(a) Religion is communion with God. This 
is no fancy, but a fact to be experienced. The 
lover sees his beloved in every event and 
object of the common day. Every flower 
speaks of her; every problem has her as its 
center and its solvent. Yet the absent beloved 
is a present reality. It is so with the soul’s 
pilgrimage, the boy’s growing concept of God. 
The facts of every day can group themselves 
around the thought of God. God becomes 
central to us when we group all our plans and 
thoughts, and acts about Him. “What will 
God think of it,”; “Will my Father 
approve?”’; “Is it best, in God’s sight?” these 
are the natural queries that flood into the mind
-P-A-G-E-127
104. EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
which is communing with God. It can become 
second nature, as we say, to refer to God all 
our thoughts, words and deeds. Nor is this a 
counsel of perfection, but a practicable habit 
of mind. It is the duty of the school to bring 
the pilgrim soul into such an intimacy with 
its Father. It can be done. 
(b) And one of its resultants will be the 
inflow of power. All the schools have been 
telling all the boys to lift themselves by their 
own boot straps. The school has been crying 
almost with petulance, “Be good, be good— 
make good. It’s up to you to make good.” 
But such a command has no divine sanction. 
uch a work is impossible. It is a cruel com- 
mand. The school cannot make good by 
itself, nor can the boy. “My grace is sufficient 
for thee,” is the message of hope which comes 
to all schools and scholars who have quite 
properly undertaken more than they can do 
alone. We are only truly living when we have 
undertaken too much. Too much, that is, to 
cope with alone. It is the belief in grace, in 
power from God, which schools need for their 
Own corporate progress, and as the healing 
message for their boys. To shout “Be good,
-P-A-G-E-128
RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 105 
be good,” is a mockery. But to teach that to 
fulfil our daily task or to conquer our foe God 
will give us power, is to teach the blessed — 
truth. The young American trying to be a 
Christian, trying to “make good,” needs most 
of all to know that God stands ever ready to 
nourish, to support, to guide. His grace is 
sufficient for our need, and nothing else is. 
(c) The schools must all assure their 
scholars as a ruddy religious reality that life 
can be a-success. Life is not only real, and 
earnest—the one chance, perhaps, we have to 
prove ourselves before God—but (here lies 
the point) life can be lived acceptably. Away 
with the morbid notion that life is a dream, 
or worse still a tragedy or a farce. It is the 
high function of the school to shatter these 
delusions, and to implant in each soul a sane 
sense of reality. To say: “Of course your 
life is hard, and it will be; of course you will 
be disappointed and be bowed with burdens; 
of course you will be near to fainting and 
giving up. But be of good cheer, life is 
infused with the conquering grace of God. 
There is more grace than hate or death or 
failure, far more. Those who fight with you
-P-A-G-E-129
106 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
are mightier than those against you. Strive 
on, you too can overcome the world.” 
A voice says to the school: Here are my 
children. Show them all things that are noble 
and of good report. Teach them to grow in 
wisdom and in stature, in favor with men and 
in love for me. My Grace is sufficient for thee, 
and for them. Let them fear not, but be of 
good cheer. Let them do my will in my world. 
Certainly I will be with them. 
And it is in the strength of that promise 
that a school dares to take up again its high 
and heavy opportunity.

ACADEMIC INFLUENCE 
In considering the influence of the private 
school we shall not attempt to weigh the 
values of the respective contributions of the 
public and private school to education in this 
country. Each does in its own way the work 
assigned to it. They belong together in a 
partnership of high service. This is not 
always understood, but it is the view of many 
of those who are especially responsible for 
these institutions. In the Headmasters’ Asso- 
ciation, an organization of the principals of 
public and private schools from a large sec- 
tion of the country, there is found the 
most complete understanding and sympathy. 
Never is there a suggestion of superiority on 
the part of the representative of either 
system. 
A father who was offered a place for his 
son at a private school some years ago replied, 
“No, I shall send my boy to a public school. 
The private school is out of the stream of 
tendency.” Today we recognize that the 
107
-P-A-G-E-131
108 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
private school is a permanent part of our 
educational system, and that it carries on its 
task under its own peculiar conditions. 
It is especially the academic influence of the 
private boarding school, and semi-boarding 
school, known as the country day school, that 
we wish to consider here. So long as people 
dwell in great cities where the atmosphere, 
physical and moral, is in large measure un- 
wholesome, at least for young people, so long 
the boarding schools will continue to minister 
to the children of those who can afford to 
send them out of the towns. The present 
crowded conditions of these schools and their 
growth in number during the last quarter cen- 
tury suggest that they are regarded as mem- 
bers in good standing of the body politic. 
Some day they may be taken over by the State 
and form part of the system of public edu- 
cation. Until that time they have something - 
to provide which is different from the products 
of the public school just as the endowed col- ° 
lege supplies something other than that which 
comes from the State university. 
The private day school, it is true, labors 
under certain disadvantages. Its pupils have
-P-A-G-E-132
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE 109 
in many instances begun their studies late. 
The custom of their parents is to return late 
to their city homes, still hoping that at the 
primary school their boys can, by some kind 
of “juggling,” be taught a year’s work in a 
little over seven months’ time. They easily 
consent to the child’s remaining at home if 
there is any slight indisposition. The result 
is that boys often reach the secondary school 
without having had any thorough training, and 
at twelve years of age are void of all power of 
concentration. The early preparatory schools 
cannot be held to blame for this. They have, 
many of them, high ideals of education, but 
they are sorely let and hindered by indulgent 
parents who are more interested in the health 
than in the intellectual development of their 
children. , 
Another handicap is found in the fact that 
nearly all, from seventy-five to one hundred 
per cent, of the pupils in the private schools, 
are destined for college and must therefore 
be brought up to a certain standard. On 
this account, we may point out in passing, 
it seems unfair to compare the public and 
private schools in the preparation of their
-P-A-G-E-133
110 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
boys for college. From the public high 
school comes a small percentage of its grad- 
uates. They are the pupils of the highest 
caliber and are the fittest of the scholars pro- 
moted from the grade schools. It is clearly 
comparing unlike things when we place these 
scholars alongside the entire output of the 
graduates from the private school. 
The private school has the further dis- 
advantage that its boys, as a rule, are not 
impelled by financial necessity or by the 
thought that their scholastic record will have 
a definite effect in helping or hindering them 
after graduation. We may add to this the 
fact that funds are often lacking to secure for 
the private school the fitting and attractive 
buildings and the complete equipment avail- 
able for schools that can draw upon the taxes 
of the community. 
On the other hand, the private schools are 
free from the interference of the politician 
whose influence can be secured for the appoint- 
ment of teachers and for the fashioning of 
the curriculum. They have the advantage of 
commanding the services of men teachers 
alone. There are indeed many women who
-P-A-G-E-134
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE it 
are altogether efficient instructors—some cer- 
tainly superior to the men, but it is the belief 
of many parents that their sons during the 
period of adolescence, beginning at twelve or 
thirteen and continuing until eighteen years 
of age, should be under the direction and influ- 
ence of the male mind and personality and 
they act accordingly. The boarding schools 
having their pupils with them all the time, 
morning, noon and night, the masters can — 
determine to a great extent the amount of 
work that shall be accomplished daily and the 
hours that shall be devoted to it. The masters 
are not burdened by the great number of’ 
pupils that are assigned in the public school to 
each teacher and therefore come naturally 
more closely into touch with their pupils’ 
minds. If the pupils be found unequal to the 
course of the private school and fall much 
below the required standard or show any 
serious lack of mental power, it is not neces- 
sary that they should be retained. They can 
_ be transferred to some school which cares 
especially for this type of youth. 
Further, the private school has the privilege 
—denied inevitably to the public school—of
-P-A-G-E-135
112, EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
giving instruction in the theory of Religion. It 
is not true, as one often hears it said, that the 
public schools are wholly irreligious. Con- 
scientious and spiritually minded teachers in 
these schools bring to their classrooms an 
atmosphere which influences the child’s reli- 
gious life profoundly; but there can be no 
fearless teaching of the history and _phi- 
losophy of the Christian religion, no in- 
struction in the influence of Christianity on 
human institutions, no definite exposition of 
the teachings and life of Jesus Christ. These 
can be given by the Sunday-school and some- 
times they are so given, but it is not an 
uncommon thing for boys to reach the uni- 
versity without any knowledge of the prin- 
ciples of their religion. 
The curriculum of the private school is 
naturally largely governed by the college 
requirements, inasmuch as a large majority 
of its students are destined for the university. 
This is counted a misfortune by some teach- 
ers; but the subjects in which a candidate 
may be examined today are sufficiently nu- 
merous to admit of almost any course in the 
school.
-P-A-G-E-136
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE 113 
The private boarding schools for the most 
part retain what is known as the “classical 
course.” This does not mean that the classics 
take up the greater part of a student’s time, 
but simply that they are a regular part of the 
education that the school supplies. Latin is 
included in all the classes. Greek is ‘begun 
later and, while not compulsory, is recom- 
mended to all who have shown aptitude for 
language and literature. 
It is on this question of the study of the 
classics that the private schools have gen- 
erally taken a positive stand. They are free, 
these schools, to disregard, in some measure at 
least, what is known as a “practical educa- 
tion.” , 
The theory of secondary education which 
they advocate has been thus expressed: “The 
purpose of education is not so much to pre- 
pare children for their occupations as to pre- 
pare them against their occupations. It must 
develop in them the powers and interests that 
will make them in later life the masters and 
not slaves of their work.” Towards the 
attainment of this purpose the study of the 
classics makes an important contribution.
-P-A-G-E-137
114. EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
The objection is often raised to the classics 
that they do not interest the pupil, and on 
the theory that interest shall be the deciding 
factor and that subjects not attractive “per 
se” to the individual youth shall be largely 
abolished, the classics might consistently be 
dropped out. 
To the plea that there is no evident use for 
the “average man” derived from the study of 
the classics, Senator Lodge replied in an 
address delivered at a conference on Classical 
Studies in Liberal Education: “Repeatedly 
have I been told that there was no use in 
teaching the classics to boys in school or col- 
lege because the ‘average man’ never used 
them or recurred to them in after life. One 
feels inclined to say, ‘All the worse for the 
average man,’ and to feel sorry for his loss 
of so much that is elevating and delightful. 
But admitting the truth of the objection, how 
much real force is there in it when one applies 
the comparative test? How large a part do 
mathematics and science in various forms play 
in the daily life and current interests of the 
‘average man’? How many ‘average men’ 
amuse their leisure by solving algebraic prob-
-P-A-G-E-138
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE us 
Jems, or by trying to conceive the fourth 
dimension; how many can explain to you—I 
take an obvious illustration—the Mendelian 
theory of the dominant and recessive quali- 
ties, or the Linnzan system or tell you of 
the movements and appearances of the fauna 
of Europe during the glacial periods and inter- 
vals, or even name to you all the great con- 
stellations of stars which look down upon them 
nightly in silent splendor? My occupations 
have brought me into contact with very many 
‘average’ men and also with men above and 
below the average, and far more have referred 
to the history and literature of Greece and 
Rome than to any of the well-known scien- 
tific subjects to which I have at random 
alluded. The fact is that not to know who 
Mendel was or what the fossils show as to 
animal life is not necessarily esteemed a mark 
of ignorance, but never to have heard of Socra- 
tes or Pericles, of Hannibal or Cesar, or Cicero 
is held to indicate a very defective education 
to say the least. And yet no one would think 
of arguing that boys should not be made 
acquainted with the simpler forms of mathe- 
matics and geometry because in after years
-P-A-G-E-139
116 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
the ‘average man’ as a rule finds little 
use and less pleasure from them in daily 
life.” 
Or, as another puts it, “What we can re- 
member is worth much, but what we had to 
nourish our mind in school and college counts 
for far more. It is like food. Who, unless 
he was on a fixed diet, remembers what he 
ate a week ago? Yet the effects continue. 
And it is the nature of our diet in youth, as 
all know, which does much to determine our 
health in manhood.” 
Dr. Andrew F. West, Dean of the Graduate 
School of Princeton University, has collected 
in a volume entitled “Value of the Classics” 
the opinions of a multitude of men of all pro- 
fessions and callings upon the subject of the 
study of the Humanities. He has thereby 
rendered a great service to the cause of edu- 
cation in the United States. It is from this 
book that the author has selected certain quo- 
tations in order to spread further the views of 
thoughtful men of various professions who 
have had large experience in the world. They 
are an indication of the real “use” of the 
classics in after life—not so much from the
-P-A-G-E-140
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE 117 
point of view of money making as of quality 
of service which a well trained man should 
offer. 
“It is not merely the obvious need of study 
of Latin,” writes Dean Roscoe Pound, of the 
Harvard Law School, “in order to understand 
law Latin, and the Latin maxims and phrases 
of which the books are full, that leads teach- 
ers of law to insist upon the importance of 
classical training. It is the lawyer’s everyday 
business not only to reason soundly but to 
express his ideas clearly and accurately; to 
make what he has put on paper so clear and so 
definite as to convey his precise meaning to 
disputants ‘fired with zeal to pervert’ and thus 
to forestall controversy. . . . There is no 
better way for the student to train himself 
in the choice of the very word that will fit his 
thought than by translation from Latin and 
Greek. Thus he develops habits of analysis, 
habits of discriminating choice of words, 
habits of accurate apprehension of the mean- 
ing which another has sought to convey by 
written words, which lead to power of expres- 
sion and to power of clear thinking. Such 
habits are worth more to the lawyer than all
-P-A-G-E-141
118. EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
the information which a modern school may 
hope to impart.” 
Dr. L. F. Barker, Professor of Clinical 
Medicine at Johns Hopkins, tells us that “at 
present some of us in medicine feel that edu- 
cation is in danger of becoming illiberal in the 
other direction, first, because schools are grow- 
ing remiss about humanistic rather than about 
physical subjects and, secondly, because of 
the tendency in the colleges to displace liberal 
by vocational education. A protest seems due 
against the unwise subordination, in the cur- 
riculum of liberal studies, of language, lit- 
erature, history and philosophy. If these 
subjects, which are fully as important for the 
welfare of individuals and nations as are the 
physical sciences, were to be neglected, all 
human progress would be endangered, and 
medicine as well as other sciences would 
suffer.” 
' Thomas Hastings, a prominent architect 
of New York, echoes the same thought. “To . 
know Greek and Latin,” he says, “is, I believe, 
as much an essential part of a literary educa- 
tion as a true understanding of the classic 
orders is the beginning of all architectural
-P-A-G-E-142
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE 119 
schooling. These are the foundations upon 
which the artists in literature and architec- 
ture alike build their superstructure. These 
fundamental first principles in education culti- 
vate and stimulate the true sense of beauty: 
and refinement while they impress upon the 
mind of the student an accurate appreciation 
of those most subtle laws of proportion which, 
though intuitively learned, are none the less 
true and to be relied upon as a part of our 
education.” 
“Were I the emergency autocrat of this 
[English] language,” declares Edward P. 
Mitchell, editor of one of the great New 
York daily papers, “I should proclaim in 
drastic regulations and enforce by severe 
penalties the American duty of adherence to 
the old habits of speech, the old scrupulous 
respect for the finer shades of meaning, the 
old rigid observance of the moralities of word 
relations: and this I believe can be done only 
by maintaining the classical culture at high 
Potency. For the ‘guy’ or ‘gink’ who is ‘wise 
to what we want,’ in his dismal attempt to 
put ‘punch’ into the vernacular is punching 
the intelligence out of it: and he promises,
-P-A-G-E-143
120 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
unless deterred, to leave the precious fabric 
as full of holes as a colander and as void of 
working efficiency as a last month’s commuta- 
tion ticket.” 
Contained also in this volume we find as 
advocates of the classical studies President 
Woodrow Wilson who wrote, “What you can- 
not find a substitute for, is the classics as 
literature; and there can be no first hand con- 
tact with that literature if you will not master 
the grammar and the syntax which convey its 
subtle power.” 
Ex-President Roosevelt, speaking in favor 
of these studies, declared, “Nothing makes a 
man more interesting to himself or to others 
than that wide knowledge of men and life, 
that wide knowledge of the globe and of man’s 
past and present on the globe, which is given 
by a liberal or cultural education in which the 
study of classical literature is an essential 
element.” 
The author has quoted at some length from 
outstanding members of various professions 
because it is frequently alleged that the clas- 
sics are chiefly advocated by theorists among 
schoolmasters and in spite of views of prac-
-P-A-G-E-144
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE 121. 
tical men who have been successful in the 
world. 
It was in order to prevent the spread of the 
“utilitarian” or “vocational” theory of educa- 
tion which has been at times so vehemently 
urged that fifty professors of Cornell Univer- 
sity published this statement: “We the under- 
signed professors (or one time professors) of 
Cornell University should prefer as students 
of our respective subjects those who have in- 
cluded both Greek and Latin among their 
preparatory studies rather than those who 
have neglected those studies in favor of our 
own respective subjects.” This statement is 
signed by professors of mathematics, mechani- 
cal engineering, civil engineering, electrical 
engineering, economics, botany, zodlogy and 
other sciences and branches of learning. 
It is sometimes argued that good transla- 
tions will afford all that one can gain from the 
study of classical literature. This, Dr. Henry 
van Dyke believes unsound. “There is some- 
thing,” he says, “in an Ode of Horace read in 
the original, which is never found in the trans- 
lation, however good it may be. The sweep 
of the Virgilian line and of the Virgilian
-P-A-G-E-145
122, EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY ~ 
thought may be imitated in English, but it 
cannot really be reproduced. To read even a 
little of the classics in the original tongues 
makes an effect upon the mind, which, 
although it may be forgotten, is in my opinion 
hardly ever lost.” 
Often one hears criticisms of the teaching 
of the classics. And no doubt there is good 
ground for it. But this applies equally to 
instruction in other subjects. 
Statistics of the results of College Entrance 
Examinations, which are only a rough method 
of appraising the instruction it is true, give 
some idea of the effectiveness of teaching in 
various studies. 
The following is a portion of the report 
of Prof. C. H. Forbes of candidates in seven- 
teen departments who failed to secure sixty

Examinations for 1916: Per cent of

It is a fact, recognized by all teachers, that 
there is need of more skilful and more enthu- 
siastic teaching of all subjects. Great progress 
has been made in this direction during the last 
ten years. The progress is found in classical 
instruction as well as that of other depart- 
ments. The classical studies are taught in a 
broader and more human way. “Throughout 
the course,” as one has urged and the advice 
has been already taken at least in part, 
“opportunities should be seized of indicating 
the historical and literary significance of the 
works read—their relation to great events in 
the history of mankind and the great products 
of modern literature.” 
Emphasis has been laid upon these human- © 
istic studies, not only on account of the charac- 
teristics which the writers we have quoted find 
in them, not only because they impart vigor 
of intellect which we need today, but also
-P-A-G-E-147
124 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
because private schools are considered, al- 
though there may be no sufficient ground for 
it, the chief strongholds of these subjects and 
it is well that we should give reasons for the 
faith that is in us. In doing so we believe we 
are doing something for the secondary edu- 
cation provided by these schools throughout 
the land. 
The curriculum, however, is not given over 
to these studies. Including Latin and Greek 
as they do, the private schools in their courses 
attempt to give a generous preparation for 
life. They follow in a general way the lines 
laid down by Matthew Arnold in his theory 
of a liberal education. Foreseeing a further 
development of the struggle between realists 
and humanists than had occurred in his time, 
he urged a combination of both aspects: “The 
ideal of a general, liberal training is to carry 
us to a knowledge of ourselves and the world. 
We are called to this knowledge by special 
aptitudes which are born with us; the grand 
thing in teaching is to have faith that some 
aptitudes of this kind every one has, This 
one’s special aptitudes are for knowing men— 
the study of the Humanities, that one’s special
-P-A-G-E-148
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE “125 
aptitudes are for knowing the world and the 
study of nature. The circle comprehends _ 
both, and we should all have some notion, at 
any rate, of the whole circle of knowledge. 
The rejection of the Humanities by the real- 
ists, the rejection of the study of nature by 
the humanists, are alike ignorant. He whose 
aptitudes carry him to the study of nature 
should have some notion of the Humanities). 
he whose aptitudes carry him to the Humani- 
ties should have some notion of the phenomena 
and laws of nature. . . . The prime and 
direct aim of instruction is to enable a man 
to know himself and the world. Such knowl- 
edge is the only sure basis for action, and this 
basis is the true aim and office of instruction 
to supply. To know himself, a man must 
know the capabilities and performances of the 
human spirit; and the value of the Human- 
ities, the science of antiquity, is that it affords 
for this purpose an unsurpassed source of 
light and stimulus. . . . It is a vital and 
formative knowledge to know the most power- 
ful manifestations of the human spirit’s ac- 
tivity, for the knowledge of them greatly 
feeds and quickens our own activity; and they
-P-A-G-E-149
126 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
are very imperfectly known without knowing 
ancient Greece and Rome. But it is also a 
vital and formative knowledge to know the 
world, the laws which govern nature and man 
as a part of nature. This the realists have 
perceived, and the truth of this perception, 
too, is inexpugnable.” 
In sympathy with this sane view of educa- 
tion the curriculum is a comprehensive one. 
There are included in it not only the tradi- 
tional subjects: mathematics, classics, science, 
history, modern languages—one finds there 
also music, drawing, manual training. These 
appear in the course as either integral parts of 
it or as electives—they are pursued also out of 
school hours by those who have peculiar tal- 
ent for them. 
There is provided also some instruction in 
hygiene and physical training. It is hardly 
stretching a point to include among academic 
influences athletics, when they are pursued in 
a rational fashion and not merely with a view 
to success in interscholastic matches. The 
great games of football and baseball today, 
and rowing also, require a grasp of the 
theories and a promptness of decision which
-P-A-G-E-150
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE 127° 
are often effective in awakening the powers 
of a dormant intellect. 
When we have placed the aim and theories 
of our plan in the most favorable light we 
must in all frankness acknowledge that we 
fall sadly short in our performances. ‘The 
European boys,” writes an American lad of 
thirteen, “are way ahead of us. I have been 
corresponding with a French boy and he asked — 
me in his last letter whether in America we 
had made any great progress in our view of 
international relations.” It is a fact, much 
as we regret being obliged to confess it, that 
the English schoolboy is one or two years 
ahead of ours and that in the upper classes 
of the English public schools they do work 
in classics, and in science as well, that is on a 
level with that of our Sophomore and Junior 
classes at college. 
It is not that the American boy is less 
capable than the youth of Europe or England; 
there are serious defects in the home and 
academic influences. 
If they are to increase in learning ard intel- 
lectual power our boys must begin their real 
education earlier. By twelve years of age a
-P-A-G-E-151
128 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
boy should have a sound foundation in the 
elements of English, arithmetic, history and 
geography and some knowledge of French or 
Latin, preferably the latter. They should 
also have acquired the power of concentrated 
attention and know what it is to work hard. 
Much can be done in the home, by starting 
at an earlier age, by keeping the boys regu- 
larly at school, as we have suggested, and 
also by laying emphasis upon the importance 
of the highest possible attainment in their 
education. 
“TI do not expect my boy to become a 
scholar”’—this is one of the familiar utterances 
of parents—“but I hope he will get through.” 
One never hears the suggestion, “I do not 
expect my boy to be really strong and healthy; 
but I hope he may be well enough to keep out 
of the infirmary.” The success of the boy in 
athletics or in getting a place in so-called 
“extra curriculum activities” is frequently 
counted as important as his attaining a high 
average in his studies. A similar spirit is 
found at the university. Social prominence, 
popularity in college and equally, today, in 
general society, carrying on the college papers
-P-A-G-E-152
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE 129 
and management of teams are on a level with 
outstanding performance in studies. A few 
years ago a professor at one of our universi- 
ties declared that athletics were to the mind 
of the college student almost the only real 
thing in college. Clubs are eagerly sought but 
little interest is shown in qualifying for Phi 
Beta Kappa, which is the noblest of them all. 
The schools have allowed themselves to be 
influenced by college and the outside world. . 
It is for them also to seek a change of heart 
and become more faithful and more enthusi- 
astic in preparing their pupils to meet and 
perform the duties of life. In this new world _

more than ever before by men of able and 
well trained minds. 
It is clear that a finer kind of influence can 
be exerted by the private schools. They have 
not yet taken advantage of the great oppor- 
tunities which are offered to them. There 
must be other developments than those which 
we have emphasized in the curriculum. New 
and better methods of presenting all the sub- 
jects must be discovered. Herein lies for the 
private school a chance for service. Experi-

ments are possible which cannot be made in 
our great public school system. Already there 
has been great advance in the teaching of 
English and history. Learning by rote from 
the text book has been abandoned. It is the 
custom now for even the youngest boys to 
turn to books of reference for the broader 
” study of topics assigned to them. They learn 
very early in the course to collect data and 
compare and draw inferences from them. 
Knowledge of science comes from experiments 
made by the pupil himself in the laboratory. 
The whole theory of the presentation of 
mathematics has been changed. Arithmetic, 
algebra and geometry are taught, not as sepa- 
rate subjects but as parts of one branch of 
human knowledge. Classics are treated in a 
freer fashion. The “Hale” method of reading 
at sight has been adopted in some schools. 
Many are using the “Dalton” and the “pro- 
ject” methods, or making experiments with 
some of the principles underlying them. 
There is a constant moving of the waters.

of teachers and to make their. work more 
interesting to themselves and to their pupils. 
The chief advance in secondary education 
will be made not simply by changes in meth- 
ods, however admirable, but still more by im- 
provement in the personnel of the teaching 
staff. We have already remarked that the 
. teachers in these private schools are men. A 
weakness in the past half century has been 
that they often took up the work with a view 
to earning enough to support them in prep- 
aration for some other profession—law,. or 
medicine, or the ministry. The natural result 
was that the calling of the schoolmaster lost 
the high regard in which it was held in our 
early history. Almost anybody with a fair 
education could prepare boys to pass college 
examinations, and the result was that the 
schools became simply places for getting boys 
into college and the teacher’s object was to 
apply the process. “Preparatory” schools they 
allowed themselves to be called instead of 
secondary schools, which aimed at giving a 
thorough training in the second stage of edu- 
cation, from which the graduates might natu-— 
tally proceed to college, if they desired to do
-P-A-G-E-155
132, EDUCATION OF THE MODERN Boy 
so, taking the examinations in their stride. 
And the teachers were interested tradesmen, 
not members of a great profession. 
With the growth of boarding schools it 
has become more generally understood that 
the secondary school has the key to the mak- 
ing of the man in his intellectual life as well 
as in his moral and spiritual life. 
The school now is beginning to count as 
never before. An Englishman, when asked 
where he was educated, will reply “at Eton” or 
“at Harrow” or “at Clifton” or at some other 
public school and will add, if he be a univer- 
sity man, and “at Oxford,” or “at Cambridge.” 
With us the custom of regarding the board- 
ing school as the chief contributor to a boy’s 
education is growing steadily. With this ten- 
dency there has been an increase in respect 
for the calling of the schoolmaster; the greater 
regard is manifested by the desire that there 
shall be offered a higher rate of remuneration. 
And so in many of our schools there have 
been established endowment funds the object 
of which is to increase masters’ salaries. No 
longer are we satisfied with sojourners in the 
land. They must be permanent citizens.
-P-A-G-E-156

They must be given means for the support. of 
themselves and their families in sufficient com- 
fort during the working time, and, as their 
powers diminish, there must be pensions avail- 
able for the later years. The two things 
working together — the appreciation of the 
dominant influence of the schoolmaster, and 
the realization that he must have adequate 
pecuniary support, are doing something 
towards enhancing regard for the vocation of 
the secondary teacher. 
Young men choosing their life work are 
turning to these schools in greater numbers. 
I believe I am correct in stating that of the 
graduating class of Harvard University this 
year (1925) a larger number are headed for 
teaching than for the law. With this encour- 
aging turn we may insist upon a higher stan- 
dard of excellence in those who shall give 
themselves to the work. In the English public 
schools none but scholars of high standing 
need apply for masterships. Many of them 
have been also fellows of their colleges. They 
find in the instruction they are required to 
give at the schools a sufficient stimulus for 
their intellectual life. The headmaster of
-P-A-G-E-157
134 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
Winchester School, England, told me that he 
was resigning his office at sixty years of age 
because it was impossible for him to adminis- 
ter the school and at the same time keep up 
with all the new discoveries and advances in 
scholarship which must be the equipment of 
one teaching the upper form as the head- 
master is required to do. With the high 
record in learning that will be required, we 
shall also ask for some training in the science 
and art of education in order that the master 
may have a knowledge of “the technique of 
teaching and of the way young minds work.” 
All this, or much of it, is coming to pass in 
these days. There never was a better outlook 
for this phase of our education. 
The outcome that we look for is a supply 
of two classes which have been comparatively 
rare among us. The one is the “all round” 
man—an athlete of skill and power and a 
man interested and instructed in the things 
of the mind. Such men are unusual in Amer- 
ica. Our athletes, generally speaking, are not 
scholars and our scholars are not athletes. 
Men now have to choose between sport and 
study if they would represent their college in
-P-A-G-E-158
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE 135 
games. So great an amount of time is re- 
quired in order to reach the professional 
standard established for games that men have 
little chance to do their work, and the man 
who is interested in his studies must satisfy 
himself with the minor sports which have less 
value in their effect upon character. If we 
can succeed in some measure in persuading 
parents and college authorities that the pres- 
ent requirements for intercollegiate matches, 
fostered by professionals, are inconsistent with 
high performance in studies, and if we can by 
better teaching stimulate the boys in second- 
ary schools to aim at high standards in their 
studies as well as reach a reasonable pro- 
ficiency in games, we shall take an important 
step forward. There should be a great com- 
pany of all-round men produced by our col- 
leges and schools if these changes can be 
brought to pass. 
Another aim of the secondary schools each 
year should be a group of “scholars.” We 
have been obliged to confess that our boys 
are two years behind those of Europe. We 
must now commit a further act of humility. 
and acknowledge that we have no “scholars”
-P-A-G-E-159
136 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
in the European sense of the term. This is 
one more sin to be laid to the charge of 
our accepting the position of “preparatory 
schools.” All the students of the upper class 
are brought to a point at which they may be 
expected to get through the college entrance 
examinations. Some few are ambitious enough 
to aim at honors in these tests. But there 
is no thought of giving an able boy as ad- 
vanced instruction as he is capable of receiv- 
ing. 
We have no body of “scholars” who can 
compare with those of England or the Con- 
tinent. The reason for this we have attempted 
to explain in part. Another cause is found 
in the organization of our schools. The 
studies of the forms or classes are arranged 
with a view to the students being promoted 
each year. In a school with six classes a 
boy is expected to take six years in getting 
through them. At the end of his sixth year 
he is ready for college. If he is too young 
for college life he is sent abroad or uses up 4 
year in some other way. In the English 
schools a pupil is carried on as rapidly as 
he can profitably travel. Promotion may be
-P-A-G-E-160
ACADEMIC INFLUENCE 137 
gained at any time in the year. He may 
reach the upper form at an early age, much 
below his time for university life, and there, 
in the upper class, he does advanced work 
and becomes a highly trained scholar. 
Such an ideal as this is possible for us. We 
have a supply of boys who are capable of 
excellent performance and already many of 
our masters are able to give this higher in- 
struction. It would mean a larger body of 
teachers with the additional expense that this 
would bring and it would require interest on 
the part of parents that their sons should 
acquire something of higher learning and 
should allow them to remain at the school for 
the purpose. If these were given it is believed 
that a goodly number of boys would be stimu- 
lated by the pleasures of intellectual growth 
and by the competition for scholastic honors 
at the university which would be fostered by 
the plan. Very soon a private boarding school 
will blaze the way towards this inviting moun- 
tain top and we shall have a race of scholars 
as well as of fairly well educated men. 
In the meantime we have no excuse for 
standing still—the “new plan,” so called, for
-P-A-G-E-161
138 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
entering college, which has been accepted as 
the regular plan by some of our schools, gives 
opportunity for starting on our way. Under 
this system the records of candidates for the 
last three years of school life preceding the 
last year are presented to the university 
authorities. These cover the subjects of gen- 
eral training to which we have referred. If 
the records are accepted, then the candidates 
are presented for examination in four sub- 
jects selected by themselves or by the school 
authorities. During the last year, therefore, 
their time can be given to intensive study of 
these subjects, and the result should be-a 
fairly thorough knowledge of them, sufficient 
to gain distinguished credit in the compre- 
hensive examinations submitted by the College 
Board of Examiners.

ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 
Brrore we try to analyze the influence of 
athletics in their relation to schools, it may 
be worth while to look into the origin of two 
words. These words are those which are 
applied to the time free from academic duties, 
in a boy’s school life. Note they are of old 
English coinage. One is play, meaning to 
amuse one’s self, the other, game, a word given 
to any form of amusement resulting in mirth. 
There are three others which became integral 
parts of the English language in the Middle 
Ages and which have interesting meanings for 
us as well. Sport has as its root enjoyment, 
diversion or fun. Recreation reflects its func- 
tion—the re-creation of the tired mind or the 
restoration of the fatigued body. Leisure sug- . 
gests permission or license from work. Is it 
any wonder that the English stand for the 
Personification of sport for sport’s sake? Into 
their language came these descriptive words 
of what games to them imply. 139
-P-A-G-E-163
140 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
We must see then if these words which 
we commonly apply to school athletics are 
directly applicable. We speak of playing 
baseball, football and tennis. Do all the boys 
we ask to play these games amuse themselves 
—are some of them even amused? Add to the 
list rowing and track, and do they re-create 
the mind or restore fatigued bodies, as per- 
formed under intensive school coaching sys- 
tems that look only for success? Do they 
result in mirth born of a light heart? They 
are engaged in with permission, yes—but with 
how much license? Are they all sports for 
enjoyment or fun? The word fun appeared 
in English literature in the seventeenth cen- 
tury because needed by boys to describe best 
what they most desired in their play, their 
games, their sports, their recreations, their 
leisure hours. “In any field of endeavor your 
true and authentic amateur is a man who 
plays a game gleefully”—this is the true cri- 
terion of sport. 
It then appears that schools must bear in 
mind the very evident fact that the time set 
apart for relaxation from studies must be pro- 
vided with forms of pleasurable exercise. The
-P-A-G-E-164
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 141 
emphasis should be laid on fun, for enjoyment 
is the antidote for fatigued minds. It is im- 
portant to call this form of athletics to spe- 
cial notice, for the tendency today is to 
divorce athletics from their dual educational 
part in the curricula of our colleges, and if 
we are not careful, in our schools as well. 
Let us now turn to the origin of the word 
athletics, for it carries our thoughts into new 
and totally different channels. It is a far older 
word than either play or game, a Greek 
derivative, meaning a combatant for a prize. 
The first athletic games at all akin to the 
formal athletic events of today were, as every- 
body knows, those of the Greeks at Olympia. 
The first records of these contests, we are 
told, date from 776 B.C. It seems proved that 
they originated as a way of “testing endurance 
and strength with an especial view to war.” 
_ They were serious contests, instituted as a 
means to an end, not games for pure relaxa- 
tion or fun, but a form of military training 
with implements of war, or for the develop- 
ment of courage, the building of hardy man- 
hood. They were the forerunners of our 
athletics of today. Like them, our school
-P-A-G-E-165
142 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
athletics are found to be a preparation for the 
everyday battles of life, through their effect 
in the building of character. I suppose this 
is the excuse for their existence in the present 
condition in which we find them. We must 
ask ourselves if it is an adequate excuse. We 
have, then, diverging purposes for our ath- 
letics, fun and character development, and the 
extent to which they diverge is becoming 
greater and greater. However, as athletics 
have diverged in form, have they not con- 
verged in effect? 
Let us first consider the purely recreational 
pastimes and their function in school life. In 
any school we find that all its boys are not 
of the athletic type, and the question at once 
arises, Shall the school force all its boys to 
endeavor to become such? There is the non- 
athletic boy whose body lacks the power of 
muscular codrdination. There is the musician 
or the bookworm, who would rather play or 
read than go out of doors. There is the nature 
lover who vastly prefers to wander over the 
meadows and through the woods. There is 
the imaginative boy who desires to build 
cabins and stage the life of the aboriginal.
-P-A-G-E-166
ATHLETIC. INFLUENCE 143 
There is the mechanical boy who wishes to 
seek out opportunities to create with his 
hands. Then there is the timid boy who dis- 
likes any form of physical contact with his 
fellows, or one who has some insurmountable 
infirmity of eye or limb. The answer, I be- 
lieve, is that there is no general treatment for 
these varying non-athletic types. Not to force 
one to try to be athletic would bring him 
back in later years with the cry, “Why did 
you not make me play as the other boys 
did?” while to force another would be 
to clip the unfolding wings of genius. To 
carry out its full responsibility the school must 
study to provide adequate exercise in the open 
for these important cases which, though, in the 
minority, are no less important. For the first, 
there are corrective exercises; for the second, - 
a common-sense upholding of the adage mens 
sana in corpore sano; for the third, the school 
museum as an object for collections; for the 
fourth, the woods and fields; for the fifth, . 
an open-air workshop; and for the sixth and 
seventh, a sympathetic adjustment of moods 
and values. These are not what have been 
termed “good normal American boys,” but
-P-A-G-E-167
144. EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
that is not to say that they will not make their 
mark in later life, and we cannot afford to use 
one standard of measurement, nor should we 
wish to have but one. 
This group which has just been mentioned 
is a small one, but for the development of such 
boys much time and thought is necessary. It 
can hardly be classed as a group at all, for it 
presents distinctly individual problems. These 
are the boys that are being neglected in the 
wholesale handling of organized games. In 
the first place, the boys who lack muscular 
coérdination are of two types: those who are 
sensitive before other boys of their deficiency, 
and those who, though consciously awkward, 
wish to learn. The former must be coaxed into 
group games, the latter can be encouraged to 
join duffer divisions. Both invariably im- 
prove, and are happy in their increased accom- 
plishment. The musicians, the bookworms, 
and the nature lovers frequently isolate them- 
selves, not because they lack athletic ability, 
but because their recreative instinct lies else- 
where. As a rule they improve under and 
enjoy sports, and should be asked to divide 
their free time so that they do not miss the
-P-A-G-E-168
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 145 
opportunities of which they will uncon- 
sciously deprive themselves if left unadvised. 
The school must be aware, however, that here 
and in the two following cases it may lead a 
real genius away from important fields of self- 
expression. Outdoor dramatics will often pro- 
vide a group opportunity for the imaginative 
and mechanical types, and for the latter model 
yacht racing has lately opened a great field for 
competitive sport. The timid boy, though at 
first perhaps the most discouraging problem, 
has in my experience latent in him the germ 
of the most sublime courage. Both in foot- 
‘ball and during the Great War I have seen 
timid and retiring boys drive themselves 
through sheer character to become the most 
fearless and splendid examples of real man- 
hood. Their timidity is rarely, if ever, cow- 
ardly, and experience, I think, will prove that 
they present problems of short duration. The 
fear of fear proves always the antidote of the 
timid. Lastly, for the infirm boys, two school 
fields are at least open, managerships and crew 
coxswains. Their craving for self-expression 
in the afternoon world of a boys’ school pre- 
sents one of the most touching problems, and
-P-A-G-E-169
146 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
one that most repays effort and ingenuity to 
overcome. To provide such boys with normal 
inter-relationships not only has its more than 
adequate reward on account of the pleasure 
it gives the boys concerned, but lifts a load 
from the hearts of parents who have felt their 
sons cut off by misfortune from their right- 
ful playmates. 
There is little doubt, I believe, in the minds 
of schoolmasters that the athletic influence, if 
properly introduced, offers to these boys a 
real and valuable opportunity for self-develop- 
ment, and which a careful athletic curriculum 
should take into account. They will not pro- 
vide the “letter boys” of the school teams 
except in rare instances, but they are the ones 
for whom physical education today is doing 
so much in bringing them into the great fold 
of young men who wish to do something for 
the betterment of their bodies, boys who would 
otherwise develop into one-sided and unhappy 
men, incapable later of enjoying their com- 
panions at play. 
We may now turn again to the Greeks be- 
fore we proceed to discuss the far larger group 
which is so strongly influenced by athletics,
-P-A-G-E-170
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 147 - 
We have found that the Olympic Games origi- 
nated as a preparation for war, but we also 
find that the belief was “that the body of man 
has a glory as well as his intellect and spirit, 
that the body and mind should alike be dis- 
ciplined, and that it is by the harmonious 
discipline of both that men best honor Zeus.” 
It is perfectly clear, I think, that the inter- 
est in athletics has progressed along two dis- 
tinct lines, and for two distinct purposes. The 
first is that which has arisen purely for the 
accomplishment of physical development; 
the second occupies the field of competitive 
games, 
The most encouraging fact is that, as 
has already been said, they are converging 
now to produce a higher type of manhood. I 
can remember distinctly when I was a school- 
boy that we took no such interest in the de- 
velopment of our bodies as boys and young 
men take today. We played our games, but 
heard nothing of the advantages of posture 
and carriage in relation to our success, nor of 
their hygienic value. Departments of physi- 
cal education were embryonic, or only in their 
infancy. Let us, therefore, first discuss what
-P-A-G-E-171
148 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
has been accomplished on the side of purely 
physical education. 
It is undoubtedly true that the old type of 
gymnasium with its prescribed equipment of 
dumb-bells, chest weights, ladders, rings, 
horses, ahd bars is losing its interest, and is 
less and less in evidence. The old-fashioned 
gym floor is being replaced by open-air cages 
where outdoor games can be played under 
cover in winter weather. The “college strong 
man,” as judged by certain tests of strength 
made after long and lonely practice in such 
old gymnasiums, is little heard of. His deca- 
dence has been the natural result of his lack 
of suppleness, and, therefore, inability to take 
part in games with his fellows that require 
deftness and rapid muscle codrdination. An 
amusing account of the now discarded tests 
that athletes took has recently appeared in 
an article on school and college athletics. 
“After an examination of your heart, you were 
led over to a chain which was fastened 
securely to the floor and you were directed 
to pull it. Just what was supposed to give, 
I have never found out, but when you had 
indicated by facial contortions that you could
-P-A-G-E-172
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 149 
not pull the chain out of the floor, you were 
released. You were then handed a funny 
little thing to squeeze. With this instrument 
you felt that you had been about as success- 
ful as you had been with the anchored chain. - 
The parallel bars suggested two more con- 
tests of endurance. You chinned yourself as 
many times as you could, and you dipped as 
many times as you dared. With the aid of 
mathematical formule you were finally in- 
formed that you had a strength test of five 
hundred points. This was not enough to make 
you eligible for the crew, so you returned to 
your room to practise dipping and chinning, 
and in the brief period of two days you waxed 
in strength by two hundred points, and were 
then eligible to pull an oar.” 
The accent today is on prescribed physical 
examinations, including studies of posture, 
and the individual corrective exercises that 
follow. With these accomplished, pleasurable, 
competitive games are advised, preferably 
those played out of doors. This is a common- 
sense plan that is not only being generally 
accepted by schools and colleges, but is being 
heartily subscribed to by the boys themselves.
-P-A-G-E-173
150 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
A recent schoolboy athlete of great promise, 
when he found himself in the D class under the 
Harvard Freshman Prescribed Physical Train- 
ing Program, instead of ignorantly turning up 
his nose and pointing to his schoolboy record, 
as a proof of his bodily fitness, asked for the 
corrective exercises to be prescribed at once, 
that he might gain the A class, which he 
shortly did, and later became a three “H” 
man in the University’s athletics. This is but 
one instance to show the kindly acceptance by 
boys of modern physical education. No more 
are wholesale classes in dull calisthenics car- 
ried on, but corrective exercises for the needy, 
while those of correct posture play instead 
enjoyable games. 
No one has preached more this modern 
doctrine of physical education, and no one 
has brought more recreative pleasure into the . 
lives of young men than the late Director of 
Physical Education at Harvard University, 
William H. Geer. A eulogy of him written 
by one of his boys who caught the inspiration 
of his idea was one of the most touching trib- 
utes to his memory. “He taught that grace 
is more desirable than strength, that sym-
-P-A-G-E-174
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 151 
metrical development is better than bulging 
biceps. Despising hypocrisy and cant, he 
instituted a hygiene course for freshmen, in 
which, without mincing matters, he frankly 
and dispassionately told the truth. He 
preached the gospel of fresh air, plain food, 
sound sleep, and regular exercise in moder- 
ation. He spoke of sex, not as a prig, nor as 
a libertine, but as a man whose clean heart 
had reconciled the laws of nature with the 
voice of God.” And for this young man “life 
had stopped being a bore; it had become a 
game.” Physical education, therefore, has 
become a means to an end, and that end is 
games. 
To turn now to a study of what the majority 
include in the term “athletics” in our schools 
and colleges. I suppose that no one will doubt 
that the lowering of almost every record in 
track, and the improvement in the skill with 
which American youth play their games, has 
been due to the intensive athletics that have 
gripped the country. We, too, are no doubt 
proud of the fact that today the Olympic 
Games are won by the United States by a 
large margin of points—that the tennis inter-
-P-A-G-E-175
152 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
national championship is held in this country 
—that we have won once in that most ancient 
of English sports, the grand challenge cup at 
Henley. These and many more point to our 
supremacy in athletics. In no country, how- 
ever, has commercialism in sport reached the 
point it has here, with professional baseball, 
and the enormous crowds that attend the 
football contests each autumn, not to say 
those that gather around the ringside, and 
to see other professional contests. 
The question now is, How much have we 
lost from this intensive point of view toward 
our games, and where is it leading us? Has 
the level of our sportsmanship kept parallel 
with the level of our proficiency, and what is 
more important, has the level of the enjoy- 
ment that the participants gain kept parallel 
as well? I think that most of us today are 
beginning to doubt whether we have not over- 
stepped the real purpose of athletics. Dr. 
Wettstone of the University of Dubuque feels 
SO, so strongly that he has abolished athletics. 
The Nation writes thus of his action: “Al- 
though not one of the most important of our 
colleges, the change is a pleasant sign that
-P-A-G-E-176
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 153 
the institution is sufficiently independent of 
donors and alumni to feel free to take this 
step and to state the reasons. The head of the 
institution is evidently ready to risk being 
regarded as an old fossil. He objects to the 
fact that coaches and athletic directors are 
paid three or four times the salary of the 
heads of other college departments, and refer- 
ting to the competition of various colleges in 
offering scholarships to athletes, he says: ‘I 
have come to the conclusion, as head of the 
University of Dubuque, that either I must step 
out of intercollegiate competition or I must 
sacrifice my moral principles.’ He finds that 
things are at such a pass that when approached 
by scouts, the high-school athlete asks, ‘How 
much do I get?’ instead of ‘How does the 
school rank as an educational institution?’ 
What makes Dr. Wettstone’s action more 
interesting is the fact that he was a successful 
undergraduate athlete himself. We believe 
that the step will help and not hurt the Uni- 
versity, for we have felt for some time that 
that college which would frankly advertise 
that it was without a million-dollar stadium, 
a winning football team, or a good baseball
-P-A-G-E-177
154. EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
diamond, and had no paid coaches would 
make a hit. Reed College in Oregon profits, 
we believe, by its abolition of all competitive 
games with other institutions. But our uni- 
versities are as slow to grapple with the evils 
of athletics as are the churches with mili- 
tarism. Having sunk millions in great ce- 
ment and stone edifices for athletics, they 
feel that the alumni would refuse to permit 
the giving up of extra-mural competitions.” 
Certainly from the point of view of the 
schoolboy there have been many unfavorable 
results, if we consider the athletics of a school 
a part of its educational curriculum for the 
development of character as well as muscu- 
lar skill. No doubt Lord Wellington’s refer- 
ence to the playing fields of Eton was made 
because his men showed the development of 
character, and no doubt in the late war the 
value which our private school and college 
boys had gained out of their athletics made 
them of officer material in the ranks. Is not 
it, therefore, the most important thing to 
safeguard the character-building qualities that 
our athletics provide rather than to develop 
mere skill and the lowering of records? Is
-P-A-G-E-178
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 155 
not this what we must cherish and hold? Back 
in the early days of our schoolboy lives, for 
example, if one will read the early accounts 
of the play hours of boys who attended the 
old New England schools, he is struck with 
the fact that those young fellows had a wider 
range of afternoon activities, and the entire 
management of their play was in their own 
hands. And with such examples as one reads in 
the maritime history of Massachusetts, when 
young boys went to sea as masters of vessels 
at seventeen, and as cooks at ten, can we argue 
ourselves into the belief that character and 
dependability were not more developed in 
those days than now, when our youth have 
their playtime organized, and their games 
coached, and where they have been cut off 
from the opportunity for initiative and the 
ability to mix with each other without a medi- 
ator to settle disputes? I believe that we shall 
see a distinct reaction in our schools and col- 
leges against the over-organization of our 
sports. The coach, now long in the ascend- 
ency, will again disappear, and we shall find 
that those boys and young men who are fitted 
to be leaders will lead in the development of
-P-A-G-E-179
156 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
their sports, that those who are fitted to 
organize will attend to their organization, and 
that out of the future will come a generation 
of young men more able to carry on them- 
selves their own recreations, in which more 
sturdy character will be built, and where 
maturity of purpose will be gained at an 
earlier age. 
It has recently been said that: “A civiliza- 
tion that creates a leisure which it cannot 
rationally use may well be in greater danger 
of destruction than one that has no leisure at 
all. A civilization that bores its beneficiaries 
is perhaps even worse than one that over- 
works its slaves. A world fit for democracy is 
a far easier aim than a world fitted for leisure. 
Democracy can stand the test of war. 
Whether it can stand the test of uninspired 
leisure and survive is quite another matter. 
At least we should begin to recognize the 
problem and the necessity for its solution. 
“The great problem before us today is to 
create a civilization that does not degenerate 
under leisure. This can be done only by set- 
ting in operation forces making for a culture 
that recognizes, as no civilization since the 
fall of Rome has been required to do, that
-P-A-G-E-180

ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 187 
leisure is and must be a means and not an 
end; that its true value is measured by what 
we do with it—by whether it lifts us or lowers 
us in the great world of intangibles, the world 
not of material but of spiritual values.” 
In the discussion of the present abuse of 
athletics in England, Dr. Arthur Shadwell 
writes: “The point is not that they play as a 
telaxation in leisure hours, or even that they 
watch others play, but that they think of 
nothing else. It is no longer recreation, but 
the chief preoccupation of life.” 
There is one thing certain; that man is a 
gregarious animal. He longs to belong, and 
this has been the cause of the invention of 
our multitudinous games. From this desire 
of young men to belong have grown our teams, 
and the resulting team spirit, have grown also 
the audiences that follow the teams, that have 
resulted in the school and college spirit, and 
that have thrown our young men, without the 
necessity of draft, into our armies, and have 
developed their national loyalty. 
Let me now ask you to consider what is the 
Modern trend of schoolboy athletics. It fol- 
lows two schools of development; that which
-P-A-G-E-181
158 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
believes in entirely intramural contests, and 
that which supports interscholastic relation- 
ships. There is no doubt that schools which 
follow the intramural plan of athletics reap 
certain distinct advantages which are lost if 
interscholastic contests are permitted. In the 
first place, no teams leave a school of an 
afternoon without causing interruptions in the 
scholastic curriculum, and the cost of trans- 
portation is always a heavy burden on school 
athletic finances. It is also, no doubt, pos- 
sible to develop a splendid system of intra- 
mural contests which provide many opportu- 
nities to practice the advantages gained from 
athletics. In the English universities, where 
the college plan of competition is so fully 
developed, it has always been found advis- 
able to have university contests. No doubt 
this dual plan, by the very fact of its 
general adoption, is the better. Interscho- 
lastic contests provide the advantages of 
a wider interscholastic relationship. They 
permit schools to play the part of generous 
hosts; they develop a type of sportsmanship 
under greater competitive stress that is not 
possible to develop in intramural contests.
-P-A-G-E-182

Feeling often runs high between schoolc 
it is true, but the control of undergraduate 
feeling is, however, so important that the. 
opportunity to practice it in the more intense. «- 
situations that arise in outside contests is well 
worth while. There is one New England 
school that has apparently felt the need of 
inter-relationships of a broader type than the 
intramural, and has widened its field in recent 
years by meeting in competition other schools. 
Certainly one of the great purposes that inter- 
scholastic contests nourish is to unify school 
spirit, to develop common loyalty, which is, 
under the intramural system, divided and. 
impossible. 
In such a discussion as this it will be worth 
while to consider at some length the abuses 
of athletics today in the schools. In the first 
place, over-organization seems to be one of the © 
worst modern features. Recently some one. 
who was writing about the establishment of a 
nature club in a school said “that his boys 
were running to him all the time asking him to 
start an Ornithological Association in the 
school. ‘Not on your life,’ was the gist of his 
reply, ‘If I start such an association you will
-P-A-G-E-183
160 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
have a constitution and by-laws; president, 
secretary and treasurer—Yes, and a manager, 
before you know it, and all will be off. I go out 
every such and such day at such an hour. Come 
along if you want to.’” Organization may be 
an American characteristic of which we are 
proud, for I believe in the Boxer Rebellion 
America’s contribution in the defense of 
Peking was notably that of organization. 
Lately I have read, also, an amusing article 
by the rector of a parish who refers to the 
present-day emphasis on this very organiza- 
tion. He says, “We organized. How we 
organized! We organized the babies into a 
Cradle Roll. We organized the boys and girls 
into Scouts. and clubs of a dozen different 
varieties. We organized the young people 
into dramatic associations, bands, choruses.” 
This very organization has come to bear the 
misnomer of efficiency. It robs us, however, 
of the more important spiritual relations which 
are the very reasons, after all, for which we 
organize. It should certainly be possible to 
keep out of schoolboy athletics at least the 
so-called efficient systems that call for com- 
plicated management and the like. No less
-P-A-G-E-184

an authority on organized athletics than W. J. 
Bingham writes: “I am, however, willing to 
subscribe, and do subscribe, to the view that 
our athletic sports are over-organized. When 
schools will enter no protests against pre- 
season football practice, and when they will 
allow outside organizations or individuals to 
provide summer camps for this purpose, such 
an influence must be labelled as dangerous, 
and cannot be condemned too strongly. This 
condition prevails because in some communi- 
ties there exists an element so thirsty for 
athletic victory that it is willing to provide 
such facilities and even subsidizes the athletic 
coach by popular subscription. In a few in- 
stances boys have been encouraged to change 
their residence in order that they might play on the football team of a neighboring city.” 
In the early athletics in this country it was 
not thought necessary to have special uni- 
forms, though it must be admitted they all 
tend to help the spirit of the team which is the 
answer to man’s craving to belong. Magenta 
handkerchiefs were sought by the first Har- 
vard crew to mark their identity—to establish 
them as a unit. This was the origin of the
-P-A-G-E-185

Harvard crimson. Certainly uniforms should 
not be paid for out of the coffers of the athletic 
association, which spends in such an event the 
major portion of its income on the uniforms 
of its major teams, though the income is drawn 
from the pockets of every boy’s parents. Also 
it does not seem necessary to have paid 
officials for schoolboy contests, Today we 
hear at the final contests of our schoolboy 
baseball games the professional umpire an- 
nouncing with unction the batteries of the two 
teams. Our sense of proportion should make 
such a happening ridiculous in our eyes. Bet- 
ter far that our officials should be chosen from 
the alumni or faculty of our schools, estab- 
lishing a mutual confidence in their fairness 
that would help to lift the whole tone of our 
interscholastic sports to a higher plane. 
In all branches of sport during the past 
two decades the coach has been in the ascend- 
ency, and with his coming a recompense 
entirely disproportionate to the service ren- 
dered has been asked for and paid. Already 
there is becoming a healthy reaction in the 
establishment of a relationship between the 
salary of professor and coach, and the high
-P-A-G-E-186
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 163 
schools of New England are now searching, 
as the independent schools have, for more 
“teacher-coaches” than ever before in recent 
years. A year ago Mr. W. H. Geer wrote, 
“Many schools, too, are eliminating the pro- 
fessional coach and substituting the teacher- 
coach, elected by the school committee as a 
member of the high school faculty and directly 
responsible to the principal. Such coaches 
are free to strive for worth-while objectives 
in athletics. They can teach sportsmanship, 
foster clean play, and see that a desire for 
victory does not develop into a desire for 
victory at any cost. They do not hold their 
positions by virtue of having winning teams.” 
So far the professional coach per se is prac- 
tically confined to the college world, and I 
know of only a few instances where the inde- 
pendent schools have employed them. The 
function of the coach should be exactly 
parallel to the function of the master in the 
classroom, to instruct how to play the game, 
not to direct and organize the play itself. 
There is much truth in the statement that 
“the teacher develops the independence of 
his pupil; the coach takes away that inde-
-P-A-G-E-187
164 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
pendence.” Coaching from the side lines, even 
in baseball, where it is openly permitted 
through a system of signals, is now being 
given up in the best secondary school games, 
and I believe heartily that an experiment 
tried in the rowing coaching at Harvard Uni- 
versity where the varsity oarsmen coached in 
the early season the raw freshman recruits did 
more to establish healthy class inter-relation- 
ships and a keener knowledge of rowing than 
was admitted. Certainly it would be well for 
schools to consider allowing the captains of 
their teams to conduct their practice at least 
one day a week. It is believed it would de- 
velop leadership, responsibility and loyalty 
to a greater degree than can possibly be gained 
under the system where the team waits on the 
field almost inert and helpless until the arrival 
of the coach. 
Unquestionably we have»good and bad 
coaches to deal with, coaches whose ideals of 
sportsmanship are low, and those whose ideals 
are high. And it is, moreover, absolutely true 
that the plastic boy will adopt and willingly 
follow whatever coaching system he develops 
under and be loyal to it, even if its standards
-P-A-G-E-188
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 165 
are not what they should be. Give the aver- 
age American boy, or the boy of any other 
country half a chance, and he will be a good 
sport. Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn has said the 
same: “The young American is a good sport 
if he gets a fair chance at being one.” The 
harm is done by the type of coach over him. 
The accent is so strongly on the side of win- 
ning that the unprincipled coach will descend 
sometimes almost unconsciously to methods 
that lead toward victories, and so warp his 
own point of view and that of the boys under 
him, that they come to believe that their low 
plane of sportsmanship is, on the contrary, 
an acceptable one. 
If a more common-sense point of view is 
not taken in regard to coaches in general 
their use will become the “height of the ridicu- 
lous.” Have we not perhaps reached this 
State already where there are “as many 
coaches on the bench as we have players on 
the field? Many of you who have attended 
football games in the Stadium at Harvard 
must have wondered at the number of coaches 
who cross the field preliminary to a game.” 
Have they not usurped one of the definite
-P-A-G-E-189
166 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
educational values? They are “the brains of 
the team. The initiative of the game origi- 
nates in the minds of coaches and not in the 
minds of the players. Boards of strategy 
determine what kind of an offense shall be 
used, and an elaborate system of scouting 
is responsible for the defensive tactics used 
against each of our opponents.” 
Here let us pause to deplore the lack of 
confidence between reputable schools. Only 
recently I have heard of a school which was 
following out what is an unfortunate, if not 
disgraceful, custom of submitting to its oppo- 
nents the list of officials they had chosen as 
umpires, referees and the like for a coming 
contest. Objection was found to one of the 
number, and not a very courteous objection 
at that. What sort of impression can be made 
on boys if they know, as they do, that their 
school takes such a petty, ungenerous point 
of view toward officials selected in good faith 
by the rival. school? We hear it argued that 
it spoils the game if the officials are not 
responsible parties—exactly, but who is to be 
the judge? It is vastly better for the charac- 
ter of a boy to learn to accept umpire rulings,
-P-A-G-E-190
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 1 
  because of the sincere belief in the good faith 
of their opponents, than to benefit by any... 
other consequence that could arise out of 
accidentally wrong or even partial decisions. 
Would that the schools which play together . 
could bring themselves to decide, to eliminate — 
the paid official and accept faculty or alumni“ 
ones instead, with a gentleman’s agreement, to is 
stand by their decisions bad or good, ‘hecause: : 
of absolute faith in their opponent's intention: 
to do the right and fair thing. The faculty 
umpire is, as a rule, dangerous, only because 
he will lean over backwards to be fair to the 
rival team, and thus occasionally overpenalize 
his own school boys. This, however, is a 
matter of small moment. . 
There is also even in school athletics the 
shrug of the shoulders over the eligibility of 
boys representing other schools. The eligi- 
bility of a boy to represent his school should 
be a matter entirely at the discretion of his 
school faculty. The matter would be better 
governed, I am convinced, within a school if 
it were settled on an individual basis with- 
out the necessity of rules—and confidence 
between contending school administrations 
  Ne
-P-A-G-E-191
168 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
would remove interscholastic bickering and 
backbiting. Should the question of eligibility 
to play in games be used at all as an incentive 
to get boys to work at their books, which is the 
fundamental purpose of the school? Is the 
relapse when this pry becomes ineffective at 
a season’s end a healthy sign toward intellec- 
tuality? Are we not on the wrong track in 
using such a method? 
In my experience in both school and col- 
lege contests a generous spirit of good faith on 
the part of one rival has never failed to result 
in gaining the same from the other party, and 
as a tribute to the sportsmanship of the race, 
it is generally repaid twofold. Mr. Bingham 
has touched upon this phase as follows: “An- 
other evil, not confined to football but appli- 
cable to all athletic sports, is the suspicion in 
which athletes are held by some rival insti- 
tutions. There are some colleges, or college 
graduates, who subsidize their athletes, and 
because there is a fine line between the deserv- 
ing boy whe receives aid and the college 
athlete tramp who expects assistance on 
account of his athletic contribution, we have 
a financial inquisition of the innocent. Ifa

boy is a candidate for an athletic team and 
is dependent on his own resources to meet his 
college expenses, he must account for every 
cent he earns during the college year and 
in vacation periods. The motive behind every 
gift is questioned with suspicious apprehen- 
sion. I am quite in sympathy with confer- 
ences, and I believe it is our duty to eradicate 
every evil of athletic sports which exists, but 
I am also of the opinion that the status of © 
eligibility of a boy ought to be a matter for 
his own college to decide. We are too sus- 
picious of our rival institutions, and if as 
institutions we are going to be suspicious of 
each other, it is only natural that our boys 
should develop or absorb these same ten- 
dencies.” 
Are there any who doubt that Dean Le 
Baron R. Briggs could not have settled alone 
Harvard’s cases of eligibility to the entire 
satisfaction of Yale and Princeton, simply 
because they believed him to have accepted 
this spirit of mutual confidence? He wrote 
that it was “inexcusable not to use your oppo- 
nent a little better than yourself, not to trust 
him a little further than you trust yourself.”
-P-A-G-E-193
170 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
We have now another aspect of the abuse 
of athletics to ponder over and that is the 
resulting fatigue, both nervous and muscular, 
that arises from intensive competitive games. 
Iam not referring to actual bodily harm either 
of strain or injury, which is another topic. 
There is very little doubt that unless more 
care is taken to prevent overfatigue, because 
of its direct influence as a detriment to scho- 
lastic work, particularly as shown in listless 
study periods following hard practice or con- 
tests, we shall have to admit that athletics are 
not functioning—their purpose being a recre- 
ation which results in better mental accom- 
plishment. 
In closing this discussion of some of the ob- 
vious abuses of school athletics, what appears 
to be one of the most pernicious phases has 
been saved for the end—the ridiculous public- 
ity, even to actual exploitation, of the school- 
boy athlete for advertising purposes. This 
phase includes pre-season practice and post- 
season games, local leagues and champion- 
ships, newspaper hero worship, and absurd 
monetary expenditures, including the income 
from gate receipts. The first of these has no
-P-A-G-E-194
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE wm 
raison d’etre, having been done away with by h 
most thoughtful college authorities as unwise 
  and untenable. Certainly no school under these.” 
circumstances can justify it. The post-season ~ 
contest has for the same reason no logical 
excuse, for it has no counterpart in the school’s 
scholastic life. Local championships and 
results of imaginary or organized leagues can 
be largely laid at the door of the press. Mr. 
Geer writes: “Another unfavorable tendency 
in secondary school athletics is the unneces- 
sary showering of honors on winning athletes. 
A desire on the part of the school and towns- 
people to honor the members of victorious 
teams finds expression in various forms. This 
Matter assumes such proportions in some 
schools as to become a travesty on amateur 
sport. If it is necessary to arrange compli- 
mentary trips for successful teams and give 
elaborate banquets at the close of victorious 
seasons to pay boys for athletic services ren- 
dered, we are forced to admit that all the 
talk about sportsmanship and loyalty in con- 
nection with athletics is hollow mockery. 
. . . Another unfavorable tendency in high 
school athletics that is fraught with a good
-P-A-G-E-195
172, EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
deal of danger is the mania for State and 
National championships. In college athletics, 
where the players are more mature than high- 
school boys, we find that the trend is toward 
a reduction in schedules, and’ an elimination 
of post-season games, with less and less atten- 
tion devoted to sectional and National cham- 
pionships.” And the absurd antithesis to this 
wise point of view is set forth by this tran- 
_ Script from a morning paper. ‘““The apotheosis 
of school sports will come this afternoon in 
New York, at the Yankee Stadium, when the 
nine of the L—— Technical High School, of 
Chicago, scholastic champions, will play the 
team of the F High School, Queen’s 
and inter-borough leaders. An intercollegi- 
ate football game which attracts twenty-five 
or fifty thousand is considered a great spec- 
tacle. More than sixty thousand will see 
that game this afternoon.” How can boys 
so glorified ever regain their sense of pro- 
portion? 
There are some wise schools that never 
allow their athletes to be pictured in the news- 
papers. It would also be better if no indi- 
. vidual pictures appeared in school magazines  
-P-A-G-E-196
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 173 
but only those of teams. Many boys between 
the ages of fourteen and eighteen have their 
names in press headlines and their individual 
portraits on the sporting pages who will never 
again in their lives, save possibly in the col- 
lege athletic world, assume such prominence 
in the public eye. Already their names are 
being broadcast on the radio. No doubt the 
prominence given in the press to a school, 
when successful in its athletic contests, is what 
may be called under present conditions “good 
advertising.” Would it not be more worth 
while and logical, however, that schools as 
institutions of learning advertised their prod- 
uct—scholars, rather than their by-product-— 
athletes? Collegiate “stuff,” as it is called, 
should be kept out of school athletics. Train- 
ing tables, for example, have no legitimate 
Place in schools. “Varsity” is clearly a mis- 
homer for schoolboy teams. Instead of per- 
mitting and encouraging its use, would it not 
be of more educational value to point out 
that the word is derived from “university”? 
A school is not a university. 
Finally the costs. A fair estimate of the 
expenditures of the average schoolboy for the 
4
-P-A-G-E-197
174 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
accessories of his scholastic education in 
books, stationery, and the like, amounts to 
not over fifteen or twenty dollars a year, 
while the cost of the same boy’s athletic equip- 
ment frequently amounts to this for one 
athletic season alone. It requires no argu- 
ment to prove the absurdity of the ratio. Yet 
parents will frequently indulge their boys with 
some expensive piece of athletic equipment 
when they will refuse him the purchase of a 
reference book, recommended by the school, 
which would be a permanent addition to his 
or his family’s library. In the words of the 
prophet “these things ought not so to be.” 
The whole business of the magnification 
of schoolboy athletics is so farcical as to be 
an indictment of the intelligent common sense 
of persons connected in any way with the 
true purpose of education. 
Before turning to discuss athletic influence 
for good, it may be of interest to the reader, 
as it was to me, to read the essay of a French 
boy of sixteen to whom was put the subject: 
The Place of Athletics in a School. France, 
unlike England, has been a country slow to 
see the place of competitive games in a school
-P-A-G-E-198
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 175 
or college’s curriculum, and to adopt them as 
such. A. N. Escouplaire of the Ecole des 
Roches writes: “The great usefulness of 
athletic games in school life is that these games 
develop both body and mind. 
“The physical qualities that games procure 
to school boys are strength and health, both 
by being played in the open air. When I 
said that athletic games developed the mind, 
I meant that they developed certain qualities 
of the mind such as the will, a kind of spirit 
of manliness, of solidarity, of fair play, and 
responsibility. 
“When a team of football players wish 
earnestly for the cup or the medal, they must 
train themselves with a will to win, without 
tegard to the many difficulties that arise for 
the team from the nasty weather, the bad 
State of the playing fields, mud, pools of water, 
etc., the long distance of those fields from 
the school, and many other trifles that cool 
one’s courage and enthusiasm. They must 
also wish to vanquish their opponents. That 
is how athletic games develop the will. As to 
manliness this is my opinion. It gives you a 
stout heart, especially if you are not strong
-P-A-G-E-199
176 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
and play with much stronger opponents. I 
say that because, if in a match, you are afraid 
of receiving a few paltry kicks on the shins, 
the ball on the stomach or on the eye, it is no 
use playing. And even if you know your 
opponent to be much stronger than you, you 
must fight manfully till the end, for the honor 
of your team: ‘play on, play on, and play the 
game.’ 
“What does solidarity in games such as 
football and hockey mean? It means that 
every player must believe in the others’ 
capacities, and play according to them, and 
not all alone, to shoot a goal and have vain- 
glory, or his colours. It means also that every 
player must play for his team. 
“Fair play? Everybody knows or should 
know what is fair play: to give equal chances 
to one’s opponent, not to use unjustly of the 
advantages that chance gives you: and once 
beaten not to bear a grudge or to rage against 
those who have won, but smile and shake 
hands. 
“T have said that athletic games develop 
responsibility. The captain of a football team 
well knows that his task is to bring his men to
-P-A-G-E-200
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE “ar 
victory, and each player knows that he has 
aspecial place in the team, and special things 
to do. That is responsibility in a football 
match, or in a hockey match, or in any other 
matches, 
“All these qualities, which result of athletic 
games, and of which I have briefly spoken, 
help to form a strong character, and since a 
strong character is quite necessary in life, the 
value of athletic games is undeniable. Besides, 
a boy who should go in a school where no 
time is spared for games, would have an 
incomplete education.” 
Are not his findings just what, since the 
Greeks, people have come to believe is the 
value and place of athletics? It is not what 
they are, but what we make them, that needs 
our earnest thought. “Eidsas, the Greek idea 
of good sportsmanship, sought for, and for a 
time attained, in the competitions of the 
Greeks, [is] a word untranslatable, but con- 
veying the idea of ‘reverence, modesty, cour- 
tesy, scrupulous sense of honor and fairness’.” 
There are, of course, as we have seen, those, 
like Dr, Wettstone, who see nothing but the 
abolition of athletics to correct the situ-
-P-A-G-E-201
178 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
ation, and one cannot help but admire him 
for having the courage of his conviction. But 
the Volstead Act has not cured the evils of 
drunkenness, and a great many sober and 
intelligent people think it never will. What 
is needed .in athletics is not a Volstead Act, 
but a common-sense point of view by those 
who play—by those who govern play—and 
particularly by those who look on. It is due 
in a large part to the utter selfishness of the 
latter that our sports have been degraded. It 
is overemphasis on the necessity to win, to 
satisfy a supporting alumni, that is to blame. 
In other words, we have ourselves, not the 
boys who play, to thank. “Defeat is a por- 
tion of every man born into the world. He 
must learn to accept it and, if he is to amount 
to much in his community, he must get from 
every check a certain stimulus. to appeal from 
decision.” “The alumni who are normally in- 
telligent on popular subjects are surprisingly 
unintelligent in their demands for athletic vic- 
tories. The teams must always win, and one 
defeat is longer to be remembered than ten 
victories.” Why do we not act on this plain 
fact? The carping alumni know this well, but
-P-A-G-E-202
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 179 
refuse to believe and be led by it. “Any 
alumnus who stops to think knows that a 
good team does not prove a good college.” 
It is at least fortunate for schools that the 
alumni have not as yet assumed the control- 
ling influence—that committees of alumni do 
not direct school athletic policies. May such 
persons who are rightfully interested, but who 
are not the proper administrative bodies, never 
gain control. The college athletic program 
for afternoon recreation should no more be 
planned by the alumni than the college schol- 
astic curriculum for the forenoon’s intellec- 
tual work. With one purpose in view—edu- 
cation, mental, moral and physical—the 
school or college faculty should shape the 
Policies for which they are alone responsible. 
“Only once,” writes Heywood Broun, “did 
Tever hear an official football speech which 
met with my entire approval. It was made 
by a Harvard captain. His team had lost to 
Yale by a smaller score than was expected. 
It had been a fast and interesting game. At 
the dinner when the team broke training the 
captain said, ‘We lost to Yale but I think we 
had a satisfactory season. We have had fun
-P-A-G-E-203
180 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
out of football and it seems to me that ought 
to be the very best reason for playing the 
game.’ A shocked silence followed his re- 
marks. He was never invited to come to 
Cambridge to assist in the coaching of any 
future Harvard eleven. His heresy was pro- 
found. He had practically intimated that 
being defeated was less than tragic.” 
I had the satisfaction, when Director of 
Rowing at Harvard, to receive the following 
letter from a university crew captain, but, like 
the football captain, no doubt his point of 
view was also tragic: 
“I don’t know that you remember my posi- 
tion in general—we discussed it at Concord— 
but my conviction has only grown with time 
that the chief end of sport in the University 
is indicated by the word itself. It is a delec- 
table luxury to beat Yale but the necessity is 
to row a good race, win or lose, with no dis- 
grace attached to the latter event.” 
What Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn wrote in 
an article on “What are College Games for?” 
applies also to schools. “There are two pri- 
mary motives from which college games 
spring, out of which the essential spirit of the
-P-A-G-E-204
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 181 
games is made. The first is a desire of the 
players and of the undergraduate community 
which they represent; it is the desire for fun, 
for the sheer joy of competition with another 
college and its team. Taken all in all, there 
is no ‘outside’ interest of the undergraduate 
years which is so compelling or, within proper 
limits, so worth while as this. The second 
motive is the desire of the players and com- 
munities for victory in the games. This, too, 
is essential. There can be no game without 
it. If one does not wish and strive for victory, 
then one does not play at all. To play is to 
play to win.” There was never a truer saying 
than this last. But because the hope to win 
springs eternal in the athlete’s breast it does 
not mean that defeat cancels automatically all 
the joy of having played. This belief is what 
iskilling true sport in this country. The hope 
of winning is the actuating cause; defeat the 
incentive to try again. 
The cheering at college games has come to 
provide one of the salient features, but it has 
lost its spontaneity, its sincerity. ‘All shade 
and sensitivity is sacrificed in football by the 
pernicious practice of regimentation. ‘A long
-P-A-G-E-205
182 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
cheer with three Harvards on the end,’ cries 
the man in the white sweater through his 
megaphone. It is entirely possible that at the 
precise moment he calls upon me and my fel- 
lows to declare ourselves there is stored up 
in none of us more than a short cheer. It may 
even be that we have no inclination to cheer 
at all. Still, the duty is heavy upon us and 
we must do lip-service,” again writes Heywood 
Broun. The same was true of the crowd in 
the Colosseum—a purely selfish one that 
brought man to the level of the beast. 
No, we cannot condemn games and shut 
our eyes not alone to their value, but to their 
definite place in an educational curriculum. 
“All work and no play makes Jack a dull 
boy” remains and always will remain a tru- 
ism. The elimination of athletics would be 
followed automatically by more time devoted 
to scholastic work. It has been proved time 
and again that the reverse is true. It has 
been my invariable observation that during 
the autumn and spring terms in school when 
sports are at their height, a quite parallel 
apex is reached in scholastic attainment. 
So much for the benefit derived in relation
-P-A-G-E-206
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 183 
to scholarship, and now how about character? 
Is it not perfectly true that “the right type 
of athlete has always been a credit to the 
scholastic institution which he represents, and 
a powerful influence for good?” I think so. 
Our problem then is to develop the right type. 
Clearly it is impossible to do so by the abol- 
ishment of athletics. 
Permit me to quote once again from Mr. 
Geer and Mr. Bingham, men who have had a 
sane and manly point of view, and have been 
closer to the fire than those who annually 
cry for a “new coach and a new system,” and 
who advocate the expenditure of eighty per 
cent from the athletic coffers on the five, 
nine, or eleven men who make up the major 
teams, with no thought or concern for the 
ninety and nine who deserve their rightful 
portion. 
“The evils which have crept into our sports 
are there because educators have ‘not accepted 
this phase of the boy’s life as part of their 
educational problem. They have been un- 
willing to direct or recognize athletic sports 
until the evils have appeared, and they then 
find their schools menaced by a real danger,
-P-A-G-E-207
184 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
which exists not because of the boys, but be- 
cause of outside influences which could have 
been curbed had our educational leaders 
' appreciated that natural tendencies cannot 
be suppressed in the American youth. We 
see hope for the future when teachers who 
are studying the problem of education are 
willing to devote a whole conference to dis- 
cuss the health of the youth. Whether you 
wish it or not, this is your problem. Already 
we have seen that as soon as our best minds 
tried to find a place for athletic sports in 
their school program athletics moved a step 
forward; and they need your intelligent and 
sympathetic consideration. 
“Tt is being more and more generally recog- 
nized that athletics bring forth, as nothing 
else will in a boy’s life, expressions of unity 
and loyalty to the school. Athletics, for both 
student spectators and student players, exist 
as tremendous social and spiritual expres- 
sions. A school can ill afford to allow such a 
splendid and wonderful expression, so fraught 
with magnificent opportunities, as well as
-P-A-G-E-208
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 185 
with grave dangers, to go undirected or, even 
worse, misdirected. Some one has said, ‘the 
ideals and ethics expressed in athletics are 
more likely to be the student’s ethics in more 
purely social and business relations than are 
those found in the discourses of the lecture 
room or in the principles enunciated from the 
pulpit. The one he hears and may believe; 
the other he accepts and lives.’ 
“One of the most encouraging favorable 
tendencies in secondary school athletics is the 
very definite attempt that is being made by 
many schools to . . . change the old form of 
athletic regulation that was negative to one 
that is positive and constructive. . . . Just as 
soon as school men see in the athletic field 
the possibility of a great human laboratory 
for the development of personal honor, self- 
control, and other desirable qualities in the 
training for citizenship, athletics will, cease 
to be viewed with suspicion or merely toler- 
ated as a necessary evil. 
“School men must begin to concern them- 
selves with the whole athletic situation and 
think of it as a moral agency that is an essen- 
tial in the life and education of youth. If
-P-A-G-E-209
186 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
they approach the problem in the right spirit 
the school officials in the various athletically 
related groups have within their power the 
lifting of competitive athletics to a high moral 
plane.” 
And now we come to the last and most 
evident criticism, that of what should be the 
relation between fun derived and character 
training. Fun may be in itself selfish. This 
is not necessarily, but frequently, so. Char- 
acter develops through sacrifice and service. 
In the very amusing article by Heywood 
Broun, from which I have quoted elsewhere, 
he writes that he does not want his son “to 
think of a game as something which leaves 
two or three young men stretched on their 
backs in the wake of every smashing play. I 
cannot think up any good reason, suitable to 
his immature years, why these young men 
should submit to such an ordeal. The chair- 
man of the football committee at a great 
eastern university explained to a mass meet- 
ing that preparedness was the chief justifica- 
tion for intercollegiate football. He said that 
unless the young men of America submitted 
to the arduous discipline and drill of training
-P-A-G-E-210
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 187 
and the hard knocks of fighting football, we 
should have no adequate officers for our next 
war. But I don’t want to use that reasoning 
on my small son. I have tried to enlist him 
in the determined ranks of those who insist 
that there will be no next war.” 
None of us, I hope, believe in the necessity 
of war, and all of us look forward to an ideal, 
but vastly more sensitive civilization of the 
future, when the heroes of peace will equal 
in acclaim the heroes of war, when without 
the stimulus of contest men will not degener- 
ate into utterly selfish existences. © Construc- 
tive reforms do not grow out of revolution, 
but out of the refining pot that calls for slow 
but steady progress along the right road, 
which is and has always been illuminated, but 
to which we are in our human frailty only too 
willing to close our eyes. War brings with it 
purposeful destruction of life. One of the 
byproducts of athletic games is physical in- 
jury, resulting frequently in permanently 
impaired. bodily efficiency for life, and even 
sometimes in death. As long as these results 
temain as accidental, and at times unavoid- 
able occurrences, they may be worth the
-P-A-G-E-211
188 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
candle. The majority agree to this. The 
opportunity to do bodily harm to an oppo- 
nent, which games provide, is sometimes 
abused, and is an element that cannot ever be 
eliminated by rules. It is the spirit in which 
games are played that takes care of this ele- 
ment, and so far in the independent schools 
that are carefully and wisely administered, 
the athletic plane is too high to tolerate such 
abuses. 
Professor George E. Johnson, of the Grad- 
uate School of Education of Harvard Uni- 
versity, startled his hearers when he was 
announced to speak on “Teaching Children 
to Fight,” but the following excerpt is an 
answer to those who can see nothing in the 
character-building values held in our com- 
petitive games, 
“In the first place, competition in sport 
tends to extract ill-will from fighting. Origi- 
nally, in the struggle with rivals, fighting was 
expressed in rage, anger, and lust of blood. 
Animals have little or no zestful competition 
except in the spirit of anger. The play of 
dogs, as one may readily verify by observa- 
tion, is not really competitive. The infant
-P-A-G-E-212
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 189 
first meets personal opposition with anger. It 
takes several years of development before a- 
child enters into earnest personal competition 
in good nature. The evolution of good sports- 
manship has been consistently in the direc- | 
ti of the elimination of bad temper in 
fighting games. 
“Tn the second place, competition in sport 
idealizes the aims of endeavor. Many regard 
the spirit of a fighting game as-sordid and 
selfish, as though taking something away _ 
from another, or beating him, or putting him _ 
in a hole, was the object fought for. This 
seems to miss the true psychology of a game. 
The psychological attitude in a game is not. 
sordid and selfish, but rather out-and-out | 
idealism. In a true game a player is in pur- 
suit of high attainments and ideals of excel- 
Ince, and not of material gains... . A 
fame is one of the most purely idealistic 
activities of life. Why do boys exert them- 
selves to their utmost in a ball game, strain- 
~ ing every nerve and muscle and testing to 
the limit every manly quality? To make 
‘tuns, ‘goals,’ ‘scores,’ to be sure. But why 
make scores? Do they take them home? Do
-P-A-G-E-213
190 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
they eat them? Do they wear them? Do 
they sell them? Do they store them away in 
safety vaults? Don’t you see that there is 
nothing but ideals in a true game, anyway? 
Good ideals! Be strong, plucky, efficient, fair, 
honest; do your darndest in the place where 
you can serve your group the best. Winning 
is just a unit of measure. Without it there 
could be no game at all, nor the benefits 
derived therefrom. And winning takes noth- 
ing away from the ‘loser.’ He grows and: 
profits in the same way as the winner, pet- 
haps sometimes even more. In a game played 
with the true play psychology there is no 
loser, but only those who gain. 
“Biology and psychology, then, suggest 
at fighting taps the deeper reservoirs of 
LY vos mental, and moral and social energy. 
It makes one care more; one tries harder and 
endures longer; all the faculties become more 
fit. Fighting play, then, is a schoolmaster to 
bring us to a higher state. It contributes to 
greater interest, energy, and efficiency; it 
,offers the richest field for the expression of 
the individualistic virtues; it extracts ill-will 
from fighting; it idealizes the aims of en-
-P-A-G-E-214
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 191 
deavor; it leads to the keenest expression of 
the spirit of codperation and of service to the 
group in which the individualistic virtues are 
socialized; ... Every earnest boy player 
on the suburban football teams is striving 
towards perfection; not perfection in the 
highest things, but, such as it is, the attitude 
is essential in any later effort towards 
them, 
“How shall we tap this source of energy in 
‘education in a way to make it serve social 
ends? What the school should be especially 
interested in is to see how in the educational 
“use of competition we can be on safe ground: 
with respect to the social attitude of the 
pupils. Will they be made self-conscious, 
proud, scornful, selfish, cruel, by competition? 
Or can competition be used so as to induce 
only good nature, the attitude of give and 
take, sympathy, fairness, generosity, mutual 
appreciation, codperation, chivalry? Can 
competition be made to benefit alike the vic- 
tor and the vanquished?” 
T shall never forget two instances that 
occurred in Harvard-Yale football ‘contests 
that to me also answers the question of “fight-
-P-A-G-E-215
192 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
ing” games. In the first instance I was sit- 
ting on the side lines directly behind the fence 
that borders the field when a player made a 
fierce, flying tackle at a half-back. He 
missed his man and rolled over and over in 
the straw against the boards not three feet 
away from me. His eyes glowed like a pre- 
dacious animal’s, and he in a frenzy of rage 
struck blindly at the fence with his fist, then 
struggled to his feet, with bleeding knuckles, 
staggering in his anger like a mad bull. 
The other instance was when a captain in 
the thick of the battle insisted that the referee 
suspend the rules allowing an exhausted fel- 
low opponent only two minutes to recover 
from a smashing tackle, which enabled him 
to gain his breath. 
In the first, unnoticed episode, I saw the 
degrading results of a “fight talk” between 
the halves recalling “fight week” of the fort- 
night before. In the second instance, appre- 
ciated by the crowd, I saw the manly spirit 
of a magnanimous opponent reflecting the 
just upbringing of a good home and the tone 
of a fine school. Both instances were born 
of the same game.
-P-A-G-E-216
ATHLETIC INFLUENCE 193 
And now what is, and what should be the 
athletic education of the modern boy? It 
has followed in the footsteps of the athletic 
education of the college undergraduate. It 
has taken on all the favorable and most of 
the unfavorable aspects of college sport. It 
has in truth become a miniature replica of 
collegiate recreational life. Boys have been 
permitted to follow a very natural tendency 
of youth, and have become copy-cats. This 
natural trend has been aided and abetted 
by overindulgent, but thoughtless, educa- 
tional policies with the help of the press. But 
overindulgence always has its reaction——com- 
mon sense eventually prevails. Being trained 
asa biologist, to me these tendencies of youth 
teflect what man is, not what his intelligence . 
should make him. 
I believe that the reaction has not only 
commenced, but has already gained the mo- 
mentum which will carry us into a renais- 
sance that will not only vastly better the tone 
of schoolboy athletics, but will in turn con- 
tribute its share to a saner point of view 
toward American sport. Since the war youth 
thinks more for itself—is less willing to be

led blindfolded along the paths of tradition 
or fashion. With the smaller school units, 
under more intimate and sympathetic admin- 
istration, and where alumni influence is not a 
powerful factor, the much needed reforms 
have a real chance to become established and 
grow as a corrective influence. If those who 
mold athletic policies do not falter, with the 
ready help of youth, the converging paths of 
physical culture and competitive games will 
eventually combine to produce more manly, 
self-reliant boys, whose bodily and mental 
play-time will develop a race of fine physical 
bearing, and of fine feeling for all that is best 
in sport. These will be contributory factors 
towards disciplined minds which will be bet- 
ter able to meet the complexities of modern 
life if their recreation brings about a sharp 
contrast between play and work. 
We have heard much of the fourteen 
points. May we not stop to consider in the 
field of school athletics, if to follow the four- 
teen points enumerated below would not do 
much to eliminate the evil that is done in 
the name of competitive sport, and to con- 
serve the good that it has accomplished in

ing the last twenty-six centuries.

purpose in view.

14, A truer sportsmanship that develops 
character. 
If they are to serve a purpose, these pre- 
cepts must be accepted in a true spirit of 
sportsmanship, a term which in itself is really 
the answer to all our athletic difficulties. 
“Say there, will you catch our oars?” cried 
the cox of the school crew as the shell ap- 
proached the float. “My, but that was a 
great race—a close scrap all the way,” gasped 
bow. The captain, in the delightful callow- 
ness of a budding oar, asked, “Well, what was 
the score?” A hearty laugh from the more 
sophisticated rounded out an hour’s fun. 
“Hurry! we only have fifteen minutes before 
study period for a swim and to dress—and my 
Latin assignment for tomorrow will need 
some doing” was the last remark I heard. 
The “score” had not mattered.
-P-A-G-E-220
MEETING THE COLLEGE 
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 
Every schoolboy who expects to go from 
school to college begins to think about col- 
lege entrance requirements fairly early in his 
school course—earlier, and more seriously, 
than his elders are apt to realize. Such think- 
ing puts him in a rather humble frame of 
mind; and we do not habitually go about 
proclaiming our humble frames of mind to 
the world, so the boy is altogether likely to 
keep his thoughts to himself for a long time. 
Meanwhile he is pursuing elementary studies, 
whose fundamental relation to his later work 
he is not yet qualified to appreciate. In the 
Present discussion it is probably well to 
assume that the boy’s teachers do appreci- 
_ ate their responsibility as architects of foun- 
» dations, though in this assumption we are 
going pretty far, for the special technique of 
their occupation is in an early phase of de- 
velopment as yet. 
Enlightenment of a most helpful sort may 
197
-P-A-G-E-221
198 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
come to the boy, either through the reading 
of books which are “beyond his years” and 
tell him. of the progressive achievements of 
grown-up minds, or through a happily direct 
contact with grown-up minds. People who 
have such minds do not “talk down” to boys. 
They do not spend all their time in preaching 
and moralizing and dreamy reflection. They 
are moving ahead, and not always looking 
back and beckoning. They have enthusiasm, 
which is the most contagious thing in the 
world. Even through their writings they 
may communicate it, but by their personal 
human presence they may work wonders. 
Lucky is the boy who in his daily environ- 
ment encounters them. He will not need to 
be cajoled or goaded into the industrious pur- 
suit of his own higher education. He will not 
need to be told, in labored exposition, what a 
college is, at its best. He will discover it to 
be a place where minds and bodies, both, 
grow up. — 
Such foreknowledge of the nature and pur- 
pose of his educational opportunities ought 
to be acquired by every intelligent boy, just 
as readily as his foreknowledge of the nature
-P-A-G-E-222
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 199 
and purpose of his athletic opportunities. In 
each case the time he spends on the side 
lines, interestedly watching the performance 
of those more advanced than himself, is well 
spent, provided that he does his own full 
share of active training. Only by some such 
alternation of activities does any one, at any 
age, acquire or maintain the power to. work 
diligently upon the building of foundations 
for a structure which shall ultimately embody 
his own design. And without a chance to 
contemplate the action of minds more highly 
trained than his own, how is any boy-to be- 
come convinced that diligent training is essen- 
tial? 
The foregoing reflections are commonplace 
enough. Yet, if we look about upon the — 
“educational” experiments now in. progress, _ 
how often we see them ignored! We see 
children segregated by ages, and by degrees 
of aptitude for their immediate tasks, with 
the avowed purpose of avoiding the strain of 
competition. We see methodical and unemo- 
tional supervisors of play, marshalling simi- 
larly segregated recruits into dreary games | 
where competition is arbitrarily restricted,
-P-A-G-E-223
200 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
and the fever of high emulation is unknown. 
We see the practice of watching, from the 
side lines, the action of more skilful perform- 
ers, treated with a lofty abhorrence, as some- 
thing idle and vicious; indeed we are told 
that here we see a symptom of national decay, 
and are reminded that even so the gilded 
youth of Rome looked on while the gladi- 
ators fought. And yet every one of us who 
has ever been a real boy knows the burning 
ambitions that are kindled on the side lines, 
and knows that those ambitions, even though 
never directly realized, somehow have the 
power to clarify and organize the resources 
of mind and body for the meeting of diffi- 
culties of diverse kinds. 
A generally unwritten, but well understood, 
college entrance requirement is that the en- 
trant shall have a purpose in entering. No 
admittance except on business must always 
be a rule of the college, as of the school. And 
the boy who is likeliest to enter college with 
‘a well-considered aim, and a working plan, 
is he who has had chances to observe and to 
reflect and to emulate, as here suggested, dur- 
ing his most impressionable years.
-P-A-G-E-224
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS ‘201: 
The process just described begins, as I 
have intimated, while the boy is still young. 
Commonly it begins about four years before , 
the time for going to college. It is no merely | 
accidental coincidence that a boy begins to 
meditate upon his future career at about the 
age at which, if properly prepared, he may 
enter upon the traditional “high school” or 
“academy” studies, as distinguished from the 
studies pursued in grammar schools. There 
comes naturally, at this age, a critical point 
in the developmental process, and it is fitting 
that here the path of education should begin 
amore rapid ascent. (In some degree, per- 
haps, the abruptness of this change is being 
overcome by the institution of the junior high 
school, or the six-year course in a boarding 
school; but Nature decrees that it shall never 
be wholly smoothed out.) So it is fitting, 
also, that the revised procedure of the col- 
leges, with reference to the school records of 
their applicants for admission, should take 
account of all four of these preparatory years. 
To many a boy it is reassuring and stimu- 
lating to be told that from this time on his 
record will “count.”
-P-A-G-E-225
202 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
What are these studies, of which the col- 
lege may wish to examine the record? Eng- 
lish, of course, with much attention to 
spelling, punctuation and paragraphing, with 
more grown-up planning of the arrangement 
of words than has been attempted before; a 
modern foreign language, probably French 
or German; Latin, or a second modern 
language; mathematics; and a rather ele- 
mentary course in some one field of His- 
tory or Science. All of them are studies of 
fundamental value in any broad scheme of 
education, whether it is to lead the boy 
through college or along some other path; 
but a consideration which is often overlooked 
is that the thoroughness of the work at this 
stage is a large factor in determining the 
ultimate success or failure of the plan. At 
this stage the simpler structural principles of 
English composition must be mastered, or 
else all the remaining school work will be 
handicapped; at this stage spelling ordinary 
words correctly must become habitual, and 
the boy’s notion of ordinary words must 
expand until it comprises a respectable vo- 
cabulary; at this stage a sense of the need
-P-A-G-E-226
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 203 
of accurate language should develop (and 
with it the inseparable tendency to argu- 
ment, the stubborn and often annoying de- 
mand for the clarification of minor issues, 
the general matter-of-fact-ness which older 
people often resent, but which is neverthe- 
less a manifestation of a normal and essen- 
tial instinct). I have indicated a choice at 
_ this stage between history and science; but 
my own feeling is that science is the better 
choice, if a good teacher is available, because: 
of the practice it gives in original experimen- 
tal investigation, with the accurate statement 
of findings; and the glimpses of law and order 
which it affords. 
The studies just outlined will occupy, per- 
haps, the boy’s fourteenth year of life; per- 
haps they will run over into his fifteenth. 
Are we overstressing their importance? Read 
the life-story of any notably successful “self- 
made” man, and observe the critical impor- 
tance of this period; or survey the struggles of 
the “hard-luck” candidate for college—the 
one who “does pretty well in daily lessons, 
'. but can’t hit it off in an examination,” and 
piles up a discouraging record of failures de-

spite all that desperate tutors can do in the 
line of cramming—and see where his chief 
difficulties lie. Are they not in spelling and 
punctuation; in the “foundations, never 
properly laid,” of French, or German, or 
Latin; in the elementary operations of arith- 
metic or algebra? Analyzing his shallow, 
inadequate statements upon topics in Eng- 
lish literature, or history, or science, do we 
not usually find that he has dodged the word 
which would have fitted his need because of 
a fear of misspelling it, or that he has pro- 
duced a childishly monotonous paragraph be- 
cause he could not trust himself to punctuate 
correctly the one he would have liked to 
write? Looking back over his school record, 
do we not presently discover that at the 
period under discussion he was lacking in 
thoroughness? Perhaps he was badly taught. 
Perhaps he was lazy. Perhaps he was “grow- 
ing too fast.” Perhaps he was one of those 
precocious, superficial “perfect little gentle- 
men” of the type so well described by Booth 
Tarkington—a type which is the despair of 
schoolmasters. 
Let me not paint too discouraging a pic-
-P-A-G-E-228
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 205 
ture. Salvation is not forfeited by waste of 
opportunity in one’s fourteenth year, if one 
really has the right stuff in him. All teach- 
ers are fallible, few human beings at any age 
are wholly free from laziness, many a boy 
does grow and develop physically so fast that 
for a time he may be unfitted for hard, con- 
sistent study. Equally is it true that many 
a boy, belatedly acquiring the desire for, or 
the unexpected privilege of attempting, a 
“college career,” has successfully completed 
the whole of the preparatory training, self- 
taught, and with astonishing speed. The in- 
dispensable precaution is to make the foun- 
dations secure. 
The sense of having laid secure foundations 
gives to any one, at any age, and in the face 
of any kind of difficulty, a calmness and 
Steadiness which otherwise are quite unat- 
tainable. When we see such calmness and 
Steadiness in a young boy, we call him un- 
commonly mature for his years. Endless 
discussions, in schoolmasters’ offices and else- 
where, revolve about the problem of implant- 
ing this maturity hopefully, though abruptly, 
as a pot-grown perennial expected to flower

immediately, in the scantily tilled soil of 
young and restless minds. It is fairly obvi- 
ous, nevertheless, that as roots which have 
struck deep into the ground are the best 
foundation for the long life of a plant, so 
the experience of having grappled with the 
whole normal array of obstacles, and over- 
come them by dint of long-sustained effort, 
is the best preparation for the well-balanced, 
upward progress of the mind. 
I think few persons doubt, however, that 
the poise and self-reliance gained in one line 
of effort are to a considerable degree trans- 
ferable to other lines. Thus a boy, whose 
early education has been of the sort of which 
we regard Abraham Lincoln’s as the out- 
standing type, may well tackle, and overcome, 
obstacles in the path of study which to a 
less ruggedly trained student would seem in- 
surmountable. Yet it is neither practicable 
nor desirable to prescribe for every school- 
boy the discipline of the frontier. That pre- 
cise form of discipline is indeed approaching 
extinction. What we must try to substitute 
—what, indeed, boys themselves do impose 
with a superb relentlessness upon themselves
-P-A-G-E-230
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 207 
and their fellows in athletic training—is the 
discipline of thoroughness in. everyday tasks. 
That brings forth, in due time, a fighting 
spirit that is unconquerable. And when a 
boy begins to show that spirit, not merely 
before the grand-stand but in. unheralded 
encounters with the difficulties of his daily 
work, he is meeting the broadest and most 
vital of all college entrance requirements. 
In whatever degree a prospective candi- 
date for-college has met this broad require- 
ment, in just that degree he will: approach 
examinations—long or short, announced or 
unannounced—with courage and confidence. 
Having faced a few of these trials of mettle, 
and surmounted a fair proportion of them, 
he may even gain a certain zest for them. 
Every teacher who has had experience in the 
giving of examinations knows that there are 
some pupils who do their best work under 
Stress of such excitement, just as there are 
some—indeed, very many—athletes who are 
at their best in the crisis of a great game. 
Are we to dismiss that significant fact from 
our minds as just a bit of evidence of the 
diversity of temperament? Are we not here
-P-A-G-E-231
208 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
brought face to face with the great aim of 
education? What are we trying to train 
youth up to—a life of dull monotony in the 
placid exercise of certain acquired skills 
(more or less technical, more or less lucra- 
tive, more or less chosen under the spur of 
visible commercial opportunity), or a splen- 
did resourcefulness for the meeting of crises, 
for the solution of unforeseen problems, for 
the endurance of adversity, even disaster, and 
the possible exercise of a saving leadership? 
It would seem that those who are at their 
best under stress should have further prac- 
tice in being at their best, while those who 
cannot sustain the excitement should be seg- 
regated and trained until they can. Yet we 
often see particular favor bestowed upon the 
student whose daily work is of high quality 
by excusing that. student from examina- 
tion. Could any policy be more completely 
grounded in fallacy than that? 
It is really hard to find parallels. If the 
elder lawyer should say to his junior asso- 
ciate, “You have prepared this brief so well 
that I shall excuse you from further partici- 
pation in the case,” we should either have to
-P-A-G-E-232
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 209 
infer that the case was a particularly dreary 
and unprofitable one, or else that the elder 
man was employing the most brutal sarcasm 
in getting rid of an inefficient colleague. If 
a coach should say to a member of his team, 
“You are clearly our ablest player, and you 
may absent yourself without discredit from 
all our match games,” the inevitable con- 
' dusion would be that either the competition 
or the coach was without value. 
On one ground, and one only, may a stu- 
dent’s exemption from customary examina- 
tions as a recognition of scholarly attainment 
be justified: namely, on the ground that he 
has completed his preparatory studies, with 
full and successful participation in exami- 
nations along the way, and with so high a 
rank that his readiness for college work may 
safely be assumed, without the imposition of 
entrance examinations. Exemption, in these 
circumstances, is a stimulus to the student, 
who feels that he must justify it by his work 
in college, if for no other reason than to 
uphold his school. But this is a matter of col- 
lege policy, and while the schools may wel- 
come it as a test of their strength, it has no
-P-A-G-E-233
210 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
support to give to any tendency to omit 
examinations “in course”; indeed, it gives 
further emphasis to their value. 
I have been careful, in the preceding para- 
graph, to refer to customary examinations. If 
the college is one of those which accepts stu- 
dents “on certificate” from qualified schools, 
its newly admitted freshmen will scarcely 
have finished congratulating themselves on 
their care-free estate when examinations “in 
course” will loom again upon the horizon; 
and every year the casualties are many at 
such seasons. So we are reminded that this 
is the kind of examination peril which is 
most likely to bring the unwary to their 
undoing. 
If any one imagines himself as about to 
wage a debate with some opponent formid- 
able in argument, he begins to think out his 
position in words. He does not utter the 
words; but he thinks them, choosing them 
with care to express his precise meaning; and 
he matches the effect of these words against 
the imagined attack. This is just the sort of 
process that most of us go through when it 
is too late; when we have been caught off
-P-A-G-E-234
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS au 
our guard, and worsted in an argument. We 
fight the battle over again in imagination, 
employing clean-cut phrase and brilliant epi- 
gram, with prodigious imagined effects. A 
few grains of comfort may be gained from 
even so belated a precipitation of our ideas, 
for at least we are somewhat better prepared 
in the event of a renewal of the fray. Even 
if our steps are thus painfully taken, under 
the repeated spur of disillusionment regarding 
our powers of debate, they lead us forward; 
and as we grow older, we more and more think 
in words when trying to formulate an opinion” 
on even a minor point, or when seeing some- 
thing of which we hope to be able to give a 
description later. I am inclined to believe 
that, as we progressively achieve this power, 
we lose the power to sympathize with the 
unformulated and incoherent thinking of 
youth. 
I once had in my possession, for a brief 
time, a remarkable and valuable document, 
which I wished to show to each member of 
a large group of boys. There were over a 
hundred individuals in the group; I felt com- 
pelled to take special precautions against
-P-A-G-E-235
212 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
crowding or jostling, and I felt that I had no 
right to let the document go out of my hands, 
So I asked them to pass before me in single 
file, each pausing for a moment before the 
precious relic which I held. They complied 
eagerly, and with conscientiously maintained 
order; and so impressed were they that their 
monosyllabic comments were given almost in 
whispers as they passed. I alone heard all 
the comments, and all were alike: “Gee!” 
A procession of older persons would have 
acted very differently, I thought. Some 
would have rehearsed in advance, and de- 
livered with unction, sentiments. supposedly 
fitting the occasion; some would have been 
monosyllabic; a few would have looked in- 
tently and said nothing; a very few might 
have observed some minute peculiarities of 
the document, and remarked upon them. I 
am by no means sure that the level of rever- 
ent attention would have been kept as high as 
the boys kept it. But the interesting thing 
was that the boys were all reacting in the 
same fashion, and apparently were not think- 
ing in words at all. 
It would be a great pity if any educational
-P-A-G-E-236
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 213. 
procedure should tend to the suppression of 
genuine instinctive response, and the substi- 
tution of vain platitude;. but practice in the 
exact use of words is a wholly different mat- 
ter, and solitary practice, without the inter- 
vention of speech or writing to produce self- 
consciousness, is invaluable. The student 
who has discovered this, and made good use 
of his discovery, will find that his mind’s 
action, both in learning and in giving account 
of what has been learned, will be greatly 
accelerated. And this sort of skill should be 
sought early. It will be indispensable in col- 
lege. In school it will hasten the develop- 
ment of that grown-up appreciation of Jan- 
guage, as the vehicle of ideas, without which. 
a boy, however intelligent, will be uncouth 
and childish. 
In the third year prior to college entrance 
the student’s work continues along the same 
general lines as before; and if he has not 
been negligent of earlier steps, he finds great 
pleasure as well as profit in certain of his 
tasks, One reason is that the subject-matter 
is becoming more interesting; but another 
treason is that the boy is becoming better able
-P-A-G-E-237
214 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
to appreciate poetry, to venerate antiquity, 
and to project his own figure into the mists 
of the future as the figure of a man, rather 
than a boy. This new ability is the result of 
a tremendous mental change. In the course 
of the change his brief but pugnacious stand 
for the visible and tangible was well taken, 
but he no longer feels compelled to assert it; 
now he plants his feet upon the solid ground 
he has acquired, and begins to take observa- 
tions of infinity. 
This is the time for a rapidly growing 
acquaintance with literature, no longer by 
elementary considerations of spelling and 
punctuation and the parts of speech. We 
teachers seldom feel that we can safely rele- 
gate those formal things to the background 
altogether; but this is the time to begin the 
reckoning with depths and distances. Also, 
at this time, the natural sciences should begin 
to have a large share of attention. Biology 
in particular can give a tremendously stimu- 
lating revelation to the developing mind at 
this stage, while if attempted earlier it has 
to be taken in a much more dilute and child-

ish form. History now becomes an impt _____ 
part of the program; and if it is practicable 
to carry it as a continuing course through © 
  the two years to follow, the sequence should. 
naturally be Ancient, Medieval and Modern 
European, American. If it be not practicable - 
to study all three of these fields, it is wise 
to consider carefully the opportunities ahead, 
in the choice of college studies, before decid- 
ing which one to omit in school. No risk 
should be incurred of omitting anyone of 
them altogether. , 
In mathematics, plane geometry is com- 
monly studied after algebra; and even in 
schools which reverse the order it will be 
found helpful to bring in a review of plane 
geometry toward the end of the course. For 
many students, the college preparatory work 
in mathematics will go no farther than this; 
afew, having clearly in mind the trend of 
future studies, will carry on with solid geome- 
try and trigonometry. Those who plan to 
do that must plan carefully in order that the 
senior year in school may not be a year of 
overcrowding; for the same students. will wish
-P-A-G-E-239
216 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
to secure a thorough elementary grounding in 
either chemistry or physics. 
The language studies will move on unin- 
terruptedly until those points are reached at 
which, in the older manner of reckoning these 
attainments, two, or three, or four “units” of 
credit, as the case may be, have been earned. 
Most of the colleges which use this scale of 
“units” require a total of fourteen or fifteen, 
preferably fifteen; and most of them are care- 
ful to stipulate that English, a modern foreign 
language, a second foreign language either 
ancient or modern, mathematics, history, and 
the natural sciences shall all be represented. 
The English course (including both compo- 
sition and literature) is awarded three units; 
French or German, carried to the “intermedi- 
ate” stage, will similarly score three; Latin 
or Greek may score two, three or four, but 
the two-unit credit in Latin is not recognized 
by all colleges; French or German in the 
“advanced” stage will have four units of 
credit, but few students go so far with either 
of these languages in the preparatory school. 
Elementary. algebra will yield two units, to 
which advanced algebra will add half a unit.
-P-A-G-E-240
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 217 
Solid geometry and trigonometry count for 
half a unit each; and the various one-year 
courses in the several fields of. science one 
unit each. A unit is supposed to stand 
for a year’s work in any given study, as the 
time is commonly apportioned in well-admin- 
istered schools; but in the language courses, 
particularly, the average boy needs to put in 
more time than the units suggest. Again the 
emphasis comes back upon the advantage of 
having laid one’s foundations thoroughly. 
All this reckoning of units has an unfortu- 
nate aspect, as well as an undeniably conven- 
ient one. It is unfortunate when it tends to 
give to students and their parents the idea 
that these quantitative symbols are the end 
and aim of school work. It is convenient 
when it serves as a scheme of notation while 
we are trying to balance the student’s ration 
of studies. It is on the whole too-much talked 
about, yet we should have difficulty in doing 
without it altogether. It is most emphasized 
in the “Old Plan” of testing applicants for 
admission to college, and least emphasized 
in the “New Plan,” which happily is making 
converts rapidly. Before we drop it from

consideration, we may as well put it to use 
in displaying a few sample assortments of 
college-preparatory studies:

Of these groups, numbers 1, 3 and 5 are 
suitable choices for students who expect, 
later, to be candidates for the degree of 
Bachelor of Arts; and numbers 2 and 4—the 
former with no Latin, the latter with only 
two units of it—for those who expect to try 
to become Bachelors of Science; for it is a 
curious feature of the present-day practice 
that those choices (no longer accorded the 
old-time importance) are virtually made be- 
fore entering college. 
Of course there are many options which are 
not represented in these sample lists. One
-P-A-G-E-242
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 219 
may, for instance, offer three units of Greek; 
formerly this was very commonly done, and 
signs of a revival of interest in Greek are not 
lacking. One may even, at some colleges, 
offer Greek without Latin, though I have not 
known any student who has done so. One 
may, of course, if very ambitious or very 
prudent, offer extra units; and indeed this 
is a common practice. I have limited my 
groups to the fifteen-unit standard in order 
to show the slenderness of actual require- 
ments. Some parents, going over a school 
curriculum in advance of sending their sons, 
tend to map out more extensive programs 
than these, and seem surprised and a bit 
impatient when their efforts are curbed by 
the schoolmaster. Vet these same people 
will, in other moods, inveigh against the bur- 
densome demands of the colleges. 
Colleges which demand a wide array of 
examination grades as the credentials of a 
new recruit—in other words, colleges which 
adhere to the “Old Plan” of imposing exami- 
nations in all the required preparatory studies 
~generally provide for the taking of. those 
examinations in several successive . instal-
-P-A-G-E-243
220 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
ments; so that a candidate may “pass off” 
certain studies two years, or more, before 
going to college. This is a necessary arrange- 
ment, so long as the requirements stand as 
they are, for it would be impossible to pur- 
sue the whole list of studies, with any sort 
of scholarly thoroughness, in one year. Only 
out-and-out cramming schools attempt such 
things. But unfortunately the step-by-step 
“passing off” of required studies is, measured 
by real educational standards, a terribly in- 
efficient method. It provides for no synthesis 
of what has been so laboriously acquired. 
Too often the essence of all the instruction 
received passes off, and there remains little 
more than an imposingly formal record of 
tasks completed, and “credits” duly regis- 
tered. 
Colleges which do not insist upon entrance 
examinations, but accept students “on cer- 
tificate” from approved schools, generally 
accord to the schools a good deal of freedom 
in the determination of the sequence of 
studies, and the number to be attempted in 
one year; and it is urged with some force 
that the discretion vested in the schoolmaster
-P-A-G-E-244
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 221 
by this arrangement is a stimulus to educa- 
tional efficiency. Yet there is an ever-present 
danger of slumping away from standards once 
set up, and certain groups of these colleges 
have found it necessary to establish central 
supervisory boards which check up the col- _ 
lege records of the students recruited from 
the various schools, and are empowered to 
withdraw the privilege of certification from 
schools which prove unworthy. Undoubtedly 
this makes the schoolmasters exercise. great 
care in the granting of certificates; but’ so

will prevail as under the “Old Plan” with its

tained certificate grade” in a course will feel 
that he may dismiss that course from his mind _

adopted by Yale, Princeton, and others, re-

tem while transferring the emphasis from the 
examinations themselves to the orderly. suc-’.

cession of studies on which they are sup- 
posedly based. The inferior student, or the 
student who, under force of circumstances, 
has been kept shifting from school to school, 
without continuity of preparation, will not 
find it adapted to his needs; but for the con- 
scientious worker who can produce a record 
of ordered progress, it has great advantages. 
Under this plan there is little or no discussion 
of units. It is stipulated that all the depart- 
ments of study we have been considering— 
English, foreign languages, history, mathe- 
matics, science—must be represented in the 
record, which, as furnished to the college by 
the school, must show the candidate’s stand- 
ing in every study during four years; and with 
this scholastic record there must be submitted 
a candid statement about the boy’s character, 
interests, and influence. Here is a real 
chance for those qualities of faithfulness and 
thoroughness to count, not only in the main- 
tenance of a high scholastic rank—which 
through this plan receives increased recogni- 
tion—but also as virtues entitled to their own 
rewards. The college needs those virtues in 
its recruits. No examinations are imposed
-P-A-G-E-246
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 223 
until the end of the school course, and then 
four are given, covering the studies of the 
last year. One of these must be English; in 
the choice of the remaining three, there are 
chances to fit the course to individual needs, 
so that each student may hope to show the 
best work of which he is capable. The atti- 
tude is one of looking for his strength, and 
not his weakness. Moreover, the papers are 
passed upon as a group—a collective exhibit 
of the boy’s prowess—and not as separate 
struggles to win separate credits. It is pos- 
" sible for a brilliant performance in one exami- 
nation to offset a clumsy piece of work in 
another, and it is possible to receive recog- 
nition for real intellectual power in spite of 
minor slips which pull down percentage 
Scores, 
The wholesome results already attained 
through the ““New Plan” have exceeded expec- 
tations and given ground for the belief that 
we are really getting away from the old 
mechanical counting of credits and substitut- 
ing an incentive to true scholarship, which is 
effective from the very beginning of a boy’s 
school career; and by looking for his abili-

224 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
ties rather than for his disabilities, the “New 
Plan” is a subtle but powerful influence in the 
investment of all secondary school work with 
a greater dignity than it had before. There 
is reason to hope that this may be but the 
beginning of a reform which shall, in the 
course of the next decade, bring about the 
abolition of many of the old clumsy prac- 
tices which are as disastrous for the colleges 
as for the schools. The number of colleges 
which accept the “New Plan” is steadily grow- 
ing, and intimations are not wanting of a 
preferential consideration in the future for ° 
“New Plan” candidates when the steadily in- 
creasing pressure at the gates of our colleges 
shall compel the adoption of more thorough 
methods of preliminary sorting than have 
hitherto prevailed. 
Here we may dismiss the topic of college 
entrance examinations and return to the 
broader aspects of college entrance require- 
ments. Is it going too far to include in our 
picture of the requirements the intelligent, 
deliberate choice of the college which one 
is to try to enter? I think not. Colleges 
differ far more widely than do the rules
-P-A-G-E-248
    ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 225 
governing their admission of recruits, and the 
day is coming when no thoughtful boy will © 
attend a given institution solely for the 
reason that his father attended it, or solely 
for the reason that he has good friends who 
are headed in that direction. Those motives 
may pull strongly, and it is right that they 
should, but a careful weighing of all. the 
evidence available will often bring to a 
boy’s attention strong reasons for the con- 
sideration of courses of study of which his 
father and friends may never have known. 
As the scholarly instinct becomes more and 
more the traditional thing in our schools, so 
the intelligent discussion of the opportunities 
offered at various different colleges, quite 
apart from ephemeral conditions of athletic 
glory, will more and more prevail, and: no 
boy ought to go to college at all without 
having thought very seriously upon these 
things and talked them over with well quali 
fied advisers. 
Here it may be well to make brief: refer- 
ence to a question frequently propounded in 
an extremely shallow and unprofitable way. 
Is a ‘small college better than a big one?
-P-A-G-E-249
226 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
Many persons seem to think that the only 
considerations to be weighed in reaching an 
answer to this question are considerations of 
the relative prevalence of distracting influ- 
ences, Small colleges are very commonly situ- 
ated in country towns, though by no means 
always. Big colleges are very commonly 
parts of still bigger universities, and often 
they are in metropolitan situations. If the 
questioner should ask, “Is my boy the sort 
that you would not allow to go to a large city 
unchaperoned and would prefer to see estab- 
lished in some wholesome task in a quiet, 
country village?” the schoolmaster might 
readily answer. The question clearly is on 
the strength or weakness of the boy. But 
to say that a given college is better than 
another because it is likely to offer a safer 
environment to a morally flabby recruit is 
not to judge colleges by a very lofty standard 
of measurement, and it is always unfortunate 
to drive the boy into such introspective mis- 
givings about himself. If a boy is fit to go 
to college at all, he should be ready to face 
the world and uphold his own true standards 
without any cowardly palpitations.
-P-A-G-E-250
  ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 227 
   ‘Furthermore, he should surely formulate in 
his own mind, and be prepared to follow, a 
code of conduct which will help forward the 
tendency, everywhere strikingly shown, to 
. take the colleges more and more communi- 
  ties of men and not of boys. This is not 
purely a matter of age: it is, indeed, very 
largely a matter of attitude. It is true that 
in the early phases of American educational 
institutions conditions were very different, 
and the college occupied a réle not very dif- 
ferent from that now taken by the school 
which prepares for college. Then boys. en- 
tered college at the age of fourteen and dis- 
played during their college years all those 
forms of exuberance which characterize boys 
between fourteen and eighteen when assem- 
bled in large groupings with scanty super- 
Vision. In those days, too, the colleges meted 
out discipline of a correspondingly crude 
order. Floggings were administered and stu- 
dents were shut in their rooms for varying 
Periods. That sort of thing is nowadays re- 
garded as too childish for even a self-respect-

responsibility, even to the length of partici- 
pation in the formulation of official policies, 
is a very striking evidence of the great change 
that has taken place. 
Yet here and there stray echoes of the 
confusion of the old days instigate reversions 
to old form, and there is still too general an 
acceptance of the silly belief that a boy who 
has been manly and trustworthy in his senior 
year at school will be expected in his fresh- 
man year at college to become a sort of child- 
ish ruffian with a profoundly cynical disregard 
of all serious purposes and occupations. It is 
easily noticed by any one with the slightest 
observational capacity that the leaders whom 
freshmen, themselves, elect to important 
offices are never of this type. The noisy 
and disorderly freshman has his own reward, 
but it is a reward in which there are no last- 
ing satisfactions. 
In the foregoing pages I have tried to show 
the great importance of keeping one’s aim 
steadily in mind; of looking hopefwly ahead 
to the college years while one is still in school, 
and of looking ahead even beyond the college 
years to active participation in the work of
-P-A-G-E-252

the world. At the same time, I have tried to 
show the balance and moderation which 
characterize the demands of the colleges, as 
expressed’ in their statements of entrance re- 
quirements; desiring thereby. to vindicate the 
value of a “college preparatory” course in 
school, even to the boy who by adverse cir- 
cumstance is denied the privilege of going to 
college. So long as one always looks ahead, 
and entertains worthy purposes, I believe that 
this general scheme of education has merits 
which should lead any boy to think very care- 
fully before turning aside from it into any 
short cut to vocational proficiency. 
Vocations change, but in the wider ranges 
of its effort a man’s mind searches for un- 
changing things—for principles of thought 
and action in which he may place his trust 
when everything else in the world seems to be 
crumbling. 
And while it is a splendid thing to reach, 
at an early age, a well-considered decision as 
to one’s future vocation, it is still better to 
teach that and something more: the resolve: 
to be one who in a changing order can find
-P-A-G-E-253
230 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
new paths, and be a leader in some new kind 
of progress. 
The worst advisers in a boy’s education are 
old people who have forgotten that the world 
moves; while his very best advisers may be 
‘people equally old, but who are of the type 
that welcomes new ideas. One of the most 
obnoxious of old, outworn ideas is that which 
pictures “the world” as a place of grimy 
struggle through long uninteresting years, 
before plunging into which the specially for- 
tunate may enjoy a brief holiday in college. 
If the sense of preparing for college gives 
zest and purpose to the years spent in school, 
and it is. therefore essential (as I maintain) 
to begin young at this practice of looking 
forward, why halt the lifting of the horizon 
when one reaches college? Why not keep on 
looking forward? Why not really think of 
college as the scene of vigorous preparation 
for a vigorous working life? 
I venture to say that there are very few 
children who take any stock in the foolish 
assertion that childhood is our happiest time; 
but there is some reason to fear that college 
students are more easily humbugged than
-P-A-G-E-254

children, And it is this humbugging per- 
formance, this dreary wagging of heads and. 
repeating of old cynicisms, that sometimes 
does seem to turn a boy’s eyes away from the 
vision he might otherwise attain. So it be- — 
hooves those who would see the preparation” 
for college really accomplished with whole- 
some completeness, to begin: early their 
aggressive campaign of insistence on. the 
practice of independent foresight. 
Thus far this has been intended as a mes-. 
sage to parents, conveying some very simple 
ideas about the guidance of a boy. It may 
be that a summary of these ideas, translated’ . 
into the form of a message to the boy himself, 
will best show how very simple they are. 
Look far ahead; have a plan. 
Practise; emulate; be thorough from the 
Start. 
Welcome searching tests of your prowess; 
if you dodge them, you yourself will be in 
doubt about your own powers. 
Always try to have words in mind to con- 
vey your exact ideas. : 
Re-examine old ideas with the aid of new 
ones as you gain them.
-P-A-G-E-255
232, EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
Cultivate special interests diligently, but 
do not narrow your ability. New interests 
are bound to arise. 
Choose your college with due thought for 
the studies you hope to pursue, the friend- 
ships you hope to establish, and the tradi- 
tions you intend to maintain. Don’t assume 
that all college curricula are alike; they differ 
much more than do the entrance require- 
ments. 
Don’t choose your college with reference 
to your own negative qualifications. Don’t 
hope to prosper in a small college if you feel 
that you are too feeble a character to keep 
your feet on the ground in a big one. 
Keep on growing up. Don’t accept the 
carnival theory of the freshman year. 
Look ahead just as much in college as you 
did in school. 
So shall you find that college is better than 
school, and that later life promises to be 
even better than college.

THE FUTURE TREND OF THE 
PRIVATE SCHOOL 
Tue foregoing chapters have discussed in 
detail the fundamental elements in the edu- 
cation of the modern boy: his home, his play, 
his studies and his religion. They are funda- 
mental, because. heart, body, mind and soul 
are the primary elements_of _his_being and 
not oné of them can be ignored in his develop- 
ment to a manhood that lieth four square. 
Any education worth while must be in these 
four dimensions, but the education of the 
modern boy demands their inclusion in his 
Preparation for good citizenship in a de- 
mocracy. This is the traditional motive of 
American education, its ultimate goal, and 
in its development the private school has 
played an important part. Whatever its 
future may be, there can be no doubt that. 
the private school has served the community 
in many ways and made a distinct contribu- 
tion to National education. 
Conditions, however, have changed and the 
233
-P-A-G-E-257
234 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
presence everywhere of the public school sug- 
gests that the private school is no longer a 
necessity and may become only an expensive 
luxury to be enjoyed by the few. Though 
recent criticisms of the private school may be 
unfair, they raise the justifiable question, can 
the private school render a service to educa- 
tion that cannot be rendered by the public 
school? Many answers to this question in 
defense of the private school are not in them- 
selves final or adequate. The private school 
can no longer claim academic superiority in 
the development of American education. 
Looking back to when academies were 
founded in New England and church schools 
in various centers in the Southern States, 
there was a definite necessity for their exist- 
ence. High schools had been established 
only in large cities, but many of them were 
incompetent to prepare for college or to com- 
plete the secondary period of education. 
Again, with the settlement of the Middle 
West and later, of the Northwest, private 
schools were started by all religious denomi- 
nations as the churches moved with the popu- 
lation. They were necessary because the
-P-A-G-E-258
     THE FUTURE TREND 235 
State was not ready or equipped to furnish 
education. This necessity has now passed. 
The development of the high school and its 
- ptesence everywhere has made the private 
'. school unnecessary except in such remote dis- 
 tricts or unusual communities where the high 
school is not of a sufficiently high standard to 
}. seve its mission. There are many high 
schools throughout the country. that fail to 
come up to the proper standard, but this fact 
does not enter into the present discussion. 
The principle is established that the State is 
under obligation to furnish an education of 
.. high quality and of recognized standard 
Within the reach of every boy and girl of the 
secondary school age. 
When the public school system is in com- 
Plete operation the academic necessity for 
the private school will cease to be. Admit- 
ting this, will there not always be a need for 
the boarding school? - With the growth of 
our cities and the consequent congestion, the 
- ity becomes less and less desirable every 
_ year for the bringing up of boys and girls 
between the ages of twelve and eighteen. 
: The absence of proper conditions, the dif-

ficulty or impossibility of providing proper 
playgrounds, the distractions and temptations 
of city life, all unite to influence parents who 
can afford to do so, to send their children to 
boarding schools. In these schools their chil- 
dren have the advantages they are deprived 
of in the cities and are saved from the disad- 
vantages that modern city life involves. 
Therefore, say their defenders, the boarding 
schools are now necessary, not because the 
“State fails to furnish adequate academic ad- 
vantages, but because the conditions of our 
life are such that it is no longer desirable for 
our children to be brought up in their own 
homes. But this defense cuts both ways. If 
it be true that the conditions in our cities are 
such that boys cannot be educated properly 
under the conditions without detriment to 
their health and character, then, indeed, the 
city must meet these conditions. If it be 
established that the boarding school is a 
necessity for the boy whose parents can afford 
to send him, then also it becomes a necessity 
for the boy whose parents cannot afford to 
send him, and the obligation must be shoul- 
dered by the State.

  THE FUTURE TREND 2 
Within the city limits of Boston, there are 
two of the oldest schools in this country; 
- both of honored lineage and of high traditions.’ : - 
~The Boston Latin School and the Roxbury.” 
Latin School were founded in the very earliest 
- days of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, one a * 
public school, in the generally accepted mean- 
ing of that term, and the other a private - 
“school so far as it is free from any State 
or city control. Plans are under way and a - - 
~ large sum of money has been raised to move 
the Roxbury Latin School into the country. 
“There can be no doubt about the wisdom ~ 
_ of this plan and if it be wise for the Roxbury: 
Latin School, why not for the Boston Latin’ 
- School? To go a step farther, suppose it 
should seem wise to its trustees to make Rox- 
bury Latin School a boarding school, would 
any one question that the trustees had a right 
80 to do if the change was for the benefit of 
the boys? Now the point is, that if this be 
wise and even necessary for this old-estab- 
lished private school, why should it not be 
wise and necessary for the other old-estab- - 
lished public school? : 
-. Itis not beyond the possibilities that in a 
          
   
 
-P-A-G-E-261
238 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
few years the State may consider the board- 
ing school a necessity and, if a necessity, 
it would have to meet it and provide board- 
ing schools, to meet the evils of the congested 
conditions of our cities. The argument, there- 
fore, for the necessity of the private school 
fails to stand on either of these grounds. On 
the one hand, it cannot simply be a parallel 
of the public school in the academic advan- 
tages it offers, nor, on the other hand, can it 
justify its existence by furnishing to a limited 
few an opportunity which may be the duty of 
the State to supply to all. 
There remains, however, a third essential 
element of education which hitherto has been 
considered beyond the possibility of the State 
to supply. By the limitation of the National 
Constitution, it has been assumed that reli- 
gious instruction cannot be given in the 
schools. But even this limitation can be met 
by codperation with the religious organiza- 
tions of the community. This codperation is 
already a fact in a number of cities and is 
working with apparent success. There are 
at the present time, hundreds of thousands of 
school children in a number of our large cities
-P-A-G-E-262
  THE FUTURE TREND 
that are receiving weekly instruction d 
school hours under the direction of the 
gious body to which they belong. This p._ _. .. 
not perfect, but where it is in operation it is * 
at least a partial substitute for the normal 
instruction under perfectly free conditions. ~ 
Until a comparatively recent period it has... 
been taken for granted that religious instruc- 
tion during regular school hours was impos- 
_ sible without the violation of our fundamen-. 
tal law, but the experiment referred to has © 
had sufficient success to warrant its extension. 
The private school, therefore, can no longer 
make as a specific claim for its existence, that 
religious teaching is its peculiar privilege. 
Nevertheless, there will be always a demand . 
on the part of many religious organizations - 
that religious instruction, though possible, is 
inadequate in the State school and that there- ~ 
fore it must insist on its right that. one of . 
these primary elements should not be omitted « 
in the boy’s education. moe 
If these things be so, why should the pr 
vate school continue to be? If the State is” 
competent to fulfil the whole obligation, is 
- itnot inevitable that the private school must 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
240 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
go? There remains, however, another con- 
sideration which not only gives it a right to 
be, but assures it a permanent place. The 
private school is free. It possesses its own 
soul which cannot be taken away from it. 
The private school has a freedom which the 
public school cannot have even under the best 
conceivable conditions. Though thus far the 
danger of political control has not been great 
enough to cause serious alarm, the menace is 
not imaginary nor is the future secure. The 
attempts already made to infringe on the 
liberty of teaching have been checked if not 
permanently nullified, and it is evident that 
the disposition of the courts is on the side of 
freedom. The law passed by the State of 
Nebraska to forbid the teaching of German 
in the public schools was thwarted by judicial 
decision, and the Tennessee law so obviously’ 
violates freedom of thought and freedom of 
speech that there can be no doubt of its meet- 
ing the same fate. 
The Oregon law which attempted to close 
all private schools has been declared uncon- 
stitutional by the unanimous decision of the 
Supreme Court. These attempts of the
-P-A-G-E-264
THE FUTURE TREND MAL 
‘States to control the subject matter taught in 
the schools. and the purpose of Oregon to 
«dose all schools not under State control, are 
symptoms of an attitude that involves more 
. than appears in the object sought. Back of 
- | these efforts toward control lies the heresy 
__ that the State, not the parent, is the guardian 
of the child. It is encouraging to note that 
the decision of the Supreme Court in the 
Oregon case goes to the very root of the 
matter. “We think it entirely plain,” runs 
the decision, “that the Act of 1922 unreason- 
ably interferes with the liberty of parents and 
guardians to direct the upbringing and edu- 
cation of children under their control. As 
often heretofore pointed out, rights guaran- 
teed by the Constitution may not be abridged 
by legislation which has no reasonable rela- 
tion to some purpose within the competency 
of the State. The fundamental theory of 
liberty upon which all governments in this 
Union repose excludes any general power of 
the State to standardize its children by forc- 
ing them to accept instruction from public 
teachers only. The child is not the mere 
Creature of the State; those who nurture him 
            
            
-P-A-G-E-265
242 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
and direct his destiny have the right, coupled 
with the high duty, to recognize and prepare 
him for additional obligations.’* 
Such a statement, made by the highest 
authority in the land would seem to insure 
the continuance of the private school, but it 
does not assure the danger of other attacks 
on the freedom of the public school. There is 
a strong movement afoot for Federal centrali- 
zation, and a demand for a Department of 
Education, with a Cabinet Secretary. The 
motive for such centralization is that our 
schools throughout the country should be set 
the highest standards and should be kept up 
to these standards. An active tendency in 
our educational development is undoubtedly 
toward standardization which means not 
progress, but stagnation. Though it be ad- 
mitted that the schools in France and Ger- 
many are academically superior to anything 
that this country has produced, the superior- 
ity has been gained by depriving the parent 
of any personal control of his child’s educa- 
tion under a system that regards the child as

and 584—October term, 1924,

award of the State. It may be that sooner 
or later some definition will have to be 
made of the relation of the private school to 
the State and some supervision insisted on, 
to assure the child his rights to an adequate 
education. This may mean a curtailment of 
its liberty, but under present conditions the 
private school has a freedom that is impos- 
_ sible under any State system, however wise 
    and liberal it may be. 
To make use of its freedom is the manifest 
duty of the private school. This should be 
its future tendency if it claims a right to exist- 
ence. It has not taken advantage of its free- 
dom in the past, and in recent times, while 
boasting of its liberty, it has become subservi- 
ent to another master. The very name com- 
monly used for the private school of the 
Secondary grade is an admission of its servi- 
tude. It is a preparatory school and just so 
long as it continues to be a preparatory school 
it will fail to make use of its freedom. The 
vital period in education is that covered by 
the years from twelve to eighteen. It is a 
Period of intellectual awakening, a period that 
determines vocation, a period that makes or
-P-A-G-E-267
244 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
mars the future scholar. To use this period, 
primarily if not solely, to meet a quantitative 
demand, is a surrender of the school’s richest 
privilege. 
For nine-tenths of the boys in this country, 
the period covers the whole of their formal 
education, and this fact entails responsibility 
serious enough to give pause to all schools in 
the choice of the content and aim of curricula. 
That the schools which have unqualified free- 
dom should shape their ends to any external 
demand, and limit their opportunity to any 
requirement, is an abdication of rights which 
can hardly escape the charge of cowardice. 
This is the present situation. The prepara- 
tory schools are not living their own intel- 
lectual lives; they live, move and have their 
being in traveling toward the country of 
intellectual hopes, where education is to be 
found. The journey is only the process of 
reaching the desired country as quickly as 
possible. If there be short cuts, so much the 
better, for the journey has no benefits and 
delights of its own. 
There is no reason to complain of college 
requirements. They cover a wide field and
-P-A-G-E-268
    THE FUTURE TREND 245 
set standards within the reach of average 
intelligence. College examinations are no 
_harder or more exacting than they were a 
generation ago, but they have become a 
standard by which the schools are tested and 
a goal toward which all intellectual effort 
tends. Today the high school is freer than 
the private school. As the secretary of 
Princeton College has recently stated, the 
high school cannot possibly gear its courses 
in preparation for the standard of a college 
examination. It is well for their freedom that 
they cannot. Only a small percentage of 
those entering the high school goes on to 
college and to shape the courses of the high 
school for the benefit of this small percentage 
would be manifestly unjust to the large per- 
centage of boys and girls who do not go on. 
There are, to be sure, in our large cities, high 
schools that perform a special function and 
are in a sense preparatory schools, but in so 
far as this becomes the chief aim of the school 
it is a distinct limitation of freedom. 
If the Harvard Law School should exist 
Primarily for preparing its graduates to pass 
the bar examinations of Massachusetts or
-P-A-G-E-269
246 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
New York, it would cease to be an institution 
worthy of consideration. If Harvard College 
existed to prepare its graduates for profes- 
sional schools, it would before long cease to 
be, and yet our secondary schools are content 
to be preparatory schools instead of repudiat- 
ing such an unworthy designation. It is im- 
portant that this should be clearly understood, 
if the private school is to justify its existence. 
Just as it goes without saying that a gradu- 
ate of Harvard College is prepared to do 
the work of a professional school and that a 
graduate of the Harvard Law School is 
equipped for preparation for the bar exami- 
nations, so also it ought to go without saying 
that the graduate of a secondary school is 
prepared to enter college. This, however, is 
a very different thing from the present prac- 
tice of the use of four to six years in specific 
and technical training to pass examinations 
given by the College Entrance Examination 
Board. ‘Statistics show that the graduates of 
private schools are better prepared for these 
examinations than the graduates of the high 
schools, and this in spite of the fact that only 
the superior members of the high school take
-P-A-G-E-270
      THE FUTURE TREND 247 
college examinations, whereas the average 
and the inferior of the private schools meet 
these tests. In fact the reason for attendance 
in private schools of a large percentage of 
their membership is because these schools can 
prepare them better for college than the high 
schools in the communities from which they 
come. The future trend of the private school, 
if it is to be wholesome and progressive, must 
~ begin with the declaration of independence of 
college examinations. 
Having acquired its freedom or in making 
far wider use of it than it has hitherto, the 
private school must move toward higher 
Standards of scholarship. This does not mean 
| higher marks in college examinations, but 
tather the production of higher scholars and 
the development of the boy of superior 
ability. Up to this time the superior boy is 
the one neglected in our schools. So much 
energy is spent in bringing the inferior up 
to the average and the average up to the 
Superior, that the really superior student 
_ lnarks time in the process of education. . If 
~ he rises into the realm of high scholarship it 
is because of his own personal effort and
-P-A-G-E-271
248 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
endeavor and not because of the school. The 
most that is expected of the boy of superior 
ability, and really the best that he can do, 
is to so prepare for the college examinations 
that he will receive high marks as his reward. 
When the new plan of admission to college 
was set forth it seemed to promise an escape 
from servitude and an opportunity for the 
development of the scholar. The compre- 
hensive examinations were to eliminate spe- 
cific preparation and give the opportunity 
both to the school and to the student for 
development in scholarship. Unfortunately 
this great end is not being attained and the 
new plan means little more than a relief from 
certain examinations and a justifiable credit 
for school work. We have become so ob- 
sessed with the idea that the school is a pre- 
paratory school that nothing but a declaration 
of independence made good by a revolution 
will give the school its freedom. 
The trend of the modern school should be 
toward the development of the superior 
scholar. It may still minister to the average, 
it may still tolerate the inferior, but it must 
see that it has a primary obligation to the
-P-A-G-E-272
THE FUTURE TREND 249 
boy of more than average ability and must 
bend at least a share of its energies toward 
the education of the scholar without regard 
or reference to college requirements. No 
criticism of the college is intended or im- 
plied. We have no quarrel with the college 
demand. The sole contention is that the 
school period is the time for the making of 
the scholar, and not for preparing him to 
be made in college. The American college 
has a larger mission than the production of 
,. scholars. It is the melting pot of young men 
  brought up under the varying conditions of 
our American life. 
The boy born of illiterate foreign parents 
~ who has exhibited in the school an intellect- 
ual ability worthy of admission to college, 
. comes there into immediate contact with the 
» Son of intellectual parentage and with young 
» men brought up in material prosperity. The 
American college is a democracy, as democ- 
‘tacy should be rightly defined. It contains 
ten of all classes and distinctions. The son 
of the man that works with his hands is on an 
equality with the son of the college professor 
or the son of the capitalist of world-wide
-P-A-G-E-273
_250 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
reputation. As President Butler has pointed 
out, it would be a national misfortune if the 
energies of the college were to be devoted 
solely to the superior scholar. The college 
offers him every opportunity for the attain- 
ment of the highest scholarship, but it offers 
also to the average man the chance for a 
broad and sound education that will fit him 
the better to take his place in life. Our 
colleges are functioning satisfactorily in the 
development of the scholar and are offering 
in graduate and in professional schools a di- 
versity and an abundance rich enough to 
satisfy the intellectual hunger of the very 
best. It should be maintained frankly, how- 
ever, that the college does not exist for the 
creation of the scholar, at the expense of the 
making of intelligent citizens. So also the 
school cannot become an aristocracy of in- 
tellectuals. If there be any justice in the 
charge that private schools encourage social 
sngbbery, they would gain little by substi- 
tuting an intellectual snobbery. .The last 
state would be worse than the first. It is 
certainly possible that the school might ac- 
complish the development of the scholar with-

out sacrificing its obligation to the average, 
or becoming a hotbed for budding genius. 
The means are at hand and nothing more is 
needed than readjustment. 
e future trend of the private school must—s 
be toward the. realization of a high ideal. 
(“Hitherto it has not had a higher ideal of 
- scholarship than could be measured by the 
. foot rule of a college requirement. Harvard 
College has recently extended its rules for 
admission by accepting from schools of recog- 
nized standing the upper seventh of the 
graduating class without demanding any ex- 
amination. The upper seventh means a rela- 
tively small number. In a school graduating 
one hundred boys, the upper seventh would 
be fourteen boys, but in a school graduating 
about thirty boys, the. upper seventh would 
mean only four. The upper seventh in a 
given school may be distributed among sev- 
eral colleges so that the actual number able 
to take advantage of this opportunity is very 
small, Whether or not this concession to the 
scholar is wise, is a debatable question, but 
it is undoubtedly a step in the right direction 
on the part of the college in the recognition 
     
     
-P-A-G-E-275
252 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
of the higher mission of the school. If the 
school had taken the first step long ago, it 
would today be much further along on its 
way to freedom. A school is not chasing the 
will-o’-the-wisp, but is setting its face stead- 
fastly toward the attainment of something 
worth while which definitely abandons the 
classification of a preparatory school. That 
school which is first to make public announce- 
ment that it does not exist for the preparation 
of boys for college, will be the first to lead 
the inevitable trend of the private school in 
the next half century. Before making such 
announcement, however, it must be able to 
prove that it is doing something better than 
meeting college requirements. The start can 
be made at once in any school of recognized 
standing with a faculty adequate to the task. 
Let the school choose twenty per cent of 
the better scholars in each class. The choice 
might well be made two years before gradua- 
tion in a school with a four years’ course, and 
three years before graduation, in a school 
with a six years’ course. If in a given class 
the number of superior boys should exceed 
twenty per cent, let this special class be as

curriculum, though following the traditional 
course of each particular school. It matters 
not what the subjects taught may be. If, for 
example, a given school has ‘little interest in 
the Classics, its duty would be: to provide 
courses in mathematics, modern, language, 
natural science, history and English or. a 
choice of these subjects. The old-fashioned 
school, on the other hand, that still believes 
in Latin and Greek, would lay its plans ac- 
cordingly. Whatever the content-of.studies

and such a plan would be a complete sur- 
render of the traditional school to educational 
theories not yet accepted or entirely accept- 
able. - There is a worse thing than surrender, 
namely, a useless fighting for a lost cause, 
but there is no surrender contemplated. No 
change is demanded in the plan, policy or 
method in any of our existing schools; no 
radical change is advocated or even sug- 
gested. All that is asked for is a fair chance 
for the boy of superior ability. Not only 
the boy will gain, but the master will profit 
as much or more. ~A-swhole chapter might 
be written on the freeing of the master from 
the same bonds which limit ‘the liberty of 
the school, but it is sufficient to indicate 
a possibility within easy reach. 
A master who will keep ahead or even keep 
up with the superior fifth of his class will have 
quite enough to keep him from intellectual 
stagnation. There are good men, excellent 
men, men of high scholarship and high intel- 
lectual ideals engaged in the work of our 
secondary schools, but few of them are en- 
couraged to extend their bounds or lengthen 
their stakes by any demand that is now made
-P-A-G-E-278
  THE FUTURE TREND 255 
+ of them in teaching their classes. So much 
- of their time must be put into the beggarly 
elements, so much of their energy must be 
spent on the inferior and the average boy 
that the best they can do for the superior 
boy is to offer suggestions for, his outside 
- reading or in pointing the way to further in- 
‘dividual study. If, by this method, at least 
one half of a master’s time were. used in 
actual class work with the superior fifth of a 
- dass group, his whole outlook would be 
- widened and he would experience anew the 
intellectual joy of youth. 
It is not necessary to lay out here a plan of 
Procedure or to do more than sketch the bare 
outline. The insistence must be made on the 
obligation of the private school to produce 
out of its numbers a group of superior schol- 
ars. It has already this group of superior 
minds. Psychological tests made in several 
boarding schools of good standing indicate 
clearly that these schools havea larger per 
cent of superior minds than the general aver- 
age of high schools where similar tests have 
been made. The material is at hand and this 
material must be treated according to its
-P-A-G-E-279
256 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
worth and deserts or the future trend of the 
private school will be downward toward ulti- 
mate uselessness. The immediate result of 
the private school recognizing its obligation 
to produce scholars would be the raising of 
the standards of all of the classes in the school 
and the general scholastic standards in all 
other schools. Democracy is not the equality 
of mediocrity. Democracy can only continue 
to exist if the individual, superior in mind, 
character or personal power, has the oppor- 
tunity to rise above his fellows. By the same 
token, a private school has no right to exist 
within a democracy if its aim be the education 
of the average gained by the neglect or sup- 
pression of the superior. 
There is no danger of our schools produc- 
ing merely grinds and intellectual snobs, for 
at present our general average is mediocre; 
compared with English and Continental 
schools, we are far behind. The statement 
is fair that the product of an English public 
school or a French Lycée is two years in ad- 
vance of the product of our schools at the same 
age, that is between eighteen and nineteen. 
An upper tenth of a class in an English school

  THE FUTURE TREND 257 
that competes for the university scholarships 
has reached a point in education equal to 
the sophomore class in our colleges, as has 
been shown in an earlier chapter. The im- 
mediate problem that confronts our private 
school is to raise the standards of the average 
and produce the scholar. Unless the private 
school moves forward in this direction, tak- 
ing advantage of its opportunity in using its 
“freedom, it will forfeit its right to a place 
in our plan of secondary education or, still 
worse, degenerate into a pleasant association - 
of the materially favored classes, where ath- 
letics, good manners and social isolation are 
its only assets or liabilities. 
Some time must elapse before the private 
school has fulfilled this first and great obli- 
gation, but when the time comes for recog- 
nizing that the school has risen to its duty 
of producing its group of scholars, it will face 
4 still higher obligation. The school must 
taise up leaders in public service in a democ- 
tacy. There is a widespread theory that 
would define democracy as consisting solely 
of the rule of the majority, but if we are to 
; profit by the experiences of democracies since
-P-A-G-E-281
258 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
they came into being, we must protest against 
any such theory. As soon as the conception 
of the democracy degenerates into the theory 
of the majority rule, without regard to the 
wisdom of leadership, it becomes Sovietism. 
The permanency of American democracy 
depends not on majorities but on leadership. 
Of what sort is this leadership to be? 
Aeadership that is measured in terms of 
personal popularity lacking ability and char- 
' acter is the danger of majority rule) The 
false conception of leadership is illustrated by 
the homage paid to the college hero. For- 
tunately, there are signs of this conception 
giving place to a better one. An example of 
this is in the selection of the Rhodes scholars. 
One of the requisites in the appointment of 
a Rhodes Scholar is that he shall have shown 
qualities of leadership, but word has come 
recently from the Oxford Colleges, begging 
that no more “leaders” be sent. In other 
words, the committees selecting these scholars 
have interpreted leadership as meaning that 
shown by the young men of pleasing person- 
ality, social popularity, success in athletics 
and of passing scholarship, in fact, what is
-P-A-G-E-282
    
    
   
    
             
   THE FUTURE TREND - 259 
called on the college campus, “the big man.” 
“Please do not send us any more leaders,” 
_ say the Oxford Dons, and our masters of 
industry and finance are saying the same 
_ thing to the colleges, They are looking to 
the colleges today for choice young men. 
The time has gone when “the big man” of 
the campus will have places offered him in _ 
“the business world unless he has something 
more to show than the things that made him 
“big.” Men are sought who have taken ad- 
vantage of the education offered by the col- 
lege and not the men who have attained 
leadership solely through the by-products of 
‘college life. It were worse than foolish to 
discredit the activities,’ a term that 
Strangely enough has come to mean -every- 
thing except student’s studies, for they count 
for much in the preparation for life, made up 
so largely of human relationships. No one 
questions the value of charm, of athletic 
ability, of personality, of the faculty for 
friendship, but why scholarship should be ex- 
cluded from the list of activities, has failed 
¢ So far of explanation. Leadership in the ulti- 
mate democracy must be a leadership of
-P-A-G-E-283
260 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
brains, and such leadership must have its 
start and inspiration in the school. 
Public service covers every activity in life 
that has for its object something other than 
the service of self. The term may properly 
include not only the recognized professions 
of law, medicine, politics, teaching, the min- 
istry, but also any industrial or mercantile 
activity conducted for public benefit and with 
the motive of public betterment. It is a sig- 
nificant fact that the boys who are graduating 
from our schools are, in larger numbers every 
year, looking forward to something other than 
money-making or the possession of wealth. 
Account for this new outlook as we may, 
all schools, whether public or private, should 
take advantage of it and the private school 
has a chance all its own to make use of it. 
Adolescence is the altruistic period in human 
development. The final decisions for voca- 
tion are not always made in school, but the 
vision of opportunity is clearest before the 
‘practical age comes on. 
In Dr. Cushing’s life of Dr. William Osler, 
the story is told of the power of the school 
in shaping the future of the superior boy.
-P-A-G-E-284

  No conditions could be more primitive or 
seemingly inadequate than those of the 
. school on the Canadian frontier. Yet under 
_ the influence of a real teacher there emerged) 
the recognized leader of the medical profes- 
sion in this generation. The capacity for 
leadership was evident in the school period, 
ut without the kind of a teacher to point 
the way, Osler might never have risen to his 
-preéminence in public service. The same 
’ story has been told before and has a familiar 
_ sound as we recall the lives of other servants 
and friends of mankind, but it cannot be told 
too often. An analysis of leadership in the 
- development of our national life in the past 
fifty years, unparalleled in the world’s his- 
tory, confirms the dictum of Dr. Francis 
Walker, that the two essentials of success are, 
“Parts and Poverty.” It is the rare excep- 
-tion when the son of privilege has risen to 
_ preéminence in public service. Possession of 
. things has been a heavy handicap to the boy 
“Who has possessed also abilities. In the same 
periods compare what the great English 
: schools, made up of similar material, have 
' given to England and the British Empire. 
       
-P-A-G-E-285
262 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
The War proved beyond dispute that the 
same spirit had been potentially present in 
the material, but it had not been called forth 
into public service as it ought to have been, 
had our schools been fulfilling their mission. 
But what of the future? Lest we be satisfied 
with vague generalities and abstract appeals, 
let the schools focus their efforts on some 
definite opportunities. To choose, by way 
of illustration, two which have been ignored 
and neglected by the very men best able if not 
best equipped for the expression of the self- 
same spirit. 
The first call today to the equipped and 
choice young man is politics, that is to say, 
the voluntary choice of preparation for pub- 
lic office. It is a long, hard career and beset 
with many pitfalls, but there is no profession 
open to the young American filled with 
greater promise of usefulness. It is not an 
overstatement to say that our political repre- 
sentatives today are largely either puppets 
of the machine or the accidents of the hit-or- 
miss process of the primary. There are many 
reasons why so few of our best men go into 
politics, but the chief reason is that they
-P-A-G-E-286
THE FUTURE TREND _ 263 
are not interested. They have never seen 
_ the vision nor heard the call, and just here the 
* private school has a chance to open the eyes 
- of its boys to the opportunity for service 
in politics. The fact that many of them will 
+ be spared the struggle for existence, through 
no merit of their own, increases many times 
-_ their obligation to serve the State. The 
school. can definitely aim to turn its very 
» best product toward the profession of poli- 
| tics, provided it has made use of its freedom 
: in its insistence on high academic standards 
» and in choosing the superior boy for develop- 
ment in scholarship. 
«Second only to this call is that to the 
| scholar to enter the wide field of science. A 
. field infinite in dimensions wherein lie hid 
riches beyond the dream of avarice. We are 
| aware of the impetus given to scientific in- 
' vestigation by the foundations established by 
r great benefactions. These make it possible 
| for the chosen scholar to carry on scientific 
. investigation and at the same time be assured 
| a living maintenance. No public service 
» is commensurate with the services that have 
. been rendered to the health and well being of    
  
-P-A-G-E-287
264 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
mankind in the laboratories of this genera- 
tion. On the other hand, even these richly 
endowed foundations do not begin to cover 
the field, much less limit it to their opera- 
tions. We have in our secondary schools to- 
day superior boys who, relieved from the 
struggle of existence, might devote their lives 
to science. There is no finer thing for the 
school of the next generation to accomplish 
than in giving during the school period the 
definite direction for this great purpose. It 
offers the fascination of the explorer, the joy 
of the discoverer and the inspiration of the 
prophet. In the group of boys of superior 
ability, there are always one or two or more 
who can see the vision as the boy William 
Osler saw it. A school that can be credited 
with the inspiration of these few will justify 
its existence. 
It is needless further to emphasize the 
point, to enlarge on the opportunities of 
public service that may be found in any 
career. The two opportunities named are 
for our present purpose merely illustrative. 
The thought to be kept in mind in this dis- 
cussion is that the private school has pecu-
-P-A-G-E-288
    THE FUTURE TREND 265 
liar opportunities for pointing out and lead- 
ing the way in these directions. The peculiar 
advantages that it possesses in the oppor- 
tunity for personal influence on account of its 
smaller enrollment and its many points of 
contact carry with them their special obli- 
. gations. The charge that is brought against 
- the private school, that they are opened only 
to limited numbers, must not be denied but 
frankly admitted. The admission, however, 
increases many fold its obligation. Looking 
into the future, we should expect that the ex- 
pansion of the private school will be not in 
the enlargement of schools already existing, 
but in the continued multiplication of schools 
. able to fulfil what the State requires and a 
. great deal more. Any expansion, however, 
must be so safeguarded that limitation should 
not mean exclusion. 
Exclusion is not inherent in either the 
_ theory or the practice of the private schools if 
We recall their history and their past contri- 
bution to the educational life of the nation. 
The very idea of the earliest private schools 
was to furnish an education to those worthy 
of it, without regard to the financial returns.
-P-A-G-E-289
266 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
It is true that many of the private schools 
today are beyond the reach of all except the 
well-to-do and the rich, but here again, though 
this condition is regrettable, it is not inherent 
in the private school idea. We point with 
pride to such great schools as Andover and 
Exeter to refute the charge. Schools have 
had to wait for endowment until the colleges 
were, in a measure, looked after, but the en- 
dowment of schools has already begun, and is 
being recognized as an obligation. 
The question here arises, Is not this mat- 
ter of cost beside the point? Yes, unless we 
lose sight again of the right conception of 
democracy. There will be always grades of 
prosperity and difference in wealth; so long 
as material conditions vary, there will be a 
leisure class or something that approaches it. 
Nothing could be more undesirable than 
schools existing for the children of the rich, 
but, on the other hand, these same children 
have the right to education and it will be ill 
for the community if they be neglected. In 
a democracy, the most dangerous of all 
classes is the idle class, and no community 
can advance in well being if the unemployed
-P-A-G-E-290
THE FUTURE TREND 267 
forms a: considerable part of its population. — 
For this reason, the private school must be -- 
within the reasonable reach of moderate and — 
even meagre means, lest there be segregation . 
of a leisure class. The defenders of the pri- 
vate school will have little standing ground 
unless they can rid the schools of even the 
suspicion of exclusiveness. To justify the 
endowment of the private schools, their ad- 
vocates must show that they are doing 
something that the public schools cannot do. 
To heap up endowments for schools which 
at best merely parallel the schools supported 
by the State would be a misappropriation of 
funds that should be turned toward the bet- 
tering of the schools within the reach of all. 
The popular demand in education is for 
variety, and the modern school: has set its 
face against the traditional content of studies. 
Present theories are all against past practices. 
No one private school can compete with the 
State in the variety of education that it offers, 
nor carry out all the current theories. We 
shall see before long a differentiation in type 
in the private school similar to that which 
has already been brought about in the pub-
-P-A-G-E-291
268 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
lic schools. There was a time when the high 
school giving a general education was the 
only type. Today no one type will satisfy 
the demand. There is the high school of 
fine arts, the high school of manual arts, the 
high school of mechanics, the high school of 
commerce and so on, presenting bills of fare 
to meet every taste, and run on the American 
plan. The desire for variety grows in pro- 
portion as we move westward. It is said that 
in the State of Ohio, there are over five thou- 
sand combinations of courses open to the stu- 
dents of the public schools. In Los Angeles 
there are nine high schools of different kinds, 
housed in beautiful buildings and equipped 
regardless of expense. 
' The public school has inexhaustible re- 
sources in taxation. The cost per pupil in 
some of our high schools, taking into account 
the amount invested in property and the 
annual expenses of the administration, is 
actually higher than the amount paid per 
pupil in the private school, charging the 
highest fees. There seems to be no prospect 
of any immediate return:to the one-type 
school, in fact, a return would be an edu-
-P-A-G-E-292
THE FUTURE TREND 269° 
cational calamity. The experience of the. 
most old-fashioned schoolmaster is in accord’ 
with the most radical theory of differentia- . 
tion that one boy’s intellectual meat is 
another boy’s poison. Experiment need not 
be left to the State as its sole prerogative, for. 
the freedom of the private school incurs the 
responsibility to try and to test. all that the 
State, out of the richness of its resources, 
may supply. In fact, the private school has 
been the pioneer in experiment, and private 
endowment has in some quarters subsidized 
the trying out of the newest and most radical 
theories. 
The demand for variety and experiment 
may be checked, the craze for choice may be 
kept within bounds, but the near future will 
see the establishing of schools for the boys 
who cannot stand the rigors of the traditional 
content of studies, but who are seeking the 
Other advantages that they believe the pri- 
vate school has to give them. Already schools 
have appeared offering special features for 
special training. Others are in sight with 
individualistic motive for the creation of new 
forms, and we shall see the desire for spe-

270 EDUCATION OF THE MODERN BOY 
cialization carried to satiety. Notwithstand- 
ing this evident tendency, it is not the future 
trend of the older academies and the longer 
established boarding schools. They will con- 
tinue to move along the old lines, getting light 
that is coming from the latest experiment, 
and impetus from the combatting of radical 
theories, yet insisting on the traditional sub- 
jects as the basis of the cultural education 
of the superior mind. They will hold the 
fort of the Classics, against all modern criti- 
cism, and if they be termed antiquated they 
will glory in their shame. 
The modern school has not yet furnished an 
adequate substitute for the traditional con- 
tent, and until it-does, the old-fashioned type 
- of school will have a reason for existence. 
There are still alive in the educational world 
those. who will not bow the knee at the new 
altars. There are still those who believe that 
Socrates is not dead, and that Aristotle is a 
living voice. 
It seems then to be clear that the future 
trend of the private school must be in those 
directions in which it can show a real reason 
for its existence and its ability to make its
-P-A-G-E-294

peculiar contribution. It cannot: for a long 
time continue as a commercial venture or to 
cater to idiosyncracy. Any attempt to rival 
the national school is futile both because of 
_ the limit of its resources and also because the 
national school is the most honored of our 
institutions. The school’s task is to furnish a 
complete education with the responsibility of 
the fourfold demand. In the last analysis the 
only virtue the private school can claim is 
its complete freedom, and its only right to 
survive depends on the attainment of its free- 
dom and its proper use of ity This chapter

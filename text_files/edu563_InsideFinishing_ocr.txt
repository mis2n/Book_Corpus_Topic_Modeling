  PREFACE TO THE SERIES 
Tus series consists of five volumes, four of which are intended 
as textbooks for pupils in manual-training, industrial, trade, tech- 
nical, ornormal schools. The fifth book of the series, the “ Hand- 
book in Woodwork and Carpentry,” is for the use of teachers and 
of normal students who expect to teach the subjects treated in the 
other four volumes. 
Of the pupils’ volumes, the first two, “ Elements of Woodwork ” 
and “Elements of Construction,” are adapted to the needs of stu- 
dents in manual-training schools, or in any institution in which 
elementary woodwork is taught, whether as purely educational 
handwork, or as preparatory to a high, or trade, school course in 
carpentry or vocational training. 
The volumes “Constructive Carpentry” and “Inside Finish- 
ing” are planned with special reference to the students of tech- 
nical, industrial, or trade schools, who have passed through the 
work of the first two volumes, or their equivalent. The subjects 
treated are those which will be of greatest value to both the pro- 
spective and the finished workman. 
For the many teachers who are obliged to follow a required 
course, but who are allowed to introduce supplementary or 
optional models under certain conditions, and for others who 
have more liberty and are able to make such changes as they 
see fit, this series will be found perfectly adaptable, regardless 
of the grades taught. To accomplish this, the material has been 
arranged by topics, which may be used by the teacher irrespective 
of the sequence, as each topic has to the greatest extent possible 
been treated independently.

  PREFACE TO INSIDE FINISHING 
In many places carpenters are classified as framers or outside 
men, and joiners or inside men; the subject matter treated in 
the following pages refers especially to the work of the latter, 
as it deals with the fitting up of the house to make it habitable 
after the framing, covering, and outside finishing have been 
completed. Certain aspects of carpentry of interest to the pro- 
spective contractor are also dealt with, and suggestions are offered 
which will be of assistance to him in placing his business upon 
a satisfactory basis. 
In connection with this book, research, discussions, and the 
writing of essays on the various subjects presented should be 
required. The arithmetic includes many problems similar to 
those which the mechanic has to solve in his daily work, and a 
thorough drill upon these will add much to the equipment of the 
future workman.

     INSIDE FINISHING 
CHAPTER I 
HEATING, VENTILATION, SANITATION, REFRIGERATORS 
1. Fireplaces and stoves.— (A.) The heating of a 
building is not a part of the work of a carpenter, but he 
should have some knowledge of the different methods of 
heating in common use. 
Our forefathers used fireplaces for both heating and cook- 
ing, but as far as heating is concerned, they are unsatis- 
factory, as the room quickly cools off if the fire dies down. 
They are invaluable in the fall and spring, before and after 
it is necessary to heat the entire house, and as an auxiliary 
to the heating system during an extremely cold spell. 
A fireplace furnishes a valuable means of ventilation, 
and thus adds much to the healthfulness of the house, be- 
sides imparting an air of cheerfulness. The center of the 
decorative scheme of a room is generally the fireplace and 
mantel. 
(B.) Stoves are efficient as heaters, and may be regu- 
lated to radiate as much or as little heat as desired, within 
the capacity of the stove. They are inconvenient, and 
cause much dirt to be brought into the room. 
2. Hot-air heating. — (A.) A system of furnace heat- 
ing properly installed usually gives satisfaction, though 
there is an economical tendency to put in a furnace which 
is not quite large enough for extremely cold weather. 
1 
    
-P-A-G-E-14
     
     INSIDE FINISHING 
The furnace should be set low, and accordingly is often 
placed in a pit in the cellar, in order to give as much pitch 
to the conductor pipes as can be obtained, since a pipe 
with less rise than one inch to each foot in length is very 
apt to conduct heat unsatisfactorily, though the pipes 
leading to the upper floors of a building will give satisfac- 
tion with less pitch than those which heat the lower floor. 
The furnace should be located very near the center of 
the system, but nearer the side of the house from which 
the prevailing cold winds come, to give as much pitch 
as possible to pipes running in that direction, which 
rarely conduct the heat as satisfactorily as others. These 
conductor pipes should be connected at the furnace upon 
the same level, or the highest pipes will take most of the 
heat and destroy the efficiency of the others. The con- 
ductor pipe leading to a room which is difficult to heat 
is sometimes placed above the others, but not unless 
it is very necessary. 
(B.) A cold air duct of about half. or two thirds of the 
capacity of all the conductor pipes it is to supply should 
connect the furnace chamber with the outside air, by means 
of which, pure air is heated before being used to heat the 
house. This cold air duct should be provided with a 
damper or slide, by which the air supply may be regulated ; 
if the best results are desired, ducts should be taken 
from opposite sides of the house, as the direction of the 
wind often has considerable effect upon the efficiency of a 
furnace. 
A register sometimes is placed in the floor or wall for the 
purpose of conducting impurities out of doors; this for- 
merly was a common custom in the best houses, but is not 
used so much at the present time, as partly heated air is
-P-A-G-E-15
  HEATING Beg 
wasted, and the expense of heating a house is increased. 
Instead of allowing this air to pass out of the house, it is 
usually conducted to the furnace chamber and reheated, 
and enough pure cold air allowed to enter the furnace 
chamber at the same time, to replace the vitiated air. 
From the standpoint of theory this is not desirable, but 
in an ordinary dwelling there are not enough impurities 
to make this method hygienically objectionable, as the 
opening of the doors and the crevices of the house will allow 
enough pure air to enter to make the air in the house suit- 
able for use. 
Since most of the impurities in the air are burned out by 
contact with the furnace drum, and since greater efficiency 
of the furnace is obtained at less cost, this method is 
being installed in nearly all of the best furnace-heated 
houses now in construction, and many are being remodeled 
to allow this system. 
It is important that furnace pipes should be carefully 
wrapped in asbestos paper to retain the heat and to con- 
form to insurance regulations ; pipes which go in the 
partitions should be put in place before the house is 
lathed. 
(C.) In a modern furnace, there is provision made for 
a water pan in the air chamber. The water becomes heated 
to a moderate temperature, so that moisture is given 
off by evaporation, and carried through the house by the 
movement of the heated air. Unless moisture is sup- 
plied, the air will be so dry that it not only is undesir- 
able for breathing, but will cause the joints of the finish 
and of the furniture to open, the frame of the building 
to shrink so much that the plastering will crack, and the 
doors to warp and shrink so badly that they will not latch.
-P-A-G-E-16
    4 INSIDE FINISHING 
3. Steam and hot-water heating. — There are three 
methods of heating, by some one of which all steam or 
hot-water heating apparatus is operated. 
(A.) The term direct heating is applied to the system 
in which heat radiates from coils of pipes-or radiators 
directly into the room in which the appliance is located. 
This method is used in places where little attention is 
paid to ventilation, though it should not be installed where 
there are to be many people, as the same air is simply 
heated over and over again. 
(B.) The term indirect heating is applied to the system 
in which fresh air is heated by being passed through 
steam or hot-water radiators located outside of the room 
which is to be heated. Though not often so regarded, 
a hot-air furnace is an example of this system, as the out- 
side air is heated before it is conducted into the room. 
In this method of heating, a system of ventilation is 
frequently installed in connection with the steam or hot- 
water system, by which the impure and cold air is re- 
moved at the floor level, giving place to heated fresh air. 
This method is sometimes applied by connecting the foul 
or cold air ducts with the heating coils, as described in 
furnace heating, and by allowing this partly heated air 
to be reheated more economically than if cold air were 
heated to the desired temperature. It is obvious that 
this system, which is in effect direct heating, is objec- 
tionable where many people have to breathe the same air 
over and over. This objection is to some extent removed 
by the introduction of a certain amount of fresh air to 
the heater to replace some of the vitiated air, as by 
the indirect method. (See the preceding page.) 
(C.) The third method is known as the direct-indirect,
-P-A-G-E-17
HEATING 5 
which, as its name implies, is a combination of the two 
above described. 
In this system the radiator is placed in the room to be 
heated, and the air is reheated as often as it comes in con- 
tact with the radiator. To furnish a certain amount of fresh 
air, a duct is so located that air from the outside passes 
into the room through the radiator, replacing impure air 
which is removed through vents or foul-air ducts by nat- 
ural or forced draft, the latter of which should be used if the 
most reliable results are wanted. This method is used a 
great deal in heating large halls, theaters, churches, etc., 
and gives quite’ satisfactory results, though the indirect 
method with a system of forced draft ventilation is gen- 
erally considered the best device for heating large build- 
ings; its expense, however, prevents its universal adoption. 
The term direct, indirect, or direct-indirect, as applied 
to a radiator, refers to the relation of the radiator to the 
air supply and the room to be heated, and not to any 
peculiarity of construction or circulation of steam or hot 
water in the radiator itself. 
4. Steam heating. — A steam-heating system may be 
installed after the house is built; this is often a great ad- 
vantage, but as it is expensive tomaintain fora small house, 
its principal use is to heat large buildings; in many loca- 
tions, steam is conducted by the central-heating-plant 
system to all of the buildings within a radius of several 
hundred feet. 
In places where steam power is generated, the radia- 
tors may be heated by exhaust steam, and the expense of 
heating, while the exhaust is being used, will be practically 
nothing. This is the method followed wherever possible. 
If direct steam is used, it is at a very low pressure, from
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 INSIDE FINISHING 
three to six pounds being sufficient to send the steam 
through the pipes and insure the return of the condensa- 
tion to the boiler. 
Steam radiators are connected by two systems; the 
one-ptpe system, in which there is only one pipe to supply 
the steam, and to return the condensation to the boiler 
to be reheated, and the two-pipe system, in which each 
radiator or coil has a supply pipe, and a return to the main 
return pipe. Either system, if properly installed, will give 
satisfactory results. In neither system should there be 
pockets or sagging pipes in which the returning condensa- - 
tion may be trapped, as this will prevent the system from 
doing its work and, if the pipe should freeze, a new piece of 
pipe would have to be put in. In neither system should 
there be any part which cannot be drained. 
5. Hot-water heating. — The initial cost of a system of 
hot-water heating is greater than that of a steam system, 
as more radiating surface is required, but it is less expensive 
in operation. As in steam heating, the pipes and radi- 
ators may be installed after the house is built. It is a 
very popular system for use in dwellings, as it requires but 
little care besides keeping the fires, which need less fuel 
than any other equivalent system. 
In the pipes of this, as of the steam system, there should 
be no pockets or drops, and‘both should be so built that 
they can be thoroughly drained, to prevent freezing if the 
house is to be left vacant. 
6. Ventilation. — Ventilationforms apart of most modern 
heating systems. Ventilation consists of more than fur- 
nishing a sufficient supply of fresh air; it should provide 
also for removing the air which has been breathed, or 
which has been polluted by coming in contact with unclean
-P-A-G-E-19
  VENTILATION iv 
bodies or clothing. An opening in the ceiling of a room 
is not satisfactory, if it is the only means of ventilation, 
as it allows a great deal of heat to escape. A ventilator 
of this sort should be used judiciously, especially in cold 
weather ; if a building or auditorium intended to accom- ‘ 
modate large gatherings is constructed properly, the ceil- 
ing will be high enough to allow foul air to be well above 
the heads of the people, and the ventilator need not 
ordinarily be opened at times when the loss of heat would 
be a serious inconvenience. 
The heat of an indirect system usually enters a room 
near the ceiling, and in its downward passage carries with 
it impurities and the most poisonous gases. These de- 
scend to the floor, and unless removed, will accumulate 
until the air is absolutely poisonous. To provide an easy 
exit for these gases, registers should be placed in the 
floor, or in the wall near the floor, through which the 
gases may be conducted out of doors by one of two 
methods, the natural draft, or the forced draft. The for- 
mer allows gases to follow their own inclination, and while 
ventilators are made which, by various devices, accel- 
erate the movement, the efficiency of the system depends, 
to a great extent, upon the condition of the outside atmos- 
phere, which, if dead and heavy, checks the air current. 
The forced draft is independent of the atmospheric con- 
ditions, and a current of air may always be maintained, as 
the draft is caused by a fan driven at a high rate of speed, 
_ which draws the impure air from the inside of the building, 
and forces it out of doors. This air, of course, is replaced 
by pure heated air, or in warm weather by artificially 
cooled air. Thus the air is kept continually in motion. 
The contractor in building a house generally will sublet  
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 INSIDE FINISHING 
the heating and ventilating, as this work, in order to insure 
satisfactory results, should be planned and installed by 
men who have made it a study and who are familiar with 
all the appliances and methods which will assist in mak- 
ing it efficient and satisfactory. 
7. Plumbing. — It is the usual custom that the carpen- 
ter should do all of the cutting necessary to allow the 
plumber to lay pipes and to set his work properly. The 
soil pipes and all others which are to be laid in the walls 
or floors should be in place before the house is lathed or 
the floors laid. 
The carpenter should not attempt to say whether the 
work is properly done or not unless he has had considerable 
experience with plumbers’ work; if he is responsible for 
the work done upon a house for which there is no architect, 
he should engage some competent person to inspect the 
work thoroughly before it is covered. A guarantee from 
a responsible plumber is often accepted. In most cities 
where there are sewer and water systems, there is an 
official inspector of plumbing, who should be given every 
opportunity to look over work, for if a faulty place is dis- 
covered after the house is finished, considerable expense 
and annoyance may be caused in making it right. 
That part of the work which is out of sight is most 
important ; no elaborate fittings can compensate for im- 
perfect plumbing in the wall or under the floor. 
8. Sanitation. — (A.) The disposal of sewage is always 
one of the gravest problems to consider in the development 
of a community. The cities upon or near the seacoast 
have the nearest to ideal conditions for disposing of their 
sewage, as it is simply emptied into the ocean or one of its 
tributaries, generally by gravitation, and the action of the
-P-A-G-E-21
SANITATION 9 
tides will carry the matter out to sea, where it is scattered 
by the ocean currents, and in no case is there any danger 
of the water supply being affected, as salt water is not used 
for domestic purposes. 
Any lake or river, no matter how large, if it continually 
receives sewage in any quantity, will eventually be con- 
taminated. 
It is not the purpose of this book to discuss the efficiency 
of the many various systems of disposing of the sewage of 
inland cities, so we will consider merely the aspects of sani- 
tation with which the carpenter has to deal. 
(B.) The privy, which is in common use in rural dis- 
tricts, is prohibited by law in modern towns and cities, 
where the houses are close together and where a sewer is 
provided. Even where there is plenty of room, care must 
be used that the privy is not placed where there is the 
_ slightest danger of affecting the water supply, or where 
it will drain into a brook from which cattle have to drink. 
It should be located always below the water supply if pos- 
sible. A privy is usually very obnoxious in warm weather, 
even at some distance from the house, but it may be 
made inoffensive by scattering, in the vault, dry earth, 
which will prevent odors from spreading. 
Chamber slops should not be thrown into a privy, but 
instead should be thrown upon the grass, or in any place 
where the sun can do its work of purifying. 
(C.) Where there is no sewerage system and privies are 
in common use, the dry earth closet is a simple and efficient 
method of dealing with this problem. The closet should 
be light, well ventilated, and fly-proof. The equipment 
may consist of a box of dry earth or road dust, to be used 
as often as the closet is, or it may be an elaborate 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 INSIDE FINISHING 
arrangement, in which the earth is thrown in above and 
handled with a slide, as it is needed. A closet of this sort 
may be built as close to the house as desired, and if prop- 
erly cared for, will never be objectionable. 
If this form of closet is used, there should be provided 
a place, perfectly dry and large enough to contain a suffi- 
cient quantity of dry earth to care for the privy during 
rainy weather and the winter months. This should be 
kept full of road dust, which is well suited for this pur- 
pose. The receptacle should be a well made, water-tight, 
movable box with handles, so it may be easily emptied, 
though an ordinary vault may be used. 
(D.) Water-closets are not possible in all localities, not 
only on account of the absence of a sewerage system, but 
because the soil is not adaptable to the construction of a 
cesspool, which is simply a deep hole, loosely walled to keep 
the earth from caving in, but which will allow the contents 
to seep away through the soil. This is connected by 
a drain to the house, and is the means of disposing of 
sewage and household waste in many places where 
there is a sandy subsoil and where there is no danger of 
contaminating the water supply. It is not considered a 
system suitable for general use, even in isolated places, as 
a well a long distance away may be affected ; nevertheless, 
it is used in many places where there is a deep sandy soil. 
A method of disposing of sewage, known as the sub- 
surface system, is sometimes used in localities where there 
are good natural drainage facilities. In this system, the 
sewage or other household waste is conducted to tanks 
in which the solid matter is precipitated, and the liquid is 
distributed through a series of drains laid under the surface 
of the ground, from which it finds its way to some natural
-P-A-G-E-23
  
SANITATION i ala lee 
watercourse. This is a complex matter to discuss, and 
we shall not do more than mention it. 
Another method known as the “ Septic” consists of beds 
of sand located in some isolated place, lower than the area 
which is drained, in which the sewage is exposed to the 
action of the sun and the air. This method is being used 
with satisfactory results in small inland communities and 
by institutions. 
(E.) Sink drains should carry as far as possible from 
the house, and should have as much pitch as can be 
obtained, not less than 1’ in a run of 40’, fora 4”’ drain tile, 
which is as small as should be used. Under the sink there 
always should be a trap made perfectly tight with solder. 
If more than a sink enters the drain, the work of con- 
necting should be done by a plumber, for if improperly 
done, the effects may be very serious. 
A drain should have as few bends as possible in it; the 
bottom should be laid straight, or in straight sections, re- 
gardless of the surface of the ground, and low enough to 
be well below the frost line. 
The end of the drain should empty in a sandy place upon 
a side hill if possible, as high as the nature of the ground 
will allow, or otherwise the outlet will freeze in winter and 
possibly destroy several feet of the end of the drain. 
In rural districts the drain often empties upon the top 
of the ground at some distance from the house, and for 
ordinary conditions in the country there is little to criti- 
cize in this, provided there is no danger of affecting the 
water supply, as the sun is a great purifier. The drain tile 
should be laid in cement, with perfectly tight joints, and 
without low places, or rough cement on the inside of the 
pipes, to catch the matter from the sink.

9. Refrigerators.—(A.) Refrigeration upon a large scale 
has become the work of the scientist and the engineer, and 
we shall not discuss the problem, as it includes very little 
in which the carpenter would be interested, but we will 
discuss the construction of an ice refrigerator suitable for 
family use, or for use in a meat market, or wherever one 
is needed. ( 
(B.) A refrigerator operates upon the principle that air 
of a low temperature will descend, and that of a high tem- 
perature will rise if both are confined in the same com- 
partment. 
To make an efficient refrigerator the walls should be air- 
tight, and the doors fitted closely and forced tightly into 
their places. The walls should be made of two or more 
thicknesses of ceiling, with air spaces between in which 
the air is perfectly dead. In order to 
insure this, there must be studding every 
18” or 24”, as the stock will work to the 
best advantage. The ceiling in every case 
should be laid upon dressed studding of an 
even thickness, say 13’ X 2?’’, and a good 
grade of sheathing paper laid between the 
stud and the ceiling. 
Figure 1 shows two methods of building 
a’ the walls of a refrigerator. At a is shown 
Fic. 1.—Rerricer- the method of constructing the wall. Ceil- 
ator WALLS. ing is laid upon the studding or framework 
of the refrigerator, with sheathing paper (b) between it 
and the studding, leaving a dead air space (c) between the 
two layers of sheathing paper ; this is an efficient means of 
preventing the inside of a refrigerator from being affected 
by the outside temperature. The space c may be filled Tu ET

with shavings, which will settle vertically unless filled 
under pressure. This is often done, but it accomplishes 
little, or no more than does a dead air space. 
At d, a piece of sheathing paper (¢) is tacked tightly upon 
the small pieces of wood (x) which surround each space 
between the studs; this makes an extra air space to help 
make the walls impenetrable. 
The walls of refrigerators are sometimes insulated with 
hair felting, or with mineral wool, which, if kept dry, will 
make an excellent wall to resist the passage of air from 
the inside or outside of the refrigerator. 
For convenience, the ice door should open from the front 
of the refrigerator and be of a size to admit as large a piece 
of ice as possible; if the door is in the top, the ice will 
not melt so rapidly. 
The doors and jambs should be made and fitted by some 
method similar to that shown in Fig. 2, by making as

nearly an air-tight joint as possible at a by means of a felt 
or rubber weather strip, and by forcing the door into its 
place by a lever lock (6), placed upon the outside of the 
door. There are several kinds upon the market, but the 
one illustrated at 6 is efficient and economical,

Figure 3 shows the construction of an ice chamber, which 
should occupy from one fifth to one third of the cubical 
contents of the refrigerator. At 6 is seen the ice rack, the 
top of which should be set level. The floor of the ice 
: chamber (c) should be set. 
at a pitch so that the cold 
air will have plenty of 
room to find its way to the 
cold air duct (d) through 
which it is carried some 
distance below the bottom 
of the ice floor. As the 
air absorbs gases and heat 
from the foods, its temper- 
ature rises, and it passes 
through the warm air flue 
(e) and into the ice cham- 
ber (w) where the gases 
condense upon the ice and 
pass off in water form 
through the waste pipe (f) 
which has a trap at the end 
of it, to prevent the escape of cold air. The ice chamber 
should be lined with galvanized iron, which is very 
durable, but in the lower-priced refrigerators, zinc is much ~ 
used. 
This is, in substance, the method of the construction 
and operation of ice refrigerators. Other things being 
equal, the one which gives the freest circulation of air is 
the one which will give the best results, both in economy 
of ice and in the preservation of its contents. 
In building a refrigerator, the workman cannot be too   
  Fic. 3.—Tue Ice Camper.
-P-A-G-E-27
REFRIGERATORS 15 
careful in making all joints as nearly air-tight as possible. 
It is the poorest economy to save on the price of the re- 
frigerator by omitting anything which will tend to make it 
air proof, as the additional cost of the ice unnecessarily 
used will soon be more than the extra cost of building the 
refrigerator properly. 
ro. Construction of an ice house.—Figure 4 indicates 
the method by which an ice house may be constructed. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
              
  
      
                                        
  Fic. 4.—Icz House Consrrucrion. 
The ground upon which the building is to stand should be 
well drained with a tile drain, as at c, not less than 12’ 
below the surface, and in rows not more than 6’ apart. 
The site should be so graded that no surface water will run 
over the floor after the building is completed. A slope 
in the ground upon which the house stands will assist in 
the drainage.
-P-A-G-E-28
16 INSIDE FINISHING 
The house should be large enough to allow at least one 
foot of sawdust, shavings, or hay under and on each side 
of the desired quantity of ice, which should be packed in a 
solid mass, with nothing between the cakes. Hay is pre- 
ferred for the outside packing, as it may be handled more 
easily than either sawdust or shavings. 
It is the custom of many, after the ice house is filled, to 
deluge the mass of ice with water, thus making nearly a 
compact mass, and preventing the circulation of air as 
much as possible. After the house is filled, the ice should 
be covered with at least a foot of hay. 
The building should be covered with a tight roof, and 
the gables boarded up, with a door (a) at each end for 
ventilation. These should never be entirely closed during 
warmweather. Doors forconvenience in fillingand empty- 
ing should be made at 6, b, b. In large ice houses, the fill- 
ing and emptying is done by machinery and inclined 
planes.

CHAPTER II 
Fioor Layine, Insipr FIntsH 
rz. Floor laying.—(A.) Floor laying is a branch of 
carpentry which, in some localities, is done almost en- 
tirely by specialists who can do a far greater amount than 
can the all-round man. Figure 5 shows the kinds of floors 
in most common use, the matched 
(a), and the square-edged (b). The 
former of these always should be 
blind nailed; that is, the nails should 
be driven into the edge as shown 
atc, with a nail set; the entire floor 
may then be laid with no nail heads 
showing. 
This is the method by which 
the best floors are laid, though it 
is slower than the square-edged 7 
method, since the floor has to be Fic. 5.—Marcuep anp 
laid one board at a time.. Also if  S8v4=™rocm: Hzconme, 
is a more expensive floor, as considerable lumber is used in 
making the tongue for matching the boards. 
A piece of 33’’ matched flooring or ceiling is made from 
a board 33” wide, but its covering surface is only 3”, as 
‘shown at a, Fig. 6. On account of the tendency of the 
grain of wood to straighten itself in drying, boards will 
frequently have “kinks” or short bends in them, due 
a9)   
        
 
-P-A-G-E-32
Re Le ee 
20 INSIDE FINISHING 
to cross-grained places; in order to straighten boards 
of this sort, it is often necessary, in matching them, to 
make their faces }” or 1’ less in width instead of only 
}”, and }” less in thickness instead of $”, than the sawed 
dimensions, indicated 
in Fig. 6, which were 
S888 based upon a straight 
board. Therefore it is 
customary to allow one 
quarter or one third of the floor area for waste in match- 
ing and in cutting out imperfections ; while for a square- 
edged floor an allowance of one fifth or one fourth is 
sufficient, as there is no waste in matching. (See b, Fig. 6.) 
Usually it is not necessary that matched flooring should 
be nailed at every joist; an 8d floor nail every second or 
third joist is sufficient for narrow flooring; for wide ma- 
terial the nailings may have to be closer to hold the floor 
down properly. The best grades of factory matched 
flooring are usually bored along the edge to allow nails 
to be driven without splitting the piece. If these holes 
do not come over a joist, the nails will generally hold 
well enough if driven into the under floor only, as they 
enter the wood at such an angle. 
For a very nice floor it may be necessary to smooth, 
scrape, and sandpaper the boards after they are laid, 
though if the flooring has been well made at the mill, it 
will be enough for common work to smooth the few joints 
which may not have come down perfectly. 
If paper is to be laid under the wearing floor, it should 
be laid from the side from which the flooring is laid, or else 
at right angles, so that the edges of the paper will not 
curl up and prevent the boards from coming to a joint:

Tf a floor is to have a natural finish, the carpenter 
always should select wood of the same color. In no other 
place is thoroughly seasoned stock more necessary. 
It is always best to lay a floor with as narrow boards as 
possible, as the shrinking effect of seasoning is thereby 
minimized; if wide boards are used, the cracks will be 
more open, and therefore more noticeable. 
In laying matched flooring, much depends in getting a 
straight start. If the wearing floor is laid upon an under- 
  Fic. 7.— Layine Tue Frrst Piece or FLoorina. 
floor, which is covered with sheathing paper, and if the 
base is cut down on top of it, as at a, Fig. 7, this is an 
easy thing to do, as the first two or three pieces may be 
nailed perfectly straight; but, if the base has been put 
on, as in 6, the starting piece (c) should be carefully 
seribed to the base, the grooved edge being the one 
fitted. A straight piece must be selected for the first 
because a crooked one would make trouble in laying 
the next few boards. One with a bruised, grooved edge 
should be selected if there is such, as the bruise may be 
cut off in scribing, while it might destroy the piece for use 
elsewhere in the floor. 
If a quarter round, or shoe strip is to be used, as at d,  
-P-A-G-E-34
  22 INSIDE FINISHING 
Fig. 7, this fitting may be dispensed with, and the starting 
piece laid straight. A strip of any kind at the joint be- 
tween the base and the floor always seems to hide a bad 
joint, and it is rarely used upon the best work. 
Tf a floor is to be hand smoothed, time may be saved by 
using care in selecting the grain, and by laying as many 
pieces as possible of the same grain together, then several 
more of grain running in the opposite direction. This 
can be done only in a general way, but it is good practice. 
(B.) A square-edged floor should not be laid one board 
at a time, but a ‘“ bay,” two or three feet in width, of the 
floor boards should be cut to the same length, and wedged 
so tightly that each joint will be perfect, as shown at d, 
Fig. 5. Enough nails are driven to hold the boards in place 
while the process is repeated until the entire floor is cut 
down; in doing this, the different bays of flooring should 
be cut to different lengths, breaking joints with the ad- 
joining bay at least 32”, or the distance between centers 
of two joists; this will prevent a straight joint from ex- 
tending across the floor and will add to the stiffness of the 
building. It is best to select boards for each bay of the 
same aggregate width as the boards they join endways. 
Any small spaces left open on account of the material not 
exactly fitting can be filled in after the floor is nailed. 
In heavy buildings, it is quite a common custom to lay 
the flooring diagonally, to add rigidity to the structure. 
When the boards are all cut and laid, marks should be 
made with a chalk line or pencil, by a straightedge, to 
indicate the exact location of the joists as a guide in driv- 
ing nails. The young workman must learn to keep his 
left hand full of nails and one nail in the wood all of the 
time; with a little practice, one at a time may be picked
-P-A-G-E-35

out by the thumb and middle finger, and held for the 
first blow of the hammer. 
12. Wood for finishing. — In selecting the inside finish 
for a house, care should be used to sort the different colors 
as much as possible ; though the same grade and the same 
kind of wood may be used, some of it will be darker or 
lighter than the rest. The dark wood should be used in 
certain rooms, and the light wood in others. 
All of the exposed finish of a room should be of the same 
wood, though the doors upon very good work are often, 
and upon common work are generally, of a wood different 
from that of the rest of the room. Almost any kind of 
wood may be used for inside finish, provided the desired 
dimensions can be obtained and the appearance is satis- 
factory, since very little wear comes upon it. Certain 
kinds of woods, as spruce, gum, and buckeye, do not hold 
their shape well unless very strongly fastened. Basswood 
is used to some extent, but it shrinks and swells con- 
siderably unless it has been well seasoned. 
The woods commonly used are the pines, oaks, walnuts, 
whitewood, or poplar, red birch, black gum, ash, chestnut, 
cherry, cypress, redwood, maple, sycamore, and a few 
other woods, the use of which is largely local. Besides 
these, imported woods are used to some extent, chief 
among them being mahogany. 
The best material should be selected, which should in 
every instance be thoroughly kiln dried, especially for 
mitered finish. 
13. Casings. —(A.) The tops of all the openings of a 
room should be on the same line. This often is accom- 
plished by putting a transom in over the doors, but the 
rule is disregarded as much as any other rule in carpentry,
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 ‘ INSIDE FINISHING. 
even upon the best work, as it affects only the appearance 
of the room and in no way the comfort of the house. 
(B.) Figure 8 shows three styles of finish for the casings 
of doors and of window frames. The mitered (a) is the 
style generally favored upon the best class of work. The 
  
  
    
    
                    
  
Fic. 8.— Types or FInisu. 
window casing and stool finish are shown at b. The end 
of the stool at z, and of the apron at y, should be mitered, 
or returned upon themselves; this applies to all forms of 
finish. 
The corner block finish (c) is used commonly, as it is
-P-A-G-E-37
FLOOR LAYING, INSIDE FINISH 25 
more easily put in place than the mitered finish and more 
ornamental than the plain finish, shown at d; if the ma- 
terial shrinks or swells, the defect is not so evident as 
in the mitered finish. The corner block should be 3” 
thicker, and }’”’ longer and wider than the side casing 
or architrave (w), and the header (2). 
The plain finish (d) is used in many places where it is 
difficult to obtain moldings, though unimportant rooms 
of good buildings are often finished in this style. The 
header or lintel (v) should be }” thicker than the side 
casing (7) and should project equally at each end. 
A plinth (f{) 9” or 10” high should be used to finish the 
bottoms of the side casings of all forms of door finish, 
to give a place against which the baseboard (uw) and mold- 
ing (¢) may stop, if the latter is separate from the base- 
board. For economy the plinth is often omitted, and the 
base and molding stopped against the architrave or side 
easing. The plinth may be of a straight piece, but upon 
the best work it conforms to the shape of the casing, as at s. 
If a plinth projects more than 4/’ beyond the face of 
the baseboard, it is a good plan to cut the front corner of 
the bottom end off about ,3,”” from the floor, and back to 
the line of the base, to admit a carpet, instead of cutting it, 
or leaving a bunch where it comes against the plinth. 
Door casings always should be set back to show 75’ 
or 2’’, as shown at h, Fig. 8; it is best never to finish flush. 
The fillet or corner thus left adds to the appearance of the 
work, for, if the casing were made perfectly flush with the 
door jamb, the slightest difference would be noticed. It 
also allows the latch of the lock to swing clear of the finish 
upon which it otherwise might make an ugly scratch. An 
exception to this rule is in putting the finish around win- 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
26 INSIDE FINISHING 
dows, where the edge of the casing should be flush with the 
inside of the pulley style, as shown at j, Fig. 8; the stop 
bead (k) hides the joint. 
Casings never should be spliced, for in every instance 
an unsatisfactory job results, as the joint is certain to open 
or start if the wood shrinks or swells. 
In putting up any kind of trim or standing finish, the 
workman will realize that it pays to be sure that the frames 
are set square and plumb, and that the ends of the casings 
are cut perfectly square and true both ways, and fastened 
exactly to their places. 
If every piece is set accurately, the work of finishing } is 
greatly reduced, as upon common work it is usually satis- 
factory to make a joint without planing. 
(C.) In putting on the corner block, as in many other 
things which vary in different localities, it usually is ex- 
pedient to follow the local custom. It should be put on 
with the grain running the same way as the header, of 
which it is a part. Generally it is the custom to put it 
on so that it is a part of the side casing; the only ad- 
vantage of this is that the end wood does not show. 
Again, no workman should cut the header of a plain door 
casing between the side casings, as that would give the 
opening an appearance of weakness which should be 
avoided, even where strength is unnecessary. Also, if 
the grain of the block is set vertically, the shrinking is apt 
to open the joint between it and the header, while if the 
grain of the block runs horizontally, the open joint will 
come between the block and the side casing, where it is 
less conspicuous. 
14. Moldings. —(A.) Moldings are indispensable to the 
carpenter in putting the finishing touches upon any piece
-P-A-G-E-39
  FLOOR LAYING, INSIDE FINISH 27 
of work. It is obvious that a molding which is intended 
to be used in a certain place might be entirely unsuitable 
for use elsewhere, for instance: the band molding, b of 
Fig. 9, would be entirely out of place if used instead of the 
    
  
WK 
vu w

cornice or crown molding which is shown at m. Thus it 
will be seen that the contour of the molding is not the im- 
portant consideration, but its relation to, and the shape 
of the other surfaces of, the piece upon which it is molded. 
Lumber dealers keep in stock the standard forms of 
moldings, among which may be found types which are 
suitable for every purpose for which moldings are used 
upon buildings. 
Those in most common use are shown in Fig. 9. The 
band molding (a) is used for the finishing member on the 
outside of a mitered casing; b is used sometimes for a 
band molding to form a rabbet upon a window frame, 
against which the siding is cut, to form a very tight joint.

The base molding (c) is nailed into the angle formed by 
the baseboard and the plastered wall, and the lip molding 
(d) is for the same pur- 
pose, though rarely used. 
The molding should be 
nailed to the top of the 
baseboard, and not to 
the wall, as otherwise the 
shrinking of the base-

such place. 
The bed mold (f) is used to fill a corner or as part of a

Fig. 11, using care that the edge (a) is, throughout, the 
same distance from the back of the box (6). 
Panel moldings are raised, as shown at g, Fig. 9, or sunk, 
as shown at h, and nailed to the frame of the panel work, 
as shown at j; if nailed to the panel, which may shrink, 
the molding would be pulled off the rails, making an

unsightly place upon the face of the panel work, while if 
properly done, the panel will shrink independently of the 
frame or molding. 
The distance between the back (7) of the lip molding, 
and the under side of the lip (J) should be #2’’, or less, 
smaller than the panel “ sinkage,’’ or the distance between 
the face of the panel work (J) and the face of the panel (0). 
This will allow the lip of the molding to fit closely against 
the face of the panel work, and will compensate for any 
slight inaccuracy. In mitering a lip molding, a small 
piece the size of the sinkage of the panel (I, 0, Fig. 9) should 
be used as shown at c, Fig. 11, to allow the molding to be 
sawed at just the angle at which it finally lies. 
A panel sometimes is laid out upon a flat surface by 
means of an astragal molding, shown at k, Fig. 9; it is 
used also to cover an open joint in a flat surface, and is 
valuable for a variety of uses. 
The crown molding or sprung molding (m) is used as the 
highest or crown member of a cornice. Moldings of this 
type are suitable for the cornices of cases of shelves, closets, 
etc., and should be cut in a miter box as shown at a, b, 
Fig. 11. 
The quarter round (n) is used, especially upon the cheap- 
est work, to cover the joint in a corner, if the pieces which 
form the angle do not come together. It 
also is used as in Fig. 12, to put up par- 2 
titions; one piece (a) is laid first and the 4 ic

moldings for the purpose of building up large cornices. 
It is also placed under the nosing of a stair tread, as at r, 
under a dado cap, or wherever a finish under a cap or a 
molding is needed. 
The nosing (r) is generally the edge finish of a stair tread, 
to round the edge of a board, a cap, or for similar purposes. 
The half round (s) is applicable to many of the same 
purposes as the astragal. The bead, shown at t, is used 
upon ceiling, and wherever it is necessary to hide a joint. 
Stop beads (uw) are used upon window frames to hold the 
lower sash in place; they are not confined to that design, as 
they may be shaped like , or w, or any other desirable form. 
Room or picture molding, as shown at 2, Fig. 9, is fitted 
around a room near the ceiling, forming the lower edge of 
the frieze, or border. Its use is to support picture hooks, 
as shown. Its outside angles should be mitered, but the 
inside angles should be coped, as shown at B, Fig. 10. 
(B.) Most of the moldings above described are mitered 
at both the inside and outside corners, except the base 
moldings, the room moldings, 
and other small moldings which 
should be coped at the inside 
angles, as described above, and 
shown in Fig. 10.

made of narrow pieces and fastened to the face of the 
work if desired, as indicated by the dotted line.

(D.) Nearly all of these moldings are modeled from 
those used by the architects and builders of the temples and 
public buildings which the Greeks and Romans erected. 
There are eight distinct types of these moldings capable 
of great variation without losing their distinctive form. 
These forms are shown in Fig. 14; at a is seen the ovolo 
or echinus, which is the 
parent of the quarter 
round; at b the talon 
and quirk, or bird’s beak 
molding, which should be @ 
used where it seems to Z 
support something as the 
shape suggests; at c the 
cyma. recta; at d the cyma 
reversa or ogee moldings ; 
at e the cavetto, hollow, or cove. The last three appear 
weak and should be used where they will seem to sup- 
port no weight, as the upper member of a cornice, for 
instance. 
The torus (f) (bead, round, or thumb molding) and the 
astragal (g) should appear to go around, as if to bind to- 
gether. The scotia (h) and the /illet (i) are used as inter- 
mediates, to separate one member of a compound molding 
from another, and to give variety to a large cornice, or to 
form a break in a wide, flat surface. 
The ovolo and the talon generally should be located 
above, and the scotia below, the eye. 
The contour of moldings of the best periods of archi- 
tecture is elliptical, not round, and in making and design- 
ing moldings, the workman should always strive for a 
graceful elliptical curve, instead of an arc of a circle. Fia. 14. tea fe 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 INSIDE FINISHING 
A comparison of the two forms will show the difference in 
appearance. 
In general, important moldings above the line of the eye 
extend upwards, and those below the eye extend down- 
wards, from the vertical plane at an angle of about 45°, 
so that no important member of the molding will be out 
of the line of vision. 
(E.) A baseboard is usually 8” wide, and should be well 
seasoned ; it should not be put on until the plastering is 
thoroughly dry, or it will curl off, the moisture in the plas- 
tering swelling the back of the board, while the front 
remains dry. 
When a single floor is laid, the baseboard is fitted upon 
the top of the floor boards, and a quarter round or shoe 
strip similar to n or w of Fig. 9 is nailed on to cover the 
joint, as at d, Fig. 7. 
If the shoe strip is nailed to the baseboard, the shrinkage 
of the floor and baseboard will show a crack under the 
shoe strip, but if it is nailed to the floor, the shoe strip will 
follow the floor, and move with it, thus showing no joint. 
If it is desired to dispense with the shoe strip, the base- 
board should be nailed to the wall after the under floor is 
laid, and the wearing, or top floor, fitted to the baseboard, 
as atc, Fig. 7. Care should be used in fitting the ends of 
the flooring to the baseboard, for if one floor board is 
forced too much, it will push the base away from the one 
which was laid before it. 
In cutting the baseboard down, the outside corners are 
mitered, and the inside corners cut square and butted upon 
common work; but upon the best class of work they should | 
be housed, as shown at a, Fig. 15, to insure that the season- 
ing and settling of the building will not open the joint.
-P-A-G-E-45

If it is necessary to splice moldings, the joint should be 
made in the least conspicuous place; to make the fewest 
possible splices, the long 
pieces should be fitted first. 
These splices may be made 
with either a butt or a 
miter joint, the latter of 
which is preferred by many 
workmen. r roy 
(F.) The quality of the “~ -— 
work done with moldings Fic. 15.—Hovusine Corners or Bass- 
depends to a great extent enue 
upon the condition of the moldings used, and the selec- 
tion of the material from which they are made. The 
lumber should be straight and straight-grained, and kept 
lying straight. After the moldings are “ stuck,” that is, 
made, they must be handled with great care, or the cor- 
ners and fillets will be bruised. 
One of the earmarks of a good 
workman is that he always 
leaves square corners; no 
rough, or “‘spalled ” (rubbed), 
or broken edges should be 
permitted, but all corners and 
angles should be _ perfectly 
», smooth and accurate.

“ cut and try,” lay out the moldings upon a board with 
a pencil, indicating a center line of each piece, and their

will give the sweep of the joint. Draw the chord of the 
are of the joint as indicated by the dotted line, and meas- 
ure the distance of its altitude at c; this must be trans- 
ferred to each piece which is to form the joint. Upon a 
large molding, it may be easier to find the sweep by the 
well-known problem of constructing a circle from three 
given points. 
16. The dado.— (A.) Woodworking machinery has | 
made the construction of panel work, similar to the types 
indicated in Fig. 17, a simple matter. A dado of matched 
or beaded ceiling may be easily and economically made, 
and is often used in places where a more expensive dado 
is unnecessary. A ceiling dado is made upon the work, 
but paneled dado is usually made in a shop which has 
all of the appliances necessary for doing the work eco- 
nomically and well. : 
The measurements for dado should be taken at the 
building after the partitions are set, and it is possible to 
locate accurately all the openings and angles. 
The different types of panel work, the names of their 
members, and the methods of construction in common use 
- are illustrated in Fig. 17. At a is shown a plain panel, 
and at b a raised panel; either type may be used upon 
the cheapest or the best work, depending upon the effect 
desired. The grooves for the panels in the different 
members of the frame are usually ;%’’ deep to accommo- 
date 3’’ of the panel and to allow for any possible swelling. 
The stiles (c) should be grooved, usually upon one edge 
only, to receive the panels and the ends of the rails d, e, f.

The top rail (d) is usually 1” wider than the stiles, to allow 
it to show the same width as the stile when the cap finish, 
similar to p,r, of Fig. 9, is in its place. One edge of the 
top rail and of the bottom rail (f) should be grooved, and 
their ends fitted to the stile. The bottom rail should be of 
a width to allow it to show at least ?’’ more than the width 
of the stiles when the base and the base molding are in 
place. The middle rail (e) should be somewhat nar- 
rower than the stiles, and grooved upon both edges, 
and fitted to receive the muntins (g) which should be the 
same width as the middle rails. The ends of the middle 
rails should be fitted to the stiles; the ends of the muntins 
should be fitted to the middle rails and also grooved 
to receive the panels. 
Six different ways of constructing panel work are in- 
dicated. At H is shown the form of construction known 
as “tongued and grooved”’ ; it should be used only in places 
where it will be firmly fastened, or where it will be re- 
quired to do no more than to support its own weight. The 
thickness of the panel may equal the width of the groove, 
or it may be thicker, in which case it is rebated to 
allow it to enter the groove as shown at J. This is much 
better, as the panel, being thicker, is not so apt to be 
split by a blow. 
The ends of the rails and muntins are grooved 35’’; in 
this groove is placed a tongue, 1” long, made to fit closely, 
but not so tightly as to risk splitting the wood. The grain 
of the tongue should be parallel with the rails (0), so that 
when it is in place, it will be at right angles with the 
stile (p). This is usually done by planing a board to the 
thickness of the width of the groove, and cutting pieces 
1” long off it as they are needed. If the work is well
-P-A-G-E-49
  
FLOOR LAYING, INSIDE FINISH 37 
made of dry material, and not roughly used, it will give 
very good satisfaction for a cheap grade of work. ; 
J illustrates the panel grooved and tenoned construction, 
between which and H there is much similarity. It makes 
a better and stronger piece of work, and considering 
all things, it costs about the same. This form of con- 
struction is often reénforced by doweling the joints be- 
tween the rails and stiles, and sometimes the joints of 
the muntins and rails are treated in the same way. The 
dowel holes must be bored before the grooves are made 
or there will be no center for the dowel bit. 
In the grooved and tenoned method (K) the groove (1-2) 
is cut with a circular grooving saw about 14” deep, the 
shape of the saw causing the curved shape indicated by 
the dotted lines. The tenon (3) is then fitted. The 
groove for the panels should be only 75’ deep. 
The mortised and tenoned joint, shown at L, is generally 
the method by which the best class of work is constructed. 
Instead of making the mortised joint, a doweled joint 
may be used. In this case there should be at least two 
dowels in each joint, which should be so located as to 
avoid the grooves which receive the panels. If a doweled 
joint is used, the holes must be bored before the pieces 
are grooved, or there will be no center for the dowel bit. 
If a mortised and tenoned joint is used, and the tenon 
coincides with the groove, there will not be so much 
work in digging out the mortise after the groove has 
been made. The doweled joint is often used, and with 
satisfaction, in shops which have neither mortising nor 
tenoning machines. 
At M is shown rebated panel work ; this type is much 
used in places in which the work is built in because, if the
-P-A-G-E-50
| 
38 INSIDE FINISHING 
tenon (3) is omitted, it can be built one piece at a time, 
and can be nailed through the edges so that no nailheads 
will show. This method is sometimes applied by building 
the frame of square edged pieces, and furring out a dis- 
tance equal to the back of the rebate (4). The thickness 
of a lath is about right for the furring. This form of con- 
struction is especially valuable in places 
where it is necessary that glass or wood 
panels should be put in place after the 
work is set up by using the back side of 
the pieces shown in the illustration as the 
con face of the panel work. The panels may 
ee be put in from the back.

FLOOR LAYING, INSIDE FINISH 39 
the spaces between the studding may be back plastered 
for either deadening or warmth, and the wall above plas- 
tered to a ground of the same thickness of the dado, as 
shown in Fig. 18, at a. One point of superiority of this 
method over nailing the dado upon the plastering, as is 
frequently done, is that the finish may be put on and the 
moldings stopped against the door casings much more 
easily and in a more workmanlike manner than if some 
of the moldings of the cap or base projected beyond the 
door casings, in which event they should be stopped by 
being returned upon ‘them- 
selves; that is, the contour 
of the face of the molding 
should be cut across the end, 
which will look as though 
the molding were mitered ; 
small moldings should not 
be mitered if they return 
only their thickness, as the 
short grain of the return is 
apt to break off. Large 
moldings may be mitered 
when a return is necessary. 
17. Rake dado may be 
made as easily as any other, 
if the work is done prop- 
erly, the difficult parts being to get the clamps on so 
that they will not slip, and to prevent the muntins 
(z, Fig. 19) from slipping as the pressure is applied by 
the clamps. 
As the top of the top rail and the bottom of the bottom 
rail of a piece of panel work usually are covered at least   
  Fic. 19.—Srrrine up Raxe Davo.

  40 INSIDE FINISHING 
one inch by the finish, they may be notched to receive the 
clamps as shown at a, b. 
Another and better method is shown at c, Fig. 19, in 
which a piece 14” wide is screwed to the outsides of the 
top and bottom rails to prevent their slipping, and the 
notches cut as indicated. These pieces may be used in- 
definitely upon similar work. To prevent the muntins 
from slipping when the pressure of the clamps is applied, 
a small piece of soft wood (e) may be cut upon the end at 
the angle at which the muntin intersects with the rails, 
and glued by a rub joint at the place where the long corner 
of the muntin will rest against it. 
The panel work must be tried together to be sure that 
each piece will go to its place with the least pressure ; 
pounding should be dispensed with as much as possible, 
as the small pieces (e) will be knocked off easily. 
If there is trouble in getting the stiles on, they may be 
easily brought to their places by the glue blocks (f) being 
fastened on both sides of the rails and stiles, and hand 
screws applied. Hand screws (h) will draw the stiles up to 
a joint. The face of the stile should be fair with the face 
of the rail. This should be done at each joint of the rails 
and stiles; it is customary to put on the glue blocks (f) at 
the same time that the blocks (c) are applied. It is gen- 
erally better to use cold glue for work of this sort. 
Some workmen prefer to cut the ends of the rails, and 
make the joints against the stiles after the panel work has 
been glued up and the glue hardened, because it is some- 
times difficult to keep the ends of the rails exactly in line. 
The top rail may be brought to the stile by applying a 
hand screw, as at g. The middle and bottom rails may be 
brought up to a joint by extending clamps across the face
-P-A-G-E-53
  FLOOR LAYING, INSIDE FINISH 41 
of the panel work from the outside of the stile over a 
muntin; this method should be applied carefully, as the 
muntins may be pulled away from the rail, or the edges 
bruised. The former method is considered the better. 
18. Soffits. — (A.) For a curved soffit, or the jamb of 
an arched opening, there are several methods of obtaining 
a piece of the desired sweep. One method known as 
“ kerfing ’’ consists of 
making, with a clean 
cutting saw, a series 
of cuts or kerfs across 
the face of the soffit, 
~ and nearly through to oe ds, 
the back. These cuts a Saat 5 
should not be made in 
a hit or miss manner, 
but at regular inter- 
vals, so that, when the at 
soffit is bent to fit the xy... -\ll arch, the sides of each Fic. 20.—A Scarrep Crrcurar Sorrir. 
saw cut will come together on the face. The distance 
between these cuts may be found by the method in- 
dicated in Fig. 20, in which ab and gd both equal the inside 
radius of the soffit. . : 
The piece of wood from which the soffit is to be 
made should be of clear, straight-grained stock, and 
held upon a straight surface with a hand screw, as at c. 
The saw cut g should be made square with the edges of 
the piece, at the distance from the end of dotted lines d, 
which equals ab; the end should then be lifted up 
until the saw cut g is brought together. The distance 
h should be carefully measured with a pair of compasses 
    
      
       
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  42 INSIDE FINISHING 
and spaced from g a distance each way equal to the radius 
of the semicircle ef. All cuts should be made with the 
same saw with which the cut g was made, and to the same 
depth. In applying this method, it is necessary that the 
distance between the centers of the saw cuts shall equal 
exactly the distance h, so that when the soffit is in place 
the pressure necessary to bring it to the correct curve 
will force the sides of the cuts closely together, and con- 
ceal them as much as possible. 
One objection to this method is that unless the face of 
the soffit is smoothed off with a crooked-faced smoother, 
after it is in place, the curve will appear to be a series of 
short faces between the cuts and, if the work is to be fin- 
ished in the natural wood or stained, the cuts will show; 
if the wood is painted, a very satisfactory job may be made. 
This work often is done by bringing the ends together 
and fastening them at the right place, after filling the saw 
cuts with glue. After the glue is set, the face may be 
smoothed off upon the bench. 
Another modification of the same method is to make saw 
cuts in the back at equal intervals, and, after bending the 
soffit around a form to the correct curve, to fill the saw 
cuts with feathers of wood glued in, as shown at Kl, 
Fig. 20. 
After dressing the back off to the desired thickness, the 
piece may be handled as any straight piece, as it will hold 
its shape, though it will have but little strength. 
(B.) A circular soffit may be made also of any kind of 
soft, flexible wood by preparing thin pieces which are to be 
bent to the desired form, the face piece being of the same 
kind of wood as the finish it is to match. These pieces 
should be bent to the required curve by means of pieces

    inches apart, as at a, Fig. 21, or over a form, as in Fig. 20. 
The pieces to be glued together are forced to the pieces

Usually, one twelfth or one fifteenth of the radius of the 
sweep will be a safe spring allowance. This is the method 
commonly used in cabinet shops upon the best class of 
breaking it ; if many are to be made, a form of the correct 
shape should be used, as that is the most economical way.

or the stiles which are fitted upon the end.

method of construction used in panel work. 
In circular panel work, the panels are usually plain 
and built up of several layers of veneer. If a raised 
panel is desired, the panels are sometimes planed to 
  Fic. 22.—A Sprayep Sorrir. 
  
       
-P-A-G-E-57
  FLOOR LAYING, INSIDE FINISH 45 
the right curve and if a very quick sweep is wanted that 
may have to be done, but it is difficult to do it prop- 
erly. This is a very laborious and expensive method, 
and the results rarely justify it; instead, it is quite the 
usual practice to warp the panels to the right curve after 
they have been molded or raised. This is done by wetting 
the side, which is to be convex, with moist sawdust, 
and exposing the other side to dry heat. 
The panels should be watched carefully, and tried fre- 
quently with a pattern of exactly the desired curve, and 
when the panel has warped to fit the pattern, the wet saw- 
dust should be brushed off, and the panel set where the air 
will reach both sides of it evenly, until it has dried thor- 
oughly. As the panels are apt to straighten somewhat in 
drying, it is best to allow them to warp a little more than 
the pattern demands. 
21. Closets. — (A.) Ample closets should be provided 
for various purposes, as nothing adds more to the livable- 
ness of a house, or appeals more to the heart of the house- 
wife. Inevery kitchen there should be closets for groceries, 
dishes, etc. In many houses a dust and vermin proof 
closet is specified for holding the family linen. This closet 
should be fitted with shelves and drawers, the details of 
which generally are provided by the architect, or by the 
owner. 
(B.) A moth proof closet should be built of a good grade 
of sound, well-seasoned lumber, and made proof against 
dust, moths, and vermin. The doors should be made tight 
by the use of weather strips; naphthaline or moth wax 
should be used plentifully to insure against damage by 
insect pests. A red cedar chest or closet, while new, is 
satisfactory, but the wood loses its aroma in a few years,
-P-A-G-E-58
  46 INSIDE FINISHING 
after which, unless the surface is planed, it is no more 
moth proof than any other wood, though it may still 
resist the ravages of boring insects and of mice. 
(C.) China closets are built usually in the dining room. 
They should have glass doors, and be at least 12” deep in 
the clear inside. Clothes closets may be of almost any 
size, but they should not be less than 48” high. They 
should be provided with hooks ; if there is a shelf, the ca- 
pacity of the closet may be increased by screwing into its 
under side hooks which are especially useful as places to 
hang garments which are on forms. 
(D.) The pantry should have shelves not less than 10’ 
wide above the principal shelf, which may be from 18’ 
to 30” wide, and 30” from the floor, to be used for a 
working table. Covers should be arranged in the wide 
shelf for the flour and sugar barrels, which should be 
in a closet underneath. Bins for meal, ete., are often 
wanted by the owner, who usually decides how the 
shelving is to be arranged. In the best houses, the 
pantry shelves are inclosed by doors, but this is not 
often done upon ordinary work. 
(E.) A large trunk closet, or one for general storage, is a 
great convenience. In most houses planned by architects, 
these closets and their details are carefully worked out, 
and the carpenter who fits up these and other little con- 
veniences in a new house is sure to be appreciated. 
22. A drawer case for bedding, linen, or clothing is fre- 
quently needed, and should be placed where it is easily 
accessible from the bedrooms. It is a good plan to place it 
in a closet, so that when the door is closed the case will be 
out of sight. In some places the case of drawers may be 
placed across the end of a closet or alcove, so that there will 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  FLOOR LAYING, INSIDE FINISH 47 
be no need of finishing the ends. Such a case is shown 
in Fig. 24. 
In making the drawer case as illustrated, the joints of 
the partition frames (a) should be made by being tongued

and grooved, or doweled at the corners and glued. The 
standards (6) which support the partitions should be 
grooved at c, at the proper distances to fit the drawers 
which slide between them. 
After the glue has set, the partitions should be planed 
square and fair, and all but the bottom one notched, as at 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
48 INSIDE FINISHING 
d, to receive the casings (e). The hl rail of the bottom 
partition should be made narrow to allow the base to be 
glued upon it, as at f, the joint being strengthened by glue 
blocks (g) if desired. The standards and partitions may 
now be nailed together, the casings (¢) and the base (f) 
being glued and nailed with finish nails, unless a very good 
piece of work is being done, when the pieces should be 
glued only. If nails are used, it will not be necessary to 
leave hand screws upon the work until the glue sets. The 
joint at j, between the casing and base, should be mortised, 
tongued and grooved, or doweled. One casing may be 
left loose if desired, as it will be easier to fit the case into 
the space which is to receive it, though if one end of the 
case is finished, the casings should be fastened permanently, 
Be sure that a case of this sort is set up square, as it will - 
save much trouble in fitting the drawers, the construction 
of which is indicated by sections h, h and k, k. The top 
of the case should be glued up, if one board of suitable 
width cannot be found, and may be either fastened on or 
left loose, as may seem wise considering the setting up of 
the case. 
After the drawer is fitted and the front planed, leave it 
with the front flush with the face of the case, and mark 
with a pencil beside the drawer sides on the partitions; 
remove the drawer and nail the runs (I, l) in their places. 
It is obvious that any slight inaccuracy in the squaring of 
the drawer will make no difference in its running, After 
the runs are in place, the drawer should be stopped 2” or 
less back of the face of the case by nailing a piece back of 
the drawer to prevent its being pushed in too far. 
The dimensions of the case shown are purposely omitted, 
as each piece of work will have its own length if the case is
-P-A-G-E-61
  FLOOR ‘LAYING, INSIDE FINISH 49 
to be fitted in; but cases in general range between 2’ 6”” 
and 3’ 0” in height, and 16” and 24” in depth. 
In fitting a drawer, many workmen make the mistake 
of running it too loosely; it should run as closely as 
possible against the guides. The less that can be planed 
from the bottom edges of the drawer sides the better, as 
any taken off there weakens the support of the drawer - 
bottom; if the sides are too wide, they should be made 
narrower by planing off the top edge. 
Be sure that the bottom of the drawer front does not 
drag on the partition, also that the ends of the front clear 
the space in which it runs, for if the outside of the face of 
the drawer front rubs against the case, it may splinter. 
Care should be used to leave an open joint; the least pos- 
sible difference between the ends of the opening and the 
drawer front is sufficient. 
The use of a wax candle, paraffin wax, bayberry tallow, 
or oven a piece of soap, upon the drawer and guides where 
there is apt to be friction, is of great help. If a drawer 
runs hard in damp weather, do not plane off more than 
is absolutely necessary, as artificial heat will cure almost 
any drawer which ever fitted, if it is made of seasoned stock. 
23. A kitchen sink should be set with a pitch toward 
the drain to allow the water to run off freely. The drain 
should be connected with a sewer, or carried to a sufficient 
distance to insure that there will never be any annoyance 
from it; this work should be done by a plumber in a 
sanitary manner. Upon one side of the sink, usually at 
the left, there should be a dish drainer for conducting the 
water into the sink as it drains from the dishes; this 
should be set at an incline of about 1’ to 1’, as shown in 
Fig. 25, at a.
-P-A-G-E-62

There should be no closet under the sink; the place 
should be left open to allow a free circulation of air. 
A splash board (6) 
should protect the wall 
from water, back of 
and above the sink.

there is little opportunity for woodwork in the bathroom 
of the modern house. 
25. Wood mantels, hardware, and other special finish 
are often furnished by the owner, though a limit to the 
price may be specified in the contract. Any expense 
incurred in pleasing the owner’s fancy is figured as 
an extra, though the best plan is to keep the cost of extras 
as low as possible, since it often causes misunderstanding, 
unless each matter is settled in writing as it occurs.

  CHAPTER III 
Doors 
26. Doors for all ordinary purposes can be purchased 
in stock sizes much more reasonably than if they were 
made to order. Stock doors usually are doweled, and if 
well made of thoroughly seasoned material are perfectly 
satisfactory; a doweled door can be made more econom- 
ically than a mortised door, therefore it is 
sold at a less price, but if well made it will 
give just as good satisfaction. 
For a 12” door, 4’ dowels, placed “stag- 
gering,” as shown in Fig. 26, will make a 
stronger job than if a mortised joint were 
used, other things being equal. These doors 
usually are coped after the dowel holes are 
bored, as otherwise there will be no center 
for the bit. The grooves for the panels F's: 26.—Posr ra TION oF DowELs. 
should be 3” deep, to allow the panels which 
enter 4 to swell 3’ without opening the joints between 
the rails and stiles. Sometimes a shallower groove and 
cope are used, the panels being proportionately narrower. 
The joints in the doors are made by machinery, and are 
forced to their places and held there by clamps while 
the glue sets. 
27. Stock sizes of doors cover a wide range, but those 
most commofly used are 2’ 6” x 6’ 6”, 2’ 8” x 6’ 8”, 
#10" X 6’ 10”, 3’ 0" <7’ 0"; either 12” or 13” thick.

Doors other than those commonly used are generally 
made in these same sizes, but they are kept in stock by 
none but the largest dealers. 
28. Selection. — In selecting a door, be sure that the 
material and workmanship are all that the quality of the 
door demands, and that it is straight and out of wind; 
' if these things are carefully considered in purchasing doors, 
time will be saved in hanging them. 
Upon ordinary work the doors may be of any wood, re- 
gardless of the finish of the rest of the house, though often 
they are veneered to match the rooms which the doorway 
connects. 
Solid doors are made of white pine, cypress, Carolina
-P-A-G-E-67
DOORS 55 
pine, and poplar or whitewood, generally preferred in the 
order named. 
There are usually three grades of doors recognized: 
#1, #2, #3 or common. The #1 door is supposed to 
be first-class in every respect; the #2 door may have a 
few blemishes which do not injure its strength or appear- 
ance greatly, and is the grade of door commonly used. 
A common door is of poor stock and workmanship, and is 
used only upon the cheapest grade of work, usually receiv- 
ing a coat of cheap paint at the factory, to cover up some 
of the defects. 
29. Veneered doors, if well made, are in general more 
serviceable than other kinds. Solid hardwood doors will 
not hold their shape 
well, therefore they 
are veneered by 
the following pro- 
cess. A core (see a 
of Fig. 27) of thor- 
oughly seasoned ‘eat 7 
white pine is made Fic. 27.—Tue Giuep Core ror A VENEERED 
by ripping a plank DeOk, 
12” or 12” thick into pieces at least }’’ wider than the 
finished thickness of the core; these pieces are laid side by 
side or turned upon their edges, as shown at a, a, a, a, 
Fig. 27, until, with the face edge b, they aggregate a little 
more than the desired width of the member of the door 
for which the core is intended. The pieces are then turned 
end for end, or other edge up, to cross the grain, as at a, Fig. 
27, thus counteracting the tendency of the different pieces 
to change their shape. After the joints have been fitted, 
the pieces are glued together. A piece of the finish wood
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 | INSIDE FINISHING 
should be glued upon one edge of the stile at the same time, 
as at b, Fig. 27. After the glue has set, all the cores of the 
door should be jointed straight and out of wind and dressed 
to the desired thickness. 
In preparation for veneering the sides of the cores, the 
backs of the veneers and each side of the cores should be 
planed with a scratch or toothing plane, to make the 
glue hold better. Veneering should be done in a hot shop, 
with wood thoroughly heated, and with hot glue, which 
should be of about the consistency of cream, so that it 
will spread evenly and rapidly. The glue should be ap- 
plied with a broad glue brush, not a paint brush in which 
the bristles are usually set in glue, or the glue in the brush 
will soften and allow the bristles to come out. The glue 
should be spread thickly enough to cover the wood well, 
and the veneer of both sides put on at the same time. 
Several Hells of the same size may be piled and glued at 
once, and placed in a veneer press, or it is sometimes done 
with large hand screws, if a veneer press is not available. 
The former method is the better, but as the work has to 
stay in the press until the glue sets, few shops are fitted 
with a sufficient number of veneer presses to allow of their 
use exclusively. Care should be used that no glue is 
spattered upon the face side of the veneer, or the pieces 
will stick together. A caul, or a piece of thick, straight 
wood of the proper size, is placed between the hand screws 
or veneer press and the veneers of the outside pieces. 
The caul should be a little larger than the work which is , 
being veneered ; it should be waxed carefully to prevent 
the glue from sticking to it, and placed where every part 
of the surface of the veneer will be under pressure. The 
pile should be built carefully, to be sure that it is straight
-P-A-G-E-69
  DOORS 57 
and square, and that every part of each piece will receive 
the required pressure. The pile should be built vertically; 
unless this is done accurately, the pile may ‘‘ buckle” or 
break when pressure is applied. 
When the veneers have been glued upon the cores, the 
stiles and rails should be of the desired thickness of the 
door. After the veneering is done, proceed as with solid 
pieces. 
30. The doorframes, if the finish is to be in the natural 
wood, should be of'the same kind of wood as the trimming 
of the rooms which the door connects. Usually they are 
made 13” or 14” thick, and in width equal to the thick- 
ness of the partition, and rabbeted to fit the thickness 
of the door. ; 
Upon common work, the door jamb is often made of 14” 
stock. However, when rabbeted, this is not thick enough 
to hold the screws of the 
hinges properly. If this 
thickness of stock is used, a 
stop is sometimes nailed on _| 
to form the rabbet. This is 
not a workmanlike thing to 
do, as the stop is apt to be 
loosened by the slamming of    
      the door. If 14” jambs have c 
to be used, grooves should eee Ome 
be cut into them as shown at a, Fig. 28, to hold the 
stops. 
There are several styles of door jambs or frames, but 
those shown are the ones most commonly used. Figure 
28, b, is a popular form, as the door may be hung upon 
either side of the jamb. Doorframes between rooms which
-P-A-G-E-70
58 INSIDE FINISHING 
are finished in different woods are veneered to match the 
rooms in the best class of work. 
Door jambs like a and 6, Fig. 28, generally are fitted 
together with a butt joint, as shown at a, Fig. 29, and those 
like c are mitered, as 
shown in Fig. 29, 6. 
F They should be fas- 
a tened together by 
6 spikes, and squared, 
being held by battens 
tacked diagonally 
across the openings 
from stile to header, 
and across the bottom of the frame to hold the stiles 
parallel. This is very important since, if the doorframe 
is not square, there will be trouble all through the casing 
and in hanging the door. 
31. The doorframes of a brick house are wider than 
those of a frame building, as the walls are thicker. The 
frame is sometimes set as shown in Fig. 30. In this way 
any size of frame stock may be 
used, though a paneled frame as 
wide as the thickness of the wall is 
i ea deecsied — To. set fe VY 
a doorframe economically, the open- F1c.30.—Smrrie 4 Door- 
ing left in the studs should be mie cs 
on the sides, both ways, and 1’ wider and }” higher than 
the outside of the doorframe. In this opening, the door- 
frame should be set perfectly plumb and out of wind, in 
which position it should be wedged and fastened securely. 
The time spent in setting a doorframe accurately is   Fie. 29.—Jornts or Door Jams.

-P-A-G-E-71
  DOORS 59 
more than compensated for in fitting the casings around it, 
and in fitting and hanging the door. If the doorframe is 
not set plumb, the door will swing of itself unless it is fas- 
tened open or closed. 
Wedges or “‘ shims ” should be placed between the frame 
and the stud to allow the frame to be nailed straight ; they 
are used also where the hinges are to be set, so thatif it is 
ever necessary to put a long screw in the hinge, there will 
be wood to hold it. In setting a 13” frame this always 
should be done. 
In setting the doorframes of a brick house, a piece 
should be nailed the entire length of the wall side of the 
frames, so that the wall may be built around it, as at a, in 
Fig. 30. It should be so placed that the bricks will have 
to be cut as little as possible. A piece of 2” X< 4” or 2” 
Xx 6” should be laid in the brickwork at the bottom of 
the door opening, level with the floor, to give a nailing for 
the flooring and the threshold. 
It is the carpenter’s business to assist the mason in set- 
ting the frame, and he should see that it is securely braced 
plumb and out of wind before the wall is built around it. 
33. Jointing.— A door should be jointed before the 
threshold is cut down, and the edges made to fit the rab- 
bets of the frame closely. In doing this, the advantage 
of setting the doorframe accurately will be appreciated. 
The door should be fitted carefully to the header or top 
of the doorframe, at a, Fig. 31, pushed into its place, and 
wedged there, as at b. 
The threshold, or a piece of the same thickness, should 
then be placed against the bottom of the door, as at c, and 
a pencil line (d) made on the door, to indicate the exact 
length of the door after the threshold is in place. The
-P-A-G-E-72

door should be sawed off about }’’ shorter than this line. 
If a carpet is to be laid over the threshold, either the door 
should be still shorter, or the 
threshold planed thinner. 
It is a good plan to dispense 
with a threshold by building up 
3” or 3’ under the floor ; this gen- 
erally will allow the door to swing 
| over a carpet or rug. 
34. Hanging a door.— In hang- 
ing, or fitting the hinges to a door, 
trouble will be saved by using care 
| and accuracy at each step of the 
work. If the hinge stile of the door 
lh is not perfectly straight sideways, 
if the rounding side should be placed 
tees eee next the rabbet, as a good joint Ori. - BPC ane der ye between the door and the back 1 
of the rabbet can be more easily 
made than if the hollow side of the stile were to be fitted. 
‘ This applies more especially to the hinge joint, as a slight 
hollow in the lock stile will be remedied by the latch. 
After the door has been fitted to the side and head rab- 
bets, as at a, e, f, Fig. 31, it should be dropped 3’ by 
drawing out the wedge (b). Make a knife mark 8” from 
the top of the door, at.g, to which the top end of the upper 
hinge should be placed; for the bottom of the lower 
hinge, make another mark at h; on line with the top of the 
bottom rail of the door. These marks should be made 
upon both door and doorframe simultaneously. 
Remove the door; stand it edgeways on the floor with 
the hinge edge up; lay the hinge carefully in its place, the

distance is governed by the 
thickness of the door, and 
the projection of the round 
of the hinge beyond the face 
of the door, necessary to allow 
the door to swing wide open 
and clear the finish. 
With a piece of wood of the 
same thickness as k, or the

in the rabbet of the door-

which each half of the hinge is to rest.

the door and the frame at r will be a little less than +5”, 
to insure that the paint upon the door and upon the frame 
will not make the door “hinge-bound.”’ With a sharp

hinges ; bore holes for the screws, and fasten the hinges 
on. Ordinarily a 1}4’’ screw is used for this purpose. 
If the door is sprung, and strikes the rabbet of the frame 
on the hinge stile, or does not fit the rabbet on the lock 
edge (f, Fig. 31), do not plane the stile of the door to fit, 
but instead mark the rabbet carefully, and with a rabbet 
plane take from the jamb the wood which prevents the 
door from closing. 
The lock edge of the door should be jointed a little under 
so that it will clear the frame easily. It is quite a general 
rule among carpenters to fit the face of a door so that 
a twenty-five-cent piece will just slip into the joint all 
around it. After the door is fitted satisfactorily, it is ready 
for the lock. 
The loose-pin butt (a, Fig. 33) and the loose-joint butt 
(b) are the types of hinges generally used. The latter has

an advantage over the former in the ease with which a 
door may be removed and replaced, though some trouble 
may be caused in keeping the right and left hinges separate. 
The terms “right” and “left” as applied to hinges and

it is pushed open.

Also there are several forms of spring and special hinges, 
which are for use upon doors swinging both ways, or self- 
closing. Hinges should be set so that the door will swing 
wide open without touching the finish, as shown at z, Fig.

hinges should be upon ZN == MA

Hinges for cupboard 2 
doors and Other com- 
mon work are often cut entirely into the door, as at a, 
Fig. 34; but upon the best work they are halved into both

35. Fitting locks. — (A.) The rim lock, shown in Fig. 
35, is less expensive than a mortise lock, and as it may 
be put on very easily, is used upon 
Cle the cheapest work. If the door rat- 
tles, the striker or latch plate (a) 
may be set back into the frame, or 
the lock itself may be set out by 
means of pasteboard or thin wood 
between it and the door. 
Padlocks are useless unless the hasp 
and staple by which they hold the 
door are fastened firmly in the wood ; 
if padlocks are to be exposed to 
dampness, those should be selected which have brass or 
bronze tumblers, otherwise they will rust so badly as to 
be worthless in a little while. 
(B.) To fit a mortise lock (Fig. 36), bore a 2” hole for the 
knob spindle, as at a, and a ;),’’ hole at b, for the key, being 
sure that they are accurately located before boring. 
The mortise should then be marked, and “ beat out ” Fic. 34. Cupsoarp H1nazs.

Usually both rim and mortise locks are reversible, that is, 
their latches may be changed to suit either a right or left 
hand door. 
Cupboard locks are usually screwed to the inside of the 
door. 
36. The threshold.— In cutting down a threshold, con- 
siderable skill is necessary to make a good job. Figure 38 
shows the different steps of the process. Drive nails ‘in 
‘the floor at a, a, opposite each side of the doorframe, at

exactly the same distance from each rabbet (d), and far 
enough from the plinth to allow the threshold to be moved 
endways without touching it. Mark lightly upon the 
floor the line 6, b, the edge of the threshold when it is in 
place ; this line should be parallel with the threshold when 
the edge c, ¢ of the latter is resting against the nails a, a. 
The distance (z) between 6 and c should be taken with a 
pair of dividers, and with one leg touching the rabbet (d) 
make lightly a short scratch at e upon the threshold, 
marking the other end also. Without changing the di- 
viders, lay off the same distance from the jamb (f) and 
from the face of the plinth (g), as these denote what will

have to be cut out to allow the threshold to go back into 
its place. 
Do not use the try-square to lay out the ends, as they 
should be made to fit the horizontal section of the door- 
frame, which is rarely set perfectly square with the faces of 
the partition; therefore the cuts may be made with a knife 
at the angle of the jamb, which is found by using a straight- 
edge, or by the blade of a steel square, as shown at h. 
The square is in position to obtain the first cut (¢) which 
is from the rabbet (d) to the edge of the threshold (c). 
Upon the line, e, of the threshold, lay off the exact size 
of the rabbet (d); measuring from 7, mark j with the point 
of a sharp knife. With the steel square held against the 
long side of the rabbet, as indicated by dotted lines at y, 
move the threshold until the point, 7, coincides with the 
edge of the square. Draw the line, k, which will rest 
against the long side of the rabbet at w when the threshold 
is in place. 
Following the above method, make all marks neces- 
sary for the fitting of that end of the threshold. The 
length of the threshold is found by measuring the exact 
distance between the two jambs, from m to m opposite, 
and by laying it off upon the threshold from the cut, 7, 
to the corresponding cut upon the other end. This 
should be a little -long, not a measurable distance, say a 
little less than ;’’ in order to be forced to a close fit. 
Having obtained this point, proceed in the same way as 
in marking the first end, moving the threshold so as to 
make the points of length coincide with the straight- 
edge when held against the members of the doorframe 
which are to be fitted by corresponding members of the 
threshold, as described above.
-P-A-G-E-79
DOORS Gi 
All cuts should be made a little under, that is, shorter 
on the back or under side than on the face, so that the 
threshold may be forced into its place without marring 
the jamb. The outside ends of the threshold should be 
returned upon themselves, as shown at n. 
The result of the work will depend upon the care used, 
and while the .process may seem intricate, if it is fol- 
lowed through carefully once, it will be found to be 
much more simple than it appears.

37. Window frames. — Window frames for common 
work are made generally in localities where labor and 
power are cheap, are sent 
to the market ‘knock 
down” (K.D.), or in 
“ shooks,”’ and nailed 
together at the building 
where they are to be 
used. The size of the 
window frame is gov- 
erned by the size of the 
sash it is to accommo- 
date. The width of a 
window frame is between   
  
  
  
  
  
the pulley stiles (a, Fig. 
39), and the height is =* 
measured from the point 
where the outside of the 
lower sash strikes the   
  
              
sill or stool (g), or at the     
    
inside of the parting strip 
  (h), to the header (j), .F1¢. 39.—Wzyvow Frame wirn 4 Sincue 
as from 6 to c, Fig. 39. Siu. 
  There are a number of di fferent styles of frames; 
those for common use are made usually after one of two

methods. The one shown in Fig. 39 generally is used 
upon the medium grade of work in the East, and has 
stood the test of many years of service in trying climatic 
conditions with perfect satisfaction. It has no subsill, 
and no blind stop, the blinds being hung upon the out- 
side of the casing, as discussed later. Since there is but 
one sill, there is nothing to curl up and allow water to 
drive under. 
As the clapboard, or siding (/), is generally thinner than 
that in common use throughout the West, a }” outside 
casing (m) is all that is necessary to give sufficient sink- 
age to the siding. It is a cheaper frame to make than 
that generally used throughout the West. 
Where this frame is in common use, it is quite the 
general custom to board the house upon the studding, 
and let the back of the outside casing (m) rest upon the 
boarding (n), cutting the siding (k) against it as at d. 
To make a nice job, the frames are often set before 
the house is boarded in, with the outside casing’ (m) 
nailed to the studding, and the boarding (n) cut against 
it, as at e, Fig. 39. Before the frame is set, or while it 
is being made, a band molding (f) is mitered around the 
casing, 3’ or 2” from the outside edge, and the siding (k) 
cut against it. In this case, the pulley stile (a) should 
be ?” narrower than if the frame were set as at d. 
This makes a warm and a good looking piece of work, 
and is used often. 
In making this frame, the pulley stile is grooved for the 
stool (g) upon a pitch of 1” in 7”, and the stool nailed in, 
as ats. The bottom of the stile is cut off square with the 
edges about 3’’ below the stool at the outside edge; this 
gives a square base instead of a slanting one to rest the
-P-A-G-E-83

frame on while handling or setting it. A piece known 
as the pocket (p) is cut upon the inside edge of each 
pulley stile as shown by section rr, at s, Fig. 39, 
for the purpose of allowing the sash weight to be 
removed easily. The pocket is afterward replaced, and 
fastened in with a screw at the top, 
and nails at the bottom, as indi- 
cated. 
The parting strip (A) usually stops 
at the header, though a mortise is 
sometimes made there, to receive the 
top end of the parting strip. A wide 
stop bead (¢) should extend from the 
inside of the upper sash to miter with 
the side stop strips; this is, however, 
part of the finish and not of the win- 
dow frame. 
The frame generally used through- 
out the West (Fig. 40) is a more ex- 
pensive and finer looking frame than 
the one described above, but it gives 
no better satisfaction, as the subsill (a) 
is apt to curl up and allow water to 
driveunder. The groove inthe bottom 
of the sill of both frames is to receive Fic. 40.—Wrxvow Frame 
the top edge of the siding. The pul- 3h") eee ae 
ley stile is sometimes cut off flush 
at the bottom of the subsill, as at c, and the sill (0) 
nailed upon the bottom of the whole frame, thus giving 
a slanting base upon which the frame must rest while it 
is being handled. Some manufacturers run the pulley 
stile down to the bottom of the sill, as indicated by dotted   
  
  
  
  
                  
  
 
-P-A-G-E-84
    72 INSIDE FINISHING 
lines, grooving it to receive the sill as at s, Fig. 39. This 
makes a much better job. 
The blind stop (f) and subsill (a, Fig. 40) add to the 
appearance of the frame, and allow the blinds to be 
hung between the casings 
(h) which are generally 13” 
or 1} thick. Thick cas- 
ings are necessary to allow 
the siding to be cut in and 
to prevent it from pro- 
jecting beyond the face 
of the casing, as the siding 
generally is thicker than 
that used in the East, 
where a 2” casing is suffi- 
cient. In this type of 
window frame, the part- 
ing strip (¢) is usually con- 
tinued across the header, 
as atd. The pocket (p) is 
cut the same as in Fig. 39. 
The outside casings of 
frames for wooden build- 
ings are generally 4’’ or 
YL 43” wide; this allows the

ing, known as a box frame, Fig. 41. In this frame, the 
weights run in a box which is inclosed back of the pulley 
stile. The outside casing usually projects beyond the 
back of the pulley stile 3’ as at a, Fig. 41, around which 
the bricks are laid, holding the frame firmly in its place. 
The staff bead (6) generally is set about 3’’ from the 
back of the box, or the extreme outside of the frame, at c, 
and the brick laid against it as indicated, though some- 
times as at g. Under the stool, as at d, is a groove which 
should be filled with cement when the frame is set upon 
the stone sill, thus preventing water from driving under. 
Aside from these distinctions there is no essential dif- 
ference between the frames for a wooden and a brick 
building. : 
The architect often furnishes the details of the window 
frame and of the sash, and generally the only important 
point in which they differ from the ordi- 
nary stock window frame, aside from the 
specially designed moldings, is in the sill, as 
at a, Fig. 42, and in a drip upon the bottom 
rail of the lower sash (6). The advantage 
is that water cannot drive under the sash, 
as it may in an ordinary window. If the 
water drives under the sash, it has access to pig 42.—sroon 
the end wood of the stiles, and will in time yp» Sasu wir 
cause them to decay. ae 
Mullion frames, consisting of two or more windows in 
one frame, are frequently used. The mullion pulley stiles 
should be 32” or 4” apart, or far enough to allow the 
two sets of the window weights to work freely, if hung 
sash are used. A stud is frequently set in the mullion 
to support the header of the opening. If this is done it 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 INSIDE FINISHING 
is plain that the backs of the mullion pulley stiles must 
be far enough apart to allow room for the stud and the 
two sets of weights. The header of the frame should ex- 
tend the entire length between the end pulley stiles of 
the frame into which it should be grooved, the tops of 
the pulley stiles of the mullions being grooved into the 
underside of it. 
The pulleys for all window frames should be strong 
and stiff, for if made of too light metal, they will wear 
out quickly, or heavy weights may spring them, thus 
allowing the cord to catch, causing much trouble and 
annoyance. The top of the pulley is ay placed 5’ 
from the under side of the header. 
Frames for casement windows usually are made to 
allow the sash to swing out, as otherwise it is quite 
difficult ‘to make them rain-proof. One objection to 
swinging the sash outward is that fly screens cannot be 
placed upon the outside of the window, though as they 
may be placed upon the inside, this is not a very im- 
portant matter. : 
Window frames are often needed to accommodate 
center hung sash, which should swing with the lower 
half outward, otherwise the rain will be guided into the 
house. Sometimes sash are pivoted in the center of 
the top and bottom. This practice is not recommended 
for outside sash, as a rain-proof joint cannot well be 
made, though for inside work this method is quite satis- 
factory. A pin hinge is used for this, of which there are 
several forms upon the market. 
38. Window sash. — The construction of senile sash 
is practically the same in all parts of the country, though 
in some places the members are lighter than in others,
-P-A-G-E-87
  WINDOW FRAMES AND SASH 75 
thus making it necessary that the frame and the sash 
should be of different sizes for the same size of glass, ac- 
cording to the style of sash used. 
The names of the different members of a sash are given 
in Fig. 43. If the sash springs out of shape, it is diffi- 
cult and often impossible to

A sash should be made as é & 
light as possible, in order that | | Meeting kalo” 
the weight may be at a mini- 
mum and that the glass surface 
may be at a maximum. N i 
The strength of a sash de- LR 
pends upon its construction at f 
the corners, which should be 
made in the strongest way pos- | |e Rait~ 
sible. Figure 44 shows the 
mortised, tenoned, and coped 
joints of the top and bottom rails. The ends of the 
muntins are fastened to the rails by the same method. 
The tenon is split a little distance from the edge, as at 6, 
or a saw cut is made by a thin saw, and a wedge (c) 
driven in, to make the tenon wider upon the outside of 
the stile than at the shoulder of the joint, thus forming 
a dovetail; the mortise is cut longer upon the ends to 
allow the split tenon to be pushed over. This should 
be done at each joint where a tenon comes through to 
the outside of the sash, though it is rarely done except

    upon the best work, or upon heavy sash. This is not 
the method in general use in the manufacture of common 
sash ; commonly the tenons are pushed 
through, and the wedges driven be- 
tween the ends of the mortise and the 
tenon. This gives fair satisfaction, 
and nearly all sash are made this 
way, as it is cheaper and easier. A 
hole is sometimes bored, and a pin 
driven through the mortise joint, and 
in large sash the joint is often draw- 
bored. 
The attention of the student is 
called to the joint between the meet- 
Wibonelad ing rails and the stiles (Fig. 45) as this 
Fia. 44.— Mortisep ano has to stand hard usage. Most people 
Corny Ons in pushing up the bottom sash of a 
window lift under the middle of the top or meeting rail, 
and if the sash sticks a little, several heavy 
blows are usually given under it. In time, Z\\ 
this will break the joint and destroy the ZN l 
sash; it may to some extent be prevented “0%” “4 
by using the strength as near the stiles as ce 
possible, working one side at a time, if the 
sash does not go up easily. To stand this 
usage the meeting rail is joined to the stiles 
by the dovetailed joint shown at aa, the 
strongest form of joint that can be used 
upon a sash of this sort. 
A stronger form of sash than this is 
made, in which the stiles extend beyond 45 yeme 
the meeting rails about 3”, as in Fig. 46. we Ram Jowr.

     WINDOW FRAMES AND SASH 77 
This form of sash should be used where the greatest 
strength is necessary. 
The edges of the meeting rails which form the joint 
between the upper and the lower sash are joggled and 
beveled ;. they should fill closely the space 
between the upper and lower sashes, as at 
b, Fig. 45, occupied by the parting strip, 
which will be described later. 
A 1” hole, 1” deep, should be bored 
about 14’’ from the top of the edge of each 
sash as at f, Fig. 43, and a 2” groove }” 
deep cut from near the hole to the top of 
the sash, as shown at b, b, leaving a space 
between its lower end and the hole, as USOC eae aes 
shown at c. A #’ hole should be bored  orMeerncRam 
through c, from the groove to the hole, as 7°'™ 
shown at d, to allow a cord to pass through and to keep 
the knot in its place. 
When the sash are in place, the joint between the 
meeting rails is made tight by means of a sash fast, 
which pulls them together. 
39. Glazing sash.— Glass should be cut about }’ 
smaller each way than the rabbet, to allow it to go in 
without forcing ; it should be bedded before 
= being laid in the rabbet. This is done by 
covering the part of the rabbet on which 
the glass rests with putty, as shown in Fig. 
47, a. In order to do this successfully, the 
  Fic. 47, — Sec- i 
rion or a putty should be as soft as it can be handled, 
Graze Sasi. for the glass has to be pressed into it until 
it bears evenly, and only about ,',’’ of putty is left between 
the glass and the wood, as at a. This pressure should
-P-A-G-E-90
  | 
78 INSIDE FINISHING 
be distributed lightly and evenly, therefore the necessity 
of soft putty. Another way of doing this, which is pre- 
ferred by many workmen, is to roll a thin layer of soft 
putty upon a flat board; then by 
holding the glass at an angle, as 
shown in Fig. 48, a narrow strip 
of putty is taken off upon each 
edge as at a, and the glass laid 
in its place and carefully pressed 
down. This method can be ap- 
plied only in a warm temperature, 
as the putty chills quickly. When conditions are right, 
it is the best and fastest way of bedding glass. 
The glass should be held in place by glazier’s points 
while the putty sets. These are small triangular pieces 
of sheet metal which are driven 
into the sash with a chisel as 
shown at a, Fig. 49. The putty, 
as soft as can be handled, should 
be laid in and run down with a 
putty knife to the angle shown 
at b (also at 6, Fig. 47), care ¢ 
being used that the putty does ad 
not project beyond the rabbet oe ee 
of the sash, so as to be visible from the other side. 
If an old sash requires a new light of glass, the old 
putty should be cut out with a chisel, or if there is time, 
soften it with hot, soapy water, or some of the prepara- 
tions made for the purpose of removing paint and putty, 
of which there are several upon the market. After the 
glass is set, the putty should be painted the color of 
the rest of the sash.

40. Stock sizes of sash.— Common sash are made 
in stock sizes in a variety sufficient for almost any pur- 
pose. These are determined by the regular sizes of 
glass, as the following list shows. 
This list is for four-light windows, all 13”, or 13” in 
thickness; it will be noticed that an allowance of 5” in 
width, and 6” in height, is made for the outside sizes of 
the sash, or the size of the frame, between the pulley 
stiles in width, and the stool and header in height at b, 
c, Fig. 39; if a different allowance is desired, it easily 
may be made.

Sash are spoken of as 2-, 4-, 8-, or more light; a hung 
window is composed of two sash, the upper and the 
lower. Thus in speaking of a window, a carpenter would 
say, ‘(a 14 X 28, 4-light window,” or “a 10 X 12, 12- 
light window,” omitting the word “ inches,” as that is 
always understood. 
To find the outside size of a sash, its different mem- 
bers must be estimated. To allow for any slight varia- 
tion in cutting, or for the sash being out of square, the 
glass should have 34” play; that is, the opening for a 
14 X 30 glass should be 144” x 303’. To this must be 
added the width of the stiles between the rabbet and the 
outside edge, and the width of the muntins between the 
rabbets; the same rule applies in finding the height of 
the opening. 
Thus the outside dimensions of the sash of a 14 X 30, 
4-light window, are 33” x 66”. 
Single sash may be described as being so many lights of 
a certain size, and to avoid mistakes, the size of the glass 
and the size of the outside of the sash should be given in 
an order, omitting nothing which will make the order 
plain. 
41. Fitting a sash. — (A.) In jointing the sash to fit 
a window frame, the upper one should be fitted first, 
the edges being jointed so that the meeting rail will be as 
nearly level as possible. The edges of the lower sash 
should be jointed so that the tops of the meeting rails of 
both sash will be parallel in about the relation shown at 
b, Fig. 50; this distance should be taken with dividers 
and scribed off the bottom rail of the lower sash, as at 
either c ord. Ifa glazed sash is being fitted; it is ob- 
vious that the scribing should be done upon the inside of
-P-A-G-E-93
  WINDOW FRAMES AND SASH 81 
the sash at d, before the stool cap of the window finish is 
nailed on, though it is equally plain that the best place 
upon which to scribe the bottom rail of an unglazed sash 
is upon the outside at c, as the inside, at d, 
will be out of sight when the stool cap is 
in place. A bevel should be set to the 
angle of the window stool with the pulley 
stile, and the bottom rail of the sash planed 
to fit it. The sash should be made to bear 
a little harder upon the outside than it does 
upon the inside, as at e, to prevent the 
water from driving under. When the sash 
are properly fitted, the tops of the meeting 
rails will be flush, as at f. The sides of 
the sash should be made to run easily, 
but not enough to rattle perceptibly. . 
(B.) Sash generally should be fitted Fic. 50.—rirrine 
and hung before the house is plastered ; Gane 
at all events before the finish is put up, as the house is 
thereby closed against the weather. Another advantage 
in hanging the sash before the finish is put on is that the 
cord may be pushed through the pulley from the window 
opening, and the weight tied on; the cord may then be . 
cut and fastened to the sash without taking the pocket of 
the frame out, obviously an easier and more economical 
way than to hang the sash after the house is finished 
inside. If it is necessary that the house should be finished 
before the sash are hung, the weights are usually put in, 
and the cord run through the pulley from the back of 
the stile. A knot is then tied in it, so that it will not 
slip back, after which the sash may be put in at any 
time, as the cord is ready for it. This is not a desirable 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 INSIDE FINISHING 
thing to do, as the cord:is in the way in jointing the 
upper sash. 
If sash are not hung, nor the cord put in before the 
standing finish is put on, it will be necessary to remove 
the pocket of the window frame and to pass the cord 
over the pulley from the outside, and to pull it down to 
the pocket between the back of the pulley stile and the 
stud by means of a “ mouse.” This is a small weight 
which can be pushed through a pulley; it is often made 
on the job by tying a nail on a string, or by rolling a piece 
of sheet lead around the end of a piece of twine. After 
the other end of the twine has been tied to the end of 
the window cord which is to go through the pulley, the 
mouse may be pushed through the pulley and allowed to 
drop down between the stud and the pulley stile until it 
may be grasped by the hand through the pocket, at p, 
of Fig. 39. The weight is then tied on and pulled up to 
the back of the pulley; the sash is put in its place at 
the bottom of the opening in which it is to slide, and 
the cord cut off about 4’’ below the 1” hole in the edge 
of the sash at.f, Fig. 43. 
The end of the cord should then be pushed through 
the 2” hole (d, Fig. 43) and the knot tied, when the sash 
is ready for the stop strips which are to hold it in place. 
42. Hotbed or skylight sash are made upon a prin- 
ciple entirely different from those in ordinary use, as 
they must be so constructed that water will run off 
easily. They are made to lay upon a pitch which should 
be not less than 2” to a foot. There are no middle rails; 
the bottom rail is thinner than the stiles or the top rail, 
the glass extending over it, so that the water will have 
no obstruction in its flow.
-P-A-G-E-95
  WINDOW FRAMES AND SASH 83 
Upon sash of this description, the glass usually is 
lapped about 1’’ over the pane below, with no putty in 
the joint. It is bedded and puttied at the sides by the 
usual method, the glass being held in place by glazier’s 
points, and prevented from dropping down while the 
putty is setting by means of a glazier’s point bent to 
hold the glass or by a small brad driven in the sash be- 
  Fia. 51.—Sxyuicut Sas. 
low each pane of glass, as at a, Fig. 51. These brads or 
points should be driven so that the putty will cover 
them. 
The sash for hotbeds and greenhouses need not be 
placed with so much care to prevent leakage as would 
seem necessary; the glass may be cut as square as pos- 
sible, and laid end to end with a butt joint, instead of 
lapping as shown at b, Fig. 51; a strip is then screwed 
upon the frame of the sash to hold the glass in its place, 
as shown at a, Fig. 52. This eliminates all putty, and
-P-A-G-E-96
  
  84 INSIDE FINISHING 
allows repairs to be made easily, and the water which 
will leak through, ‘if the glass is cut accurately, is insig- 
nificant. 
In hanging a skylight sash, the joints should be made 
rain-proof by some method similar to that shown in Fig. 
51, at sections c, d, e, in which strips are fastened upon 
the sash in such a way as to allow the sash to be lifted 
easily, but which will be water-tight when the sash is 
closed. The worst feature of a skylight is the condensa- 
tion of moisture from 
the inside of the house 
= upon it, the dropping of 
  
  EB which is often mistaken 
for a leak. This may 
a A be. remedied by an ar- 
rangement of grooves 
and gutters to carry the 
condensation away and allow it to run out of doors upon 
the roof. This is not practicable nor advisable, unless 
there is a considerable area of roof to be treated, as in 
a dwelling house the skylights are rarely of a size which 
will make this an important matter. 
There are patent forms of hothouse frames, similar to 
Fig. 52, 6, which will care for the condensation of large 
areas of glass. : 
43. Store sash.— Sash for store fronts are of the 
same construction at the corners as other sash, except 
that the stiles and rails are heavier and should be put in 
place with the molded side out, instead of the puttied 
side, as in common sash. In store fronts large lights are 
sometimes held in place with a bead instead of putty, as 
in Fig. 53; this allows a certain amount of elasticity, as Fic. 52.— Horsep Guass Framgs.
-P-A-G-E-97
  WINDOW FRAMES AND SASH 85 
the bead will spring and allow the glass to move a little, 
so that a strain, which would break the glass if it were 
held rigidly with putty, may do no damage. 
If a large glass is broken, pieces may be left which 
would be of value if they could be removed safely, and 
the bead setting makes this pos- 
sible. This method of setting 
glass has its disadvantages if the 
sash is to be exposed to the rain. 
This may be remedied by bed- 
ding the glass upon the outside Fic. 53.—Serrine Guass in 
with putty, or rubber tape. Sion Winton 
Such bedding alone will not hold the glass sufficiently to 
interfere with removing it, if necessary, by simply taking 
out the bead from the inside of the sash. 
In making glass doors which are to receive hard usage, 
the molded side of the door should fit against the rabbet 
of the doorframe, so that the weight of the glass will be 
against the wood instead of against the putty aid points 
when the door is slammed. 
44. Blinds are made in factories under the same con- 
ditions as are sash and window frames. They are ordered 
generally by the size of the glass, the same as sash. 
They usually are hung upon gravity hinges, which are 
so made that when the blind is swung past the center in 
either direction, it will swing the rest of the way itself, 
and will remain either open or closed. 
Upon window frames which have blind stops, the 
blinds are hung between the outside casings, but if the 
frame has nothing but the casing outside of the pulley 
stile, the blinds are hung with special hinges. This latter 
is the usual method of hanging blinds in certain parts of

the country; in other places the gravity hinges are more 
popular.

45. Making measurements. The principal dimen- 
sions to be ascertained in measuring for a stairway are 
the rise and run. The term rise denotes the extreme 
height between the top of the lower floor and the top of 
the floor above, or the actual distance to be mounted in 
going from one floor to another; the term run refers to 
the horizontal distance which the treads must cover. It 
depends upon the size of the riser and of the tread whether 
or not an “ easy ”’ flight of stairs may be built. 
Usually in localities where there is considerable build- 
ing in progress, there are men, called stair builders, who 
make a specialty of this part of house construction, and 
who can do the work more cheaply than can the ordinary 
all-round workman. It is their custom to measure the 
building for the stairs after the floor joists are in place, as 
then there is less liability for mistakes. In fact, this cus- 
tom is followed in every case possible in getting out any 
kind of finish. : 
A carefully dimensioned sketch of the stair opening is 
made, and the headroom calculated at the building, if 
there is any doubt as to the possibility of constructing a 
satisfactory stairway. This sketch should include the 
arrangement of the treads, platforms, landings, winders, 
and all dimensions necessary to enable the material to be 
prepared accurately at the shop.

46. Laying out stairs. — For an example of the method 
of laying out a flight of stairs, we will imagine a room 8’ 
in the clear between the floor and the plastered ceiling, 
as in Fig. 54. Allowing the plaster and laths to be 2”

thick, the floor joists 8’’ thick, and a single matched floor 
4’ thick, the entire rise of the flight will be 8’ + 3/7 + 8” 
+ #’, which is 8’ 98”, or 1053”, = 105.625.” 
In eden to find ‘ds exact height of the riser, which is 
usually the first part of the stairs calculated, we assume 
that 14 risers will be necessary to make an easy ascent; 
therefore the height of each will be 105.625 + 14 = 7.54”, 
or a little more than 73’. This rise may be satisfactory 
for a flight of stairs which has to be crowded into a small 
space, or where economy of space is necessary, but as it 
is desirable that the height of a step should be less than 
that, we will allow 15 risers to be used; therefore, the
-P-A-G-E-102
90 INSIDE FINISHING 
height of each will be 105.625 + 15 = 7.04”, which will 
make a much better rise. 
The height of the riser being found, the next thing is, 
to find the width of the tread. If a straight run or a 
straight flight of stairs is being built, the herizontal dis- 
tance between the starting and stopping points (a, of Fig. 
54) may be divided into any number of treads; but if the 
flight has either a platform or winding treads, a plan should 
be sketched showing the location of the face of each riser, 
as in Fig. 55. A tread may be of any width sufficient to 
allow the foot to rest upon it safely, and the riser Ge any 
desired height not too high to reach easily by lifting the 
foot, but experience has shown that a certain range of 
proportions gives the best satisfaction. One method, as 
simple as any, of finding the width of the tread to fit a 
certain rise, is to subtract the sum of two risers from 24; 
the difference will equal the width of the tread. Thus, 
24 — (2 X 7.04) = 9.92, practically 10; the flight would 
be spoken of asa 7’’ X 10” flight. The width of the tread 
is between the riser lines, as at 6, 6; to find the exact 
width of the board which is to form the tread, it will be 
necessary to add to this the projection of the tread beyond 
the riser line for the nosing or finish of the front edge of 
the tread, usually 1”, as at 1. Thus the board forming a 
10” tread will actually be 11’ wide, as at c, c, l, of the two 
lower steps. 
Another common method of finding the width of the 
tread is to divide 66 by the height of the riser; thus, 
58 = 93’, or. the width of the tread. The.student will 
see that the two most common methods give different 
results, therefore we may make the applications of the 
above rules somewhat elastic, as circumstances demand. 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
STAIR BUILDING 91 
Experience has shown that a rise of between 7” and 73”, 
and a tread of from 93” to 103” will give a satisfactory 
flight of stairs for ordinary use. For public buildings, 
and where the stairs are to be used by children to a great 
extent, the risers should be not over 7” high, and the treads 
should not be more than 12’ wide. 
Figure 55 shows a place where a flight of stairs requires 
a platform and winders. It will be seen that there are 
15 risers and 14 treads,

narrow, nor too wide 
for safety and comfort. In this case, though a platform 
would be desirable at both turns, it is plain that the two 
winders are necessary to allow the treads of the rest of 
the stairs to be of a satisfactory width. An extra tread 
could be placed in the lower run, but to have placed 
another tread in the upper run, which would have been 
necessary if a platform had been used, would have made 
each of the five treads in that run too narrow. 
It is good practice to plan the winders so that at 18” 
from the post, they will be about the same width as the 
treads of the rest of the stairway; four winding treads will 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
92 INSIDE FINISHING 
be too narrow, and two treads in the winder would be too 
wide for safety and comfort. 
47. Headroom. — It is necessary that judgment should 
be used in planning the headroom, or the vertical dis- 
tance between the lower steps and the under side of 
the floor above (see d, d, Fig. 54), as any less than 7’ 2” 
will not allow a large piece of furniture to be moved from 
one floor to another without danger of defacing the wall. . 
Though a headroom of 6’ 6” will allow a person of aver- 
age height to pass without danger, any less than 7’ 2” 
- appears cramped, and is inconvenient ; any more than 
this distance that can be allowed will add much to the 
appearance, as a roomy stairway gives the impression 
of spaciousness to the hall and to the whole house. 
48. Stringers. — (A.) Stringers or carriages (e, Fig. 54) 
are the timbers or joists upon which the treads and risers 
are fastened, and as they support and give strength to the 
stairs, they should be made of lumber which is free from 
weakening defects. 
Figure 56 shows one method of laying out a stringer.

or foot of the stringer can be moved a little to com- 
pensate for any slight inaccuracy; but if intended for 
a place where a greater degree of exactness is necessary, 
another method should be used. The entire length of 
\

the stair stringer should be laid out upon the piece, as 
between f and g of Fig. 54, which is the length of the 
stringer, regardless of the projection at h, which furnishes 
a nailing for the laths of the ceiling, at the same time 
making a stronger fastening possible. The angles and 
distances of x and y should be calculated carefully, and 
accurately laid off upon the stringer to be cut, the posi- 
tions of the points y being averaged so as to make all 
the steps of the same size. This is the method in most 
common use. The length between the points f and g of 
Fig. 54, may be found mathematically by using the follow- 
ing formula : — 
R = run of stringer, to g. 
A = rise of stringer, to f. 
H = hypotenuse or bridge measure. 
H=VR?+A®. 
The pitch board, shown in Fig. 57, is preferred to the 
framing square by many workmen; it consists of a right- 
angled triangle of thin wood of the 
same dimensions as,one of the steps, 
fastened to the side of another piece 
as shown. It is apparent that if the 
pitch board is used for the same pur- 
pose as the steel square in Fig. 56, it Fr. 57.—Tue Prrow 
will be a convenience. ro 
After the points of the stringer have been accurately 
laid out as described in the second paragraph of this topic, 
the exercise of a little judgment will make it possible to 
locate the intervening points y, of Fig. 56, so that any 
slight inaccuracies will not be apparent. 
The pieces which are cut out of the side stringers may

be spiked upon the crowning edge of a piece of scantling, 
and used for the center string, instead of cutting another 
timber; in doing this, care should be used that the tread 
and riser lines are exactly in line with each other, which 
may be best assured by marking all by the first one made, 
working from points y of Fig. 54 and Fig. 56. The rough 
stringers are usually put in place as 
soon as possible for the convenience 
of the workmen. 
If the face or outside string is to 
be of the same wood as the finish of 
the house, and is intended to take the 
place of the face casing or skirting 
board, the risers should be mitered 
into it, as shown at a and 6, Fig. 58. 
Stairs built of this form of finish, that 
is, the ends of the steps open except 
at the balusters, are called an open 
string flight. The style is in common 
use, as it may be built as simply or 
Fic. 58.—TInrerseottion as elaborately as desired. Upon ordi- or Risers AND Face . 
seus nary work, the face stringer above 
described is the form in most common 
use, but upon better work it is the custom to put the 
face casing on after the house is plastered, as it is apt to 
become discolored and marred before the stairs are ready 
for finishing. 
(B.) The skirting board is sometimes fitted against the 
treads and risers, making a square joint, as shown at a, 
Fig. 59. The nosing is cut off, as at b, so that the skirting 
board may be more easily fitted. This method is used to 
some extent upon common work; the worst thing about 
\   
   
-P-A-G-E-107

it is, that the seasoning of the build- 
ing and of the skirting board will 
cause the joints to open eventually. 
It is a nice piece of work to fit the 
wall skirting board to the steps, but 
if done ever so carefully by the 
above method, the work will, on 
account of the shrinking of the 
material, in a few months look like 
a botch job. ' 
Another method is to cut the 
skirting board into the treads and fic. 59.—Frirme a Skat

tion a, a shows the groove which is continuous across both 
risers and treads, the nosing being cut out to allow the 
skirting board to fit be- 
tween the end of the tread 
and the wall. This makes 
a very good job, and is a 
more economical method 
than that shown in Fig. 
61, where the wall skirting 
board (a) is wide enough 
to receive the treads and 
risers, which are grooved, 
or housed in. A place is 
cut in the back of the ver- 
tical groove, as at b, and 
in the bottom of the hori-

receive the wedges (d), by

and riser may be pressed firmly into their places, This 
is the method éommonly used upon the best work, and 
if the work is well done and of seasoned stock, there never 
will be any trouble from the opening of the joints, against 
which it is the first thought of the finished workman to 
guard. In this method, 
the nosing (e) and the 
scotia (f) both should be

risers butted against it, supported by furring strips nailed 
to the skirting board. This method should be used only 
upon the most common work, since the joints are certain 
to open as the building seasons. 
In building closed string, buttress, or curb stairs, the 
construction of which is illustrated in Fig. 62, the treads 
and risers are frequently housed into the wall string, 
or wall skirting board, as at a, and into the inside of 
the buttress, or face string, as at b, by the same method, 
and firmly wedged and nailed. The rest of the closed 
or buttress string is then built upon the inside piece, as 
atc. In constructing buttress stairs, the flight sometimes 
is built clear of any wall or other support, in which case 
the buttresses should be made of sufficient strength to 
support the flight and the heaviest load they ever will be

required to carry. If stringers are used, they should be 
far enough from the skirting board (6) to allow wedges 
to be driven which will force the treads and risers into 
their places, as illustrated in Fig. 61. If it is desired to 
build an economical flight of stairs of this type, a plank,

face stringer may be used, housed the same as the wall 
stringer, as indicated at n, Fig. 76. 
Another method is shown in Fig. 63, in which the skirting 
board (a) of the face string is housed into the treads and 
risers; this is the stronger way, as the joints are less liable 
to open than if built by the other method, since the frame- 
work which supports the buttress, rail, and face casing

is fastened to the treads 
and risers. ‘There are other 
methods of constructing a 
buttress string, but the two 
above indicate those ordi- 
~ narily used. 
In places where lumber of 
the proper dimensions can- 
not be secured, a: stringer 
is sometimes built by a 
method similar to one of 
those illustrated in Fig. 64. 
A built stringer, however, 
is rarely satisfactory for any 
but very light flights. 
Figure 65 shows two 
methods of fastening the 
heads, or tops of stringers, 
either of which is satisfac- 
tory, and may be used where 
the stairs are not supported 
by section posts. 
49. Forms of stairs.—There are different forms of stairs 
which may be adapted to various shapes of stair openings.

STAIR BUILDING 99 
The straight run (Fig. 54) has no turn, being straight 
from top to bottom, and is an inexpensive form of stairs to 
build. It is preferred upon common work for that reason, 
although a flight of this sort cannot be made so attractive 
as if it had an angle witha platform. It is less ornamental, 
=r"     
  
      
  ay Fic. 65.— Meruops or Fastentne THe Tors or STRINGERS. 
and is used less than any other form, though in buildings 
where large crowds are to be accommodated the architect 
tries to secure a straight flight if possible. 
A platform flight (Fig. 55) is a popular form, as it makes 
a safe and easy ascent. It may be made as ornamental 
as desired, and is frequently the center of the decorative 
scheme of an elaborate hallway. The figure shows a plat- 
form, illustrating all the turns of a full platform flight. 
A winding flight usually is avoided as much as possible, 
as the narrow treads close to the post or rail cause many 
accidents, besides appearing small and pinched, as com- 
pared with the broad turns of a platform flight. A wind- 
ing flight rarely should have more than four risers in the 
winding posts, though in attic or cellar stairs this is not 
observed, unless there is plenty of room. The upper half 
of Fig. 68 shows the plan; a full winding flight would 
make all of its turns by winders.
-P-A-G-E-112
    100 INSIDE FINISHING 
A dog-leg flight (Fig. 66) sometimes is used where it is 
necessary to economize in room and as wide a flight of stairs 
as possible is desired. The face string of the lower flight 
is directly under that of the upper flight, making an awk- 
ward place to receive the rail and balusters of the lower 
flight, since either they must 
stop under the face string of 
the upper flight, or there must 
be an easement to allow the 
hand to pass by, as ata. This 
makes the lower flight nar- 
rower. The rail therefore is 
frequently omitted between 
the place where the rail ease- 
ment occurs and the post. 
A box flight is built between 
two walls, and is the cheapest 
form of stairs to build, as there 
is no finish upon the outside, 
a skirting board being fitted 
against the steps at each side 
by one of the methods previ- 
ously described, and a rail 
fastened to either one or both 
of the walls. 
The method commonly used 
in framing the face string of 
stairs into the posts is shown in Fig. 67, where a finished 
face string (a) is used. A tenon is cut upon the end 
of the string to fit the mortise in the post, as shown at 6. 
If the angle is turned by a platform, the risers (c, c’) are 
also mortised into the section posts, as shown at d, d, the

top of the upper riser (c’) being the height of one step above 
the top of c. If the angle is being turned by winders, the 
risers, c and c’, are the lower and Te 
upper risers entering the section a" 
post. 
Upon ordinary work the wind- 
ing risers (e, e), shown by dotted 
lines, usually are sawed to the 
correct bevel and nailed to the 
winding post; upon good work, 
and wherever the greatest strength 
is necessary, they should be ten- ,,,.

50. Stair posts. — (A.) Stair posts are placed at the 
bottom, top, and angles of the stairs, as indicated in Fig. 
68, the plan of a flight of stairs showing the location of 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 INSIDE FINISHING 
every stair post in common use. Figure 69 shows the 
method by which the squares receiving the carriages and 
rails are laid out. 
(B.) The horizontal dotted lines denote the height of 
the risers, and the vertical dotted lines show the width of 
the treads ; the points of intersection of these lines show the 
pitch of the stairs, with which the handrail is parallel, the 
angle of the pitch and the height of the handrail govern- 
ing the vertical dimensions of the squares and turnings 
of the posts. 
The newel post (a, Fig. 68) is located at the bottom of the 
flight, and is larger and more ornamental than the section 
posts, as it generally occupies a prominent place in the 
hall. The bottom square should extend 3” above the top 
of the bottom tread and, if it is to receive more than one 
riser, the bottom end of the square should be enough 
longer to allow the risers to enter and leave the 3” space 
above the top of the tread, the rest of the post being 
unchanged. 
The platform post (b) is located at the angle formed by 
two short runs, a platform being the means of making 
the turn. It will be seen in Fig. 69 that there are three 
squares to this post, the two upper ones receiving the rails 
of the runs, / and 2, which form the angle in the stairs, and 
the lowest square receiving the carriages. 
The winding post is shown at c, the bottom square ex- 
tending high enough to allow it to receive the rail of the 
second section. It varies in length to allow the winding 
risers and the face stringers of the runs, 2 and 3, of the 
stairs to be mortised into it, the face of the stringer, or 
the face of the casing being kept back from the outside 
corner of the post 14’, to allow the nosing or finish of

the tread to land back of the corner of the post. This is 
observed in all the posts, so that there will be a place 
against which the finish of the steps may be stopped. 
The risers of the winding treads are mortised into the 
bottom square, radiating from a point 14” from the lower 
and inside face of the post, as shown in Fig. 69. The 
mortises should enter the post at the same angle at which 
the risers intersect it, the shoulder of the tenon upon the 
riser being upon the back side. In setting the posts, 
stringers, and risers, it is obvious that the posts and risers 
of the angles should be set simultaneously. 
The landing post (d) is located at the head of the stairs; 
the upper square receives the rail of the third section of 
the flight of stairs, and the rail of the landing or the gallery 
which extends to the starting post (f) of the next flight. 
The bottom square extends below the ceiling, and is fin- 
ished with a rosette on the bottom. The other landing 
post is the same as d, but receives no rail from the stairs ; 
it supports one end of the gallery rail extending to the gal- 
lery post (e). 
The gallery post (e) is to support the end of the rail which 
extends between it and the left landing post (d). This post 
, usually is cut in halves, one part being fastened to the wall, 
where it makes a better appearance than if the whole 
post were used. 
The starting post (f), used to start the second flight, just 
as the newel post starts the bottom flight, should receive 
the gallery rail from the right landing post, d. 
(C.) All of these posts, except the gallery post, should 
be mortised to receive the stringers or carriages, and the 
joists of the gallery or landing ; if the work is well done and 
the risers well fastened to the wall, the stairs will need no
-P-A-G-E-117
  STAIR BUILDING 105 
additional support under the face stringer. However, 
unless there is another flight of stairs underneath, it 
usually is studded up for a closet. 
Any stair post may be laid out by the above method, 
but in practice the builder will generally order his stair 
stock from the mill, or building supply house, or will have 
the stair-builder do the work. For ordinary work, the 
stock sizes of posts will be satisfactory, for by the exercise 
of a little judgment they can be made to fit stairs of almost 
any dimensions. 
The squares of stock posts furnished by mills and supply 
houses are usually suitable for a rise of 74 or 73”, 
these being about the average rises used for stairs. 
The following table gives the vertical dimensions of 
posts which will, in most cases, be satisfactory ; their loca- 
tions are indicated upon Fig. 68. If a larger post is used, 
the squares should be lengthened, and the turnings short- 
ened proportionately.

Concerning the sizes of the posts in the above table, it 
will be well to remember that a6” x 6” post will be about 
52” x 53”, and a 4” x 4” post will be about 32” x 33” 
when they have been planed on all four sides, though the
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 INSIDE FINISHING 
usual way of speaking of them is upon the basis of their 
sawed dimensions. 
If it is necessary that the base, or bottom square, of the 
newel post should receive more than one riser, or that the 
bottom square of the winder receive more than four risers,, 
and the top end of the lower stringer or carriage, the ag- 
gregate height of the desired risers may be added to the 
length of the bottom square. If the angle included in the 
winder contains three risers, instead of four, the top of the 
bottom square should be lengthened the height of one 
riser, and the turning shortened-an equal distance, to allow 
a landing for the top of the lower rail against the bottom 
square of the post. 
The distance a of the newel post (Fig. 69) may be 
about the same as distance 6 of the platform post, though 
the newel post is sometimes set so that the bottom riser 
will come 1}”’ from the front of the post, instead of 33” as 
indicated. This requires that there should be one less 
baluster upon the lower tread, and that the shaft of the 
post should be enough longer to allow the rail to land in 
the middle of the vertical height of the square. The di- 
mensions indicated upon the table will generally be satis- 
factory, as the bottom square is often made somewhat 
longer than necessary, in anticipation of the necessity of 
adjustment and of scribing it to the floor. The height of 
the rail may be varied a little to allow it to come as near 
the middle of the square as possible. 
The bottom square of a winding post, unless laid out 
for a certain place, should be about three inches longer 
than actually required, as any variation in the rise should 
be corrected at this place if possible, rather than by raising 
or lowering the rails sufficiently to make them perceptibly
-P-A-G-E-119
  STAIR BUILDING ¥ 107 
out of pitch. The rosettes (f) should be turned separately, 
and nailed on after the bottom square has been cut to its 
exact length. This is the practice of many stair-builders, 
but others prefer to have the rosette turned on the post, 
and allow the bottom square to extend as it will below the 
ceiling or stair stringer. 
The bottom squares of the landing, gallery, and starting 
posts are usually so cut that they apparently extend 
through the floor. They are notched over the thickness of 
the floor, which includes the ceiling, floor joists, and floor- 
ing, to rest against the side of the floor joist or header, the 
bottom end of the post showing its full size, ornamented 
with a rosette, as at d of the starting post. It is the cus- 
tom of some stair builders to face the thickness of the 
gallery landing or floor its entire length, and notch the 
bottom square of the posts as above described; however, 
the post rests against the facing instead of the facing 
being cut against the post; in this case, the post projects 
1}” to receive the nosing and scotia of the finish. 
Upon common work, the riser between the last tread 
and the floor level, and the facing of the thickness of the 
floor, are often cut in square between the posts with a 
simple butt joint, but in the better class of buildings they 
are mortised into the posts, the same as in the winder and 
platform posts. It is plain that the former method will be 
affected by any settling of the building, while by the 
latter, the joints will not open. The bottom of a post 
which extends down upon a plastered or paneled wall, or 
in a corner, should be finished as shown by the bottom 
square of the gallery post. 
A turned post should be laid out accurately, or there may 
be trouble in making the rails, stringers, and risers join
-P-A-G-E-120
108 INSIDE FINISHING 
it properly. Upon the best class of work, turned posts 
are rarely used, some simply designed square post being 
in much better taste, in which case the connections may 
be made more easily, the post being cut to length at the 
bottom end, when its length can be measured exactly at 
the building. 
51. Treads and risers. — Different methods of putting 
the treads and risers together are illustrated in Fig. 70. 
q ~The method shown at 
d fe a is in common use 
upon the better class 
of work, as the tongue 
and groove joint be- 
Fic. 70.— Construction or TreAps AND tween the tread and 
Coe riser at h prevents dirt 
from sifting through, and minimizes the effect of the 
shrinking of the tread and riser. 
Some stair builders tongue and groove the riser into the 
tread above it, as shown at b, but the front edge of the 
tread is thereby weakened, so that when it is somewhat 
worn from rough usage, it will break off more easily than 
if the groove were not there. The cheapest form of con- 
struction is shown at c, all of the joints being square, with 
no grooves. This form is suitable for the cheapest class 
of work only. 
The forms of moldings or nosings in common use for 
finishing the edges of treads are shown at d, Fig. 70, and 
the scotia at e. 
A method of embellishing the risers of a flight of stairs 
which is capable of either simple or elaborate application 
is illustrated in Fig. 71. This method requires that a. 
distance equal to the thickness of the scroll should be cut 
   
-P-A-G-E-121
  STAIR BUILDING 109 
off from the shoulder, or from the plumb cut of the top of 
the stringer, and that the mortise in the post should be 
set back an equal distance, as it is obvious that the face 
of the scroll should be considered the face of the stringer, 
and the mortises in the posts made accordingly. This 
method differs from the plain miter only in the addition 
of the scroll, in cutting the shoulder of the stringer to 
allow the risers to come where they would if a plain 
stringer were used, and in fitting a 
piece the same thickness as the 
scroll to preyent a hole between 
the face of the stringer and the 
back of the nosing (0). The risers 
and treads should of course extend 
to the outside of the scroll. The 
nosing, or the finish of the ends of 
the tread (b), is a separate piece, 
mitered into the front edge of the 
tread at c; the scotia (d) is mi- 
tered around the scroll at e. The

relation with the scotia (d) and 
the bottom of the scroll of the riser above, which should 
be designed with this in view. 
A single piece of molding consisting of the nosing and 
scotia is sometimes used upon cheap work, as the end fin- 
ish of the treads. In this case the ends of the treads are 
cut off flush with the face stringer, the front corner being 
mitered to receive the nosing of the end molding; the 
scotia under the front edge of the tread is then mitered 
in the usual way.

52. Circular stair risers. — A circular stair riser, illus- 
trated in Fig. 72, is frequently needed, and one method 
by which it may be made is illustrated by Fig. 21. After 
the saw kerfs have been made, the riser is bent around a 
form and glued permanently, as at a, b, Fig. 72, and held 
in place by hand screws, as at c, c until the glue sets. The 
tread is fastened by nailing into the solid block (a, 6). 
A circling riser is sometimes built as shown at 6, Fig. 72, 
the board being sawed, or planed thin enough to bend 
around the block (e, f). It is then glued there, being held

in place by a piece of sheet iron (g) which is fastened to 
blocks (h), and held in place by hand screws, as at ¢, c, 
until the glue is set. 
Another method is shown at c, Fig. 72, in which the 
riser is resawed, as shown at j, and pieces of paper, paste- 
board, or wood veneer (k), the thickness of the saw cuts 
placed in the cuts, and the joints filled with glue. The 
whole is then bent around a form, being held in place by 
some method similar to that illustrated at b. After the 
glue has set, the riser may be treated as straight. This
-P-A-G-E-123
  STAIR BUILDING 111 
method may be used to make circular work of any kind, 
soffits, bases, ete., it being an application of the method 
explained in Topic 18, B. A curved board, made of thin 
pieces glued around a form, is the strongest kind.

handrail, or stair rail, a few of which are shown in Fig. 73 ;

  only expense and individual taste can decide which is to 
be preferred, one of the principal considerations being the 
ease with which the rail fits the hand.

work and 6 indicating the best method for making a per- 
manent job. 
Sometimes it is necessary to splice a rail, though this 
should be done only as a last resort. If the long splice 
4  
-P-A-G-E-124
' 1 
} 112 INSIDE FINISHING 
method, shown at a, Fig. 75, is used, the point of the splice 
on the top of the rail should be pointed downstairs, and 
care should be taken to see that the rail is straight. If the 
rail bolt method is 
used, as illustrated 
at b, Fig. 75, the 
rail should be han- 
dled carefully until 
it is in place, as a 
sudden twist or wrench may break the joint. The method 
shown at a is generally used on the best work. A splice 
always should be made as near the end as possible, and 
not in the middle of the rail. 
The material from which handrails are made should be 
straight-grained and seasoned thoroughly, for if a rail 
springs after it is in place, the defect is difficult to remedy. 
A handrail that is so long that it is not stiff enough 
sideways is often strengthened in the middle by a cast-iron 
baluster of the same design as the others, to the bottom 
of which has been added an angle-iron or brace, so that its 
bottom end may be set rigidly ; the braces are covered by 
the finish. This baluster may be painted to match the 
rest of the stairs ; if well done, its presence i be detected 
only by an expert. 
54. Balusters. — Balusters are of many libido: suited 
to different styles of stairs, those with squares being used 
for the more expensive work. The balusters which are 
turned their entire length commonly are used upon stairs 
where economy is an object, though upon the best designed 
stairs a square, straight, or tapered baluster i is frequently 
used. 
Balusters are fastened to stairs by methods illustrated Lown : Dowel

in Fig. 76. At a is shown the method used in fastening 
square-ended balusters in the best open string work; they 
are mortised into the under side of the rail, as at 6 and 
section k, and dovetailed into the tread before the return 
or end nosing of the tread is put on. At c is shown the 
method by which the same style of baluster is fastened 
upon the cheaper grade of stairs; the top is cut at the

pitch of the rail and nailed, and a hole 
bored into the tread to receive the pin 
(f) which is turned on the bottom end 
of the square. At d is indicated the 
method by which round balusters usually 
are set upon the best class of work, and 
at e is shown a cheaper method, the 
y same as method c, applied to round 
balusters. In methods c, d, and e,

    114 INSIDE FINISHING 
the end finish of the treads (6, Fig. 71) should be in place 
before the hole is bored to receive the dowel (f). 
In setting the balusters of a closed string flight, the tops 
and bottoms are sometimes treated as at g, though there 
is another method by which the balusters are set, as at h, 
the pieces, 7, being fitted between the balusters at both the 
top and the bottom. 
The lengths of the balusters upon most open string work 
are 2’ 4” and 2’ 8’, as the top of the rail is supposed to be 
30” from the tread, measuring from the riser line, and the 
same distance from the gallery floor. 
55. Handrailing. — Laying out and making a wreath, 
or ease-off, or, as the process is called, “ handrailing,’”’ forms 
one of the most interesting pieces of small work which the 
carpenter or stair-builder is called upon todo. The laying 
out of a wreath should be done upon a piece of thick paper 
or pasteboard, to be used afterward as a pattern. 
Figure 77, A, shows the plan, or cylinder, or the top view 
of the outside of the wreath, which in this case is a quarter 
circle (d, g). 
The lines extending to the right from e, g, and the center 
line, f, indicate the straight run of the rail joining the 
wreath. Draw the pitch line K, M, of indefinite length, 
found by’a diagram of the tread and riser, as indicated by 
K, L, M, drawn at any convenient place, with KL par- 
allel to the straight rail. Drop perpendiculars from a, b, 
c,d; mark point N at the intersection of the pitch line 
KM and the perpendicular dropped from c. Through } 
N, draw OP parallel with KL; with N as the center, 
draw the ares 1,2; 3, 4; 5,6; from 2, 4,6, on OP, drop 
perpendiculars through the line QR (Fig. 77, B), which 
give the points of the ends of the top mold; transfer the
-P-A-G-E-127

-P-A-G-E-128
  | 
116 INSIDE FINISHING | 
distance a, e, g (Fig. 77, A) toa’, e’, g', of B. The ellipses 
of the top mold, d’g’ and b’e’, may now be drawn by any 
method; that suggested is perhaps as convenient as any 
other. Three points upon an elliptical are are ascertained 
by the following process: with a’ as center, draw two 
quarter circles with radii a’e’ and a’g’, respectively, and 
one each of radius a’b’ and a’d’; trisect the right angle 
d'a’g’, and from the intersection of these trisecting lines 
with the four arcs, erect horizontal or perpendicular lines 
as indicated. Curves drawn through the intersection of 
these last described lines to d’g’ and b’e’ will give the de- 
sired elliptical arcs. 
The mold should be made of a piece of thin wood or 
pasteboard, the ellipses being carefully cut to the lines. 
(Any plan of sweep may be drawn in place of the quarter 
circle a, d, g, of A, its pitch relation to the horizontal 
plane being found by the pitch diagram K, L, M.) 
The next step is to mark the plank from which the wreath 
is to be made. The necessary thickness of the plank may 
be found by drawing a section of the rail and a square 
which will inclose it, as g’e’, g’’e’’, Fig. 77,C; through g’ 
and e” draw the lines, gh and ij upon the same pitch as 
KM of A. The perpendicular distance between these, 
as at y, z, will give the thickness required. To find the 
length, continue e’e”” of C to y; draw the perpendicular 
yz; the distance e’’z, plus the length of the top mold, 
d'a’, of B, equals the length of the piece. The width of 
the piece equals the distance a’g’ of B. 
Lay the top mold on the plank from d’ to g’ of D, and 
mark around it; this will produce the upper pair of dotted 
lines d’g’ and b’e’. With a bevel set at the angle of the 
riser with the pitch line (KML, of A) mark the line g’z;
-P-A-G-E-129
STAIR BUILDING Tif 
turn the plank the opposite side up, and place the angle 
g’ of the mold at 2, so that b’ and d’ on the bottom will be 
in exactly the right relation with b’ and d’ on the top of the 
plank, and mark around the mold, which will give the 
dotted lines b’e’ and d’g’ on the bottom. 
Cut accurately both the inside and the outside of the 
wreath to the dotted lines b’e’, d’g’, thus obtained; do not 
cut the lines indicated by g’z, and e’e’, but allow the 
end at e’’, g’’, to extend its full length to y or beyond, 
as it will allow a square end to receive the straight rail. 
For the side mold, draw the indefinite horizontal line 
g 6, as shown in Fig. 77, A. Space the are dg into any 
number of equal spaces, say six; transfer these to g 6, a 
distance equal to the arc dg, or g 6, by transferring the 
spaces 1, 2,3, 4,5,6. Draw the indefinite -pitch line of 
the are gm from g, parallel to KM of. B. 
Drop vertical lines of indefinite length from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6 
of the are dg, and where they intersect the pitch line gm, 
mark the points 1’, 2’, 3’, 4’, 5’, 6’... Drop indefinite ver- 
tical lines from points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of g 6, and draw a 
horizontal line from 6’ of the line gm to the line which was 
dropped from 6, marking the intersection 6’. Draw a 
line from 1’ to 7 on gm, and mark the intersection 1”. 
(This line will not exist, as the resulting curve is prac- 
tically a tangent at this point.) Continue this process 
from: 2) to.2’-: irom 3! to73”) ete: 
Connect points 6”, 1’’, 2’, 3’’, ete., with a curved line, 
which will equal d’g’ of D. Lay out the thickness g’g’’ of 
the wreath parallel to line d’g’. After cutting paper or 
pasteboard to these lines, lay it upon the outside of the 
wreath as shown at line d’g’ of Fig. 77, D. This gives the 
outside top and bottom corners. Next lay out the squares
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 INSIDE FINISHING 
gg and e’e’’ upon each end, and proceed to cut to the 
lines thus obtained, keeping the top and bottom of the 
wreath square with the sides. If this is done carefully, 
the inside e’e’ and e’’e’”’ of the rectangular form will be 
sufficiently accurate for the purpose. 
After the rectangular form of the wreath is finished. 
mark the design of the rail upon each end, and with gouges 
and other convenient tools, work the rail to the shape of 
the one which it intersects. 
The above is for a quarter turn stair, but if a circular, 
or winding flight is being built, the pitch line should be 
taken from the rise and run of the stairs directly under the 
center of the rail, which is also the center line of the bal- 
usters. 
This may seem an intricate piece of work, but if it is 
once studied out carefully, and a wreath worked, it will 
be found to be a simple method for any one who can work 
accurately. In mills where there is a bandsaw, the piece 
from which the wreath is to be worked is held at the cor- 
rect pitch by a jig, and the four sides of the wreath sawed. 
Upon ordinary work it is rarely necessary to work out a 
hand rail to special dimensions, as all that is needed may 
usually be found in stock.

  CHAPTER VI 
Paintinae, HARDWARE 
56. Painting is one of the most important of the trades 
with which the carpenter comes in contact, and it is the 
intention of this chapter, not to teach the carpenter to 
do the work of a painter, but to outline some of the facts 
which he should know regarding the common use of 
paint. 
(A.) In mixing the priming coat, 100 Ib. of white lead 
to 7 gal. of raw linseed oil and } gal. of japan drier 
are the proportions commonly used upon the best work. 
After this first or priming coat has been put on, all nail 
holes, cracks, and other imperfections should be puttied; 
if this is done before the wood is painted, the putty is 
apt to fall out. For succeeding coats, 6 to 7 gal. of oil 
to 100 Ib. of white lead will give good satisfaction; the 
drier is usually omitted after the first or priming coat. 
Raw oil should be used upon outside work, as boiled oil 
does not stand so well, though a mixture of 3 parts of raw 
oil and 2 parts of boiled oil works more easily and dries 
faster, but is not so durable. However, it is used upon 
some of the best work. In many localities, boiled linseed 
oil is used entirely, but the work is not so permanent. 
(B.) Ready mixed paints are used by some, but many 
of them are inferior to white lead and oil, or to white 
121 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
122 INSIDE FINISHING 
lead, oxide of zinc, and oil, which are frequently specified 
upon the best work. 
In using mixed paints, it is the safest plan to shun all 
makes which have not stood the test of time. Some ready 
mixed paints are hardly worth putting on; others will 
wear as well as the best white lead paint ; in fact, the best 
brands of mixed paints are made of white lead, zinc, and 
oil, purchased and mixed in large quantities, under the 
most favorable conditions, and are generally superior to 
the white lead and oil mixed by the painter, both in 
spreading and wearing qualities. The price is about 
the same. 
It is poor economy to purchase cheap paint, as paint 
costing 50 per cent more will often cover from 75 per cent 
to 100 per cent more surface than the cheaper kind, and 
give much better service under the same iihdlHons. 
(C.) Knots in pine and other pitchy woods should be 
covered with a heavy coat of brown shellac, to prevent the 
pitch from frying out. 
(D.) Metal work should be covered with black varnish 
or asphaltum. Before being painted with oil paint, very 
rusty iron should be scraped and sandpapered to the clean 
iron. Boiled oil should be used, as raw oil requires so 
much time to dry that it is apt to be washed off by rain, 
or to catch the dust. | 
Upon metal roofs, iron oxide and boiled oil are about as 
satisfactory as anything which can be used, though there 
are many roofing paints of more or less efficiency made 
by different manufacturers. 
A good roofing paint should be quick drying, of more 
body than is ordinarily used, should adhere closely to the 
roof without scaling, and should not blister in the sun. |
-P-A-G-E-135
  PAINTING, HARDWARE 123 
(E.) Do not paint a shingled roof, as the paint covers 
only the exposed wood, and water which runs under the 
shingles of the course above will not dry out readily, thus 
causing decay and shortening the life of the roof. Shin- 
gles may be dipped in a creosote stain for about 9” or 10” 
from their butts before they are laid; this will act as 
a preservative to the shingles and increase their service- 
ableness. 
(F.) Wood adjoining masonry should have a good coat 
of paint; this is not generally done except upon the best 
class of work. 
(G.) Wet or green wood never should be painted, as 
the moisture in the wood is thereby confined and the re- 
sult will be that either the paint will peel off or the wood 
decay, or both. 
(H.) Flat color should be used upon inside work ; this 
is made by mixing white lead with turpentine and a little 
varnish, together with the pigment necessary to give the 
desired color. If oil is used, the paint will turn yellow 
after a few months. 
Instead of using a pure white paint, a little black should 
be mixed with it, or otherwise the white paint will be too 
glaring; this also prevents to a great extent the dingy 
appearance which a pure white has after the newness has 
worn off. Flat color is less transparent than oil color, 
and will, therefore, cover better, but it is not suitable for 
outside work. 
(I.) It is often necessary to remove old paint; this may 
be done by burning with a gasoline torch, a method to be 
used only by a man of skill and judgment, as a fire is easily 
started while burning around places where the joints have 
opened and the wood is very dry. Old paint may be
-P-A-G-E-136
124 INSIDE FINISHING 
removed quite well by using a preparation made of 2 oz. 
of soft soap and 4 oz. of potash mixed in boiling water, to 
which is added } lb. of lime. Apply hot and leave it 
for 24 hours; wash it off with hot water. 
Paint removers are made by paint manufacturers and 
sold at such prices that it is usually better to use them 
than to use any homemade mixture. They are generally 
quicker and surer in their action; some are apt to discolor 
the wood, but that is not an important matter, unless the 
work is to be finished in the natural wood. 
(J.) In finishing woods with an open grain, as ash, 
oak, etc., it is necessary that the grain should be filled. 
Years ago this was done by applying several coats of 
shellac and rubbing each coat down to a surface with 
#00 sandpaper, or with pumice stone, but that method 
is very slow. Of late years the use of a paste filler has 
done away with the necessity of so much work. 
There are several good makes of wood filler upon the 
market which are generally of the color of light wood; 
the addition of dry color will make it of almost any de- 
sired shade. If manufactured filler is not easily obtained, 
a fairly satisfactory substitute may be made by mixing 
cornstarch or whiting with turpentine or naphtha to form 
a thick paste, and by adding a little oil and japan to bind 
it together. Any desired dry color may be added after 
the paste has been thinned to about the consistency of 
cream by the addition of turpentine, or naphtha which is 
used by many for reasons of economy. 
In applying the filler, it is not necessary to lay it 
smoothly, for when its surface has dried so that it resists 
slightly when rubbed with the finger, it should be cleaned 
off with excelsior or shavings by rubbing across the grain 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  PAINTING, HARDWARE 125 
wherever possible and by digging it out of the corners 
with a properly shaped stick and finishing with a soft 
cloth. Care should be used that the filler is not too dry 
or it will not rub off properly ; if it is too moist, there 
will be too little left in the cells of the wood to fill the 
grain after the moisture has evaporated. 
This filling may be applied to floors, standing finish, 
furniture, etc., of any open-grained wood after the filling 
has been brought to the proper shade or tint by the use of 
dry color. 
(K.) For finishing close-grained woods, such as cherry, 
maple, birch, ete., the grain should be filled to prevent 
the finish from soaking in. This filling may consist of a 
coat of shellac, rubbed down, but there are substitutes in 
the market which are efficient and much cheaper and, - 
for everything but the finest work, are perfectly satis- 
factory. These surface dressings usually are not in- 
tended for finish coats, as they will not stand rubbing, but 
simply for a surface upon which finishing coats of shellac 
or varnish are to be applied. 
(L.) In finishing floors the nails should be set below 
the surface, and the cracks and imperfections thoroughly 
puttied ; if finished in the natural wood, the pores and cells 
should be filled as above described, and the finish applied 
upon the surface thus prepared. 
There are many good floor finishes upon the market, 
some of which are for finishing in the natural or stained 
wood, and others for painting the floors. 
A good floor paint or finish should be tough, elastic, 
and able to resist the wear to which a floor is subjected. 
(M.) Do not thin shellac with turpentine; alcohol or 
wood alcohol should be used for that purpose. Shellac
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 INSIDE FINISHING 
is a gum dissolved in alcohol and is used to give a 
fine permanent finish to woodwork. Orange or brown 
shellac should be used for dark woods, and white or refined 
shellac for all light colored woods, or where it is desired 
that the finish shall make as little change in the color of 
the wood as possible. 
Considerable skill is needed in spreading it smoothly. 
It should be laid with moderately thick coats and rubbed 
down to a surface with #00 sandpaper, or pulverized pum- 
ice stone, after each coat. The last coat should be rubbed 
down in oil, and polished with a soft cloth. Though quite 
expensive, shellac makes a very satisfactory finish for a 
nice floor, if not exposed to water. 
(N.) Do not thin varnish with alcohol, use turpentine. 
Varnishing always should be done in a room, the tempera- 
ture of which is not less than 70 degrees; the room should 
be free from dust and drafts, and these conditions should 
be maintained until the varnish has set. 
(O.) Paint and varnish brushes should be cleaned in 
benzine or turpentine; shellac brushes in wood alcohol ; 
and if they are to be laid away they should be washed in 
warm soapy water, and rinsed in clean water. If paint 
brushes are to be used again soon, they may be hung in a 
vessel partly filled with water, so that the bristles do not 
touch the bottom. Shellac or varnish brushes may be 
suspended in a covered shellac or varnish pot. 
57. Hardware. — The grade of hardware purchased for a 
house is generally in keeping with the kind of house being 
built, and is a fair index of the quality of the house through- 
out. However, expensive trimmings do not always in- 
dicate the true value of a house, because unscrupulous 
carpenters use them often with the purpose of deceiving.
-P-A-G-E-139
  PAINTING, HARDWARE 127 
(A.) Wire nails have but few points in their favor in 
comparison with cut nails; however, they drive more 
easily, are not so apt to split the wood, and as there are 
more.in a pound, the original cost is less. 
For the reason that wire nails do not resist the effects 
of moisture so well as do cut nails, the latter should be 
used for outside finish, though upon ordinary work this 
is not considered important, as the heads of the nails are 
painted, and are not exposed to the moisture so much as 
the nails with which shingles are fastened. If the best 
results are desired in shingling a house, cut nails should 
be used, especially in places near the salt water, where 
wire nails will sometimes allow the shingles to blow off 
a roof within three years from the time the roof was 
laid. 
(B.) The trimmings, or the door knobs, window fasts, 
and other exposed hardware, should not be of plated ware, 
as the plating soon comes off. Brass or bronze trimmings 
are the best; bronzed iron trimmings are used upon com- 
mon work where economy, rather than durability, is the 
object. 
(C.) For locks, nothing is more secure than the time- 
honored bolt; our modern locks are simply applications. 
of it, improved to meet modern demands. A lock which 
fastens automatically is called a spring lock, and one which 
has to be fastened and unfastened is known as a dead lock. 
(D.) In putting on Yale or similar locks, the workman 
should follow the directions which usually accompany each 
lock. It is a good plan to set them back from the edge 
of the door a little, say };” or less, to allow the door to be 
jointed at some future time if necessary. 
(E.) Loose-pin and loose-joint butts or hinges are shown
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 INSIDE FINISHING 
in Fig. 33. The advantage of the former is that the 
“hand ” of the door need not be considered, as the hinge 
may be used upon either edge; while the loose-joint butt

CHAPTER VII 
EstIMaTING 
58. Plans. — If work of importance is being considered, 
a contractor should always insist upon having a complete 
set of plans, a carefully prepared set of specifications, and 
a written contract, all so drawn as to insure against the 
possibility of a misunderstanding. 
59. Location. — The contractor should be familiar with 
the location of the house and be thoroughly posted con- 
cerning the facilities for transportation and for obtaining _ 
material and help. He should know how far from the 
excavation the earth has to be carried and should have 
reliable information about the nature of the subsoil and 
the possibility of ledges and springs which might cause 
difficulty in making a dry cellar. 
60. Method.— In writing the matter for this chapter, 
the plans of a house and its accompanying stock list and 
estimate have been purposely omitted, as it will be far 
better that the students or teacher should select a small 
accessible building, make a set of plans of it from actual 
measurements, and use these as the basis from which the 
estimates and the stock lists of the class should be made. 
In this case, the building can be used for the purpose of 
study and demonstration, thus giving the student the 
benefit of comparing his work with actual results. 
130
-P-A-G-E-143
ESTIMATING 131 
By the approximation method! of estimating, the esti- 
mator works upon the basis that the use of a certain 
quantity of a certain sized material will accomplish a 
known result ; for instance, instead of counting the exact 
number of studs necessary to stud the wall of one side of 
the house, then of another, he measures the entire distance 
to be covered by all of the walls and partitions, and al- 
lows one stud to each foot, with an additional one for 
each angle and opening. Instead of figuring that a man 
can set a certain number of studs in a given time, the 
cost is found by figuring that it will cost a certain amount 
to set a thousand feet (board measure) of studs. 
The estimate based upon the approximation method 
should be first worked out, followed by the stock bill from 
which the actual work would be done if the building was 
to be built. If the building which is being studied was 
built by contract, and copies of the contract and of the 
original stock bill could be secured, they would be of great 
value in criticizing the results of the work of the class. 
A contracting carpenter may follow the safe method of 
getting estimates upon the different parts of the building 
which must be done by other workmen, then adding his 
own estimate; to this total are added the amounts for inci- 
dentals and profit, the sum of which is his bid for the con- 
tract. If he is awarded the contract, he treats the bid 
from each sub-contractor as a maximum, and tries to find 
aman who will do the work for a lower price. This method 
usually results in fewer contracts, but there is less risk 
1The term ‘“‘ Approximation Method,” as used in this book, has no 
relation to the ‘‘ Preliminary Approximation Method,”’ which is based 
upon the cubical contents of a building and is principally used by archi- 
tects in arriving at the approximate cost of a contemplated building.
-P-A-G-E-144
    132 INSIDE FINISHING 
than if the contractor depended upon his own figures 
entirely. It is impracticable to give here prices of labor 
and material, as they vary so that no list can be devised 
which will suit all localities and times; therefore we shall, 
in most cases, discuss only the time necessary for doing 
the work under average conditions, and the methods of 
estimating the materials, leaving the student to obtain the 
local prices.. All estimates are based upon a day’s labor 
of nine hours. 
The contractor should not try to save too much time 
in estimating, but should aim at accuracy and safety, since 
this is as important as it is that the work is done well and 
economically. 
Nore. — In all estimates given, the student should not forget that 
they are based upon the actual cost, and that, for the estimate to be 
submitted, the profit is to be added to the total cost. 
Whether he gets the job or not, the young contractor 
should keep a systematic and permanent record of all his 
estimates, the cost of material and labor, and any infor- 
mation he may think valuable ; if he does the work himself, 
he should check his estimates when the actual results are 
known. This record will be found of great value in making 
succeeding estimates. A pocket size loose-leaf binder is 
a great convenience for the valuable data which is continu- 
ally presenting itself. 
In order to estimate successfully, there should be a 
schedule containing the items to be estimated. These 
should be considered one at a time to ascertain the neces- 
sary dimensions and quantities, after which similar items 
of the same price should be gathered together and the.cost 
of the total quantity estimated as oneitem. The totals of 
these different items should be summarized, and their total
-P-A-G-E-145
  ESTIMATING 133 
ascertained; to this should be added from 5 per cent to 25 — 
per cent for incidentals, use of equipment, etc., and the same 
percentages should govern the amount to be added for 
profit. The grand total should be the amount of the bid. 
61. Excavations. — Under the head of excavations, 
unless otherwise specified, should be included those for 
the cellar, piers under the partitions, porches, cisterns, 
cesspools, vaults, and trenches for the water and sanitary 
system of the house. 
The excavated earth should be carried far enough away 
so that it will not interfere with the workmen, but if it is 
to be used for filling and grading around the house, work 
which is usually in the contract for the excavation, it 
should be carried as little distance as possible. 
For a day’s work, two men should excavate from 10 to 
12 cubic yards of sand, gravel, or moderately soft clay, 
and carry it 60 feet in a wheelbarrow. Two men and 
the driver, with a horse and cart, should pick, throw out, 
and carry the same distance from 16 to 20 cubic yards of 
the same sort. 
Filling in and grading around the house usually costs 
about a fourth as much as the excavating. 
62. Stonework.— Masonry will be discussed under 
two heads, stonework and brickwork. The work of build- 
ing the foundations, piers, chimneys, etc., is usually a sub- 
contract, and as such, the carpenter may have one or more 
masons figure upon the work and make their estimates 
the basis of his own, adding enough to reimburse himself 
for building the scaffolds, arch centers, and other work 
which the mason may require of him. 
The items to be considered in estimating the mason- 
work of a building are as follows:—
-P-A-G-E-146
184 INSIDE FINISHING 
Walls Settings 
Area. Fireplaces. 
Cesspools. Furnaces. 
Cisterns. Hearths. 
Foundation. Range. 
Outside. 
Partition. Miscellaneous 
Arches. 
Material Chimneys. 
Broken stone. Cut stone. 
Cement. Footings. 
Gravel. Labor. 
Lime. Piers. 
Sand. Stone cutting. 
Tiling for drains. 
The unit of measurement for stonework varies in differ- 
ent localities, cubic yard, perch, and ebrd being used. The 
following table will be found useful in estimating quantities. 
27 cu. ft. = Leu. yd. 
128 cu. ft. = 1 cord of uncut stone. 
100 cu. ft. = 1 cord of stone laid in the wall. 
242 cu. ft. = 1 perch. 
1 load of sand 25 bushels. 
1 bbl. lime or cement. = 23 bushels. ll 
In estimating the stone in a wall, it is customary to 
measure around the outside, thus reckoning the corners 
twice and allowing for the additional work and waste neces- 
sary to build them. This distance should be multiplied 
by the height and by the thickness of the wall in feet, the 
result being the quantity in cubic feet.
-P-A-G-E-147
  ESTIMATING 135 
It is always wise for the contractor, before he sublets 
the foundation walls, to have an understanding with the 
mason, as usually local custom governs the measurements 
of openings. In laying a rubble wall, it is the common 
practice to measure all single openings as solid wall, as 
the extra work will make the cost about even. Of an 
opening larger than 16 sq. ft. a half usually is counted. 
If the estimate is for stone in the wall, the price should 
be about a fourth greater, to allow for waste and extra 
work around openings. 
One man and a helper should lay about 23 cu. yd. of 
rubble stone in a day, using 1 bu. of lime and 3} bu. of 
sand to each cubic yard of stone. If the stone is laid 
in Portland cement, it will require $ bbl. of cement and 
4 bu. of sand. 
One man and a helper should lay 13 cu. yd. of ashlar 
per day, or about 40 sq. ft. of 12” wall. The mortar 
with which it is laid will cost from 25% to 30% per cu. yd. 
of stone. 
A stonecutter in a day should cut about 25 or 30 sq. ft. 
of bluestone or granite, rock-faced, pitched, random ash- 
lar, with the beds straightened 3’’ back from the face ; 
of coursed ashlar, the amount would be about a third less. 
As the ashlars and rubble are the kinds of work com- 
monly used, we will not discuss the more expensive and 
the less used tooled and draft methods of finishing stone. 
63. Brickwork. — Under the head of bricklaying should 
be considered the items mentioned in connection with the 
preceding topic. 
It is usual to measure a brick wall solid; however, in 
buildings where there are many openings, as in those of the 
slow burning or mill construction, in which about half of
-P-A-G-E-148
136 INSIDE FINISHING 
the wall is occupied by windows, it is generally safe to de- 
duct for the openings about 25 per cent of the wall area. 
If estimated as above, it is not the custom to make any 
allowance for pilasters, arches, or any simple detail in the 
wall; if an opening occupies over 100 sq. ft., it is generally 
entirely deducted. 
A square foot of brick wall contains 73 bricks, if the ° 
wall is two bricks thick it contains 15, and if the wall is 
13” or three bricks thick it will contain 22} bricks to the 
square foot of wall surface. This is called a cubic foot of 
brick if estimated in the wall; if a large mass of brick 
masonry is being estimated, it is the usual custom to cal- 
culate that one cubic yard of brickwork will contain 575 
bricks. 
There is a loss by breakage and waste of 5 per cent, 
which should be added to the quantity estimated as being 
actually necessary in the building. 
To lay 1000 bricks, it will take 3 bu. of lime and 12 bu. 
‘of sand; for pressed brick, it will need about 4 of the above 
quantities, as the joints should be only 4’’, while upon 
ordinary acceptable work they are 335” or 3”. 
Under average conditions, a man should lay 1000 bricks 
a day, but upon some kinds of intricate work this amount 
may be reduced to 200 or less ; if face brick are being laid, 
a man will lay only about a third as many as of the com- 
mon brick. 
64. Carpentry. — Under the head of carpentry we will 
discuss only the framing of a building, and its preparation 
for the outside finish, roofing, and lathing. 
Some contractors make out a bill of the material as 
they estimate it, giving the dimensions for each piece as 
for the final list. This method has a high degree of ac-
-P-A-G-E-149
  ESTIMATING 137 
curacy to recommend it, but as a piece of dimension tim- 
ber must generally be cut from lengths of multiples of two 
feet, it is plain that the time spent in making such an ac- 
curate list is often wasted, as it is a very low estimator 
who is awarded more than one in five jobs on which he 
figures and for which there is much competition. The 
approximation method herein described is much quicker 
and the results will vary but little. (See Topic 60.) 
For the purpose of subsequent checking and reference, 
a record should be kept of the quantities and dimensions 
included in the estimate. 
The items which should be considered in connection 
with the framing of a building are as follows: — 
Plan Members 
Floor joists. 
Girders. 
Headers. 
Plates. 
Sills. 
Tail beams.

Shingles. 
Valley rafters. 
Miscellaneous 
- Bridging. 
Furring and strapping. 
Labor. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 INSIDE FINISHING 
In estimating the quantities in the frame of a building, 
it is usual to select all of the rough lumber costing about 
the same, add the different kinds together, and estimate 
the aggregate at an average price. 
Studs, if set 16’ to centers, are counted one to each foot 
in the width of the walls and the partitions, and one for 
each opening and angle. This will give enough for gable 
studs, scaffoldings, and for various other purposes not in- 
cluded in any estimate. A more exact method is to cal- 
culate the width of the partitions and walls, to subtract 
a third of that amount in feet from the total, and to add 
one for each angle and two for each opening. The former 
method is the one in common use among builders. 
In setting studding upon ordinary work, about 20 lb. 
of nails and spikes are used for each 1000 ft. Two men 
should cut and set from 600 to 800 ft. of 2” x 4” or 
2” x 6” studding per day. 
Nore.— In all estimates for labor, handling lumber and erecting 
seaffolding are included. 
Unless otherwise specified, the word ‘feet ’’ used in connection with 
quantities of lumber means square feet or board measure. 
As the corner posts are included with the studs, if the 
estimates are made as described above, do not estimate 
them again, but instead order them the full height of the 
corner. 
Calculate the number of floor joists, common rafters, 
and tie beams needed, and add one for the starter. To 
find the number of jack rafters, those upon one side of each 
corner should be counted, and their length estimated as 
a full length common rafter, which will practically equal 
the actual measurement. 
For setting rafters and floor joists, about 30 lb. of
-P-A-G-E-151
  ESTIMATING 139 
spikes and nails per 1000 ft. will generally be used. Two 
men will cut and place about 500 ft. of rafters in a day, 
and, if the building is not too irregular, 1000 ft. to 1300 ft. 
of floor joists. 
If sheathing is to be laid horizontally, estimate the 
actual area, making no allowance for openings or waste. 
If it is laid diagonally, allow 10 per cent for waste besides 
the openings. In estimating the roofing boards or sheet- 
ing, allow 25 per cent for waste if the sheeting is laid 
with close joints, but if there is a space of 2 inches between 
the boards, and they are not more than 6” or 7” wide, an 
estimate of a fourth less than the actual area will be safe. 
The above two items will require about 25 lb. of nails per 
1000 ft. 
For a day’s work, two men should lay 1000 ft. of sheath- 
ing if laid horizontally, or 800 ft. if laid diagonally ; if 
matched, the amount will be 20 per cent to 25 per cent 
less. Two men should lay from 500 ft. to 1000 ft. of roof 
sheeting per day, varying according to the number of 
hips and valleys in the roof. It generally costs about $8 
per M to handle and put sheeting in place. 
A man should cut and nail six to eight sets of bridging 
per hour. 
No prices for_bolts, anchors, plates, and other iron work 
can be given which will be of any value, as they are gov- 
erned by the state of the market, so the builder should 
always have figures submitted, if any considerable amount 
is to be used. 
Circular towers, bay windows, etc., are usually estimated 
at twice the cost of straight work. Under floors may be 
laid at the rate of from 10 to 12 squares per day. 
Many builders lump the above quantites, and estimate
-P-A-G-E-152
140 INSIDE FINISHING 
the cost of the labor in framing to equal half of the cost of 
the material. Others estimate the framing at $10 per M, 
which is in most places a@ fair price. | 
65. Roofing. — A carpenter will lay from 1500 to 2000 
shingles per day, and use from 7} to 10 lb. of 4d nails, 
but there are professional shinglers who can lay as many 
as 5000. An all-round carpenter will rarely average more 
than the above, and not that if the roof is very badly 
cut up. Generally it will cost about $1.50 per M to lay 
shingles. 
A box of tin for roofing will cover about 180 sq. ft. and 
require about 10 lb. of solder, 2 lb. of tinned roofing-nails, 
and about 15 hours’ work to prepare the tin for the roof 
andtoputiton. To this is to be added the cost of painting 
the under side of the tin before laying. In dry climates 
this is not often done. Painting the roof after it is laid 
is often a part of the painter’s contract, though the first 
painting is considered part of the original cost of the roof. 
Though the price of a tin roof usually is estimated at 
from $8 to $10 per square, the above data will allow the 
roof to be estimated according to local conditions. 
A slate roof should be estimated by one who makes that 
work a business, but generally $9 per square is a safe 
estimate, though the price varies between $7 and $12, 
according to the nature of the roof, the quality of the ma- 
terial, and the work required. 
66. Joinery. — Under the head of joinery we shall treat 
the building after the carpenter has finished the framing, 
covering, and roofing, and discuss the topics of inside and 
outside finishing. 
The items to be considered under the above head are 
as follows : —
-P-A-G-E-153
  ESTIMATING 141 
Outside Finish Stairs 
Base or water table. Balusters. 
Corner boards. Handrail. 
Cornice. Newel posts. 
Moldings. Rail bolts. 
Siding. Risers. 
- Section posts. 
: Windows Skirting boards. 
Blinds. Stringers or carriages. 
Frames, Treads. 
Glazing. 
Sach. Veranda 
Balusters. 
Doors Brackets. 
Doors. Capitals. 
Frames. Floor. 
Inside Finish Posts. 
Architraves. Rail. 
Baseboard. Miscellaneous 
Corner blocks. Grounds. 
Flooring. Labor. 
Moldings. Sheathing paper. 
Plinths. Shelving. 
Wainscoting. Shingles. 
Window frames may be bought at prices which range 
between $1 and as high as a specially designed and very 
elaborate frame may cost; but a good frame, and such as 
is in common use, may be bought for from $1.25 to $1.75. 
Usually they arrive from the factory in shooks, or knocked 
down, so about 14 hours should be allowed for nailing up 
and setting each frame. In this, as in all work, add 5 per 
cent for each story in height for the cost of handling.
-P-A-G-E-154
  142 INSIDE FINISHING 
Doorframes cost the price of the stock which is usually 
bought all rabbeted ; smoothing, nailing up, squaring, and 
setting an inside frame will usually require about 14 or 2 
hours. A common outside frame, with its casing and 
threshold, will require about another hour. 
Two good men should build their scaffolds and put in 
place from 160 to 180 ft. of cornice per day, unless there 
are a great many angles. This includes all the work from 
the siding to the upper edge of the gutter bed, or to the 
place where the roof proper begins, and will require about 
43 |b. of nails.for 100 ft. 
Another method is to figure the width of the cornice 
in inches, and allow 1 per inch in width to each foot in 
length in the length of the cornice; this will pay for all 
the material and labor of scaffolding. 
In estimating corner boards and siding, the actual wall 
area is taken, and no allowance made for single openings, 
thus balancing the waste upon ordinary houses. To this 
should be added a fourth for the lap of 6” siding. If some 
form of matched siding is used, a third of the area should 
be added, as 4” siding will usually cover about 3?” upon 
the wall, and narrow boards cut to waste more than wide 
ones. When the above method is used, there is no need of 
estimating the corner boards separately. 
Two men should lay from 500 ft. to 700 ft. of siding, 
and use from 9 to 12 lb. of nails for a day’s work. 
Many contractors consider the cost of the labor of 
putting on outside finish as half of the cost of the 
material. 
In estimating the material for flooring, add a fourth 
to the area for waste, not nieasuring stairs or other large 
openings. A room which is badly cut up by angles and
-P-A-G-E-155
  ESTIMATING 143 
curves generally should be estimated to its extreme dimen- 
sions, to recompense for the extra labor of cutting. 
If a square-edged floor is to be laid, a fifth is sufficient. © 
allowance for waste. 
From 2 to 3 lb. of nails per square are necessary to lay 
matched flooring. 
A man should lay from 3 to 4 squares per day of matched 
softwood flooring of good material, blind nailed; if less 
than 4” wide, he should lay from 2 to 3 squares per day. 
Of hardwood flooring, a man will lay from a fourth to” 
a third less than the above quantities, and of a square- 
edged floor a man should lay from 6 to 8 squares per day. 
Ceiling wainscoting, finished with cap and scotia, can 
be nailed and finished at the rate of from 2 to 2} squares 
per day upon ordinary straight work, using 2 lb. of 6d 
finish nails per square. 
Panel work or dado may be set up (not made) and fin- 
ished at the rate of about 14 squares per day, with an 
average amount of detail in the base and cap. No price 
can be given for the cost of paneled dado, as it can be made 
for almost any amount; the builder should obtain a figure 
from a factory before submitting an estimate. 
It is usually safe to estimate a third more for the labor 
upon hardwood than upon softwood work. 
A man should smooth, fit, and nail in place from 50 
to 60 linear feet of three-member base per day, including 
mitering the outside and coping the inside angles, unless 
there are a great many. 
It is a fair day’s work to fit, hang, and mortise lock five 
inside doors; if rim locks are used instead, seven doors 
require about the same amount of work to fit the lock so 
that the door does not rattle. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 INSIDE FINISHING 
It is about one hour’s work to case around a door or 
window frame with a corner block and plinth casing; a 
mitered finish will require usually about one half more 
time. It is a common method to lump the mill work of a 
house and estimate the cost of the labor of putting it in 
place to equal one third or one half of its cost, according 
to the work required. 
To fit, hang, trim, and put the stops on five windows, 
will constitute a fair day’s work. Many contractors figure 
the windows as finished complete, with blinds and paint- 
ing, at $10 per opening, which is safe for an ordinary 
house. 
Doors may be estimated by figuring the cost of the 
material and adding 1} day’s work for an inside door, 
and 1} day’s work for an outside door, if the latter is 
set with a hardwood sill and a thorough job is to be 
done. An inside door will require a good day’s work to 
complete it, from making the frame to cutting down the 
threshold. 
In the pantry, and other places which require shelv- 
ing, a man should put in place from 60 to 75 ft. per 
day. 
The cost of stairs varies greatly with the design, but it 
is usually safe to estimate that it will require one day’s 
work to two and a half risers in height, if they are not 
too intricate in their design. 
Box stairs usually require about one day’s work to six 
risers in height. 
A man should lay in place between 300 and 400 linear 
feet of grounds per day, straightening them up in good 
shape. 
Mantels and other special woodwork are furnished some-
-P-A-G-E-157
  ESTIMATING 145 
times by the carpenter. The owner often selects them 
himself, but the contractor pays for them, the owner 
paying any extra cost above the price allowed in the con- 
tract, which may be necessary to secure a special design 
to which he takes a fancy. 
67. Plastering. — The material and labor required for 
100 sq. yd. of three-coat work are as follows : — 
1500 laths. 18 hours’ work for two plas- 
10 lb. 3d fine nails. terers and one helper. 
7 hours’ workin making up _—_36 bu. sand. 
mortar. 8 lb. or 1 bu. of hair. 
1 day’s labor lathing. 4 bu. plaster of Paris. 
12 bu. lime. 
The custom of measuring for plastering varies, though 
the square yard is generally the unit. It is quite usual 
not to deduct single openings, and to measure only half 
of the double openings, treating the rest as solid wall. 
All strips less than 12” should be measured as 12’; for 
small closets add a half to the actual measurements. A 
man will lay about 1500 laths a day. Two plasterers and 
one helper will, upon ordinary work, build their stagings 
and do about 50 yd. per day of three-coat work. Roughly 
speaking, the plastering costs about 10 per cent of the 
entire cost of the house. Lathing and plastering vary in 
price according to locality from 20f to 25¢ for two-coat 
work, to 25% to 30% per square yard for three-coat 
work. In certain sections of the country, two-coat work 
is used exclusively. 
68. Hardware. — The following is a list of the articles 
of hardware needed upon a house : —  
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 INSIDE FINISHING: 
Doors Windows 
Bolts. Blind trimmings. 
Butts. Sash cord. 
Cupboard catches. Sash fasts. 
Hinges. Sash lifts. 
Mortise locks. Sash weights. 
Rim locks. Special glass.

Transom locks. 
Miscellaneous 
Anchors. ' Ornamental iron work. 
Bolts. Plates. 
Drawer pulls. Rail bolts. 
Hooks and eyes. Rods. 
Nails, spikes, screws, etc. | Washers. 
Upon ordinary work, the hardware will cost from 3 per 
cent to 5 per cent of the cost of the house, and 20 per cent 
of their cost will pay for putting on the trimmings. 
69. Painting. — The following figures are about the 
average for the whole country, but the builder should be 
sure that they are safe for his locality, before he uses them 
as the basis of an estimate. 
One gallon of paint will cover 200 sq. ft. of new wood, 
two coats, and 300 sq. ft. of metal roof, one coat. 
It is usually safe to estimate that the labor of putting 
on paint will cost about 14 times the cost of the paint upon 
plain work; and upon difficult work, or work in two or more 
colors, twice the cost of the paint should be allowed for the 
labor. The labor for varnished work should be estimated 
as costing about 1} times the material. 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
ESTIMATING 147 
Interior work will cost about 20¢ per sq. yd. for two- 
coat, and 25% for three-coat work. A plastered wall sized 
and covered with three coats of paint will cost about 
20f per sq. yd.; stippled, about 30%. Hardwood finishing 
will cost about 40? per sq. yd. for filling and two coats of 
varnish. 
Painting generally will cost from 12 to 16 per cent of the 
cost of the house, but upon rough buildings and cheap work 
it is sometimes reduced to 6 or 8 per cent. 
It costs 25% per double roll to hang common wall paper. 
In measuring for areas of painting, make no allowance 
for openings, as the difference in the work, the under edges 
of the siding, curves of moldings, etc., will make the meas- 
urement just. 
A painter can legally claim the privilege of measuring 
the height of a building by a tape measure, carefully fit- 
ting it into all the angles and curves of the siding, water- 
table, and moldings of the cornice, as all of these surfaces 
have to be covered with paint. 
yo. Heating and plumbing. — We will not go into the 
detail of heating and plumbing, as in every case there are 
so many different methods of accomplishing results that 
any data which could be furnished here would be of little 
value. So we will simply state that a hot-air system will 
cost from 5 per cent to 8 per cent of the cost of the house, 
steam heat from 6 per cent to 10 per cent, hot water from 
8 per cent to 12 per cent, plumbing about the same, and 
if the house is to be piped for gas, from 2 per cent to 4 per 
cent will pay for the piping without the fixtures. 
71. Summarizing the estimates. — After the quantities 
and dimensions of the different sizes, kinds, and grades of 
material have been calculated and their totals ascertained,  
-P-A-G-E-160
    148 INSIDE FINISHING 
the information should be filed away. This unpriced list 
should be sufficiently accurate, in regard to the quantities 
and dimensions, to be used in ordering much of the bill 
stuff, and of the cheaper lumber and other materials which 
can be ordered by quantity, and be cut afterward. If the 
figuring has been too close, there may not be enough of 
the rough material for use as temporary bracing, scaffold- 
ing, ete. 
The totals of the above quantities and sizes should be 
arranged by the methods indicated in the following out- 
line, which mentions only enough of the items to suggest 
the method to be followed ; the prices should be carried 
out, and added to ascertain the total cost of the material. 
To this should be added from 5 per cent to 25 per cent 
each for incidentals and profit. This should be enough, in 
the judgment of the contractor, to provide a safe margin 
for all reasonable contingencies, and at the same time to 
allow him a fair chance of being awarded the contract.

72. Stock bill. — After the estimating has been finished, 
the student should make out the stock list, which should 
include in detail the quantities and sizes of every item to 
be used in the construction of the building, which is not 
included with sufficient accuracy in the approximation list. 
-In making this bill, the student should follow closely 
the instructions and lists of items as included in Topics 61 
to 69. Each item should be carefully considered and 
checked to insure that none are missed or figured twice. 
Each item to be listed should be specified and estimated 
generally to the nearest stock dimensions, when framing

material and other supplies, which will have to be cut 
to exact dimensions upon the work, are being considered. 
The following bill should be ample to suggest the method 
generally followed in making out the stock list for a build- 
ing; it includes only items which the carpenter uses, since 
the masonwork, painting, etc., are usually sublet, the sub- 
contractors making out their own stock lists. The list 
is only suggestive, and is not to be followed in selecting 
items, as it is intentionally incomplete, it being assumed 
that the student will work in accord with the suggestions 
previously made.

Never use ditto marks (‘‘) to repeat figures, as they 
very often cause errors. Stock bills should always be 
made out in duplicate, by means of carbon paper, one copy 
to go to the dealer, and one to be retained by the builder, 
as one may be lost, and mistakes may be checked. 
73. The contractor.— Whenever unsuccessful, the 
young contractor should endeavor to discover, if possible, 
in what way his successful competitor was able to do 
the work more cheaply than he could. Did the success- 
ful competitor’s figures differ in regard to material or 
labor? Was the material used the same that he would 
have furnished? If the builder who is doing the work is  
-P-A-G-E-164
    152 INSIDE FINISHING 
a successful man, a young contractor may learn much in 
regard to the faults of his own estimate. 
A feeling of antagonism exists amiong a certain class of 
builders toward an architect, and many do not hesitate 
to cause him all the annoyance possible. This is a very 
shortsighted policy, as an architect’s advice to his client 
is usually of great weight, and the contract is not always 
awarded to the lowest bidder. If an architect has had 
unsatisfactory dealings with a builder, he will, like most 
people, avoid him as much as possible in the future. 
Architects, as a rule, are suspicious of builders, and 
naturally so, as the antagonistic builder is found every- 
where, and until confidence is established, the architect is 
apt to be very searching and particular in his examinations 
and requirements. The more friends among the archi- 
tects a builder can gain by his honesty and ability, and 
the more he can inspire their confidence, the better work, 
the more work, and the better prices he can command. 
The young contractor should be very careful in regard 
to the legal aspects of a contract, as there are many ways 
in which an unscrupulous man might take advantage of 
technicalities, and the young builder should make a study 
of forms of contracts and the conditions which govern 
them, and which they govern. 
Blank contracts covering all of the conditions usually 
observed in a building contract may be secured from a 
stationer who deals in legal forms. 
Every city of importance has building regulations suited 
to its own local conditions, and these should be carefully 
followed, or much expense and annoyance may be caused. 
A building permit is usually required in most cities, and 
it is generally the builder’s place to secure it.

To find the circumference and area of any diameter greater than any in the 
preceding table. Rule. — Multiply any diameter given above by the factor 2, 
3, 4, or 5, ete., the product of which will be the diameter whose circumference 
and area are wanted. Example.— What is the circumference of 140? Tabular 
diameter of 35 X 4 = 140. Tabular circumference of 35 = 109.9 X 4 = 
439.6, circumference wanted. Rule for the Area. — Multiply the tabular area 
of tabular diameter by the square of the factor. Example. — What is the area 
of 140? Tabular area of 35 = 962.11 X 16 (is the square of the factor 4) = 
15,393.76, area wanted. The Circle. — The circumference of a circle is equal to 
the diameter multiplied by 3.1416. The area of a circle is equal to the

STATE SUPERINTENDENTS OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
. The office of State Superintendent of Publie Instruction was 
created in 1835, and by an Act of the Legislature of 1843, which 
went into effect in 1844, the office was abolished. The follow- 
ing Superintendents were elected by the Legislature: 
Rozserr H. McEwen, 1835-1840. 
Rosert P. Currin, 1840-1841. 
Scorr Terry, 1841-1844. : 
From 1844 to 1867 the State Treasurer was e2-officio Super- 
intendent. of Public Instruction. In 1867 the office was again 
created. The following Superintendents were elected by the 
people, and served for the respective periods shown below: 
Joun Eaton, Jx., 1867-1869. 
A. J. Tipron, 1869-1871.

REPORT. 
The report for the school year just. closed is as complete and’ 
comprehensive as it is possible to make it under present laws 
and existing conditions. Its preparation has entailed much 
hard and persistent work. The data upon which the report. is 
largely based is obtained from reports sent to this offiee by 
County Superintendents, City Superintendents, Trustees, those 
having in charge State Institutes, and from the presidents of 
schools, colleges, and universities aided in whole or in part by 
State appropriations. While the law says that reports shall be 
made to this office from sources as herein. indicated, it doas not. 
confer upon the State Superintendent full power and authority 
to compel officials to comply with its provisions. Information 
which is necessary in making a careful and aceurate report: is 
obtained, in many instances, after repeated requests and earnest. 
entreaties made to Superintendents and Trustees. The Jaw 
should be so amended as to enable this office to obtain, without. 
unnecessary delay, the requisite reports. Amendments should 
be made defining in detail the duties of Superintendents, Trus- 
tees, and Directors; penalties should be prescribed for failure 
te comply with the law, and specific remedies for its enforce 
ment should be enacted without delay. ¢ The public schools of 
Tennessee, as now conducted, are more cordially supported-by 
the public than at any time in their history. In most counties 
good men are elected to the County Courts and excellent selec- 
tions made for School Directors. The County Courts can im- 
prove the schools of the State materially by increasing the levy 
of taxes for public school purposes.. The Directors in the vari- 
ous districts can lengthen the school term, and pay teachers bet- 
ter salaries by fostering public school funds and curtailing every 
useless and unnecessary expenditure. : 
The law requiring County. Superintendents to be examined
-P-A-G-E-17
—1g— 
under the direction of the State Board of Education. biennially 
has raised the standard of Superintendents in all the counties, 
and we have in the State at this time, in my opinion, the most 
capable and efficient Superintendents since the passage of the 
Act of 1878. 
The tabulated statements in this report show that the total 
number of children in the State of public school age—that is, 
between the ages of six and twenty-one years—is 768,843. Of 
this number, 573,287 are white, and 195,556 are colored. The 
total enrollment of students is 485,354. The average’ school 
term is nearly five months, an increase of one-half month during 
the present administration. The average salary paid teachers 
per month is more than thirty dollars (an increase). Thire are 
7,954 schools and 9,195 teachers. It will be noticed that all . children between the ages of six and twenty-one years are enu- 
merated as public school students; and when we note the per- 
centage of this number actually enrolled, the showing is unsatis- 
factory. These figures, without explanation, are misleading. 
Our curriculum embraces the following subjects: Primary— 
Orthography, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar, Geogra- 
phy, History of Tennessee, History of the United States, Physi- 
ology and Hygiene. Secondary—Orthography, Reading, Writ- 
ing, Arithmetic, Grammar, Geography, History of Tennessee, 
History of the United States, Geology of Tennessee, Agriculture, 
Algebra, Plane Geometry, Natural Philosophy, Bookkeeping, 
Physiology and Hygiene, Elements of Civil Government, Rheto- . 
rie or Higher English, and Vocal Music may be taught. This 
course of study is completed by 95 per cent of those who take it 
by the time they reach the age of sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen 
years. 1 am borne out in this statement. by reports received 
from cities and counties and statistics gathered annually. 1 
mean by this that in all the cities the full school course is com- 
pleted by children before they reach far beyond their seventeenth 
year, and the same is true of those who take the course in the 
counties. Many students quit public schools while in their 
teens and attend private schools or colleges. If our school age 
was from six to eighteen years, our showing would then be cor-
-P-A-G-E-18
—i9— 
rect and gratifying. (We are charged now with a scholastic 
population of 768,843, and a, total enrollment of 485,354, show- 
ing that only about three-fifths of our scholastic population are 
enrolled. If we deduct from the total population of 768,843 
the many thousands in the State under twenty-one years of age 
who have long since completed the public school course, then: it 
will be seen that our percentage of enrollment of those who are 
properly and in fact public school students is very large. If 
the law was changed reducing the maximum from twenty-one 
to eighteen years, this would not alter conditions in the State 
or prohibit many who now attend school from completing the 
public school course. I make this suggestion and call attention 
to these figures in order that educational conditions may be pre- 
sented to the world just as they are. While the suggested 
change is neither urged nor expected, it would make no change 
in the actual attendance or population of the State; but a per- 
son reading our reports, not familiar with the facts, is led to 
believe that about 300,000 children of free school age are not. 
enrolled in the public schools, when the facts are that a large 
majority of those enumerated and not enrolled have either com- 
pleted the public school course, gone into other schools, or aban- 
doned school going entirely. To this should be added that.a 
large colored population in the State makes a comparison of 
statistics with other States, not having this population, dis- 
paraging to Tennessee. Omit from statistical tables those of 
both races who have ceased their attendance upon public schools, 
or completed the public school courses, and it is easily shown 
that we have a larger percentage of enrollment in Tennessee 
than in more than half the other States in the Union. ¢Our 
schools are supportéd largely by direct taxation. The people 
and their representatives in the General Assembly have not been 
convinced that this rate of tax levy should be increased until 
every child in the State has an opportunity to obtain a prac- 
tical education in the free schools. . It was not the intention of 
the lawmakers, when. establishing the present system of public 
schools, that they should give thorough business training and a 
collegiate education to all the children of the State free. Tt was
-P-A-G-E-19
— 29 — 
evidently their purpose to establish free schools in every com- 
munity, where the children of the State, without regard to con- 
dition, might obtain sufficient. education and training to success- 
fully meet the requirements of life and business. From time to 
time the course of study in the city schools has been improved, 
other subjects added, until now, in the larger cities of the State, 
high schools equal to those of other States having the best sys- 
tems have been established and are now liberally maintained. 
The last Legislature passed what is known, as the “ County High 
School..Bill,” which empowers County Courts throughout the 
State to establish one or more county high schools, which schools, 
when established, shall be free to all pupils in each county who 
have completed the course of study prescribed for them in their 
respective home or school districts. In many counties of the 
State there are no cities having sehool systems of their own, and 
in some counties there are no private schools or colleges of high 
grade and standing. This County High School Bill, theréfore, 
will become practically the connecting link between our Primary- 
Secondary schools and the old established colleges and universi- 
ties. If this law is put into actual operation, and at least. one 
high school maintained in each county, then the poorest, hum- 
blest citizen of the State can, without the expense of a dollar for 
tuition, give his children an education which will fully qualify 
and equip them for the ordinary duties of life and the usual re- 
quirements of the business world. When the public schools in 
the districts are successfully taught, when high schools are estab- 
lished and liberally supported, there is no reason why they will 
not be a source from which every well-established high-grade 
college.and university. will receive liberal patronage in the im- 
mediate future. 
-The State Board of Edueation has wisely required those who 
desire to fill the office of County Superintendent to undergo a 
thorough and practical examination. | The Board has, with un- 
usual care and energy, prepared examination papers; and while 
their gradings have been rigid, they have been, in all cases, fair, 
just, and impartial. This has given most satisfactory results. 
Men whe have heretofore filled these offices or aspired to them
-P-A-G-E-20
— WI — 
are now debarreal from even asking to be elected to them, because 
they have been unable to undergo a satisfactory examination ; 
while a large number, fearing the failure, have not even. under- 
taken the examination; therefore, those licensed by the State 
Board are of the most capable and efficient in the State. } 
I have urged, wherever practicable for me to do so, that: citi- 
zens select the most capable business men for Directors and mem- 
bers of the County Court. Men should be selected for these 
positions who will give that. attention and diligence to the dis- 
charge of these important public duties that. a careful business 
man bestows upon his own affairs. If possible, regulations and 
restrictions should be preseribed for School Directors. A wan- 
ton, waste of public funds is inexcusable, and the power and 
authority to cripple public schools, shorten their terms, or lessen 
the teachers’ salaries because of extravagance and useless ex- 
penditure, should be revoked. Specifie legislation should be 
had—legislation fixing the powers, duties, and responsibilities 
of Directors. A imore capable elass of Superintendents, more 
-eflicient teachers, and better qualified Directors are the most 
encouraging indications we have of progress in sehool work. I 
have urged Superintendents everywhere not to license any per- 
son te teach who is not in every way worthy and well qualified, 
especially fitted for public school work, and of the highest moral 
character. While there is much to suggest that would improve 
the publie schools in Tennessee, so much has been accomplished 
in the last year and in preceding vears that results are certainly 
most, gratifying. 
The Fifty-first General Assembly enacted what is commonly 
known as the “Uniform Text-book Law.” This law provided 
for a Text-book Commission, to be composed of the Governor, 
the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and three other 
meinbers of the State Board of Education, to be designated by 
the Governor. _ [t. provided also that the Governor should select 
five experienced educators of the State to compose the Sub-Text- 
book Commission, it being the duty of the Sub-commission to 
examine all books submitted, grade them, and report fully their 
opinion of the various books submitted, and their grades upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
—~ 99 — 
each book or series of books. After the Commissions were 
selected and organized, bids were solicited from aJl the publish- 
ers. in the country, publication for same being made, as the law 
required, in the daily papers at Nashville. Bids to furnish 
books for the public schools of the State upon the subjects re- 
quired to be taught in them were submitted by more than thirty 
responsible and well-known: publishers. The books offered by 
the publishers were carefully examined by the Sub-commission ; 
and then the full Commission, having before it the books, bids, 
and Sub-comniission’s report, made its adoptions of books cover- 
ing each subject taught in our Primary and Secondary public 
schools. ; The books selected were of good binding and. excellent 
merit, in both respects equal to, and in some cases surpassing, 
those in former use. Recent editions were sought and adop- 
tions made. with special reference to our system of schools and 
the general conditions existing. The books were selected with 
care, and the prices were all much lower than. those: of books at: 
that time in use, the general reduction in. prices being about 33 
per cent. Since that time the books have been given. a. fair trial 
in all our public schools, and reports received at this office, from. 
every source, indicate unexpected satisfaction. The law pro 
vided that books in former use should be taken. in exchange for 
the-new books at a price not less than 50 per cent of the price 
of the new books. This provision of the law was strictly em- 
forced and books were sold and exchanged in every county in the 
State: in accordance with the provisions of the law and the con- 
tracts entered into by the publishers. There was much inconven- 
ience and confusion in, some localities when an almost universal 
change of books occurred. Some people misunderstood the pro- 
visions of the law, and many inquiries were directed to this office. 
It requires only a brief time, however, by the issuance of cireu- 
Jars and by direct communication, to satisfactorily place in 
operation the machinery of the law. This Act of the Legisla- 
ture has already saved much money tothe people of the State, 
and, as the adoption is for a period of five years, I am confident 
that thé saving during that period will amount to many thou- 
sands of dollars. ~ It. also prevents the change of books with the:
-P-A-G-E-22
— 93 — 
change of Directors, teachers, or Superintendents; it prevents 
families moving from one district to another, or from one county 
.or section to another, from being: forced to discard books on. hand 
and purchase new ones; it prevents the disturbance in. schools 
consequent upon the introduction of new books by other teachers 
or Directors. The uniform feature of the law I deem. of most 
value. It guarantees uniformity in text, in arrangement, in 
method, and in teaching. Each pupil in every class studies 
from the same text, reads from the same author, and the teacher 
prepares for the day’s work from a uniform series of permanent- 
ly selected books. The law is not without its critics, neither is 
it without friction in its operation ; but I cannot see why it will 
not be a saving of money and an econdmy in every respect. 
Under this law, a portion of the books are written by citizens of 
our own. State and manufactured by publishers in. this city. 
While all the books adopted should commend themselves to peo- 
ple of all classes, some of them especially commend themselves 
to those of us who desire that nothing be taught in. our public 
schools which is contrary to the history of our people or offensive 
to a large class of our students and citizens. 
In the years that have gone the General Assembly of Tennes- 
see has wisely and liberally appropriated money from the public 
treasury for the establishment and support of all our State in- 
stitutions. Tennesseans have a right to boast of our State insti- 
tutions of every character. The schools, colleges, and universi- 
ties for our students are equal to those in all-our sister States, 
and without question surpass those in a majority of the States. 
For a number of years the State has contributed to the sup- 
port of the Peabody Normal College, located in Nashville, and 
successfully conducted as the University of Nashville and Pea- 
bray Normal College. The grounds, buildings, ete., with, some 
small sum of money, are given by the University Board; an 
annual appropriation of $20,000 is made by the. State Legisla- 
ture, and expended under the ‘direction of the State Board; 
the remainder of many thousands of dollars necessary for the 
maintenance of this institution is donated by the Peabody Board 
of Trust. It was originally provided by Mr. Peabody in his
-P-A-G-E-23
—24— 
bequest that the money left by him should be given. to the States 
of the South that suffered most by the Civil War. The Board 
established this institution at Nashville and provided for scholar 
ships to be apportioned among the Southern States. Tennes- 
see, however, having this institution located at her capital city, 
was induced to make an annual appropriation because of the 
many benefits derived by her students. The State has to her 
credit in the University thirty-three scholarshipsp—one from 
each Senatorial District. The scholarships are for a period of 
two years, and pay the holder one hundred dollars per year and 
traveling expenses to and from the College. In addition to 
these scholarships, where funds permit it, a few special seholar- 
ships are given to young men and young women. in the College 
whe are net otherwise financially able to complete the College 
course. There are also, annually, about. three hundred students 
of the State who attend this institution without the payment of 
tuition or other expenses except that. of actual necessary living 
expenses. There are enrolled now more than six hundred young 
men and young women, representing every Southern State. 
The institution is in most excellent. condition, and there is every 
reason to believe that it will increase in power and influence 
with the years. A meeting of the three Boards having control 
of the College last year was productive of a thorough under- 
standing and an agreement mutually satisfactory for the future 
control and- management of the institution. The Legislature 
has been wise and generous in its appropriations heretofore, and 
Y hope that the incoming General Assembly will continue the 
annual appropriation of twenty thousand dellars, which, in my 
opinion, will meet with the approval of the people generally. 
The calendar and report of the University of Tennessee show 
some increase in attendance. Practically the same course is 
pursued and like methods employed in this institution as hereto- 
fore. The original donation to establish and maintain a State 
university at Knoxville was very large and liberal, and that 
property, with business management, should remain, forever in 
good financial condition. A State university thus favored hy 
gifts and backed, so far as that goes, by the State, if properly
-P-A-G-E-24
— 95 — 
managed, should have a larger attendance and a more universal 
support. Its trustees should be selected, in all cases, because 
of their ability, peculiar qualifications, and their interest in the 
success and prosperity of the institution. ‘Trustees should be 
selected from every section of the State—an equal number, if 
possible (and I think it is), from each Grand: Division. The 
former policy has had a tendency to localize this institution and 
ininimize its work. It should be made in every sense a State 
nniversity—one which will have the support of the Legislature, 
public officials, and commend itself to the people in every local- 
ity. Until those in charge of it realize these conditions and 
recognize the necessity of getting in closer touch with State 
authorities, it will not have that growth, power, and influence 
for which it was established. The buildings are excellent and 
substantial, the grounds are perfect in attractiveness, and its 
location in the active, thriving, and beautiful city of Knoxville 
eannot be surpassed. I am of opinion that the legislative com- 
niittee investigating this institution will be able to make many 
suggestions and recommendations which will strengthen it and 
insure better support by the State and the people in the future. 
There is no regularity in the method pursued by the University 
with regard to the selection and appointment. of scholarship stu- 
“dents. Specific legislation should be enacted defining in.unmis- 
takable terms the time and manner of appointments, terms of 
service, and appointive powers. 
The Tennessee School for the Blind, located at Nashville, is 
one of the most successful institutions of its character in the en- 
tire country. As is evidenced by the report of its efficient. super- 
intendent, the work done there and the system employed by him 
and those working with him rightly deserve the continued sup- 
port and fostering care of our lawmakers. This school is not a 
charity, but an institution of learning; it is a school where unfor 
tunate girls and boys who would otherwise be helpless are so 
trained and educated that they make useful citizens and can, suc- 
cessfully enter some business or profession. 
The Tennessee Industrial School, under the careful and capa- 
ble supervision of Mr. W. C. Kilvington, has grown to be one
-P-A-G-E-25
— 26 — 
of our largest and most successful institutions. I have person- 
ally visited this institution, inspected its work, and am so famil- 
jar with all its departments that I can say without hesitation that, 
in my opinion, it is-the best-managed institution of its character 
in the country and deserves our continued support. 
The State Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, at Knoxville, 
has long been a source of comfort to the unfortunates of that 
elass in our State, and the information I am able to obtain from 
sources at my command convinces me that those in charge of it 
are peculiarly fitted for their respective duties. I have not be- 
fore me the receipts and disbursements of this institution and 
other State institutions, with the exception of the Peabody Nor- 
mal College and the colleges for the colored of the State. I do 
not know what amount of appropriation will be necessary to con- 
tinue them in future, but this is a matter which will soon receive 
‘due and careful consideration by the legislative committees in- 
vestigating all our State institutions. 
Under a former Act of the Legislature the State voted annu- 
ally a sum of money, not always the same amount, in aid of cer- 
tain institutions in the State for colored. The last General As- 
sembly provided in the appropriation bill that each Senator 
should designate two colored persons, either male or female, to 
scholarships. The appointment entitles the holder to receive 
‘$50 per annum for two years. The institutions for the colored 
designated by the State Board of Education under former legis- 
lative provisions to receive these scholarship students are: 
‘Roger Williams University, Fisk University, Central Tennessee 
College, Nashville; LeMoyne Institute, Memphis; Lane College, 
Jackson; Morristown Normal College, Morristown; Freedman’s 
Normal Institute, Maryville; Athens Academy, Athens. Some 
of these institutions are the largest, best-equipped, and most lib- 
erally patronized of any similar institutions in the United States. 
‘When a person receives a scholarship appointment from a State 
Senator, he may select either of the above colleges, and, upon 
presentation of the certificate of appointment, will be enrolled as 
a student, as per his selection. 
I eall especial attention to the reports, published in the Ap-
-P-A-G-E-26
— 37 — 
pendix to this report, furnished by the principals of the State in- 
stitutions to which I have herein made reference. From these 
reports you will gather full information as to the receipts, ex- 
penditures, enrollment, methods of teaching, and such other de- 
tail matter as will be of interest to you and of value to the Legis- 
jature. 
While I feel much gratified because of the successful: man- 
agement. of the State institutions and the continued improve- 
ment in the work performed and the liberal patronage received 
by them, T would not in any way disparage any institution in our 
State or by comparison detract one thing from any of them. 
There are a number of colleges and universities not aided by the 
State in each Grand Division for both boys and girls which com- 
pare favorably with colleges in all other States. Some of them 
have been liberally endowed, and, therefore, have made much 
progress; while others, with little or no endowment, have been 
so successfully managed that they have accomplished much in 
the educational world. I wish the law authorized me to collect 
data which would be. of interest, concerning private schools, col- 
leges, and universities in the State and empowered me to publish 
the same as an Appendix to the annual report. While this office 
is the executive office of the public schools of the State, I think 
such information should be collected, printed, and distributed, 
not only because the importance of these institutions deserves it, 
but the interests of our State and our people demand that the 
world shall know what we are doing for education in every de- 
partment. 
The General Assembly two years ago appropriated $2,500 
annually for the support and furtherance of the Teachers’ In- 
stitute work in the State. This appropriation was supplemented 
each year by a donation of $1,200 by the Peabody Board of 
Trust through Hon. J. L. M. Curry, its able and distinguished 
agent. I located six State Peabody Institutes for the whites, 
giving two to each Grand Division; I established three State 
Institutes for the colored, giving one to each Grand Division. 
T selected, in my judgment, as instructors for these Institutes 
the best, most capable, efficient, and experienced teachers I
-P-A-G-E-27
— 28 — 
eould find, giving this work always to Tennessee teachers. The 
Institutes were conducted in the months of June and July, 
each Institute continuing four weeks. The work of the Teach- 
ers’ Institutes has been most satisfactory, and the attendance was 
larger than at any other period in our history. Where County 
Institutes did not conflict in date with those aided by the State, 
I sent, whenever possible, a good instructor to the county ‘in or- 
dev that he might aid the Superintendent in conducting his. 
County Institute. T find that money spent in sending a good. 
man into a heretofore neglected county not only gives especial 
instruction as to improved methods of teaching, but arouses 
among the teachers new life and greater activity. T.regret that 
there was not appropriated enough money to enable me to thus. 
aid every county in the State. The Appendix contains full and 
complete reports from the State and County Institutes, and the: 
careful reading of them is an eloquent and strong appeal to fu- 
ture Legislatures for more liberal aid for such work. 
During the present administration the attempted sale by 
fraudulent methods of every kind of charts and school furni- 
ture has been unprecedented. ‘Dishonest and deceptive agents: 
of irresponsible concerns have enlisted many City and County 
Superintendents in their work, and have by every class and char- 
acter of misrepresentation played upon the credulity of Direct- 
ors, effected numerous sales of worthless materials at enormous 
prices, and practically robbed the children of the State of many 
thousands of dollars. Early in the year 1900 my attention was 
called to their operations in various localities, and their. methods. 
in many instances were so deceptive and réprehensible that T felt 
it my duty to issue an official circular, which, when printed in 
large numbers, I mailed direct to everv school official in the 
State. T called attention to the law requiring County Superin- 
tendents to countersign warrants before their payment, and 
urged Superintendents to invoke the aid of the courts and pre- 
vent. the payment of all warrants obtained through misrepresen- 
tation or by fraudulent transactions. Since that time the sales: 
have not been so great, and the troubles complained of have been 
lessened. There are upon the market some maps, charts, and.
-P-A-G-E-28
—~ 29 — 
other aids to study of merit in many respects, and it has not been 
my purpose by advice or official conduct to prevent legitimate © 
sales of necessary school apparatus at reasonable prices. The 
law should be so amended that Directors will be responsible by 
civil action for a wanton waste of public funds, and Superin- 
tendents should be prohibited from aiding in the sales of articles 
by agents. 
The Fifty-first General Assembly passed an Act making the 
State Superintendent the Secretary of the State Board of Educa: 
tion and the Treasurer of the Normal College Fund. The Act 
required that he give bond in the sum of $10,000 for the faithful 
performance of his duties. his Act, taking from another the 
management of public funds and providing that they should be 
expended hy a bonded State official, is a wise measure, and will 
no doitht prove eminently satisfactory. Formerly the Secretary 
was paid #600 per annum, which amount, under this Act, is 
eaved, for the reason that the Legislature very correctly provided. 
that the Superintendent should not receive any compensation for 
his services as Secretary and Treasurer of the Board, though his 
duties and responsibilities are greatly increased. 
The appropriations for this office have been economically ex- 
pended, and with that I am of opinion that. its efficiency and 
public service would be more beneficial, valuable, and satisfac 
tory to the State if an appropriation for necessary printing, post- 
age, telegraph, and telephone accounts was made annually. The 
appropriation on these accounts should be sufficient to enable the 
Superintendent to supply school officials with necessary blanks, 
printed reports, and communicate directly with them by letter 
or printed matter whenever the importance. of a subject makes 
such communication necessary. 
There has been much good legislation for public schools in the 
past; and while our taxes are low, and consequently an insuffi: 
cient amount of money collected to conduct the schools thé 
length of time and in the manner desired, I would suggest but 
little change or amendment in existing laws. I recommend 
to your favorable consideration that it would be well if the Leg-
-P-A-G-E-29
—30— 
iglature would in regular manner enact the following suggestions 
‘into law: 
1. The school district and civil district should by Act of the- 
Legislature be made coextensive in every county. There is ev- 
ery reason why this should be done in order to simplify our sys- 
tem, prevent many inconveniences and local disturbances, lessen 
the number of Directors, and guarantee better officials. There 
is no logical reason why there should be more school districts. 
than civil districts. 
2. All laws heretofore passed by the Legislature creating spe- 
cial school districts in certain counties, or special school districts. 
composed of parts of two or more counties, should be repealed. 
The law conferring upon the County Court the power to create 
any number of school districts greater than the number of civil 
distriets in any county should be repealed. 
3. School Directors should he elected in each county upon the 
samédate. Either May or August would be suitable months for- 
their election. August is most desirable, because the Directors 
could he elected with Magistrates and other officers without extra 
trouble or additional expense. The law enacted two years ago- 
was not’ plain and specific, and, therefore, much confusion and 
some litigation was produced by it. 
4. The law should be amended fixing another date for taking’ 
the scholastic enumeration of children between the ages of six 
and twenty-one years. Under existing laws this enumeration is 
madé in the month of July annually. During this month many 
‘people temporarily change their residences, visit summer resorts,. 
or other places of interest and comfort, and take their children 
with them. ‘This is especially true of all the large towns and 
cities in the State. It is, therefore, impossible to take a full and 
accurate census in July. The month of May is free from the- 
above objection; and if the law should be changed requiring the 
taking of the census in May, its operation would be found satis-- 
factory and without objection. 
5: The Legislature should pass an Act making it the duty of 
the State Superintendent to prepare and have printed for public-
-P-A-G-E-30
—31— 
distribution a course of study and system of grading for all pub- 
lie schools directly under his supervision. The law now author- 
izes County Superintendents to grade in their respective coun- 
ties. With a uniform series of books for a period of five years, 
it should not be difficult: for the State Superintendent to prepare 
a course of study suitable to existing conditions and acceptable 
to teachers in all the counties. Such a course of study prepared 
by the Superintendent would not. be used, and would, im fact, be 
valueless unless the law provided for a means by which its use 
could be enforced. If the Legislature will give such authority 
to the Superintendent and require the use of a uniform course 
of study, our public schools will be greatly benefited. 
6. The Jaw making it the duty of County Superintendents to 
countersign warrants before their payment by Trustees has been 
of great value, and its enforcement has saved many thousands of 
dollars. This law should be amended. It should be optional 
with the Superintendent as to whether or not he approves war- 
rants, and he should be given anthority to prevent extortion on 
sales of any character to Directors, and.should be permitted to: 
pass upon all transactions involving the public school fund. He 
should also examine carefully and report fully upon the amount 
of money received and disbursed by the County Trustee. 
7. The State should levy increased taxes for school purposes. 
Amendments should be made to existing laws conferring upon 
County Courts power to levy county taxes sufficient to run the 
schools in counties as our origina! law intended, such taxes to be 
reasonable and their levy discretionary with the court, but in no- 
case restricted, limited, or in any way controlled by levies made 
by the State. : 
8. The County Superintendent’s salary should be commensi- 
rate with services rendered and of such amount as will justify 
him in devoting all his time to the duties of his office. A min- 
imum and reasonable salary should be fixed by the Legislature, 
one below which the County Court cannot go, and then the court 
left free to raise such salary at will. 
9. Teachers are required to stand an annual examination ‘in:
-P-A-G-E-31
— 39 — 
the county where they propose. to teach. ‘The law does not au- 
thorize, one Superintendent to duplicate the certificate issued by 
another Superintendent, and, therefore, the public school teacher 
inust undergo as many examinations and obtain as many certi- 
ficates as he teaches schools in different counties. If the law 
would provide for a uniform examination, it would be a great 
convenience to all public school teachers, and would certainly 
receive their approval. In a great many States where educa- 
tional systems have most nearly approached perfection there 
exists a State Board of Examiners. This board prepares ques- 
tions, conducts the examination, and issues. certificates. When 
a certificate is in this way given a teacher, it qualifies him to 
teach in any publie school in any county without further exami- 
nation. Teachers everywhere desire such certificates. Tennes- 
see will in time have this system, though it is doubtful if condi- 
tions now existing warrant its adoption. If the Legislature 
would authorize an Examining Board to prepare questions, hold 
examinations at stated times, and examine only those who pre- 
sent themselves for this State Certificate, leaving County Su- 
perintendents to conduct county examinations, as heretofore, it 
would be well. The efficiency of this Examining Board would 
soon be tested, and further legislation would certainly follow. 
10.. There should be legislation giving power to the State Su- 
perintendent to require reports from County Superintendents and 
County Trustees about all matters affecting the public schools 
of the State and necessary information for the preparation of 
his annual report. The County Superintendent should have 
the same right, the same authority, and the same power to ask 
and receive reports from Directors and teachers, and power 
should be given him to compel the prompt transmission of such 
reports. There is no reason why reports should be required for 
duties mentioned unless the law goes further and makes it im- 
perative upon officials to comply with its provisions. 
11. The Legislature should enact laws making permanent 
State and County Institute work, and give specific direction for 
the expenditure of money appropriated for that purpose. Six
-P-A-G-E-32
— 33 — 
State Institutes, each continuing four weeks, should be conducted 
annually, as heretofore. Capable and experienced instructors 
should be selected. The Institute should require two years for 
completion of its course of study. The first year should em- 
brace all subjects required to be taught in the Primary public 
schools, and the second year should embrace subjects required 
to be taught in the Secondary schools. At the close of the In- 
stitute examinations should be had upon subjects embraced in 
the two courses. Those receiving Primary Certificates should 
be permitted to teach in any county without examination for one 
vear, and those who receive a Secondary Certificate should be 
permitted to teach without examination, provided they continue 
from year to year in actual teaching and receive a general aver- 
age of 90 per cent on all subjects and not less than 70 per cent on 
any one of the nineteen subjects. Persons making this grade 
upon examination in a Secondary Course should be exempt from 
examination for the office of County Superintendent as long as 
such persons are actually engaged in school work. The Institutes 
should begin on the same day and continue an equal number of 
days. The examination should be uniform in every respect, so 
that teachers may be tested by the same rules of examination 
and their certificates made gocd in every comty. The State 
Superintendent should, wherever possible and practical, send 
annually a capable and experienced instructor to aid the County 
Superintendents in conducting their Teachers’ Institute. This 
work not only aids the teachers in school methods, management, 
and aew ideas of teaching, but gives life, activity, and energy to 
those engaged in it. In order to maintain satisfactorily the six 
State Institutes for the whites and three State Institutes for the 
colored in the three Grand Divisions and to provide for expenses 
of aiding County Institutes, the Legislature should appropriate 
annually the sum of $5,000, this sum to be expended under the 
direction of the State Board of Education. 
The institute work in the past, while the appropriation for it 
was limited, has been of material valne to the schools of the State. 
The Legislature can make no appropriation which will accom- 
2
-P-A-G-E-33
  
34 —~ 
plish more in actual results than to give $5,000 annually, which 
is requested by all the teachers of the State. 
These recommendations have been indorsed in substance, not 
in worl, by the State Teachers’ Association and the State Public 
Scheoi Officers’ Association.

The Superintendent. of Lincoln County reported only “ total 
number of applicants examined,” which accounts for the “ grand 
total examined ” exceeding by 217 the combined totals of white 
and colored examined. Te alse: reported only ‘¢ total number of 
teachers licensed,” which accounts for “ grand total licensed 
exceeding by 176 the combined totals of white and colored 1i- 
censed. The “ grand total licensed ” and “ total number certifi- 
cates issued ” should be the same. Their failure to be the same 
is on account of the Superintendents of Cocke and Lauderdale 
Counties reporting as to “ number of teachers licensed ” and fail- 
ing‘ to report as to number of teachers’ certificates issued.” In 
addition to this, there are slight discrepancies between these two 
totals in the reports from the counties of Bedford, Cheatham, 
Dickson, Franklin, Giles, Obion, Sequatchie, Stewart, Warren, 
and Washington. No reports were received from the counties 
of Lawrence, MeNairy, and Morgan. ‘

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE, 
UNION CITY, TENN, , 
June 11 to July 6, 1900. 
Sir: As Conductor of the State Peabody Institute held by 
your authority at Union City, Tenn., from June 11 to July 6, 
1900, I hereby hand you my report. 
The Institute was opened on the day appointed by you, all the 
Instructors being in their places ready for work. The Insti- 
tute was welcomed to Union City in a splendid address by Hon. 
W. H. Gardiner, the Mayor of the town, the School Board and 
other prominent citizens being present. Miss Mosie Wyatt, of 
Humphreys County, was elected Secretary of the Institute, and 
Superintendent R. L. Bynum was elected Secretary of the Fac- 
ulty. After these and other preliminaries, the Institute was or- 
ganized as a summer school, and lessons were assigned and daily 
recitations conducted in all the branches required to be taught in 
the public schools of the State. At the first meeting of the Fac 
ulty it was decided to conduct model classes in. all the branches 
and to endeavor to teach the young teachers how to teach by 
teaching them as well as by giving occasional lectures on meth- 
ods. With this end in view, the classes were organized and a 
schedule of recitations made out, which was followed absolutely 
throughout the term. Nothing was allowed to trespass on the . 
time of the Institute; and, as a result, the young teachers were 
taught system and the Institute saved much time. The work 
done was, therefore, thorough and systematic. We have never 
known more work to be done in the same time. The enrollment 
in the Institute was 180. These teachers came from eight or 
ten counties in Middle Tennessee and as many in West Tennes- 
see. Twenty-five applicants took examination in the Secondary 
Course, and twenty, receiving sufficient average, were placed on 
the Roll of Honor; sixty-one applicants took examinations in the 
Primary Grade, and thirty-one, receiving the required average, 
were advanced to the Second Year’s Course. The average
-P-A-G-E-117
— 112 — 
grades of those inthe secondary work were unusually high, and 
we believe an excellent body of young teachers went out from this 
Institute at thistime. The Institute was in session twenty days, 
and a little more than four days were consumed in examination. 
There was considerable professional zeal manifested in the work, 
and the outlook for a splendidly-equipped set of teachers was 
never better. Many kind words were said of the Institute by 
the good people of Union City and by the teachers who attended. 
I desire, in conclusion, to congratulate you on the selection. of 
the Instructors appointed by you to assist in the work of the In- 
stitute and to thank them for the very earnest and able assistance 
rendered in every department of the work. Much credit for the 
suecess of the Institute is due them. 
The Institute closed at 2 P.M. on Friday, July 6; and so 
prompt had been the teachers with all their work that all grades 
were made out and reported to the Conductor, and all blanks 
were, filled, so that those who passed carried their certificates 
with them. 
T. B. LOGGINS, Conductor.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE, 
CLARKSVILLE, TENN, 
June 11 to July 6, 1900. 
Sir: Lhave the honor to submit the following report of the 
State Peabody Institute held in Howell Public School Building, 
at Clarksville, from June 11 to July 6, 1900. 
The Institute was opened and conducted in accordance with 
your published circular of announcement. The Faculty con- 
sisted of: W. R. Garrett, Conductor, and P. L. Harned, Fred. 
J. Page, and 8. E. Hunt, Instructors. 
Of the twenty days of Institute work, one day was devoted to 
. organization, sixteen days to instruction, and three days to exam- 
jnations. Two sessions were held each day, the morning ses- 
sion beginning at 8 A.M. and the afternoon session ati 2 P.M. 
The number of teachers enrolled wag 181. Of this number, 
ninety-five made application for certificates, as follows: Sev- 
enty stood examination for Primary Certificates; ten teachers 
holding Primary Certificates, having attended the required time, 
applied for renewals; fifteen stood the examination for Roll of 
Honor Certificates. Sixty certificates were issued, as follows: 
Forty-one Primary Certificates, nine Roll of Honor Certificates, 
ten Primary Certificates renewed. Detailed information, giv- 
ing the names of all teachers enrolled, the names and grades of 
applicants for certificates, together with summaries of the trans- 
actions of the Institute; will be found in the report of the Secre- 
tary, attached hereto. 
It affords me great pleasure to report that the citizens of 
‘Clarksville and vicinity codperated heartily in the work of the In- 
stitute and extended cordial hospitality to the teachers in at- 
tendance. The higher institutions located in the city mani- 
fested their sympathy, offering to us assistance and courtesy. 
Chancellor Summey, on behalf of the Southwestern Presbyte- 
rian University, tendered the free use of the beautiful grounds 
and buildings of the university. The Institute, as a body, at- 
tended the commencement exercises, and were courteously re-
-P-A-G-E-123
— 118 — 
eeived. Mrs. E. G. Buford, the accomplished Principal of the 
Female Academy, opened the extensive boarding department of 
her academy for the accommodation of the teachers in attend- 
ance. Many of the best citizens of Clarksville threw open their 
doors and hospitably entertained the teachers. The active ex- 
ertions of the Superintendent of Montgomery County had intro- 
duced system into the arrangements for reception and entertain- 
ment. Committees had been appointed before the time of open- 
ing, the price of board had been. reduced much below the rates 
usually charged in the city, and the teachers found upon their ar- 
rival cheap and elegant accommodations. 
The thanks of the Institute are especially due to the ministers 
of the churches in Clarksville—Rev. Messrs. Ragsdale, Acree, 
Lacey, and Montgomery—for the valuable assistance which they 
rendered. 
Prof. J. H. Bayer, of Cumberland City; Superintendent All- 
man, of Stewart County; Prof. J. W. Cary, of Houston County ; 
and Professor Lawrence, of Montgomery County, deserve our 
thanks not only for their codperation in promoting the attend- 
ance, but also for assistance in conducting the Institute. 
A pleasing incident was the visit of Governor MeMillin, who 
spent an afternoon at the Institute and entertained the teachers 
in an instructive and inspiring address. 
Public addresses on literary and scientific subjects were de- 
livered at different times during the progress of the Institute by 
the following distinguished lecturers: Chancellor George Sum- 
mey, Dr. J. A. Lyon, Rev. R. R. Acree, Mrs. E. G. Buford, Prof. 
J. H. Bayer, Prof. J. W. Graham. 
The thanks of the Institute are also due to the Clarksville 
press for their excellent and full daily reports and notes. 
T cannot. speak too highly of the work of my associates—Su- 
perintendents Harned, Page, and Hunt—or of the professional 
spirit of the teachers in attendance. I have never witnessed

assistance of the pastors of the Methodist, Presbyterian, Bap- 
tist, and Cumberland Presbyterian Churches—Rev. Messrs. 
Ragsdale, Lacey, Acree, and Montgomery. 
It would also be unfair if we did not recognize the able as- 
sistance rendered by Superintendents J. I. Allman, of Stewart 
County, and J. W. Cary, of Houston County. Both of these 
gentlemen worked faithfully from the beginning to the end. 
Prof. J. H. Bayer, of the Cumberland City Academy, and 
his body of students, did much to add to the interest of the occa- 
sion. 
Besides the regular resolutions adopted at. the close of the In- 
stitute, there was a resolution unanimously adopted indorsing 
Clarksville as a suitable place for the Institute to be located per= 
manently and petitioning the State Superintendent to locate it 
here. PERRY L. HARNED, Faculty Secretary.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE, 
COOKEVILLE, TENN, 
June 12 to July 13, 1900. 
  
Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith a detailed report 
of the work of the State Peabody Institute which was in session 
at Cookeville from June 18 to July 13, 1900. 
The Institute met promptly at 9 A.M. on the opening 
day, and no time was lost in preliminaries. Throughout the 
four weeks the utmost accuracy was observed in the matter of 
time, every exercise beginning on the minute. This object les- 
son in promptness will bear fruit in the future work of the teach- 
ers in attendance. 
On the first morning the members were organized into a model 
sehool, dealing with the various branches in both the Primary 
Course and the Secondary Course, and illustrating the modern 
methods of management and class-room instruction. In addi- 
tion to this actual teaching of the branches, there were daily lec 
tures in Pedagogy, in which the teachers took marked interest. 
This Institute was in no sense a “ time killer.” Each day was 
divided into two parts, the forenoon session extending from 8 
to 11:45; the afternoon session, from 1:45 to 3:45. The Fae- 
ulty labored faithfully to do lasting service. The teachers in 
attendance studied their lessons earnestly and systematically, 
those who had come merely to see and rest having remained to 
work and listen. 
The entire scssion was an educational revival for this section. 
ef the State. Citizens, as well as teachers, came from many 
counties to attend the day exercises and to participate in the so- 
cial festivities of the evenings. The benefit to the general pub- 
lie was probably as great as to the teachers. The occasion will 
long be remembered as one of the most notable and highly en- 
joyed in the history of Northeast Middle Tennessee. The peo 
ple of Cookeville showed their hospitality and public spirit by 
throwing open their homes to teachers and visitors, leaving noth~
-P-A-G-E-137
— 132 — 
ing undone to make everybody feel welcome. By their attend- 
ance upon the exercises, their conversation, and their conduct, they 
showed their appreciation of the State Superintendent’s action 
in locating the Institute in their midst. It was a gala assem- 
blage, possessing most of the features of a Chautauqua, in addi- 
tion to those of a high-class normal school. 
The instruction given was of a very superior kind, and elicited 
enthusiastic commendation from both teachers and spectators. 
Dr. Edwin Wexler Kennedy, of the Peabody Normal College. 
Nashville, increased his wide reputation as an eloquent lecturer 
and expert instructor, especially in Geography, History, and 
Civil Government. President W. N. Billingsley, of Burritt 
College, did very fine and thoroughly practical work in Gram- 
mar, Rhetoric, and Physiolocy. Superintendent F. M. Bow- 
ling, of Wilson County, handled Arithmetic, Algebra, Geome'ry, 
and Schoo! Law in a masterly way. The Conductor had charge 
of Pedagogy, Reading, Writing, and Spelling. Sunerintend- 
ent H. D. Whitson, of Putnam County, acted as Secretary, and 
his enthusiasm and systematic work contributed largely to the 
success of the meeting. 
The enrollment of bona fide teachers reached 158. Had the 
names of spectators, even of those who repeatedly returned to 
witness the exercises, been included, this number would have 
been doubled or trebled. The roll of matriculates, made a part 
of this report, does not embrace a single name added merely to 
swell the list. Attendance was prompt and regular, absentee 
ism and tardiness, the bane of Institutes, being exceptional. 
Sixty-one teachers entered the examination held during the 
last two days of the session, of whom thirty-nine received certifi- 
cates, thirty-eight of these being Primary. An Honor Roll 
Certificate was issued to Mr. John J. Hendrixson, of MeMinn- 
ville. The questions used in the examination were not diffi- 
cult, being intended to test the applicants, not to entrap them. 
Besides the regular order of exercises, addresses were deliv- 
ered by Prof. S. B. Yeargan, of Cookeville; President Beardon, 
of Cumberland College, McMinnville; Superintendents Roberts, 
of Overton County; Camp, of White County; and Cherry, of

Clay County ; Professors Gross and Evans, of Alexandria; Prof. 
J. T. Williams, of Nashville; Rev. Mr. Carden, of Granville; 
Prof. Estes, of Livingston ; Hon. C. E. Snodgrass, of Crossville; 
and other visitors. The address of our State Superintendent, 
near the close of the session, was a pleasant, popular, and inspir- 
ing feature. A. L. PETERMAN, Conduetor.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE, 
GREENEVILLE, TENN, 
July 2 to July 27, 1900. 
Sir: The following I most respectfully submit as my report 
of the State Peabody Institute held at Greeneville, beginning 
on July 2 and continuing four weeks: 
This was the second Institute held at this place, and hence 
embraced both the Primary Course and the Secondary Course. 
This Institute had been well advertised and thoroughly worked 
up by the very efficient County Superintendent, Prof. B. D. 
White; and from the first the Opera House, in which we held 
our meetings, was crowded with an enthusiastic body of teachers, 
who evidently came to work and to enjoy every possible benefit 
to be received from the Institute. A cordial reception was given 
us by the citizens through their representative, Hon. J. M. Brab- 
son, who very kindly and appropriately extended to us the hospi- 
tality of the city and assured a hearty codperation in making 
this Institute a success. 
A morning session and an afternoon session were held each 
day, opening at 8:30 and 1:30 o’clock, respectively, and adjourn- 
ing at 11:30 and 4:30 o’elock. Our plan of instruction was 
mostly by recitation, and the curriculum was carefully and 
strictly carried out. 
My assistants—Superintendent Barrett, of Chattanooga; 
Professor Matney, of Greeneville; and Professor Cook, of 
Rives—did their work most effectively, and I am certainly very 
grateful to you for so fortunate a selection. 
There were in attendance 292 actual teachers during the In- 
stitute, and the average daily attendance was larger than at any 
Institute that I have ever held. 
A day was set apart for the County Court, the City Board of 
Edueation, the Board of Mayor and Aldermen, and the School 
Tirectors, at. which time an immense erowd assembled at the 
Methodist Church, and were entertained by able speakers and
-P-A-G-E-146
— 141 — 
splendid music, recitations, ete. It was gratifying to have the 
State Superintendent upon that occasion, and we feel that his 
strong and appropriate. talk upon school matters did much good. 
One interesting feature of this Institute was the full reports 
made through the city papers (three in number) by our very 
competent Editorial Committee, composed of 8. H. Thompson, 
I. P. Knight, Mrs. Pickens, and Misses Cloyd and Fitzgerald. 
They certainly deserve mention for their close attention and 
splendid work in this department. The local press did for us a 
good work, and we mention the News, the Republican, and the 
Democrat with gratification. 
During the Institute we were visited by Hon. F. M. Smith, 
James Armitage, Dr. Spence, J. M. Brabson, and W. E. F. Mil- 
burn, all of whom encouraged us very much and left good im- 
pressions with the teachers. 
Tho ministers of the city—Revs. Jones, Haymore, Baylor, 
Dogget, and Smith—were not unmindful of us, and we assure 
them that we remember them most kindly. 
Tn conclusion, permit me to urge that you use your best en- 
ergies in again securing a large appropriation for State Insti- 
tute work ; for assuredly it is the most efficient and the most. prac- 
tical method, as I see it, for molding and building wp the educa- 
tional system of our State. C. 8. DOUGLASS, Conductor.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE, 
CLEVELAND, TENN, 
July 2 to July 29, 1900. 
Sir: I herewith submit the report of the State Peabody In- 
stitute held under your direction and supervision at Cleveland 
from July 2 to July 29, 1900. 
The Faculty was organized as follows; 
L. 8. London, Conductor: Geography, Writing, Spelling, Ge 
ometry, School Management. ~ 
R. L. MeDonnold, Secretary of Faculty: Reading, Arithme- 
tie, Language, Physics, Rhetoric. 
8. G. Gilbreath: Physiology and Hygiene, Algebra, Geology, 
School Law, Psychology. 
W. M. Graybill: United States History, Tennessee History, 
Civil Government, Bookkeeping. 
Through the kindness of Drs. Stubblefield and Sullins, eo 
presidents of Centenary College, the use of the grounds and 
chapel of that institution was tendered the Institute, and ac- 
cordingly it was held in the chapel of the college. This is an 
ideal place for a meeting of this kind. The campus contains 
many aeres, covered with grass, flowers, and beautiful shade 
trees, through which run numerous white gravel walks and drive- 
ways. The chapel is furnished with patent desks, and has a 
seating capacity of 400 or 500. Pianos and song books were 
also furnished by the college, and added much toward making 
musie an important feature of our work and giving a spirit to 
the Institute which could not hawe been had without good sing- 
ing. 
‘This being the first State Peabody Institute held at Cleve 
land, we did not expect the attendance to be so large as it would 
otherwise have been; but through the efforts of the local com- 
mittee, the State Superintendent, and members of the Faculty 
the enrollment reached 406. One of the leading weekly papers
-P-A-G-E-153
— 148 — 
of East Tennessee, the Cleveland Banner, through the assistence 
of the local committee, prepared a special Institute edition a few 
weeks before our work began, copies of which were sent to teach- 
ers in every county in East Tennessee. The other papers also 
extended many courtesies, and kept. the matter before the people 
each week. I mention this to show the interest manifested by 
the Cleveland people in our work. 
There were seventy-six teachers who took the examination, 
which is a comparatively small number; but it is accounted for 
in the fact that the great, majority of those in attendance did not 
enter early enough to be in attendance during the fifteen days, 
as required of all who wished to take the examination. 
The Institute was in session twenty days, three days at 
the close being given to the examination, Two sessions were 
held each day—morning session, from 8 to 11:30; afternoon 
session, from 1: 80 to 4. : 
In the enrollment, of 406, seven States and twenty-seven coun- 
ties of Tennessee were represented. 
The attendance the first morning was better than usual at the 
opening of an Institute, and enthusiasm among teachers and vis- 
itors was high. John L. Smith, Esq., one of the leading law- 
yers of Cleveland and East Tennessee, delivered the address of 
welcome, which was full of good thought, and was inspiring to 
all. He was followed by short addresses from members of the 
Faculty. 
Miss Jessie Gaut, a teacher in the Cleveland High School, was 
elected Secretary, and was efficient in all her work. 
Prof. 8. G. Gilbreath, of the Peabody Normal College; Su- 
perintendent R. L. McDonnold, of the Union City Schools; and 
Dr. W. M. Graybill, president of Rogersville Synodical College; 
members of our Faculty, are all men of great merit. Their rep- 
utation as leading educators, not only of the State, but of the 
South, is well known; and both you and the teachers are to be 
congratulated upon having such men in charge of the work at 
Cleveland. These men are scholarly and highly practical, and 
showed by the way they handled their subjects that they are 
prepared to help teachers as but few can.
-P-A-G-E-154
— 149 — 
We enjoyed during the session four very fine concerts, one 
each week. These were given by the people of Cleveland, and 
were highly enjoyed by the teachers and friends present. The 
town, as a whole, manifested very great interest in all of our 
work, and teachers and members of the Faculty received many 
courtesies and kindnesses during our stay there. 
We had a number of distinguished visitors during the ses- 
sion, some of whom made short addresses, which were entertain- 
ing and encouraging. 
One day was set apart as Directors’ and Magistrates’ Day, and 
many of them were present and made appropriate talks. 
The official visit of the State Superintendent will long be re- 
membered in the history of our Institute. His great interest 
in the cause of education and his untiring efforts to improve the 
condition of our schools arouse new life wherever he goes. His 
address before the Institute was full of good things, and was the 
occasion of much favorable comment among teachers and citi- 
zens. 
I would not have it believed that our Institute was in any 
sense perfect; ours perhaps lacked many of the characteristics 
of an ideal Institute; but we certainly had a good school. Four 
weeks’ solid work with teachers and all the time a growing in- 
terest in every lecture and recitation, with great enthusiasm 
from the beginning, is a short, but, I think, a correct, statement 
of the kind of Institute we had at Cleveland. My impression 
is that those who attended are filled with new zeal, and will not 
rest until thev have prepared themselves better and better for 
their work. 
Fifty-two certificates were issued at the close—fifty-one Pri- 
mary Certificates and one Roll of Honor Certificate. The fol- 
lowing are the names and addresses of those receiving the same:

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTES FOR 
COLORED TEACHERS. 
NASHVILLE, 
Sir: LI have the honor to submit to you this, my report of the 
State Peabody Institute for the colored teachers of Middle Ten- 
nessee. 
The Institute opened in the Pearl High School Building on 
June 11, 1900, and continued three weeks. My three associates 
appointed hy you-—William Harrison, C. B. Lowe, and J. B. 
Batte—with myself, were present at the opening and on each 
school day thereafter till the close of the Institute. J. B. Batte 
was elected Secretary. Two hundred and fifty-six teachers reg 
istered, and instruction. was given in both the Primary Course 
and the Secondary Course. 
The last two days were devoted to examinations, and 134 took 
the Primary examination and 11 took-the Secondary examina- 
tion. Those making 85 per cent and above in the Primary num- 
bered 54; those making 70 per cent, but below 85 per cent, in 
the Secondary, 9; those making 85 per cent. and above in the 
Secondary, 2. 
Unusual interest was manifested throughout the Institute. 
The State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Hon. Morgan 
C. Fitzpatrick, and County Superintendent A. H. Wright fa 
vored the Institute with addresses on the sphere, qualification, 
and duty of the teacher. Several of the experienced teachers of 
Nashville assisted in the work. 
A vote of thanks was tendered the State Superintendent for 
locating the Institute at. Nashville, and appreciation of the same 
was proven by the very large patronage given it as well as by 
the vote of gratitude. City Superintendent Z. H. Brown and 
the Board of Education were thanked for the use of the Pearl 
High School Building. ~ TT. A. FORTSON, Conductor.

  UNION CITY. 
Sir: I beg permission to submit the following report of the 
work of the State Peabody Institute held at this place from June 
11 to June 30, 1900: 
The enrollment was not as large as I had anticipated, which 
was due to several causes. The presence of smallpox had much 
to do with the meager attendance. The teachers were enthusias- 
tic, and did good work. As a result, we have fourteen eligibles 
for State Certificates. Shelby County was well represented, 
and brought much talent and energy to the Institute. A spirit 
of union and codperation prevailed throughout the entire Insti-
-P-A-G-E-166
— 159 — 
tute, and expressions of gratitude and satisfaction could be heard 
on every side. I wish to call your attention to the able support 
given me by the instructors, without which 1 could not have 
made the Institute so great a success. 
The citizens of Union City surpassed themselves in making 
our visit pleasant and our labors easy.

REPORTS FROM COUNTY 
SUPERINTENDENTS. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
  
#. C. Cross, Superintendent. 
  
The Andergon County Teachers’ Institute was held in Clinton, 
_ beginning on July 16 and closing on July 27,1900. Dr. R. N. 
Price; of Morristown, and Prof. C. W. Stuart, of the Clinton 
High School, were our instructors. Both of our instructors 
proved themselves equal to the work assigned them. The at- 
tendance is said to have been the best in the history of the county. 
Our teachers are taking more interest in Institutes than ever be- 
fore. Many of our teachers have subseribed for school journals, 
showing that they intend to keep abreast with the times. 
The Institute was visited by a number of prominent educators, 
who lectured and entered into the discussions. Hon. J. M. 
Black, of Knoxville, gave the members of the Institute a most 
excellent talk on the subject of education. 
“Wednesday, July 25, was Directors’ Day. Quite a number 
of the Directors were present, and many interesting talks were 
given. : 
The Andérson County Teachers’ Circulating Library Associa- 
tion’ Int on Wednesday afternoon and arranged to add about 
250 choice books to their library. Our teachers take great in- 
terest in reading good books. 
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
  
' Lowis. Wilhoite, Superintendent. 
  
_ The interest in the schools is continually growing. Our 
schools at this time are the best attended I have ever known.
-P-A-G-E-175
— 168 — 
Both white and colored have progressed nicely, with but few 
exceptions. Our schoolhouses, except a few, are in good repair. 
All except four or five are well equipped with furniture and 
patent. desks. There are 107 schools in our county. All the 
teachers seem much interested in their work. 
We held two Institutes this year—one for the whites and one 
for the colored. Eight teachers were employed in each. Good 
and satisfactory work was done. The Institutes continued ten 
days. Over 250 teachers were in attendance. We have a fine 
library, consisting of over 300 volumes. All Institute funds go 
to the support of the library. The teachers give instruction free 
of charge in order that all fees may go to create a library fund. 
The colored people conduct theirs the same way. 
BENTON COUNTY. 
  
D. B, Gossett, Superintendent. 
  
The Teachers’ Institute met at Holladay on June 25, 1900, 
with seventy-three teachers present. TD. B. Gossett: was elected 
President; A. A. Lindsey, Vice President; Alma Greer, Secre- 
tary; Allie Alsup, Assistant Secretary; and Pauline Brooks and 
James Lockhart, Critics. The President appointed the follow- 
ing teachers for a permanent Committee on Programme: W. D. 
Cooper, A. A. Lindsey, J. A. Spence, Tennie Schoening, and 
Metta Dreaden. The President made an interesting address 
on “The Teachers We Do Not Want and the Teachers We Do 
Want.”” The programme was then taken up, and the enthusiasm 
and interest. were the greatest I have ever seen in any educational 
meeting. The attendance and interest continued to grow until 
our number reached eighty-five, besides the visitors. 
Prof. J. A. Baber, of the Southern Normal University, visited 
the Institute two days, and gave two excellent lectures, with a 
number of good suggestions to the teachers of the Institute.
-P-A-G-E-176

The fellowing resolutions were adopted: | 
Inasmuch as it is the duty of the teachers of the Benton 
County Teachers’ Institute to devise some plan by which to raise 
the standard of education and to promote the educational inter- 
ests of our county; therefore be it 
Resolved, That we indorse a plan by which each Civil Dis- 
trict may have the benefit of at least one educational enter- 
tainment at some time in the months of July, August, Septem- 
ber, and October; that the teachers of each Civil District 
be responsible for the success of the entertainment in their dis- 
trict; that the County Superintendent appoint three teachers to 
arrange a programme, and that he be a member of the commit- 
tee to arrange for the time and place of these mectings; that dur- 
ing these months the County Teachers’ Association be suspended, 
but after that time the Association be reorganized and conducted 
as before. 
The Institute passed a resolution asking the County Court to 
raise the salary of the County Superintendent. 
[examined seventy teachers at ny annual examination, three 
of them colored. [ examined five teachers at the quarterly ex- 
amination. 
At the close of my anuual examination at Holladay, Prof. G. 
M. Leslie was asked by a committee of twelve to lecture at the 
college on Friday night. Professor Leslie accepted, and deliv- 
ered a very able lecture on “ Perseverance.” 
The teachers and school interest are the best we have had in 
Benton County for years. 
BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
  
Miss Lilly M. Henry, Superintendent. 
  
The Bledsoe County Teachers’ Institute met at Pikeville on 
June 25, 1900, and continued one week, being conducted by
-P-A-G-E-177
— 170 — 
the County Superintendent, Miss Lilly M. Henry. “ Mr. W.°B 
Boyd was secretary. Boe 
While Bledsoé County is a small, mountainous: county and 
all our Institute work is done by local teachers,’I am pléased 
to report that we have an average schoo! of four months, and 
that our Institute, just closed, has been one of interest and profit 
to all. I arranged a programme for each day.. These pro 
grammes included all the work in the primary schools, ‘and 
were interspersed with topics of special and general interest, to 
patrons and téachers. T was glad to note that methods of teach- 
ing as a profession are recciving more attention by our teachers. 
The work on examination was fiftv per cent better than ‘that of 
last. year. 
“Our local Institute work is arranged this way for ‘the-schoot 
year: We divide our county into two divisions—upper -and 
lower—and appoint a chairman, a teacher of that divisioz,‘in 
each. He arranges the place of meeting, programme, ete. _Each 
division holds one meeting each month, making two per month 
for the county. The County Superintendent, teachers, jupils. 
and patrons attend the local Institutes, and these are very Pleas- 
ant occasions. 
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
  
J. F. Iddins, Superintendent. 
  
The Blount. County Teachers’ Institute was held in Maryville 
College from June 25 to June 30, 1900. Our Institute was one 
of the most successful ever held in the county. The attendance 
was remarkably good. The enrollment was 102 teachers, not 
including visitors. Our instruetors, Hon. M. H. Gamble and 
Prof. J. C. Barnes, are proficient in their work, and their ad- 
dresses contained much that was helpful and inspiring to the 
teachers of our county. Several other prominent edueators r ren- 
dered valuable assistance during the week. .
-P-A-G-E-178

. We have an organization composed of all the teachers of the 
county, which meets once a month in the courthouse at Mary- 
ville. Our teachers are interested in their work, and our schools 
are progressing nicely.- Our people generally are-taking more 
interest in education. - : 
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
  
Horace Ww. orelock, ‘Superintendent. 
  
The State Peabody Institute just ended here has been emi- 
nently successful. Quite a number of the leading citizens of 
Cleveland have expressed themselves as highly pleased “with: the 
type of work done: ~’Too much cannot be said in praise‘of: each~ 
member of the Faculty. They are thorough in their work, up” 
to date in their methods, and enthusiastic in the cause of edtvea- 
tion—three admirable qualities which go to make up the modern 
educator:: So satisfactory has been their work that both citizens : 
and teachers feel that you have exercised considerable wisdom 
not only in the location of this Institute, but in your selection 
of its Conductors. Each member has forcibly demonstrated 
the possibility of a much-debated principle in life—that a man 
may be 4 social factor without detracting in the’ least from that 
dignity which belongs to every true teacher. So agreeable have 
they ‘been that often they were hailed in passing to partake of 
the hospitality of our leading citizens. . It is needless to say that- 
their very affable disposition contributed largely to the success 
of ‘the Institute; indeed, this, together with the excellence of 
their work, has won them many adniirers among: Cleveland’s: best’ 
people. . 
The night entertainments were , attended by large crowie, 
Not only this, but the leading educators of our town took great 
interest: in. the daily work of the instructors. These two. facts: 
speak well for the Institute. : ,
-P-A-G-E-179
— 172 — 
When this Institute first began, the teachers of Bradley 
County felt very much chagrined that they mhust attend the en- 
tire four weeks. J insisted that they do this. Since then nine- 
jenths of them have thanked me for demanding this time of them. 
They are delighted with the opportunity of attending such a 
helpful meeting, and are urging me to do all I ean to bring it to 
Cleveland again. 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
  
P. G. Childress, Superintendent. 
  
I am now quite familiar with the educational work of this 
county, and I am pleased to state that there is a very satisfactory 
upward and onward move all along the line. 
At’ Well Spring, in the months ef April and May, Prof. 8. 
A. Walker and I held a Normal school of one month, at the 
close of which a rigid examination was held. This school was 
conducted on the recitation plan; and as it was the first of the 
kind ever held in the county, those who attended were delighted 
with the plan as well as with the results of the work. 
Our regular Normal and annual examination was held the first 
week in July, and nearly every teacher in the county attended 
one or both of these Normals. 
The schools of the county have been making’ fair progress for 
some time; but as they are becoming more thoroughly organ- 
ized, with teachers better prepared to do more thorough work 
than ever before, and since the County Court has been gradually 
raising the assessment for school purposes, we are expecting to 
make greater progress this year than in any previous year. 
We have a number of excellent schools in this county; and 
since the average term continues to lengthen from year to year, 
and while we have a number of wide-awake teachers in the lead. 
we may expect a continued inerease in educational work.

CANNON COUNTY. 
  
Miss Ina B. Smithson, Superintendent. 
  
It gives me great pleasure to say there was a marked improve 
ment. in the work and enthusiasm shown in the Institute this 
year over last year. It is evident that our schools are advanc- 
ing slowly, but surely. There is a growing demand for enter- 
prising, progressive teachers; and I believe the Directors are 
striving to have just such teachers. I realize that inefficient 
teachers have been the ruin and downfall of our schools; hence I 
have been exceedingly careful in the licensing of the teachers of 
Cannon County. The teachers this year are ten per cent better 
than last year. Fifty teachers passed the first examination. 
Twelve failed to make the reyuired general average of eighty-five 
per eent. , . 
The instruction in the advanced work was given by Prof. R. 
1, Smithson, of Bardweil, Ky., who, in his usual pleasing way, 
conducted the work with great ability, adding much strength, to 
the knowledge of our present teachers, demonstrating both by 
word and deed that he is truly their triend in education. 
Miss McLemore, of Murfreesboro, rendered much aid to the 
work of the Institute by the great interest she aroused in each 
teacher and by her most excellent work in the primary field, of 
which she had charge. 
The greatest. obstacle in this county to progressive educational 
work is a lack of school funds, apparatus, and better school- 
houses. It is hoped that the present embarrassing condition of 
the schools in this county will be improved in the near future. 
. I am trying carnestly to carry out the instructions of our 
State Superintendent to the letter, if possible. 
Our exercises during the entire week were made very enter- 
taining by vocal and instrumental solos and recitations rendered 
by friends. 
“The prospects for better schools this year than ever before are 
very flattering.

CARROLL COUNTY. 
L. M. Hampton, Superintendent. 
  
The Carroll County Teachers’ Institute convened in the au- 
Aitorium of the Southern Normal University, in Huntingdon, on 
Monday, June 25, 1900, and continued three days. The instruct- 
ors were Prof. L. S. Mitchell, of McLemoresville; Prof. A. J. 
.G... Wells and President J. A. Baber, of the Southern Normal 
. University, who were ably assisted by Chancellor Holbrook, Pro- 
fessor Kinsland, and Dr. Maxey, of the Southern Normal Uni- 
-versity faculty. By a large majority the teachers voted to hold 
~ quarterly meetings at the courthouse. _ Several teachers pro- 
«posed to give books to start a Teachers’ Library. We are now 
making arrangements for furnishing a room with the necessary 
appliances for librarv work. . We hope to get prepared to some 
extent at least by our next quarterly meeting. There were 115 
white teachers enrolled during our Institute, and most of them 
seomed to manifest an interest in the work which was done. 
The colored teachers of Carroll County met in the Public 
. School Building in Huntingdon on June.25, and organized and 
continued their meetings for three days. Rev. James Edwards, 
of the Huntingdon Publie School, assisted by C. H. Buck, of the 
McKenzie Publie School, conducted the work. The enrollment 
“was twenty-six. They also organized upon a permanent basis, 
and voted to ineet quarterly at. the courthouse. 
All in all, we feel that. Institute work has been begun in ear- 
nest in Carroll County at last. 
T have issued 114 certificates to white teachers and 30 to col- 
ored teachers, making-a total of 144. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
M. D. Allen, Superintendent. 
  
I am glad to say the schools in Carter County are improving. 
Prof. Charles Mason conducted our Normal this year. The sea-
-P-A-G-E-182

sion continued two weeks. Almost all the teachers in the county 
attended. The work was very practical and well suited to our 
teachers. 1 held local Institutes last fall in different sections of 
the county, which were well attended. We had some difficulty 
in obtaining books, which necessarily ent down the enrollment 
in the early part of the session; but the teachers were enabled 
‘to organize their schools so as to do better teaching, and, as a 
result, sive better satisfaction. 
~ The present bids fair to be the most prosperous school year 
in the history of the county. 
CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
P. H. Duke, Superintendent. 
  
Will you accept this, my annual report for the public schools 
of Cheatham County? A brief comparison of the figures of the 
same shows that there is some improvement in the working: sys- 
tem of our schools. In my last visits to the schools I have been — 
much impressed with the very visible improvement in teaching 
power made by a great number of our teachers during the past 
two years. I attribute much of this to the work they are doing 
in the Institutes and in the prescribed course of reading. . 
One thing of which I take pleasure in making mention is that 
this, year my corps of teachers is composed largely of the same 
ones I had last. year—teachers who are acquiring skill, and who 
are becoming not only “ apt to teach,” but acquainted with the 
children.whom they are to teach. ‘ 
We have been, making a strong effort to grade onr schools. 
With the second year’s work the results are much more pro 
nounced than they were last. vear, and by next vear we hope to 
have the system working satisfactorily. Our annual Institute 
was a.great success, and was much enjoyed. We have our regu- 
jaz monthly. meetings, which are well attended.
-P-A-G-E-183

CHESTER COUNTY. 
C. B. Ijams, Superintendent. 
  
The school year just closed has been one of the most. prosper- 
ous in the history of this county. The teachers are becoming 
better gualified for their positions, and are studying their work, 
not ag a makeshift, but as a profession. Tleretofore this hgs 
hindered the progress of our school system. The teachers have 
learned that they will not be licensed except. at the regular times 
prescribed by the State Superintendent, and then only upon the 
merit and qualification of the applicant, and not. his previous roll 
of certificates. 
On June 25, 1900, my annual Institute for white teachers 
convened at Henderson, in the G. R. C. College building, and 
continued one week, closing with the annual examination. Fifty- 
two teachers were enrolled, and the work was very satisfactory. 
T was ably assisted by Profs. A. G. Freed, I. B. Day G. G. But- 
ler, J. W. Stewart, and others. The Secretary, in reporting to 
our county paper, among other things, said: 
“Each day the work grew more interesting and the discus- 
sions more lively. The programme was dispensed with slowly, 
but thoroughly. Suffice us to say that more teachers took an ac- 
tive part. than at any former Institute the writer ever attended. 
We are expecting the good work to continue until each district 
may have a teachers’ meeting. Let us nite our efforts for the 
elevation of man, and in so doing we will be amply rewarded.” 
On July 2, 1900, I began an Institute for colored teachers— 
the second one ever held in the county. The week’s work was 
productive of much good. There has been a vast improvement 
among the colored teachers, which I attribute to our Institute 
work. With the interest they now have, much better results can 
be obtained this year. 
With few exceptions, I am highly pleased with the past’ year. 
Directors are more interested, parents have awakened to their dy- 
ties and to the necessity of codperation, schoolhouses have been
-P-A-G-E-184
repaired, teachers are alive to their work and rank among the 
best in the State. 
CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
  
A. N. Treece, Superintendent. 
  
The public school interests of the county are gradually im- 
proving. J held Institutes in different parts of the county. 
They were well attended by the teachers and the public. The 
Conductors, Prof. J. C. Brogan and P. F, Evans, did their work 
well. By having more than one Institute, I was able to get addi- 
tional teachers to attend, while the number at one place was as 
large as usual. Each of the three Institutes lasted five days. 
The mornings were spent in lectures and discussions; the after- 
noons, in examinations; and the evenings, in recitations, debates, 
ete. . 
The greatest troubles we have are lack of school funds and 
poor attendance. Our school terms are short, and the teachers 
are poorly paid. Almost all the teachers do good work, and are 
trying to push forward the great work of education. 
CLAY COUNTY. 
W. J. Cherry, Superintendent. 
  
The Clay County Teachers’ Annual Institute convened at 
Celina on July 2 and closed on July 6, 1900, and we are hopeful 
of good results from the incoming year. The majority of the 
teachers are studying their work, their plans and devices for 
successful teaching, in order that they may keep in touch with 
the leading teachers of the State. Our Institute was a very suc-
-P-A-G-E-185
— 178 — 
cessful one, its members many times prowing very enthusiastic. 
The instructors were Prof. M. L. Moore, of Gamaliel High 
School, Monroe County, Ky., and Prof. R. W. Caldwell, of Cot- 
tontown High School. Professor Moore is alive to the work, 
and is one of the best teachers in Southern Kentucky. Pro 
fessor Caldwell is a great Institute worker, whose services to 
this county are invaluable. 
We feel ourselves greatly indebted to the State Superintend- 
ent for sending us the last two years such a practical educator. 
The following resolutions adopted by the Institute will better 
express our thankfulness for the State aid: 
Resolved, 1. That we hereby express our high appreciation 
and gratitude to Prof. R. W. Caldwell, of Gallatin, for his talent 
and enthusiasm so cheerfully given us as the State Instructor. 
Resolved, 2. That we extend to State Superintendent Fitz 
patrick ‘our sincere expressions of gratitude for his sending to 
us an able instructor and coworker. 
There were thirty-nine teachers enrolled. ‘There are only 
forty-four teachers in the county. 
COCKE COUNTY. 
FW. Parrott, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit a summary of the sehool work for Cocke 
County. 
We are doing the best we can for the educational affairs of 
our county. We have had two regular Institutes this year. 
These were largely attended and participated in by the teachers. 
It is generally understood that our Institute work this year has 
‘been a source of much good. We are getting our teachers to 
realize something of the responsibility and importance of their 
work. When this is the fact, you know we can look for better 
results. .
-P-A-G-E-186
—179 — 
There is not a school in the county now but has a full supply 
of the new books. The average daily attendance of our schools 
has improved about 15 per cent over last year. 
Many of our teachers are reading good educational journals, 
and this will, we feel confident, bring a-rich reward to the chil- 
dren. 
We hope for the best results possible, and feel that the inter- 
est of education in our county is becoming more manifest among 
the teachers, parents, and children. We feel that our most ear- 
nest efforts will be crowned with great success, can we but place 
this great work on the basis it should be. 
COFFEE COUNTY. 
  
C. N. Townsend, Superintendent. 
  
The Coffee County Teachers’ Institute was held at Manches- 
ter on, June 25-30, 1900. Prof. W. P. Charles was elected 
President, and Miss Anna Marshall and Prof. J. L. Bush were 
elected Secretaries, of the Institute. Forty teachers were en- 
_ rolled. 
This was the most successful Institute ever held in Manches- 
ter. Ten Secondary Certificates and fifteen Primary Certifi- 
cates were issued. 
We have the best grade of teachers we have ever had in Coffee 
County. Most of our schools will run five months this vear. 
We expect our Reading Circle to grow in numbers and interest. 
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
  
J. R. McDonald, Superintendent. 
  
The schools of our county are now taught fairly well. Our 
teachers are all the time growing better. I believe they read
-P-A-G-E-187
180 —   
more school journals and do better Institute work than they have 
done heretofore. We try to have monthly meetings of the teach- 
ers, but these meetings are not so well attended as they should be. 
We had an annual Institute at Alamo, beginning on June 18, 
1900, and continuing two weeks. We feel satisfied that this In- 
stitute did more real good for our teachers and the county than 
any Institute we have ever held in Crockett County. 
On assembling at 9 o’clock A.M. of each day, after a song and 
prayer, the Secretary would call the roll of teachers. Each 
teacher, when his name was called, would rise and repeat some 
suitable quotation and give the author. Then the Minutes of 
the preceding day were read, corrected (if necessary), and ap- 
proved. Then the work of the day was begun. The day’s work 
was outlined by a programme prepared the dav before by the 
proper committee. 
The Primary branches were successfully taught by Mrs. Lelia 
Jetton; History, by R. W. Thompson; Grammar, by L. E. 
Crutehfield; Arithmetic and Algebra, by Perey MeDonald ; 
Physiology, by R. J. Fisher; Physics, by R. L. Conley; Agri- 
culture, Geology, and Geometry, by F. CO. James. The subjects 
were well handled and the teachers seemed to be well pleased. 
There were in almost daily attendance about. sixty-five teach- 
ers and as many spectators, or visitors, as the building would 
accommodate. . 
On Friday of the second week we held the examination for 
teacher’s license. In one room we conducted the Primary ex- 
amination. All who wanted to take the Secondary examination 
passed into another room. The day passed off very pleasantly, 
and certificates were issued to those who made the required 
grade. 
Our teachers expressed themselves as well pleased and parted 
hoping to be present next year and mutually assist each other to 
become more proficient. in the work.

CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
  
Sampson DeRossett, Superintendent. 
  
Jumberland County has just passed one of her most prosper- 
ous school years. 
In June I held my summer Normal, which lasted two weeks. 
This Normal was well attended and great interest was mani- 
fested. The Normal was conducted by Dr. S. W. Tindell, of 
Dayton, assisted by Prof. J. 8. Cline, of Crab Orchard. They 
gave good and lasting instructions. The teachers were well 
pleased with the work and went home full of zeal and enthu- 
siasm for their fall work. 
At the close of the Normal the teachers organized an associa- 
tion known as “ The Cumberland County Teachers’ Associa- 
tion,” which will have regular meetings during the time schools 
are in progress. 
We still have teachers’ meetings in various parts of the county 
every Saturday. They are well attended and great interest is 
manifested. 
DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
  
A. H. Wright, Superintendent. 
  
Inclosed please find my annual report for the schools of Da- 
vidson County for the scholastic vear ending June 30, 1900. 
Our enrollment is not as large as last vear by 684; the average 
attendance is 144 less than last year. I attribute this decrease 
largely to the epidemics that prevailed throughout our county. 
Some of our schools were entirely broken up. 
We had very little trouble in adopting the uniform text-books. 
We did not open school until the books could be had, and made 
the change at the very beginning of school. No complaint has 
- been made te me as te the exchange of books or the overcharge.

Our Institute work is in fine condition. The monthly meet- 
ings are well attended. The annual meeting was the best we 
have ever had. We thank you for the aid you gave us in em- 
ploying Mrs. Arthur Ransom to assist us, and assure you that 
hér-work was appreciated. The Institute employed Prof. 8. G. 
Gilbreath at its own expense, and each member of the Institute 
expressed ‘himself as being highly pleased with Professor Gil- 
breath’s work. The balance ‘of the work was done by our owt" 
teachers. 
“The Institute was held at the Peabody Normal College f from

Our regular annual Institute was held at: Decaturville on. July 
2-6,1900. Mr. J. GQ Duck assisted me in conducting the Insti- 
tute. The attendance was small, there being only twerity-nine 
teachers enrolled. Among those that took an active part in the 
discussions, I might mention J..W. Wheat, Professor Harrell, 
Mrs: Harrell, and W. F. Tucker. The last day of the Institute 
was devoted to an examination. At the close there were twenty- 
five certificates issued. : : : 
At the same time of our Institute an Institute was held for the 
colored teachers. J. M.D. Brown, of Bells, conducted this In- 
stitute. ‘There were twelve teachers ‘in attendance. At the 
close eleven received certificates.

We spent the time pleasantly and profitably. We were delighted 
to have with us. Prof. J. G. Brown, of Smith County, who came 
as a representative of the State Superintendent. Noone, could 
have been sent who would have been esteemed mere highly than 
Mr. Brown. . His ability as an educator was recognized soon 
after he came into the Institute, and his kindly suggestions were 
well received. We feel that.we have been greatly benefited this 
year by having Mr. Brown here, and ask that. next: year you give 
us a State Institute in our new college, with Mr. Brown. as one 
of the. instructors. . 
The week of our Institute was rainy, but we had a representa:

DICKSON COUNTY. 
S. E. Hunt, Superintendent. 
  
~Important reformations in the public schools are not unlike 
those in other things—that is, they cannot all be made at once. 
Dickson County does not stand at the head of the list, but I am 
glad to say that she is not so near the foot as she was a few years 
ago in educational matters. One thing I have been striving for 
especially: to consolidate the schools of the respective districts, 
thereby extending the term and concentrating the efforts of the 
people 
Tn inaking my visits to the schools of the county, T not only 
make it a point to see the teachers and the schools at regular 
work, but I endeavor to see the Directors and consult with them 
in regard to their schools. The thing that concerns me most 
during these visits is to try to arouse the people and cause the 
attendance to keep up well till the last day of school. Good re- 
sults will be seen, even if the term is short, if the schools do not 
wane the last month or two. We have over five months now, 
which is enough until all of that is taken advantage of. Ten- 
nessee’s school laws are not perfect by any means, but they. will 
give'a good practical education to every boy and girl within her. 
borders. Especially is this so when it is supplemented by the 
special taxes which the counties may levy. Educational enthu- 
siasm is what. we need; and if enough of it could sweep tha 
county and bring to school the over six thousand children that 
are within her borders, the effect would be better schools, a. desir: 
for longer terms, and erelong Secondary schools would be in 
every district and an illiterate person could not be found. 
-. We have had ne regular County Institute this year, but, in- 
stead, have had several teachers’ meetings, continuing from two 
to three days each. Upon the whole, I will say that the outlook 
for, the schools of Dickson County is favorable.

T. C. Gordon, Superintendent. 
Thereby report that I held my annual Institute and examina- 
tion at. Dyersburg the last week in June, conducting the work in 
person. About thirty-two teachers attended the exercises, and 
about twenty-five or twenty-six of those attending passed the 
examinations satisfactorily and are licensed to teach. ‘Lhe 
teachers who are prompt to attend the Institutes and annual ex- 
aminations are the ones who generally succeed in. securing the 
schools of the county. Our school interest is as good as ever 
and the schools are progressing satisfactorily. The new text- 
books adopted by the State are received with general satisfaction 
FAYETTE COUNTY. 
T. T. Hardy, Superintendent. 
  
T have the honor to transmit herewith my tenth annual report 
of the public schools of Fayette County for the year ending 
June 30, 1900. . 
The constant, steady advance of our public schools in efficiency 
and usefulness is now causing the public school system of the 
State to be most highly esteemed and properly appreciated by 
our people. The parents now realize that. the public schools 
are their only dependence for the education of their children. 
Private schools in Fayette County are not now attempted. The 
public schools are consolidated with the town schools, whieh dis- 
continue when public funds are exhausted.

FENTRESS COUNTY. 
  
James Smith, Superintendent. 
  
Our Teachers’ Annual Institute for Fentress County met. at 
Jamestown on July 2, 1900, and continued two weeks. Prof. 
A. J. Albertson, principal of A. B. Wright Memorial Insti- 
tute, and Miss Burks, former teacher of Mathematics in the 
Central Normal College, of Danville, Ind., were our efficient 
Conductors. The Institute was fairly well attended. Forty- 
four teachers were present, and most of them manifested much 
interest in, the work. _ Thirty-eight have received certificates. 
The instructions of the State Superintendent for the exam- 
ining and licensing of teachers have been followed, and, as a 
result, the standard of teachers has been greatly improved. 
On the last evening of our annual Institute a monthly Insti- 
tute was organized, and most of our teachers agreed to attend 
and participate in such exercises as may from, time to time be 
set forth by the Committee on, Programme. We expect from 
this a most pleasant and profitable work, and hope to continue 
to raise the standard of teachers and thereby raise tha standard 
of education in our county.

The.second annual meeting of the Franklin County Teach- 
ers’ Institute was held at Winchester from July 2 to July 6, 
1900. The results were very gratifying to all present, both 
teachers.and.visitors. Every county teacher was in attendance, 
besides several teachers from the colleges and private schools, 
and the general.good will and enthusiastic spirit manifested 
proved that they were fully aroused to the importance and 
responsibility of their work as teachers. The instructors
-P-A-G-E-194
— 187 — 
were as follows: Miss Maud Terrill, of Terrill College, United 
States History, Geometry, and Geography; Mr. James Van- 
-zandt, public schools, Civil Government; Mr. R. W. McClure, 
public schools, Arithmetic; Mrs. Ella Clark, Winchester Nor- 
mal College, Grammar and History of Tennessee; Mr. Henry 
A. Foster, public schools, Principles of Agriculture; and also, 
by the kindly financial aid of the State Superintendent, we were 
most fortunate in securing the services of Mrs. J. H. Phillips, 
who conducted the work on Methods and Principles of Primary 
Tnstruction, illustrating her methods with a class of beginners, 
which proved most interesting and profitable to the teachers. 
The work closed with a practical and scholarly address by Dr. 
William A. Guerry, of the University of the South, who took for 
his subject “The Bible,” showing its importance as a culture 
study aside from its religious significance, and emphasizing the 
fact that for its educational value alone, if for no other, it should 
be in the adopted course of study for the State. 
The Institute for colored teachers, conducted by D. A. Town- 
send and T. J. Townsend, was well attended and much interest 
was shown, the teachers claiming this to be the most profitable 
meeting they have ever had. Arrangements for monthly meet- 
‘ings to be held at different places in the county were agreed 
upon, at which time such questions will be discussed as concern 
the school interests in the various localities. “The colored teach- 
ers are very well organized and are doing a good work in the 
county. : . 
All over the county there is a demand for better schoolhouses, 
better school furniture, better apparatus, batter salaries, and 
better teachers. Directors are discharging their duties con- 
scientiously and faithfully in nearly every case, patrons are 
manifesting more interest, and in every way school affairs in 
Franklin County are looking brighter and. more promising than 
ever before. 
‘Our Institute was a financial success, only a half dozen teach- 
ers failing to give the membership fee of one dollar; and, with 
the assistance received from the State appropriation, all ex-
-P-A-G-E-195
— 188 — 
penses were paid and the sum of thirty dollars was deposited in 
the Bank of Winchester as the Franklin County Teachers’ In- 
stitute fund, to be used as the teachers see fit. A two-weeks’ 
meeting was voted by the teachers for next year and the plan of 
work adopted. One hundred and eight white teachers and 
eighteen colored teachers received certificates. 
Taking everything into consideration, we think we are doing 
very well indeed. It has been my constant endeavor to have the 
public schools paramount. to every other interest, and I believe 
that, with the hearty codperation of patrons and Directors, this 
desire could very soon be accomplished. 
GIBSON COUNTY. 
  
J. B. Cummings, Superintendent. 
  
The Gibson County Normal Institute, having been extensive- 
ly advertised in the leading county papers and in a six-page 
folder programme sent. out to all the teachers and School Di- 
rectors of the county by the County Superintendent, opened at 
9:30 o'clock on Monday, May 28, 1900, and continued two weeks, 
closing with the annual examination of teachers on June 7 and 8. 
The Institute was held in Pythian Hall, in the city of Tren- 
ton, and was well attended, notwithstanding the fact that it 
rained nearly every day it was in session. The Institute was 
conducted by the County Superintendent, assisted by the lead- 
ing teachers of the county. 
The following constituted the Faculty of instructors in the 
Normal: Secondary Department—Superintendent T. A. Miteh- 
ell, Applicd Psychology and Bookkeeping; H. H. Ellis, English 
Grammar and Literature; H. L. Lessenberry, Rhetoric and 
Physiology; M. W. Robinson, Algebra and Physics, with experi- 
ments; W. 8. Hess, Geology of Tennessee; A. D. Hassell, Civies

Our enrollment reached 175, and the interest increased from 
start to finish, many teachers expressing themselves as greatly 
delighted and much benefited. 
This Institute was the most interesting and the most profitable 
of the many Institutes that have been held in the county. Our 
teachers are up to date, and take great interest in Institutes and 
teachers’ monthly meetings. The instruction given in the In- 
stitute was practical, and great stress was laid on principles and 
processes of teaching. 
Our County Court was very liberal toward us, having appro- 
priated $100 for the expenses of the County Normal. 
Beginning on the same day, we held also a colored teachers’ 
Normal Institute, which was presided over and instructed by 
T. M. Stegall, G. F. Porter, and A. J. Collins. They did cradit- 
able work and aroused much interest among the colored teachers. 
We have many very fine colored teachers in. the county, some of 
them holding first-grad. Secondary Certificates. We had en- 
rolled in the colored Institute sixty-five active and intereste] 
teachers. 
The time in both the white and colored Institutes was chietly 
used in practical school work, very little time being given to out- 
side matters of little or no benefit to teachers and schools. 
We are glad to report that our County Institutes were a grand 
suecess, and upon the whole our schools are in a prosperons and 
progressive condition.

GRAINGER COUNTY. 
  
W. TY. Phillips, Superintendent. 
  
In making this my annual report, I am conscious of my 
feeble endeavors. as an official. When inducted into office in 
January, 1899, I found the school fund in my county. in a sadly 
demoralized condition, and two lawsuits on hand against the 
County Superintendent, my predecessor. .I am happy to report 
that all is harmony now, except that there are those who oppose 
me becanse I keep funds well in hand so they cannot discount 
warrants issued to a teacher on his salary at. 10 per cent, and then 
sue the county and put them at 6 per cent interest. In this con- 
nection T have used all honorable means, and my efforts have 
been erowned with suecess. Should [ be selected by the court 
for the sueceeding term, T shall as diligently watch the funds in 
the future as I have in the past. J ain, proud to make you a re- 
port that our new court is an improvement over the old, and also 
the new Boards of Directors are excellent men who have a deep 
interest in the schools. 
For the year beginning on, July 1, we will have nearly $7,000. 
Our scholastic population has increased 1 per cent, and I eati- 
mate we will have $1.10 per capita. / : 
A large number of teachers from adjoining counties were ex-
-P-A-G-E-198
—- 191 — 
amined in our Normal this year. The Normal was conducted 
by Prof. J. C. Barnes and Prof, Arthur Shirley: (I am sorry 
I-could not enjoy this Norma! on account of the ‘sickness and 
death of my little daughter on the second day thereof.) A very 
small per cent of the teachers failed to pass, and be it said that 
the examination was so fairly conducted that the usual wrath of 
the applicant who failed was nowhere apparent. 
I am on my tour of inspection in the schools again, and find 
excellent work being done. 
The following is a summary of work done in the Grainger 
County Normal, which was held from July 9 to July 14, 1900: 
Number of teachers enrolled, 56; number of teachers taking 
examination, 30; number of teachers who passed, 23; number of 
teachers who failed, 7; number of teachers holding diplomas

The second session of the State Peabody Institute for that 
portion of the State east. of Knoxville opened on July 2, 1900, 
in Greeneville. There were 286 teachers enrolled, and eminent 
teachers who were present said they had never seen anything 
like it in point of interest and the practical professional work 
done. The County Superintendent codperated with the State 
Faculty in everything to make the work thé grand success that 
it -was, 
There has never been so much good done in upper East Ten-

nessee in so short a time as was done in this Institute for the 
advancement of the cause of education. 
- There were twenty-eight teachers who took the Secondary .ex- 
amination, twenty-four of whom received Roll of Honor Certifi- 
cates, “In the Primary, Department one hundred and thirty-two 
stood the examination, aud fifty-five of them received State Cer- 
tificates, while inany others would have done so if they had been 
present the required number of days, Fifty-six received County 
Certificates from this examination. 
The State Institute was conducted by Capt. C. S. Douglass, 
of Gallatin, who was ably assisted by Superintendent A. T. Bar- 
rett, of Chattanooga: Prof. W. H. Cook, of Rives; and Superin- 
tendent W. W. Matney, of the Greeneville City Schools, all of 
whom did their work in a most practical and satisfactory manner. 
All of the teachers who attended the Institute this year return 
their thanks to the Faculty and to State Superintendent Fitz- 
patrick for the inspiration received from them in the profes- 
sional training, and ask that we mav be favored by the return 
of the Institute to our midst next vear. 
The County Superintendent held an Institute for colored 
teachers, beginning on July 16 and continuing one week. Near- 
ly every colored teacher of Greene County was present at this 
Institute and stood the examination nicely. Only one applicant 
in this department failed to pass on examination. The colored 
teachers were well prepared, nearly all of them having taken 
some Normal training heretofore. 
A special county examination was held on August 16 and 17, 
in which there were twenty-four applicants. Twelve passed 
and received certificates. 
T am endeavoring to have every school in Greene County 
closely classitied. by grades this vear. This work has been great- 
ly neglected, very few of the schools having given attention to 
classification by grades. 
T have divided the county into six sections for convenience in 
local Institute work during the year. TI mean to appoint a local 
Chairman to have charge of the work each month in my absence.

The Annual Institute for Hamblen County teachers met in 
Morristown on July 9, 1900, with Prof. Charles Mason as In- 
structor. Mr. J. M. McFarland was elected Chairman, and 
Mr. M. C. Williams was elected Secretary. 
After organization, Professor Mason asked the teachers some 
questions, such as their object in attending the Institute, what 
they especially desired to learn by coming, and asked how many 
had taught the uniform series of text-books, and with which 
books they had found most difficulty in teaching. To find just 
the kind of work needed in the Institute, they were requested to 
give written answers to these questions, stating their own par- 
ticular needs. Some very fine suggestions were gained from 
the answers, and every effort: was put forth to make the work 
practical and suited to the teachers. 
A very intelligent body of fifty or sixty teachers were in at- 
tendance, and they worked faithfully during the week. Judg- 
ing from the class of teachers in attendance and their work dur- 
7

ing the Institute, we feel very hopeful that we may raise the 
standard of work in the schools. , 
The Institute was visited by Prof. C. C. Justus, ex-Superin- 
tendent of Grainger County, who gave an interesting talk and 
also some instruction on teaching History. Professor Peake, of 
the Harriman University, was with us for a short time and 
highly entertained the audience: with his recitals. Miss Arlone 
Wells, one of the First Grade teachers in the Morristown High 
School, taught a class of small children, ilustrating methods of 
teaching Reading and Numbers to beginners. Dy. R. N. Price 
was with us and participated in the exercises occasionally. The 
artist, Mr. Allen, displayed a very fine picture of his own pro- 
duction, “ The Devil’s Trot Line,” and in a very interesting 
manner gave an explanation of it. 
The Hamblen County Teachers’ Association was reorganized, 
with Mr, J. M. McFarland as President and Miss Elizabeth 
Long as Secretary. 
A part of one afternoon was given to the discussion of the 
Teachers’ Library. We feel that it has been a source of great 
help and improvement to the teachers, and we hope to interest all 
of them in it. 
Every effort has been made to arouse a deeper interest among 
the people in educational affairs and to make our teachers pro- 
gressive, and we feel very much encouraged with the success 
with which our efforts have met.

The annual Institute for this county was held at Sneedville 
from July 16 to July 21, 1900. The work was condueted by 
Prof. F. A. Penland. The citizens of the county manifested. 
more interest in the Institute than has ever before. been seet 
among them. ‘The courthouse in which the Normal was held 
was full of people all the week. 
Prof. 8. E, Jones, of Mossy Creek, was present during the 
week and made the teachers an able and interesting address. 
He also took ‘a part and rendered us valuable service in the In- 
stitute work. 
At the Institute it was arranged to have a teachers’ meeting 
each month during the time the schools are open, to be held in 
different parts of the county. 
Examinations were held on the last two days of the Institute 
week. Sixty-six received certificates and five failed. A great 
improvement has been made by the teachers during the past year, 
as was shown by the intelligence, neatness, and general appear- 
ance of the papers submitted in the examination. 
We are expecting the next to be the most prosperous year the 
publie schools of this county have yet known.

tinued one week. All the instruction was given by Professors 
Hudson and Robinson, each teaching alternately during the day. 
Our colored teachers are very alert. Many of them show ex- 
cellent training. They gave an entertainment at the court- 
house on the closing night of the Institute, which was indeed 
splendid. The house was crowded to its utmost capacity. At 
least half of the audience consisted of white people who repre- 
sent the highest culture, and who were. well pleased with the 
work and surprised to find such culture among the colored teach- 
ers. Seventy-two certificates were issued—4 Secondary and 68 
Primary.

The White Teachers’ Institutes met at’ Campbell’s School-

house from July 9 to July 13, and at Strahl from July 16 to 
July 20, and were conducted by Profs. W. L. Arnold, C. W. 
Davis, and the County Superintendent. These Institutes were 
well attended by teachers, Directors, and school patrons, and 
were so successfully conducted that the people in various parts 
of the county have asked for two-days’ Institutes this year. We 
have arranged for three Institutes during the school months. 
The Colored Teachers’ Institute convened at Rogersville from 
July 2 to July 6, 1900, and was conducted by Rev. W. H. Frank- 
lin, president of Swift’s Memorial Institute. The attendance 
was fairly good. 
One hundred and thirty-one white teachers were examined, 
and one hundred and twenty-eight. passed. One hundred and 
twenty-five were licensed. 'ifteen colored teachers were exam- 
ined and licensed. Out of the large number of teachers that 
failed last year, only one took the examination this year. 
Superintendent Willian A. Sheffey, deceased, deserves much 
credit for his rigid examinations last year and licensing of good. 
teachers. His work last. year has lessened the burdens oi the 
County Superintendent very much. 
We have never before sent out as well qualified teachers in all 
respects as we have this year, and if our school money was suffi- 
cient to pay our teachers good wages and extend our schools, they. 
would rank with most schools of the other counties. 
We have no Teachers’ Library, but our teachers are doing a 
great deal of reading. From 80 to 90 per cent of them take one 
or more school journals, and a great many have the best works on 
education.

The white Institute continued five days, led by the teachers 
and the County Superintendent. It was generally conceded 
that. it was the best Institute we have had. The teachers ac- 
quitted themselves nobly in the Institute work and examinations. 
There were fifty-two teachers present. 
The colored Institute continued five days, including the ex- 
amination. The teachers did some good Institute work. We 
had about sixty on an average. They did not do so well in their 
examination. 
HENDERSON COUNTY. 
  
A. H. Fuller, Superintendent. 
  
The sixth annual Teachers’ Institute of Henderson County 
met in the College Hall, at Lexington, on Tune 25, 1900, and 
remained in session six days. 
The work of the Institute was under the supervision of the 
County Superintendent. The public school branches were dis- 
cussed by the ablest teachers of the county, who were assigned 
special work and who made special preparations which enabled 
them to present the latest approved methods of teaching in the 
most instructive wav. Eighty-five teachers were enrolled, which 
is about 80 per cent. of the teachers of the county. All teachers 
who attendéd expressed themselves as being greatly benefited 
and better prepared for their ensuing year’s work. ‘The Insti- 
tute was favored with lectures on education by several educators 
who visited the Institute. 
- The work of this Institute awakened more interest and in- 
stilled a greater zeal for school work than any held in the county 
for many years previous.

HENRY COUNTY. 
  
Mrs, Annette Routon Watters, Superintendent. 
  
The educational movement in Henry County is advancing. 
More children attended school, greater interest was manifested, 
more teachers sent in monthly reports, more Directors sent in 
reports on time and in better condition, teachers passed better 
examinations and more of them. attended the Institute. and took 
a more active part in it than last year or in any year previous. 
In visiting the schools, I find the standard of teaching un- 
usually high. Most of the teachers in this county are trained 
in Normal schools, and put into successful practice the methods 
used there. However, thev are vet lacking in enthusiasm, for 
my efforts to establish Teachers’ Associations and Reading Cir- 
cles have resulted in almost total failure. The teachers simply 
will not attend. Most of them read from one to four school 
journals, yet we have a few teachers who persist in “ keeping ” 
schoo] without an educational paper at all. 
Our Institute this year was a great success. It was conducted 
by Professor Thomas, Superintendent of the Paris City Schools, 
assisted by Miss Mattie Butler, of Trenton, and Prof. H. E. 
Watters, president of Minida Normal College, Palmersville. 
Professor Thomas is a fine Institute Conductor, and, although 
young, is already one of Tennessee’s great educators. He is 
cool-headed and far-sighted. Tt was largely duc to his tireless 
efforts that the Institute was such a great success. He prepared 
a syllabus and programme in which nearly every teacher in the 
county was given a part, and nearly all responded heartily. A 
very commendable feature of his work was a special daily con- 
ference with the young teachers. His lectures on Psychology 
were able, interesting, and instructive. . 
Miss Butler, whom the State Superintendent sent to assist in 
the work, is indeed a noble, intellectual, and winning lady. 
Her special work was Primary teaching, in which field she is 
an expert. She revealed many things that some of our teachers 
had never dreamed of, and it is safe to say that they will give
-P-A-G-E-207
— 200 — 
more and better attention to Primary work in the future than 
they have ever done in the past. The Institute sends a vote ot 
thanks to the State Superintendent for having sent her to in- 
struct them in this work. 
I am very much indebted to Professor Watters, whose tact, 
energy, and enthusiasm contributed so much to the success of the 
Institute. Few persons possess so many of the necessary quali- 
fications of a good Institute Conductor—tact, common sense, 
affability, experience, scholarship, enthusiasm, and executive 
ability—as does Professor Watters. 
Prof. A. J. G. Wells, of the Southern Normal University, 
favored us one evening with an unusually strong, instructive, 
and entertaining lecture on “The Teacher’s Needs,” and the 
next morning delighted us beyond measure with a review of 
Macbeth.” The next evening Professor Thomas entertained 
‘us most highly and profitably with a lecture on “ Horace Mann.” 
This lecture was quite an inspiration to all, and we trust it will 
result in more of our teachers studying systematically the lives 
of educational reformers. 
Among the teachers that deserve special mention are Mrs. 
Ball, for her valuable services as Secretary and also for a strong 
paper, and Miss Pearl Sanders, for a remarkably strong paper 
on Psychology and for other services. 
_ A fee of one dollar was charged to defray the expenses of the 
Institute and establish a Teachers’ Library. One hundred and 
twenty-five teachers were present, and another effort at organ- 
izing Teachers’ Associations was made, and we hope to meet 
with better success this time than before. 
. HICKMAN COUNTY. 
R. 8. Ballow, Superintendent. 
It is my purpose to write you as briefly as possible an account 
of our Institute work.
-P-A-G-E-208
— 201 — 
T called each set of teachers (white and colored) to hold a ten- 
days’ Institute at Centerville. 
Our annual White Teachers’ Institute for Hickman County 
met at Centerville on Monday morning, June 25, 1900, and con- 
tinued in session ten days. This was the only time since I have 
been County Superintendent that we were compelled to take 
excuses—this owing to the flooded condition of the streams, 
which made travel impossible. However, we had a good attend- 
ance of teachers, and the attendance increased every day during 
the Institute. I appointed Instructors from our own teachers, 
and the work was conducted on the plan of the State Institutes, 
and the class of work done was by far the best work ever done in 
an Institute in Hickman County. Three-fourths of our teachers 
stood the examination on Wednesday and Thursday, July 4 and 
5, and the balance were examined on the first Briday and Satur-, 
day in August. 
This is the first time in the history of Hickman County that 
there has been an attempt to hold an Institute over six days, but 
the results were more than satisfactory. 
The colored teachers met on Wednesday, June 27, 1900, with 
a good attendance. The programme was arranged similarly to 
that of the white teachefs, and fairly satisfactory work was ac- 
complished. On Friday and Saturday, July 6 and 7, I held an 
examination. 
HOUSTON COUNTY. 
  
J. W. Cary, Superintendent. 
  
The Houston County Teachers’ Institute was held in the Erin 
courthouse from July 9 to July 15, 1900, closing with examina- 
tions. The Institute was conducted by County Superintendent 
J. W. Cary, assisted by the able Instructor, Capt. W. R. Gar 
rett, of Nashville. The attendance was the best ever known
-P-A-G-E-209
— 202 — 
-in Houston County, only five of the county teachers being ab- 
sent, and four of them attended State Institutes. Hence only 
ene teacher of the county failed to attend some Institute this 
year. All the teachers manifested great interest and were all the 
time at their places when their names were called on the pro- 
gramme. At the end of the week it was found that we had only 
two cross marks for absence at roll call. All the teachers were 
placed on the programme for work of some kind during the 
Institute. Night sessions were held every night except one, in 
which the citizens of the town took an active part- 
All the teachers expressed themselves as having been benefited 
by attending the Institute, and pledged themselves to be equally 
as attentive at our monthly Teachers’ Meetings. They realize 
the importance of Institute work as creating interest in the ad- 
vancement of education. 
A three-days’ session was held for colored teachers during the 
second week of June. 
HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
P. L. Bradley, Superintendent. 
  
The Humphreys County Teachers’ Summer Institute con- 
vened in McEwen College, at McEwen, on June 5, 1900, and 
continued three weeks. The instruetors were Prof. Alfred 
Hatcher, Prof. S. L. Smith, and County Superintendent P. L. 
Bradley. There were fifty-six teachers in attendance—twenty- 
three males and thirty-three females. 
A practical, comprehensive review was given in the subjects 
required to be taught in our public schools. Drills in Theory 
and Practice of Teaching were given daily. Professor Smith 
gave special drills in the art of teaching the Primary Grades. 
The Institute was a success in every sense of the word, and 
the teachers who attend these Institutes make better grades and 
do better work in the schoolroom.

JACKSON COUNTY. 
  
U. T. Spurlock, Superintendent. : 
  
Thand you herewith a report of our Annual Institute for this 
year. 
We met at. Gainesboro on Monday, June 18, 1900, and were 
in session for one week. We enrolled sixty teachers. Subjects 
were assigned all the leading teachers, and a thorough drilling 
in, and discussion of, each subject was given by the teacher as- 
signed to the subject. The work was inspiring to every teacher 
in attendance. The new text-books formed a basis for a lively 
interest, which was a marked feature throughout the Institute. 
The last.two days of the Institute were devoted to the exami- 
nation of teachers. Not having room, I had to postpone the 
examination of Secondary teachers until a later time; so my first 
examination consisted of Primary applicants. Out of fifty-two 
applicants in my first examination, I licensed thirty-one teach- 
ers. At my next examination, better teachers presented them- 
selves and better results were obtained. 
There were a few schools in the county that did not open until 
August on account of teachers not qualifying. The one great 
trouble in this county in regard to teachers is that the best mate- 
rial does not find its way to the schoolroom. The prices paid 
teachers do not interest the better qualified class. Prices range 
from twenty to twenty-five dollars in Primary schools, and from 
thirty to thirty-five dollars in Secondary schools. This produces 
very bad results. A well-qualified teacher applies for a school, 
and at the same time a teacher of poor ability applies and pro- 
poses to teach for a small price and procures the school. Di- 
rectors do not seem to think that there is any difference between 
teachers who pass the examination. 
I am in favor of the next Legislature of Tennessee fixing 
prices on Primary and Secondary schools, and also making it an 
offense for a County Superintendent. to grant. certificates to ap- 
plicants not qualified. We can eradicate these evils, and we 
will make our schools more prosperous by so doing.
-P-A-G-E-211
— 204 — 
The schools in this county are doing good work. We have a 
few schools that are bored with “ Directors’ pets.” This is an 
evil that needs to be remedied. We have a population of 6,015 
in our county of school age. Our pro rata per capita is $1.50. 
We have eighty-one schools. 
I think that the greatest impetus that could be given our 
schools would be to erect good, commodious school buildings and 
make our schools begin the first of November and run up to 
April. The per cent of attendance can never be satisfactory 
with our schools opening in July and closing in November, as 
they do. September, October, and November are the busiest 
months of the year. 
Our County Court has not levied a tax sufficient to run our 
schools five months, as the law directs. They claimed at the 
January term of the court that. the county would have to be re- 
districted. I am sure that the county has too many schools, and 
I have advised the District Boards to reduce the number of 
schools, but to no avail. I explain to the patrons that they 
had better send to a good school six months in. the year two 
and one-half or three miles distant than to have a three-months’ 
school within one-half mile of them, and it poorly provided for 
as to a teacher. 
I shall hail the time with gladness when our legislators wake 
up to the interest of education in Tennessee. I am sure that the 
greater difficulties now confronting us are remediable, and that 
permanent aid must come through a legislative avenue. As for 
me, although I am very weak, [ am in this work to stay, not until 
it grows less remunerative and counts for less good, but for more. 
TI hope that in the near future the County Superintendent can 
report.a better condition of affairs in this county. 
JAMES COUNTY. 
  
J. G. Lane, Superintendent. 
  
The James County Institute met at Ooltewah from July 2 to 
July 8, 1900. Prof. Alfred Livingston, of Somerset, Ky., was
-P-A-G-E-212
— 205 — 
with us again as our Instructor, and did some hard, earnest 
work. There were thirty teachers in attendance, every teacher 
in the county being present except two, and they seemed ta be 
more interested than ever before. Two examinations were held, 
one in the Reading Circle and one in the regular course as re- 
quired by law. Those having taught in the county took the 
Reading Cirele Course, and those coming into the county took 
the regular examination. 
I have issued thirty-three certificates—six First Grade Cer- 
tificates and twenty-seven Third Grade Certificates. 
A committee has been appointed to select books for this year’s 
Reading Circle work. I will begin visiting schools soon. The 
outlook for the schools is better than ever before. 
JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
id. 5. Vaught, Superintendent. 
  
Our Normal began on July 9, 1900, and continued one week. 
The work was conducted by the County Superintendent, who was 
ably assisted by Prof. J. C. Welsh, of Carson-Newman College, 
and Mr. Bible and Mr. Garrett, of the county schools. Much 
interest was manifested in school work, and it is with satisfaction 
that we report progress in all lines. About one hundred and 
twenty-five teachers were examined, and certificates were issued 
as follows: White Primary—Males, 30; females, 32; total Pri- 
mary, 62. White Secondary—Males, 17; females, 10; total 
Secondary, 27. Total white, 89. Colored Primary—Males, 
6; females, 5; total Primary, 11. Colored Secondary—Males, 
2. Total colored, 13. Grand Total, 102. 
We feel confident that Jefferson County is supplied with a 
better corps of teachers, and that they are more capable, eompe- 
tent, and progressive than heretofore. We start on the new 
school year very much encouraged.

JOHNSON COUNTY. 
R. P. Donnelly, Superintendent. 
"The educational interest of Johnson County has improved 
very much in the last two years, and I am satisfied that the 
general interest is due to the excellent Institutes, we have had 
in the county. . . 
~ We held an Institute at Mountain City from June 18 to June 
28, 1900. Prof. L. S. London, Superintendent of. the Bristol 
Gity Schools, was the Conductor. We had a very good attend- 
ance and one of the most interesting Institutes we have ever had. 
The citizens as well as the teachers were very much interested. 
We had good music and several well-rendered recitations, which 
made a pleasant as well as an interesting feature of the work. 
~The following resolutions were passed : 
1. That we extend our thanks to our State Superintendent, 
Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, of Nashville, for the great interest he 
manifests in the schools of the State, for the zeal and energy 
exerted in all educational interests, and for giving our county 
Stata aid in this Institute. 
2. That we tender our sincere and heartfelt thanks to Prof. 
LL. 8. London for his very efficient services as Conductor of this 
Institute. We assure him in parting that his work and pres- 
ence among us have made lasting i impressions on our minds, and, 
though absent from us, we will have pleasant memories of him 
and his work for long years to come. : 
.3, That we most. heartily indorse the work of the Institute, 
the most successful one we have ever. had, and that. we most re- 
spectfully ask our County Superintendent and District Directors 
and the public in general to require all teachers. to attend our 
County Institutes in the future. Demand well-trained teachers 
and you will get them. 
Our teachers are taking school] journals and are trying to keep 
up with the educational progress of our times.

KNOX COUNTY. 
D. P, Duggan, Superintendent. 
  
In submitting my annual report of the schools of Knox Coun- 
ty, I wish to say that the enrollment and attendance have never 
been better, there being at least 95 per cent of the pupils enrolled 
and about 80 per cent in attendance. I find that the enrollment 
and attendance are better in the remote districts than in the dis- 
tricts near the city of Knoxville. I attribute it largely to the 
inspiration gathered in attending our educational mass meetings 
held throughout the county, with from four to six districts repre- 
sented in each meeting, where teachers, parents, children, and 
Directors were brought face to face, where they could see what 
was done and hear what was said; while some of the larger dis- 
tricts held their meetings monthly, on Saturdays, with no one 
present but the teachers and occasionally a Director. In, the 
main, I wish to say that we have had a most prosperous school 
year. 
The County Normal for white teachers was held in the city of 
Knoxville, in the Baker-Himel School Building, during the first 
two weeks of July, 1900. This was a most successful and 
largely attended Institute, there being about 95 per cent of the 
teaching force present all the time, with many interested visitors. 
I was assisted in the work by Prof. Cooper D. Schmitt, pro- 
fessor of Mathematics in the University of Tennessee, and who 
has assisted us for the last four vears in Normal work, which 
shows his worth and standing as an educator; Prof. W. 8. Bryan, 
formerly principal of Hampden-Sidney School, Knoxville, but 
now vice president of Holbrook Normal College; Prof. J. W. 
Shelley, principal of Porter Academy, one of the leading acade- 
mies in East Tennessee, where young men and women are pre~ 
pared for teaching and for entering college. In my humble 
opinion, no better work—work in keeping with the best. Normal 
methods and centered upon the subjects that will be taught in 
the common schools—was done in any two-weeks’ county or State 
work.
-P-A-G-E-217
— 208 — 
The Institute was visited by many prominent educators of 
East Tennessee. Among the most prominent were Dr. Spence, 
one of the pioneer educators of the State, and now president of 
Harriman College; J. H. McCallie, Superintendent of Knox- 
ville City Schools; J. R. Lowery, principal of North Knoxville 
School, conceded to be the largest and best school in Knoxville; 
J. A. Andes, principal of Sevier School; and Maj. E. E. Mc 
Croskey—all of whom delivered interesting and instructive ad- 
dresses. 
The school system of Knox County is steadily improving, and 
we are hopeful of good results from the coming year. Our 
schools are well graded and managed systematically. A ma- 
jority of the teachers study their work, plan and outline supple- 
mentary reading in connection with the text-books, and keep in 
touch with the leading teachers of the land by reading the best 
educational journals and books on teaching. During the school 
term J visited all the schools of the county, and in the main was 
pleased with what I saw and heard. Tlowever, I regret to say 
that I visited a few schools that were void of real worth; but it 
is gratifying to know that at least 80 per cent of our schools are 
taught by conscientious men and women who are making rea- 
sonable progress in honest efforts to popularize true education. 
The County Normal for colored teachers was held in con- 
nection. with the State Normal for the colored teachers of East. 
Tennessee, at Knoxville, in the Austin High School building. 
The State was represented by J. W. Manning as Conductor, and 
P. E. J. Yett and J. W. Canseler as assistants; while the county 
was represented by P. E. J. Yett, principal of Eastfort High 
School, and J. W. Robertson, of Sunrise. Professor Yetti is 
considered one of the best: educators among the colored teach- 
ers of East Tennessee, having taught for more than fifteen 
years at the same place, and assisted in Institute work for about 
ten years. A most excellent work was done by all the Instruct- 
ors, and a deep interest was manifested throughout the three- 
weeks’ term, which began on July .11 and closed on July 30. 
The colored teachers are well equipped and are making rapid 
strides in educational advancement.

LAKE COUNTY.   
R. C. Donaldson, Superintendent. 
  
In spite of difficulties peculiar to this section, education in 
Lake County is on a substantial basis. The greatest drawback 
to systemization is met in the country districts, where the 
school terms are necessarily irregular. The standard of qualifi- 
cation for teachers has been raised by requiring all applicants 
‘to take written examinations at stated periods as requested by 
the State Superintendent. 
One of the most promising signs last year was the establish- 
ing of a County High School at Tiptonville. For its support 
the County Court authorized a levy of ten cents on the hundred 
dollars, and also raised the tax for common school purposes to 
the full limit. 
We had no County Institute this year. Most of our teachers 
attended, instead, the State Peabody Institute held ati Union 
City from June 11 to July 6, 1900, and conducted by Professors 
Loggins, Link, Higgs, and Bynum. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
  
‘H T. Hanks, Superintendent. 
  
The Institute for white teachers met on June 4, 1900, and the 
Institute for colored teachers met on June 11, each holding one 
week. Owing to the excessively rainy weather, the attendance 
was not so large as heretofore. This can be inferred from the 
memorandum I made of the opening of the exercises, which, I 
find on reference, runs thus: “June 4, 1900.—Teachers’ Insti- 
tute met promptly at 9 o’clock A.M. Present: County Superin- 
tendent, Jupiter Pluvius, and small boy sweeping hall.” The 
Weather Bureau seemed for the time to totally ignore us. We 
did not have as much water as Grandfather Noah had on the 
occasion of his memorable excursion to Mount Ararat, but it
-P-A-G-E-219
— 210 — 
lasted nearly as long. Throngh a period of forty days it rained 
nearly every day. We came in the rain, we went in the rain, 
and it was our custom in adjourning for dinner to announce 
that we would reconvene between the second and third after- 
noon showers, Nevertheless, after the first day we had an at- 
tendance of between thirty and forty teachers at. each meeting. 
While there was not the fullness of attendance had heretofore, 
nor so much enthusiasm apparent, yet the exercises, conducted 
by Prof. G. R. Throop, were very interesting and instructive 
and productive of much benefit to those present. The results 
thereof will, I trust, be apparent hereafter in the work of our 
teachers. The examinations following the Institutes were more 
rigid than in former years, excluding a much larger number of 
applicants than heretofore; and while this caused some com- 
plaint among the disapointed ones (and their friends), I was 
never surer in my life that I was right. The good results thereof 
are already becoming apparent. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
R. L. Sutton, Superintendent. 
  
The Lawrence County Teachers’ Institute was in session at 
Lawrenceburg from July 2 to July 13,1900. It was conducted 
by the County Superintendent. 
LEWIS COUNTY. 
  
J.T. Banks, Superintendent. 
  
An Institute for the teachers of Lewis County was held, com- 
mencing on July 9, 1900, and continuing five days. The at- 
tendance was not as good as was desired. Teachers, as a 
general rule, are engaged in other avocations for the greater part
-P-A-G-E-220
— 211 — 
of the year. They do not seem willing to give time to Institute 
work. Those who were engaged in farming could not well leave 
their crops, as the season had been unfavorable. 
The provisions made for the maintenance of the public schools 
of this county are not sufficient to maintain long-term schools, 
and hence of necessity teachers have to engage in other employ- 
ments. The assessed value of the property has been increased, 
and, should the County Court continue the same rate for school 
purposes as heretofore, there will be more funds for the support 
of schools. 
The length of school terms in this county is very unequal. 
The terms of some of the schools are from two to three months: 
.of others, from seven to eight months. Manifestly this is wrong. 
Each child is entitled to the same school advantages, which 
should not depend upon his residence. There are in Lewis 
County two civil districts in which the school district is the same. 
The other school districts are separate and receive their pro rata 
share of public funds. This gives rise to the inequality of 
school terms. The remedy for this evil lies with the Legisla- 
ture. The making of the civil districts and school districts 
identical would not wholly remove the wrong, because of the in- 
equality of population in the civil districts. 
LINCOLN COUNTY. 
T. M. Wilson, Superintendent. 
  
On June 18, 1900, something near a hundred of our teachers 
assembled to begin work in our Institute. We had one week of ‘ 
active Institute work, and then the examinations, grading, and 
issuing certificates one more week. We thank you very much 
for sending Mrs. Arthur Ransom to. teach reading. It was due 
chiefly to her presence and effort that this Institute has been. pro- 
nounced the best one that Lincoln County ever had.

LOUDON COUNTY. 
  
John T. Henderson, Superintendent. 
  
Our County Institute, held from July 16 to July 20, 1900, 
was one of the best annual Institutes we have ever had in this 
county. There was a larger attendance of teachers than at any 
previous Institute held in this county within the past ten years. 
There were several new teachers in the number in attendance, 
but most of them are fairly well qualified and a very small per 
cent failed to obtain certificates. 
On Monday evening of the Institute, Rev. J. F. Spence, of 
Harriman University, gave us a very instructive lecture. On 
Tuesday evening, Prof. W. A. Wright, of U. 8. Grant Univer- 
sity, Athens, gave an excellent address, which was enjoyed 
by all the teachers. Professor Barnes, of Maryville College, 
was present nearly all the week and added much to our pleasure — 
by several talks on educational lines. There were other visiting 
eminent educators who dropped in for a short time during the 
session. 
Prof. I. Carpenter and Miss Kate Roberts each took some sub- 
scriptions to a number of educational journals, which we hope 
will be of value to the subscribers during this fall term of school. 
Everything considered, our schools are gradually improving 
and our teachers are increasing in their professional zeal. 
MACON COUNTY. 
H. N. Donoho, Superintendent. 
  
The Macon County Teachers’ Association met in Lafayette 
on July 2, 1900, and continued in session one week. Prof. E. 
B. Wilson, of Bethpage, was sent by the State Superintendent 
to help conduet the Institute work. Professor Wilson did some 
good work, presenting practical lessons to the teachers. About
-P-A-G-E-222
— 213 — 
sixty teachers were in attendance, and, at times during the Insti- 
tute, also a goodly number of patrons. 
The following preamble and resolutions were adopted by the 
teachers: - 
Whereas we, the teachers of Macon County, in Institute as- 
sembled at Lafayette for the year 1900, believe that the great- 
ness of a country largely depends upon the education of its citi- 
zens; and 
Whereas we believe that a properly trained and enlightened 
citizenship is necessary to secure to us and to our posterity the 
perpetuation of social and political liberty ; therefore, be it 
Resolved, 1. That. we commend and indorse the labors of 
Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction, and his untiring energy and devotion to the cause 
of education, and that we give him our hearty codperation in his 
educational work. . 
Resolved, 2. That we extend our sincere thanks to Prof. 
Haskell N. Donoho, County Superintendent of Public Instrue- 
tion, for the efficient work he has accomplished since holding the 
responsible position. as leader of the educational interests of our 
county; and we commend him to the favorable consideration of 
the Honorable County Court for reélection. 
Resolved, 3. That we appreciate the work of our Instructor, 
Prof, E. B. Wilson, and extend to him our thanks for his in- 
structive and beneficial lectures and valuable information dur- 
ing our Institute; and we heartily indorse his earnestness in, 
and devotion to, the cause of education, and recommend him to 
the State Superintendent as an able Instructor. 
Resolved, 4. That, since the term of schools in Macon Coun- 
ty is too short for the best interest of the pupils, it is the sense 
of this Institute that those in authority, either county or State, 
should devise some means by which it may be lengthened. 
Resolved, 5. That we, the teachers, as a body, will devote 
ourselves more to teaching as a profession; that we will labor 
more earnestly to improve ourselves and our schools; that we 
will strive to elevate the standard of moral integrity and useful- 
ness of our pupils by using our influence with the Directors
-P-A-G-E-223
— 214 — 
to secure teachers on their moral and intellectual attainments. 
rather than on a financial basis; and that we will endeavor to 
promote the cause of education in every way that will lead to a 
higher degree of advancement and prosperity. 
Committee on Resolutions: Larkin N. Smith, Chairman, Red 
Boiling Springs; Odell Davis, Chesla; Miss Pattie Bratton. 
Lafayette; Miss Kate Dunham, Sullivan; W. N. Crowder, Free- 
man. 
The attendance in our schools this year is much larger than 
it was last year, owing to the fact that the new text-books were 
so hard to get into the schools; but this year we have them in all 
our schools, and as a general thing the schools are doing remark- 
ably well. 
WMINN COUNTY.   
M. R. M. Burke, Superintendent. 
  
Inclosed find the annual report of the schools of McMinn 
County. I was elected to the office of County Superintendent 
last October, after many of the schools had closed, and have 
spent most of the year in getting up reports, as little attention 
had been given to them by the teachers at the close of the term. 
Our County Normal was to have been held at Riceville, begin- 
ning on July 10, 1900, but, after the announcement. of the State 
Normal at Cleveland for the month of July, we changed the time 
of our County Normal for white teachers to June 25, in order to 
give the teachers an opportunity to attend the State Normal. 
Our County Normal convened at Riceville on June 25 and 
closed on June 29. We were assisted in our work by Prof. John 
A. Miller. The Grading Committee consisted of Miss Lizzie 
McMahan, Prof. A. 8. Callahan, and Rev. James G. Teeter. 
Prof. R. A. Lowry was Secretary of the Normal, and Professor 
Cheek acted as Critic. All officers performed their duties well. 
There were about eighty teachers present. We enjoyed special 
\
-P-A-G-E-224
— 215 — 
addresses from Dr. J. H. Race, Prof. D. A.- Bolton, Dr. E. C. 
Ferguson, and Dr. W. W. Hooper, all of U. 8. Grant University. 
The final examination was held at Athens on the last Friday 
and Saturday in July. 
A week of Normal work was given to the colored teachers at 
Athens during the month of July. 
MNAIRY COUNTY. 
  
Horry Hodges, Superintendent. 
  
The MeNairy Countv Teachers’ Institute began on June: 18. 
1900, and continued one week. Prof. OC. B. Ijams, County Su- 
perintendent, of Chester County, was Director of the Institute, 
and did efficient work. About eighty teachers were present, and 
there was a good interest in the work during the entire time. 
The Institute is generally regarded as having been one of the 
best and most profitable ever held in the county. 
We have held several Institutes in the different districts of 
the county this year. We have a good organization among our 
teachers and the interest is growing all the time. We are de- 
veloping some good Institute workers among our young teach- 
ers, 
The teachers of McNairy County are reading more journals 
this year than they have ever read in the history of the county. 
We are encouraging professional teachers and discouraging 
those who are teaching temporarily to become doctors, lawyers, 
preachers, ete. 
The patrons of the schools have purchased the new books, and 
the attendance in all the schools was better this vear than it was 
last. year. 
We had a two-days’ examination at the close of our annual 
Institute and licensed sixty-eight teachers. Our teachers are 
beginning to take an interest in the examinations, and do not
-P-A-G-E-225
— 216 — 
regard it as an insult to be examined, even when they are in pos- 
session of diplomas. 
We have made a special effort to secure good men as Directors 
in every district of the county, and have been reasonably suc- 
cessful. The outlook for the fall schools is flattering. 
MADISON COUNTY. 
  
W. M. Wharton, Superintendent. 
  
{A State Peabody Institute was held in Madison County, a 
full report of which is to be found elsewhere in this volume. } 
MARION COUNTY. 
D. A. Tate, Superintendent. 
  
The people of Marion County are beginning to realize the 
necessity of more school money, and I believe our present County 
Court. will levy a liberal school tax at its next quarterly term. 
T£ it does this, the schools of Marion County will immediately 
forge to the front. The majority of our teachers are competent 
and full of zeal and energy. The one thing most needful is 
money, and I hope that we shall be able to report great progress 
along this line next year. 
We held our annual Institute for white teachers at Sequachtee 
the latter part of June. A larger per cent of the teachers at- 
tended than ever before, almost the entire teaching force being 
present. Dr. H. M. Evans, of the Chattanooga Normal Uni- 
versity, conducted the Institute for us, and did his work well. 
The Institute for colored teachers was held at South Pitts-
-P-A-G-E-226
— Ai — 
burg, commencing at the same time. The Institute was con- 
ducted by Dr. H. M. S. Byrom, of Whiteside, a fully competent 
colored man. All of the colored teachers were present, except 
one, who was prevented by sickness. 
The Institute for white teachers was in session seven days, 
while the colored Institute was in session ten days. The people 
as well as the teachers manifested a lively interest in these Insti- 
tutes, and I think the general tendency toward education in this 
county is favorable. 
MARSHALL COUNTY. 
J. G. Stinson, Superintendent. 
The annual Institute for Marshall County was held in the 
Haynes-McLean School building, beginning on June 18, 1900, 
and continuing two weeks. It was’ the most successful Institute 
ever held in the county. The attendance was good, there being 
about 95 per cent of the teaching force present. The Institute 
was conducted by local talent without any assistance from the 
State. 
Our teachers are doing more professional work than ever be- 
fore. They are studying up-to-date methods, subscribing for 
good school journals, and are improving along all lines of school 
work. 
Our colored teachers had a very successful Institute. It con- 
tinued two weeks, with about forty teachers in attendance. 
We have followed the instructions of the State Superintendent 
in all matters pertaining to the examination of teachers. 
. The people are very much pleased with the new text-books 
adopted by the State. The schools of the county have been sup 
plied with the new books.

MAURY COUNTY. 
P. W. Dodson, Superintendent. 
  
Under the supervision of the Executive Committee, consist- 
ing of J. M. Fitzgerald, A. ©. Allen, E. A. Ragsdale, Jesse 
Tomlinson, Miss Mary Blackman, Miss Blanche Scott, and the 
County Superintendent, we held a very interesting and profit- 
able Institute. 
The objects to be attained in the study of the various subjects, 
and how to attain them, were ably discussed by our best teachers. 
One of the liveliest. discussions was on the question, “Ts Spell- 
ing as taught now in our schools as good as it was twenty years 
ago?” which was decided in the negative. Mrs. C. W. Mitchell 
led in this. Another topic was, “ How to Make Arithmetic, 
Geometry, ete, a Matter not of Memory, but of Knowledge, 
Capable of Immediate and Practical Application.” Mr. J. A. 
Bostick, of Howard Institute, was the leader. “ The Impor- 
tance of Learning to Think, to Analyze, to Trace Effect to Cause, 
and the Reverse,” was ably: presented by W. E. Bostick, City 
Superintendent. 
We also had an able address by Rev. T. T. Thompson, who 
held the teachers’ ‘attention as few speakers do. From grave to 
gay, the theme, “The Exalted Aims the Teacher Should Have,” 
was presented with rare skill and power. Hon. L. P. Padgett, 
in a most eloquent address, urged the superior claims of our 
moral nature over all other considerations. Mrs. C. W. Mitch- 
ell gave a clear, concise description of South Africa and the 
conditions and results of the Boer War. Maj. W. C. Whit- 
thorne, recently returned from the Philippine Islands, gave an 
address that was listened to with intense interest. He described 
the islands, the climate, and the people, together with their eus- 
toms, dress, food, weapons, and other characteristics. 
Taking it altogether, the Institute was much enjoyed and the 
teachers expressed themselves as much benefited. There was a
-P-A-G-E-228
— 219 — 
unanimous resolution to have a State Institute next vear, if they 
have to pay for it themselves. 
J. W. Johnson, of Roger Williams University, was the Con- 
ductor of the Colored Teachers’ Institute. It was considered 
one of the best Institutes, if not the best one, the colored teachers 
of Maury County have ever had. Thev also propose to make a 
strong effort for a State Institute. 
MEIGS COUNTY, 
  
J. G. Paul, Superintendent. 
  
The Meigs County Normal was held at Decatur from July 
16 to July 21, 1900. Prof. S. W. Tindel, of Dayton Clas- 
sical Institute, and Prof. Charles K. Gallaher assisted County 
Superintendent. Paul in conducting the work. Prof. R. D. 
Cecil was Chairman of the Institute work. There were thirty- 
nine teachers in. attendance. Thirty-six certificates were issued. 
Among the visiting teachers were Prof. John Culvahouse, of 
MeMinn County; Professor Hooper and Dr. Ferguson, of U. 8. 
Grant University, Athens; and Professor Gass, of Carson and 
Newman College, Mossy Creek. Professor Tindel did some 
very efficient work. 
MONROE COUNTY. 
S. J. Parks, Superintendent. 
  
T herewith submit to you my sixth annual report. 
The condition of our schools was very good last year, consider- 
ing the change of text-books during the term. TIT heartily in- 
dorse the uniform system of text-books, and think that, as a 
result. of it, our schools will be much improved this fall.
-P-A-G-E-229
— 220 — 
Theld two Normals in the county this summer—one at Madi- 
sonville, the other at Sink. The attendance was the best I have 
ever known on the part of the teachers, and the attendance of 
the public was never excelled. 
One interesting feature of these Normals was Directors’ Day, 
which was very liberally attended by our Directors. Much 
good was accomplished by the joint discussion, byt teachers and 
Directors, of educational subjects. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
Perry L. Harned, Superintendent. 
  
T herewith submit my tenth annual report. of the public schools 
of Montgomery County. : 
The term for the year ending on June 30, 1900, was the long- 
est average term the county has ever had—seven and one-fourth 
months. At the same time the average salary has been increased. 
ninety cents per month, 
There is no doubt but the grade of instruction is improving 
steadily, while the enrollment and daily attendance are better 
than ever before. There is much room for improvement along 
this line, however, and we need a live teacher in each com- 
munity who can awaken the people and arouse their dormant 
interest in their children. We do not believe the State should 
let one-half the children stay away from school and grow to 
ignorant manhood ; neither do we believe that teachers should 
be guilty of letting one-half the children who are enrolled leave 
school before they reach the third grade. J mean to say that a 
few of our schools are not up to the standard, and we cannot hope 
to bring them up until we have some legislation to back us in 
the necessary steps which we should take. 
We try to be cautious in opening the gate and letting only 
teachers of unquestioned morality and ability into the schools
-P-A-G-E-230
— 221 — 
of this county, and believe that we have as good a corps of teach- 
ers as any county in the State. Last year a few of our teachers 
taught two schools, for the reason that we had more schools than 
licensed teachers. We are determined to let the public funds 
corrode in the bank before incompetent teachers shall be per 
mitted to draw them out, and we expect to consider only the i in- 
terest-of the children in licensing the teachers. 
The Directors of the county very generously give the teachers 
one day (on full pay) to visit schools and compare their work 
with that of others, provided it is done during the first two 
months of the term. We believe that good results will come 
from it. 
The Directors of the county are permanently organized, with 
W. J. Powers, of Ringgold, and B. J. Corban, of Corbandale, 
Chairman and Secretary, respectively. The regular meetings 
are held on the first Saturday of July, October, and December. 
Through this organization we expect to bring about the greatest 
degree of uniformity possible. Our Directors are excellent men 
who are interested in the work of the public schools. I regret, 
however, that under our present system they change too often, 
and every two years about half of our number are new men to 
learn the business. 
Through your interest and kindness, we had a State Peabody 
Institute at Clarksville from June 11 to July 6 (a report of which 
has already been sent to your office), consequently there was no 
annual County Institute for white teachers. These, however, 
tneet monthly, on the second Saturday, and take a regular course 
of reading. The following are the subjects and instructors for 
the year ending on June 30, 1901: Psychology in Education, W. 
L. Lawrence; English, W. I. Harper; Algebra, J. G. Rollow; 
Arithmetic, Elliott. Buckner; History, Superintendent Harned. 
The County Superintendent is Chairman, and W. N. McKee, 
of Southside, is Secretary. There are about thirty white teach- 
ers doing excellent work in the Association. 
The County Superintendent was assisted by Prof. William 
Harrison, of Roger Williams University, during the annual In-
-P-A-G-E-231
— 222 — 
stitute for colored teachers, which continued two weeks. There: 
were fifty-eight enrolled, each of whom paid one dollar to defray 
the expense of the Institute and pay Professor Harrison for his: 
services. Much good was done in this Institute, and a similar 
one will be conducted next year. The colored teachers meet on 
the first Saturday in each month to discuss a regular programme. 
In addition to the public schools proper, we have two excel- 
lent. consolidated schools—the Southside Preparatory School, at 
Southside, and Montgomery Academy, at Sango. These schools 
do a very high grade of work and offer advantages to home peo- 
ple as well as to those of other counties. 
Our schoolhouses are well furnished and many of our teach- 
ers are drawing salaries of from forty to seventy-five dollars a 
month. 
In conelusion, we will give as a reason for a tardy report the 
burning of the County Superintendent’s reports and records at 
the time the magnificent courthouse of Montgomery County was 
burned, March 12. Everything in the two rooms occupied by 
the Superintendent was a total loss, and it has taken much tine 
to reproduce enough data to complete this report. However, by 
the first of January we expect to be fitted up again in well-fur- 
nished rooms, and will be at home to the people of the State 
interested in education. 
  
MOORE COUNTY. 
  
JE. M. Enochs, Superintendent. 
  
The Teachers’ Institute of Moore County convened during the 
last week in June, 1900. The Conductor, County Superintend- 
ent Enochs, was assisted by a. corps of efficient. teachers, mostly 
young ones, who were enthusiastic in the work. The work of 
the regular Instructors was supplemented by excellent papers, 
lectures, addresses, and recitations. Miss McLemore, of Mur-
-P-A-G-E-232
— 223 — 
freesboro, an excellent teacher in Primary Methods, was with 
us and gave valuable assistance in this work, by which all 
the teachers of the Institute were greatly benefited. Miss Me- 
Lemore was the only instructor employed. There were thirty 
teachers present, all of whom took an active part. Twenty-six 
certificates were issued. 
A movement was made by the teachers to have a monthly In- 
stitute in various parts of the county. Our schools are in good 
condition. 
MORGAN COUNTY. 
  
A.J. Albertson, Superintendent. 
  
The Morgan County Teachers’ Institute was in session at 
Wartburg from June 18 to June 29, 1900. It was conducted 
by the County Superintendent. 
OBION COUNTY. 
R. L. Bynum, Superintendent. 
  
Education is on an upward tendency in Obion County. The 
teachers are becoming more professional in their work, and many 
are holding the same schools for several terms in succession. 
The State Institute has had much to do with the educational 
advancement in this county, as many or most of our best teachers 
have received Honor Roll Certificates and are striving to put 
their Institute training into practical use. 
The State Institute this year was a decided success, and the 
wish of all is that the same men be sent to this place again next 
year. . 
We have our regular monthly Association meetings ten
-P-A-G-E-233
— 224 — 
months in the year and reach most of the teachers of the county. 
The Teachers’ Library is being built up gradually and bids fair 
to grow much this year. Obion County will soon be in the front 
rank of educational standing. 
OVERTON COUNTY. 
  
A. H. Roberts, Superintendent. 
  
During the scholastic year Hon. Elbert Kimes, County Super- 
intendent of Overton County, died. This had a tendency to 
injure the schools, as they were without a Superintendent for 
about three months. Mr. Kimes was one of the brightest Su- 
perintendents in the State, and had already done much to im- 
prove his county. 
The Teachers’ Institute was conducted by Dr. A. L. Peter- 
man and Prof. G. A. Kuykendall, both of whom are very fine 
teachers. The attendance was the best in the history of the 
county, ninety enrolling the first day. 
During the year a Teachers’ Library Association has been 
formed, with a good membership, which bids fair to accomplish 
much good. The teaching now being done in this county is 
much better than ever before. Our teachers are energetic and 
progressive. Teachers’ Institutes are held twice a month and 
are well attended by teachers and patrons. After this year our 
schools will run from three to six weeks longer. The outlook is 
bright for Overton County. 
PERRY COUNTY. 
J. R. Godwin, Superintendent. 
  
Our schools are doing fairly well. Our teachers are becoming 
more interested in their work, and the Directors are looking after 
the schools closer than heretofore.
-P-A-G-E-234
— 225 — 
Professor Davies, of the Dickson Normal College, was secured 
to conduct our Institute for us. We met at the appointed time, 
but, owing to the disastrous floods throughout the county, there 
were only eleven teachers present. Those present thought. best, 
under the circumstances, to adjourn till Friday, at which time 
I held the examination, assisted by Professors Beasley, Dudley, 
and Pearson. About 70 per cent of the teachers were present. 
PICKETT COUNTY. 
W. J. Chilton, Superintendent. 
One County Normal and two Institutes have thus. far been 
held for the present vear. With possibly one or two exceptions, 
the Ccunty Normal, which continued two weeks, was attended 
by every teacher in the county. Others not intending to teach 
this year, but hereafter, were also in attendance. The Insti- 
tutes were very well attended. 
Nearly all the schools have been visited, and, without a single 
exception, I found them doing well. Every teacher seems in- 
terested in his work. They do not, however, meet with much 
encouragement from the Directors, and with but little from 
many of the people. Some of the Directors and a great many 
of the people hang with stubborn tenacity to the old pioneer 
schools, with their primitive methods and old-time books. It 
seems well-nigh impossible to get them to fall in line with im- 
provement and modern methods and ideas, These are great 
hindrances to our schools. To remove them is a problem that 
shrewd work and genius alone can solve. 
The teachers of this county are, without an exception, in favor 
of a compulsory system of education within certain limits, and 
it is our intention to ask our Representatives in the General 
Assembly to give their support to such a measure as well as to 
other reforms looking to educational advancement. 
Outside of the exceptions stated, our scliools are in splendid 
condition.

POLK COUNTY. 
  
J. D, Clemmer, Superintendent. 
  
The fourteenth annual Institute of Polk County was con- 
ducted by A. B. Nicholson, who has been connected with Normal 
work for fifteen years, five years as Conductor. Leading teach- 
ers aided in the instruction. There were fifty-one teachers and 
applicants in attendance, two at the Cleveland State Institute, 
and three absent on account of sickness. Forty-cight certificates 
were issued at the close of the week’s work, and we have forty- 
three white schools, requiring about: forty-seven white teachers. 
No schools will be had at seven places in the.county on account 
of using all the funds in building houses and buving desks. In 
three years we have had, or will soon have, fourteen houses built, 
ten of which were on plans furnished by the County Superin- 
tendent. We have also had 578 desks constructed upon a plan 
approved by the County Superintendent. 
Our funds are fast increasing. Warrants are cashed upon 
presentation most of the year, though to bring about this condi- 
tion we have passed through two years of short terms. 
Our Normal continued five days, and we will have three In- 
stitutes during the term of school. Each Institute will he of 
two days’ duration. 
Our teachers have a Union, which holds sessions at the various 
Institutes. An effort will probably be made to establish a 
Teachers’ Library soon. 
The Institute was marked by good, solid discussions on meth- 
ods and management. A system of grading for the Primary 
schools was placed before the teachers, also a model daily pro- 
gramme for a school. Two excellent entertainments were given 
during the week. Miss Annie Matlock was Secretary, and J. 
E. Rollins was Critic. There were two Grading Committees— 
one composed exclusively of ladies, the first in our county’s his- 
tory.

PUTNAM COUNTY. 
H. D. Whitson, Superintendent. 
The schools of last year were better than for any period for 
many years. I am glad to be able to say that our Directors 
have manifested much interest in the improvement: of school- 
houses, and as a result we have but few poor schoolhouses in 
the county. 
Our Institute work of last year was the best we have ever had 
in the county. 
The State Institute was a grand success, and the State Su- 
perintendent is to be highly complimented for appointing the 
learned and businesslike Conductor, A. L. Peterman, an: the 
efficient Instructors, Dr. E. W. Kennedy, F. M. Bowling, and 
President W. N. Billingsley, for from their efforts we are now 
finding greater success among our teachers. 
Our financial condition is better than it has ever been, and we 
will have the longest terms of schools in this county we have ever 
had. 
RHEA COUNTY. 
  
W. E. Rogers, Superintendent. 
  
T take great pleasure in submitting for your consideration my 
second annual report of Institute work and the condition of edu- 
cation in Rhea County for the year 1899-1900. 
In April last our teachers decided to hold a three-weeks’ Nor- 
mal Institute, beginning on July 2 and closing on July 20, 1900. 
The building of the Tennessee Valley Institute, at Evensville, 
was selected as the place in which to hold the Normal, and the 
following were elected to conduct the work: County Superin- 
tendent W. E. Rogers, Conductor; J. D. Miller, S. A. Gortner,
-P-A-G-E-237
— 228 — 
J. H. Ellis, and Mrs. K. M. Benson, Instructors. Though all of 
the above are county teachers, they are college graduates, thor- 
ough scholars, experienced teachers, and have been successful in 
their respective schools. Immediately after the Instructors were 
elected, each one was assigned his work for the Normal by the 
Conductor, thus giving them about two months to make prepara- 
tion for their work. Circulars were printed announcing the 
Instructors, the courses of study, the expenses, and the require: 
ments for the examination. The announcements were sent to 
teachers, Directors, and others interested in education, so that 
no one need remain away from the Normal for reason of his not 
knowing it. 
On July 2 the Normal was called to order by the Conductor, 
and, after music and prayer, a complete organization was ef- 
fected for the work. Mr, A. N. Grice and Miss Iva Mover were 
elected Secretaries, and the Instructors formerly elected were 
appointed as a Committee on Programme of Work. The fol- 
lowing committees were appointed: Examination Committec, 
Reading Course Committee, Entertainment Committee, and 
Committee on Resolutions. The Committee on Programme re- 
ported and the actual work began. The two courses of study 
were taught in different rooms, an hour being given to each reci- 
tation. The theory and practice of teaching were combined. 
Though there were recitations each period, much time was given 
to the discussion of means and methods of education. The 
teachers were assembled together for special lectures, and one 
hour each day for the Reading Course, which was directed by 
th: Oonductor. The teachers were at liberty to select their 
studies, but all were required to pass on one of the courses of 
study. 
The teachers met. umder different circumstances froin those 
under which they met last year. A Normal Institute was ne 
longer an experiment to them; it was something real; it meant 
something. They realized that a Normal] was of great value to 
teachers. It had been announced at the beginning of the year 
that credit would be given teachers for their attendance at the
-P-A-G-E-238
— 229 — 
monthly meetings. This had resulted in a largely increased at- 
tehdance at these meetings and an awakened interest in Insti- 
tute work. When the Normal opened, every teacher was on 
hand to improve himself and do his duty in making: the work a 
success. That the teachers might be encouraged for their in- 
terest in the Normal, it was announced that eredit would be 
given in the first annual examination for the Normal work. 
Every teacher employed in the publie schools of the county, ex- 
cept three (who did not seeure their schools till after the Nor- 
mal), was in attendance from day to dav, doing all he could for 
the welfare of the work. 
Our public school teachers were not alone in their efforts. 
The private school teachers and many teachers from adjoining 
counties attended, giving strength and interest, to the good work 
by their presence and assistance. Though our teachers were 
given the privilege and encouragement to attend the State Nor- 
mal, not one left the County Normal. : 
Tn addition to the reeular work, addresses were delivered by 
Professors Lyle, Rutherford, Roark, Hovt, Gass, and Evens. 
representatives from schools and colleges of different parts of 
the State; also, an entertainment was given one evening of each 
week by the teachers, after which an hour or more was spent in 
a social manner. 
I would not be saying more than the teachers unanimously ex- 
pressed in their resolutions, should I say that the most harmo- 
nious and successful Teachers’ Normal ever held in Rhea 
County was held this year. Not only was the attendance of 
teachers the largest in the history of the county, but in every re- 
spect the Normal was a grand suecess. Its greatest. work is yet 
to be told in the educational progress of the county. 
* T cannot close this report without saying a few words concern- 
ing our monthly Institutes. At the close of the Normal the 
organization of the Institute for the ensuing year was effected, 
as follows: County Superintendent W. E. Rogers, President; 
J. 8. Ziegler, Vice President; Miss Lena Morgan, Secretary 
No. 1; R. D. Davis, Secretary No. 2. Instructors for the Read-
-P-A-G-E-239
— 230 — 
ing Course: S. A. Gortner, Method of Recitation; J. D. Miller. 
Pedagogy. The President and Secretaries were elected as a 
Programme Committee. . 
Our meetings are held on the third Saturday of each month. 
The meetings are held at different places in the county, as invita- 
tions are extended by the people. Many times several places 
extend an invitation for the same meeting. The decision is 
always left to the teachers who are present. Our people are 
taking considerable interest in these mectings, and never fail 
to give the teachers free entertainment. Most of our teachers 
are now attending these Institutes, which are proving very heln- 
ful to them, and are exercising a great influence in awakening 
the people in the interest. of education. As an evidence of the 
latter fact, the school fund for the county has been increased 25 
per cent during the last year. Our Reading Course forms a part 
of the programme for these meetings, and other subjects are 
selected by the Programme Committee from time to time. A 
county educational paper is sent to the teachers the first of each 
month, in which is printed a full report of the Institute for the 
past month and a programme for the current month. : 
In addition to these monthly meetings, we now have a County 
Educational Meeting annually, at which leading educators de- 
liver addresses to our people. Our Second Annual County Edu- 
cational Meeting was held on Saturday, November 3, 1900. 
The condition of education in Rhea County is certainly im- 
proving. The schools and teachers have taken on new life and 
are moving with greater progress than ever before. Our teach- 
ers, stirred with greater ambition and inspired with new hopes, 
have taken up their work with renewed “energy and are giving 
our county the best schools in its history. Harmony prevails; 
we are bound in a common interest for a common cause. Ove 
schools are on a good financial basis, better than ever before. 
We are not afraid of toil. We are yet willing to make. sacrifices 
for the welfare of humanity, and will make a success, whether 
or not we receive full pay. We hope that Rhea County will pass 
all the State averages for the next year and stand with the lead- 
ing counties of the State in educational work.

ROANE COUNTY. 
Ben, F. Brown, Superintendent. 
  
I wish to say in regard to the educational status of Roane 
County, it is on the upward tendency. The teachers of Roane 
County did reasonably good work last year. There were no jars 
nor division; everything worked smoothly, with less friction 
than during any previous year. There is a lack of interest on 
the part of the parents to send their children regularly. 
The County Institute this year was well attended. The In- 
stitute opened on July 9, 1900, and continued one week. The 
enrollment was seventy-four. I employed Profs. W. H. Taylor, 
E. B. Booth, G. R. Shields, and J. P. Griffith to assist me in the 
Institute work. These gentlemen gave the best of satisfaction 
as Instructors, and the teachers were all well pleased, and quite 
a numker expressed themselves as being well satisfied with the 
week’s work. JI expected to hold a two-week’s Normal, but I 
feared it might conflict with the State Normal. 
I feel that Roane County is keeping in line with other counties 
of the State in educational work. 
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
  
A. D, Breshear, Superintendent. 
  
Our annual Institute was held in the City School Building, in 
Springfield, beginning on June 19, 1900, and continuing two 
weeks. The Institute was conducted by that prince of Con- 
ductors, ex-State Superintendent 8. G. Gilbreath, ably assisted 
by Professor McNeeley, of the Orlinda Academy, and Professor 
Huey, City Superintendent, of Springfield. Eight days were 
spent in lectures and discussions, and two days were devoted to
-P-A-G-E-241
— 232 — 
examination. Nearly all the teachers attended regularly. Our 
enrollment reached one hundred and eleven, about. twenty-five 
more than ever attended before. In every exercise there were 
enthusiasm and interest. Our teachers are rapidly forging to 
the front; in fact, our Conductor announced that he thought 
they were the equal of any in the State—a very high compli- 
ment, coming from one so highly and favorably known as an edu- 
cator. Our teachers are reading school journals, studying Psy- 
chology and up-to-date methods in teaching. Many of them 
have been teaching the same schools for five or six years. We 
do not hold the Institute to prepare teachers for examination, 
but rather to train them along professional lines. The work 
done at the Institute was largely on Applied Psychology, Schoo! 
Management, and Pedagogy. This work was supplemented by 
daily lessons in the best methods of teaching the new text-books. 
The teachers were given certificates showing the number of 
days they were present: at the Institute. We had seventy-eight 
examined, and twenty-nine were examined on the first Friday 
and Saturday in August, with the results found in my annual 
report. 
Our Colored Institute was not so well attended, but. very effi- 
cient Conductors and earnest and enthusiastic teachers made it 
a success. 
We are glad to report progress and that the interest. in school 
work is general with our people. 
RUTHERFORD COUNTY. 
  
Miss Jeannette M. King, Superintendent. 
  
The fourteenth annual session of the Teachers’ Institute, con- 
ducted by J. C. Willis, of Lexington, Ky., was a pronounced 
success. Dr. Willis was assisted in the work of instruction by
-P-A-G-E-242
— 233 — 
Miss Mary P. Jones, recently of the Teachers’ College, New 
York. 
The interest manifested is evidenced by the full, regular at- 
tendance of county teachers, visiting teachers, and citizens. 
Though the annual fee was one dollar, the enrollment was larger 
than at any previous time. Business men left their shops and 
farms to hear Dr. Willis’ daily lectures on “ Educational Psy- 
chology,” etc. The opening of each session was awaited with 
eager anticipation. 
Never before was the work here so purely professional, and 
yet, withal, so pleasing, wholesome, beneficial, inspiring. The 
results for good will be far-reaching. One fact. is established be- 
yond question: the professional Institute is superior to that type 
whose aim is text-book review and instruction. 
During the coming year monthly meetings will be held, and a 
regular, prescribed course of study and reading will be pursued. 
The Institute for colored teachers was held from June 11 to 
June 16, 1900. This is recorded as the best Institute for col- 
ored teachers ever held in this county. The work was under 
the leadership of F. F. Carney, principal of the colored public 
school, Murfreesboro, assisted by an able corps of Instructors 
from the county teachers. 
Examinations for colored applicants, on June 14 and 15, 
showed marked improvement, in English, script, and subject- 
matter over those in 1899. Many are still unable to write Eng- 
lish correctly. The bimonthly Teachers’ Meetings are a means 
for advancement in text-book matter, and many of the older class 
of teachers are regular attendants. These drills are very help- 
‘ful, and within another year will result in a far better prepared 
elass of teachers for the colored schools. 
Upon close examination, I find the subject of Physiology poor- 
ly understood and taught by both white and colored teachers. I 
attribute much of this lack of knowledge to the texts formerly 
used. We propose to remedy this before 1901. 
Considering all things, Rutherford County is slowly ad- 
vancing educationally.

SCOTT COUNTY. . 
  
G. W. Cross, Superintendent. 
  
The schools of our county are in a very prosperous condition. 
They are in a far better condition this year than last year. Our 
schools were in debt last year, and consequently the school term 
was very short. This year our school term wil] average about 
five months. I went before the County Court at the January 
term and contended for enough school money te: run the schools 
five months. Asa result, our tax levy for this year is forty-five 
cents on the one hundred dollars, as against thirty cents for last 
year. Last year we had thirty-four school districts in the 
county. The schools had been divided and cut up till it was 
impossible to run five months without taxing the people too high. 
In July, 1899, I presented the matter to the County Court, and 
we now have only fourteen school districts, and the school dis- 
tricts are coextensive with the civil districts. We find that this 
system is much more satisfactory. This plan is founded on the 
State system, and we believe it is the duty of County Superin- 
tendents to see to it that their respective county systems fully 
harmonize with the State system. Our teachers are doing good 
work this year. They seem to be very enthusiastic. 
Our annual Normal was held at Huntsville, beginning on 
June 25, 1900, and continuing two weeks. The Institute was 
conducted by the County Superintendent, and was well attended 
by teachers and friends of education. Prof. R. M. Shipp was 
the principal Instructor, and he proved himself to be very effi- 
cient and well prepared in his line of work. 
Our county is divided into four divisions, and the teachers of 
each division have their own Teachers’ Meetings. According to 
this plan, there is a, Teachers’ Meeting somewhere in the county 
every Saturday in the month. | 
T feel warranted in saying that we are making progress, and 
the outlook for the future seems most promising. 
Let me add that I believe the time fully ripe for a compul- 
sory school law. When parents willfully keep their children
-P-A-G-E-244
— 235 — 
out of school because they do not like the teacher or because the 
teacher does not teach the old way, as they were taught, it is high 
time for the State to step in and give the child its rights. It - 
seems to me that the necessity for such a law is great. Such a 
law would be to the interest of the child and the Commonwealth 
SEQUATOHTE COUNTY. 
R. A. Stewart, Superintendent. 
  
In our Institute we emploved one Conductor—Dr. H. M. 
Evans, of the Fill City Normal. We had twenty-five teachers 
in attendance. Number of certificates issued, twenty. 
We held the Institute one week, with very great. profit to the 
teachers. The entire teacher body was vigorous and aggressive 
throughout the session. It was the common opinion of those 
who were in attendance that the time had been exceedingly well 
spent. 
At the close of the Institute we organized a Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, from which we anticipate good results. 
SEVIER COUNTY. 
John J. Massey, Superintendent. 
I submit herewith for your examination my fifth annual re- 
port. 
Under the present. system it is difficult to get full and correct 
reports from every district and every school, but. T have tried to 
make this report full and as nearly correct as possible. You 
will note that, in some respects, this is the hest report ever sent
-P-A-G-E-245
— 236 — 
up from Sevier County. There is a decided increase in the 
enrollment and per cent of attendance. I am glad to be able to 
report the general condition of our schools more favorable than 
they have been before. We are slowly, but surelv, advancing. 
The work in the schoolroom is more satisfactory, and I have 
licensed this year the best class of teachers we have ever had. 
Our teachers are reading eilucational journals and good books. 
Having no financial support. either from county or State, 
the exteht of our Institute work was limited to one week. TI 
secured some able assistance and made it one of the most success- 
ful Institutes ever held in the county. Among mv assistants 
were Miss Rose FE. Hadden, Prof. William Rogers, and Prof. S. 
H. Barnes. Many of our own county teachers did some excel- 
lent work. During the week about one hundred and forty teach- 
ers were present. 
SHELBY COUNTY. 
Mrs. Lyde P. Thomas, Superintendent. 
The Shelby County Teachers’ Institute, under the manage- 
ment of the County Superintendent, convened in Memphis, at 
the Higbee School, on September 3, and continued until Septem- 
ber 16, 1900. Daily sessions were held from 9 o’clock A.M. till 
1o’clock P.M. The lectures usually embraced a period of thirty 
minutes each, interspersed with music and elocution exercises. 
During the two-weeks’ session an aggregate of ninety lectures 
were given, and each was accentuated with practical illustrations 
and simplified methods. There were enrolled one hundred 
teachers. These teachers represented two thousand pupils and 
their educational interests. 
‘The majority of the teachers had experience in the school 
work, varying in periods of from two to ten years; nevertheless, 
thev evinced steady and persistent interest and devotion to the
-P-A-G-E-246
— 237 — 
daily exercises. ‘The methods presented in Reading, English 
Grammar, English Literature, Geography, Mathematics, Voice 
Culture, Physical Culture, Psychology in the Schoolroom, Or- 
ganization—Methods and Management—were new, simple, en- 
tertaining, and highly instructive. The teachers were assured 
of increased skill, power, and efficiency. 
Work in the Primary Department with model classes brought 
before the teachers the real school process, and these attested 
their own superiority. The pupils were in actual ‘presence, and 
they readily responded to the teacher’s skill and art in develop- 
ing their mental] activities. The “how” was made so plain and 
interesting and practical that no one could fail to understand 
and readily appropriate the method presented and illustrated. 
The departmental work, its specific scope and bearing, will 
be more fully understood by giving the course of Institute work 
and the names of subjects and teachers, which were as follows: 
“The Relation of Psychology to Teaching and Education,” 
“School Methods and Management,” “ Professional Ethics,” 
“ English,” “Arithmetic, Systematic and Proved, as exempli- 
fied in Practical Business Usages,” “Geography, and How to 
Teach It,” Prof. Junins Jordan, of the University of Arkansas; 
“ Voeal Music,” Miss Carrie Smith; “ Physi¢al Culture,’ Miss 
Galloway ; “Reading” and “ English Literature in Common 
Schools,” Miss Galloway; “ Freehand Drasving as an Essentiat 
Element in Primary Work,” Miss Maida Richardson; “ Pri- 
inary Work,” Miss Mary Herron. 
In each department. the presentment of the subject was of a 
practical cast, such as to give the teachers forms and methods 
calculated to facilitate their work in the schoolroom. Every 
lecture was exemplified by facts and illustrations showing not 
only how the subjects should be set before the pupil’s mind, but 
why the particular method used was desirable and praiseworthy. 
The educational value of all the subjects in th: school course 
were specifically set forth and practical demonstrations given’ 
to show the successful operations of certain systems. 
There were no unnecessary talks or disquisitions wpon the 
subject of education, no theoretical displays of the seience of
-P-A-G-E-247
— 288 — 
pedagogy, but simply the presentation of the principles of prac- 
tical school-teaching in such a. plain and simple manner that the 
pupils in the school grades for whom the subjects were being 
discussed could readily understand them. The successful work- 
ings of the Institute were noticeable in many features, but in 
none more so than in the fact that the minds of the pupils and 
visitors, as well as teachers, who were in attendance were in- 
terested in the exercises from dav to dav, and showed no signs 
of inattention from the beginning to the close of a two-weeks’ 
session. 
The presence of the State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, during the session (on Sep- 
tember 13) was a great encouragement to the Institute. His 
able speech, full of sound, practical wisdom, and his enthusiasm 
in the cause of education stirred the hearts of all present and 
infused vigor, earnestness, and high purposes. 
This Institute has not only been of educational value, but it 
has imbued the teachers with a most earnest and high-toned pro- 
fessional spirit. They return to their schools profoundly im- 
pressed with the dignity of their work and with minds well pre- 
pared and souls well attuned for more efficient attainments. 
SMITH COUNTY. 
  
W. EF. Wilkerson, Superintendent. 
  
The following is the report of Prof. J. G. Brown, Conductor 
of the Smith County Institute: 
Tn accordance with your appointment, I assisted the County 
Superintendent of Smith County in Institute work, beginning on 
June 18, 1900, and lasting one week. Much interest was mani- 
fested in the work and much good was accomplished The num- 
ber of teachers enrolled was eighty-five, and several visitors were 
constantly in attendance. All the various branches of the pub- 
lic school course were presented and discussed, with profit to tha 
entire body of teachers.

STEWART COUNTY. 
J. I. Allman, Superintendent. 
  
Education is taking rapid strides to the front in Stewart 
County. Teachers are manifesting an unusual interest and are 
rapidly raising the educational standard. Eighty per cent' of 
the county teachers attended State Institutes this year, and more 
than 60 per cent secured certificates. 
The County Institute began on. July 9, 1900, and lasted one 
week. County Superintendent Allman was assisted by Prof. 
G. K. Grant and Prof. G. D. Free. Those subjects were dis 
cussed which usually give teachers most trouble in teaching. 
The teachers have organized a monthly Teachers’ Meeting 
and are manifesting an unusual interest. 
The attendance. in the schools is improving. The greatest 
hindrances in the way cf schools are neighborhood wrangles, the 
result of which is the division of schools and school districts and 
shortening of the school term. We have not sufficient funds, 
but hope to increase in a short time. 
SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
  
J. HL. Seneker, Superintendent. 
  
Our educational affairs are in good shape and we are. steadily 
advancing. . 
Our last Institute was the most interesting, harmonious, and 
satisfactory held during my incumbeney as County Superin- 
tendent, and the attendance exceeded that at any former Insti- 
tute held in this county. The work done was chiefly along prac- 
tical lines. All were. given something to do, that they might 
“earn to do by doing.” [ was ably assisted by Prof. R. E. 
Wolfe, Prof. I. K. Shipley, and Miss Rachel Fain. In grant- 
ing certificates, I followed your instructions.
-P-A-G-E-249

As usual, we have many new recruits—young and inexpe- 
rienced boys and girls—to take the places of those who have 
stenved down. to other professions. Itinerancy on the part of 
most of our teachers is also a great bane to the best interests of 
our schools; but so it is everywhere. 
SUMNER COUNTY. 
W. F. Albright, Superintendent. 
  
T herewith submit my annual report. and it gives me pleasure 
to state that our schools are in a better condition and more im- 
proved than ever before. Our teachers are more interested in 
professional] training and are trying to make the work more thor- 
ough, . 
‘We held a two-weeks’ Normal Institute at Gallatin for our 
teachers, commencing on June 11, 1900, and continuing two 
weeks. Capt. C. S. Douglass, Superintendent. of the Gallatin 
City Schools, was our Conductor. He was assisted by Mrs. 8. A. 
Green, of the Nashville City Schools; Prof. R. W. Caldwell, of 
the Hendersonville High School; Prof. E. B. Wilson, of Tulla- 
tuskee Normal College; Prof. J. V. Chapman, of Portland 
Seminary; Prof. Z. K. Griffin, of Howard Female College; and 
Prof. A. C. Bigger, of the Gallatin Male Seminary. The total 
enrollment during the two weeks was one hundred and twenty- 
four, better than ever before in the history of Sumner County. 
We had one of the most, successful Institutes ever held in our 
county, and a great part of this was due to the tireless energy 
of our Conductor, Capt. C. 8. Douglass. 
This is the second year that Mrs. S. A. Green, of Nashville, 
has been with us, and our teachers certainly appreciated her 
work. 
Our examination was better and more rigid, cutting ont sev- 
era] incompetent. applicants. 
Our teachers are rapidly improving along all lines. They ar.
-P-A-G-E-250
— 241 — 
subscribing for school journals, studying up-to-date methods, 
and the advancement in many ways is quite perceptible. 
The colored teachers are doing good work. Many of them are 
college graduates, and they never miss a Teachers’ Institute. 
The State Superintendent spent a dav with us. We had a 
meeting of the Directors on that day. We Sumner Countians 
think we have the best and hardest-working State Superintend- 
ent in the history of school work in the State. Great interest 
was manifested on the part of the Directors, and plans for im- 
proving the county schools were discussed. 
Our teachers, both white and colored, are organized into Asso- 
ciations, which meet monthly in different portions of the county, 
or wherever, in our opinion, an educational revival is most 
needed. The programmes of these meetings arc so arranged as 
ta be interesting and instructive to both teachers and patrons. 
The interest in school affairs in this county is better now than 
it has ever been. TI visited all the schools of the county (some 
of them more than once), talked to the Directors and patrons, 
and urged them to take more interest in, their schools. Upon 
the whole, our work is progressing satisfactorily. Teachers, 
patrons, and Directors are interested, the children seem to have 
the spirit of progress, and all are trving to make our work better. 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
J. A. Cotten, Superintendent. 
  
The schools of this county have made more progress in. the 
last two years than during the eight years previous. The school 
tax has been raised during the ten years from ten cents to fifty 
cents. During the last two years the County Court raised the 
school tax from thirty cents to fifty cents, made the thirty-three 
school districts identical with the fifteen civil districts, and em- 
ployed all the time of the County Superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-251
— 242 — 
The present Boards of School Directors have built eleven con- 
venient and modern schoolhouses and established in the county 
twenty-seven permanent eight-month schools. In the last elec- 
tion only twelve out of forty-five old Directors were changed, 
which shows that the people generally have indorsed the work of 
their Directors. 
Our State and County Normal was a suecess. The instruc 
tion was first-class, and the work was well received by our teach- 
ers. We were in session twelve days, and there were present 
one hundred and twenty teachers. 
Our teachers regard Mr. T. A. Mitchell, of Milan, as one of 
your strongest men, and Miss Nellie O’Donnel]l as a most ex 
cellent Instructor in Primary work. 
TROUSDALE COUNTY. 
Intle Dalton, Superintendent. 
  
The schools in Trousdale County are all doing well, yet 
there is room for improvement, especially among the Directors. 
We still have a few Directors that believe in letting the schools 
out to the lowest bidders. 
Most of our teachers take educational journals and are inter- 
ested in their work. That our teachers are studying is shown 
by the examination, as there were few who failed this year, 
while last year more than onethird of the applicants failed to 
get certificates. 
On the whole, I think we have good reasons for congratu- 
lating ourselves upon the condition of the schools in Trousdale 
County. The attendance is better than ever before. There 
seems to be greater interest, both in the pupils and patrons.

UNICOT COUNTY. 
  
Mrs. Lizzie Roberts, Superintendent. 
  
Our Institute, held on June 27-29, 1900, is acknowledge ! by 
the public to have surpassed anything of the kind ever held in th« 
county. Indeed, it was said by some of the. instructors to excel 
in point of interest the State Normals they had been attending. 
The three nights were spent in literarv addresses and recitations. 
Miss Jessie E. Burleson, of Milligan College; Miss Ethel Ir- 
vine, of the University of Texas; Miss Ida Tilson and Prof. W. 
G. Guthrie, A.M., of Baileyton, were among those that rendered 
excellent recitations. Mr. A. K. Harrold, B.S., of Greeneville, 
gave an excellent address on “ Good Citizenship the Product of 
Education.” The music was equal to a musicale at every ses- 
_ sion. We had violin, mandolin, guitar, and organ music all 
combined. 
The principal Instrnetors of the Normal were: R. M. Barry, 
A.M., and Miss Jessie E. Burleson, B.S., of Milligan College, 
Miss Mamie Grant, A.M., and Miss Mattie Bullock, A.M., John- 
son City; Prof. W. G. Guthrie, A.M., Baileyton; Prof. J. T. 
Pope, A.M., D.D., and Mrs. J. T. Pope, A.M., Erwin; A. K. 
Harrold, B.S., Greeneville; R. W. H. Gilbert, Erwin; Prof. J. 
C. McEwen, Kittyton. Other teachers were also present and 
did excellent work for the Institute. 
About thirty teachers were present, and the interest in the 
community has never been so high. The courthouse was crowd- 
ed at the night exercises, and a large crowd attended all the day 
exercises. 
Twenty certificates were given. The applicants were all 
pleased, and it seemed “ the era of good feeling” throughout 
the Institute and community. 
I think the future prospects for onr county flattering.

VAN BUREN COUNTY. 
L. 8. Gillentine, Superintendent. 
  
Our annual Institute, held at Burritt College, Spencer, from 
May 21 to May 26,1900, was fairly well attended by the county 
teachers. Our teachers were mostly beginners, but they seemed 
alive to Institute work. 
Most of our old teachers have retired or have been replaced 
by younger teachers, and we hope to profit by the change. We 
have a: better qualified class of teachers and lock for more suc- 
cessful work. 
We have our monthly Institutes. Our best teachers attend, 
but we want to get the short-term teachers more interested. 
While our work, as a whole, has not been entirely successful. 
yet we have advanced, and, with a new County QOourt, new 
Directors, ete., we confidently expect our schools to show im- 
provement during the year. 
WARREN COUNTY. 
J. B. Clark, Superintendent. 
Our County Institute was held in June, 1900, and there were 
enrolled ninety-six teachers of our county and several from other 
counties. I do not think we have ever had a better County In-
-P-A-G-E-254
— 945 — 
stitute. The programme was prepared so as to bring before the 
teachers subjects of the greatest importance and interest: to them. 
While the schools of this county are not by any means what 
I desire them to be, I am truly glad to sav the outlook for the 
future is indeed hopeful. There has been a great improvement 
in the public schools in the last four years, and we now have bet- 
ter houses, better teachers, and more that is suited to stimulate 
thought and awaken inquiry than at any time in the history iof 
our schools. 
T have more to be proud of to-day than at any other time sinca 
T have been connected with the school interest. There are more 
text-books in the public schools of this county than ever before. 
The text-book law has been a source of interest. as well as har- 
“mony in our schools. 
Our annual report shows a large expense account. I wish to 
say, by way of explanation, that about four years ago the School 
Directors of this county issued, for schoo] desks, warrants on 
one, two, and three years’ credit, to the amount of $3,976.40. 
The paying of these outstanding warrants has caused about. one 
month’s shortage in our school term for the last. three years. 
We have bought but little school property since T have been offi- 
cially connected with the public schools. I forced the idea, 
“ Out of debt is out of danger,” on the minds of our Directors, 
until they have learned to guard the school fund, and now we are 
free from all debt. 
Our teachers meet monthly, and I note, in mv visits to the 
schools, that Institute work aids all teachers—helps them in 
plans of teaching, and, best of all, gives them a better spirit for 
the work. I am indeed hopeful. 
WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
S. W. Murray, Superintendent. 
  
Our County Institute met on July 23 and closed on August 1, 
1900. The Institute was conducted by the County Superin-
-P-A-G-E-255
— 246 — 
tendent, assisted by Prof. W. C. Blasingame, Prof. J. T. Pope. 
Prof. 8. A. Estes, Prof. E. L. Anderson, and others. There 
were one hundred and six teachers in attendance, the largest 
number in the history of Washington County. A large au- 
dience of patrons, Directors, and friends of education greeted 
the Institute day by day during the entire session., 
A better and more efficient, teaching force than we have in th 
other county of Washington will indeed be hard te find. At 
least nine-tenths of our teachers during the past year were read- 
ers of one or more good school journals. 
Certificates were issued to eighty-nine teachers at the close of 
the annual examination. This includes certificates issued on 
State Peabody Certificates. 
We feel indebted to Rev. Spencer Tunnell, of Harriman; 
Dr. David Sullins, of Cleveland; Judge Newton Hacker, of 
Jonesboro; E. M. Wright, of Tusculum, and others, for the in- 
structive addresses delivered during the session of our Institute. 
WAYNE COUNTY. 
S. D. Bromley, Superintendent. 
  
Our Institute was held at Waynesboro, beginning on June 
18, and closing on June 29, 1900. The Institute was con- 
ducted by S. D. Bromley, County Superintendent. The Tn- 
structors were Prof. R. L. MeDonnold, of Union Citv; Prof. 
W. Z. Stricklin, of Harriman; Prof. T. F. McAnally, of the 
Leatherwood High School; and Prof. Joe Sims, of the Pinhook 
High School. Professor McDonnold gave instruction in Arith- 
metic, Reading, School Management, and English Grammar; 
Professor McAnally, in, Physiology, Penmanship, and Orthogra- 
phy; Professor Sims, in Geography and United States History : 
Professor Stricklin, in History of Tennessee and miscellaneous 
work.
-P-A-G-E-256

The Institute was very interesting and instructive throughout 
the entire time, but the attendance was not so good as last. year, 
on account of high waters. Eighty teachers were enrolled. We 
licensed sixty-four Primary teachers and four First Grade Sec- 
ondary teachers. The teachers of this county usually take great 
interest in Institutes and Teachers’ Meetings. 
This county has been gradually improving in educational in- 
terest for the last three years. Last year the teachers organized 
themselves into a permanent organization whereby each teacher 
obligated himself to help defray the expenses of employing In- 
structors for the annual Institute, which has proven beyon: a 
doubi to be a success. 
WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
  
S. S. Featherston, Superintendent. 
  
The County Institute for white teachers was heli from July 
9 to July 21, 1900. Prof. B. F. Watson, of Greenfield, was 
the Conductor. Prof. Ed. Sharp, of Greenfield; Prof. A. J. 
Smith, of Gleason; Prof. Don. J. Milam, of Dukedom; and 
Prof. Homer L: Higgs, of Sharon, were the Instructors. 
We had some of the most noted educators to visit us and de- 
liver lectures. Tfon. Finis Garrett delivered a most. appropriate 
and interesting lecture on “ Civil Government: Its Origin and 
Purpose; ” Prof. E. L. Mendenhall, vice president of the Na- 
tional Normal University, Lebanon, O., gave a very short, but 
pointed talk on “ Temperance;” Prof. J. A. Baber, president 
of the Southern Normal University, delivered a most. timely and 
logical lecture on “ The Educational Spirit of the Nineteenth 
Century; ” Mrs. Dr. Alfred Holbrook, one of the best educated 
women in: the South, delivered a helpful lecture on “ Kinder- 
garten Work.” Chancellor Alfred Holbrook, of the Southern
-P-A-G-E-257
— 248 — 
Normal University, Huntingdon, the founder of independent 
Normalism, delivered.a most excellent and practical lecture on 
“ Common Sense.” 
Owing to continued heavy rains, and some of our teachers, 
especially young teachers, being sons and daughters of farmers, 
they were so delayed that we had in attendance only seventy 
teachers; but we had the hearty codperation of nearly every 
teacher in Weakley County, which was manifested by their pay- 
ing the dues voted by the Institute to defray expenses of the 
same. During our Institute lasting friendships were formed 
and much good was accomplished along the line of advanceing 
the educational labors and interests of our county. 
The County Institute for colored teachers was held ati Mar- 
tin from July 9 to July 14, 1900. Prof. A. L. Bailey, of 
Brownsville, was the Conductor, and E. P. Buren was In- 
structor. The Institute was a decided success, and splendid 
interest was manifested throughout. There were twenty col- 
ored teachers in attendance, and they organized an Association 
to meet monthly and discuss the interests of their schools from 
time to time, by which they are accomplishing great good for 
themselves and their race. 
It has been my practice to visit the meetings and Institutes of 
our colored teachers and encourage them in their work, and IT 
find them quite enthusiastic and energetic. 
WHITE COUNTY. 
. A. Camp, Superintendent. 
  
The thirteenth annual Summer Institute of White County 
was held at Sparta from July 9 to July 21, 1900. The work 
was done by our own teachers, and a keen interest was mani- 
fested throughout the entire meeting. 
Our Teachers’ Library Association received about thirty new
-P-A-G-E-258
249 
members. A Reading Course was marked out for next year. 
For Primary teachers the course embraces Parker’s Talks on 
Teaching, Emerson’s Essay on History, and History of Ten- 
nessee; for Secondary teachers, Parker’s Talks on Teaching, 
Emerson’s Essay on History, and Geology of Tennessee. It 
was provided that. all teachers who made an average of 90 per 
cent, and did not fall below 70 per cent on any subject in the 
examination this year, would be allowed to take examination. on 
the Reading Course instead of the regular course next: year. 
Eight Primary teachers and seven Secondary teachers made th: 
required grades. ‘Fifty-four applicants entered the examina- 
tion. Of this number, forty-six were licensed. 
WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
  
Fred. J. Page, Superintendent. 
The annual Institute for white teachers was conducted at the 
Publie School Building, in Franklin, during the week beginning 
on July 9, 1900. County Superintendent Page was the Con- 
ductor, and Miss Louise Blackburn was the Faculty Secretary. 
The following is the list of Instructors, with their subjects: 
J. C. Brooks, Theory and Practice and Civil Government; T. 
E. Clay, United States History and Arithmetic; N. B. Renick, 
Grammar and Rhetoric; A. R. Parkes, Tennessee History; 
E. 8. Jenkins, Physiology; H. L. Shannon, Geography; B. B. 
Roberts, Geology; T. I. Pettus, Agriculture; N. E. Morris, 
Algebra; Miss Almattie Jarmon, Geometry; Whit. Winstead, 
Physics; EH. R. Chest, Bookkeeping; Fred. J. Page, Talks on 
Language Work. 
The Instructors did very faithful work, and the teachers were 
very prompt and regular in attendance. Besides the usual] pro- 
gramme, practica] lectures on interesting topics were delivered
-P-A-G-E-259
. — 250 — 
by teachers of ability, and excellent music and recitations were 
furnished by local talent. Nearly every teacher in the county 
attended this Institute, and twelve of these also attended the 
State Institute at Clarksville. 
The Williamson County Teachers’ Association is in excellent 
working order, and is well officered. It meets monthly, and, 
instead of discussing topics at. random, it takes up topies con- 
secutively in the different branches of study and presents the 
best methods. of teaching them. The educational interests of 
the county are improving steadily. We now have a County Li- 
brary, and I am working up District Libraries. 
The Institute for the colored teachers of this county was con- 
ducted in a sepdrate building, but at the same time as the Insti- 
tute for the white teachers, and by the same Conductor and In- 
structors. I can see a marked improvement in. the scholarship 
and teaching ability of my colored teachers. Nearly every col- 
ored teacher hag his Theory and Practice and school journal, 
attends his Association mectings regularly, and puts in full 
time at the annual Institute. They prefer to have the same In- 
structors and the same examinations as the white teachers have. 
The number of teachers in attendance at the two Institutes 
was: White, 110; colored, 59. The number of certificates 
issued was: White Secondary, 23; white Primary, 69; colored 
Secondary, none; colored Primary, 43. 
WILSON COUNTY. 
F, M. Bowling, Superintendent. 
  
The progress made by the public schools of Wilson County for 
the scholastic year from July 1, 1899, to June 30, 1900, is grati- 
fying to the friends of popular education. The standard for 
teachers has been raised at least 25 per cent. This has made 
the schoolroom work much more efficient. The Teachers’ Meet-
-P-A-G-E-260
— 251 — 
ings and the regular Institutes have been attended by a larger 
number of teachers than ever before, manifesting great enthu- 
siasm and interest in better fitting themselves for their great 
and responsible work. , 
One hundred and forty-five teachers are emploved in the 
county. The Institute for white teachers enrolled one hundred 
and twenty-four, and the Institute for colored teachers enrolled 
fifty-six—total, 180—at their June mectings of eight days’ In- 
stitute work and three days’ examination. / 
The white teachers employed Prof. A. L. Peterman, of Cooke 
ville, as one of the Instructors. Prof. R. L. McDonnold, of 
Union City, was engaged throughout the entire work. Miss 
Della Stroud, of Nashville, was furnished by State Superin- 
tendent Fitzpatrick as one of the Instructors. Miss Fannie D. 
Carnifix, of Roanoke, Va., was with us two days, and demon- 
strated the use of her chart. With the aid of local help, this 
very able corps of Instructors conducted classes in both the 
Primary and Secondary Studies. A course in Vocal Musie 
was given by Prof. C. A. Oakley. Professors Peterman and 
MeDonnold gave profitable and entertaining lectures at night. 
Professor Johnson, of Columbia, and formerly professor of 
Pedagogy in Roger Williams University, was made Conductor 
of the Institute for colored teachers, and, with able local help, 
had an unusually profitable work for the colored teachers. 
The work in both Institutes was unusually able, interesting, 
and profitable. 
The change of text-books from their former chaotic condition 
to absolute uniformity has benefited the schools in at least three 
ways. The cost of text-books has been reduced from 80 to 40 
per cent to about 10,000 purchasers, amounting in the aggregate 
to 30,000 or 40,000 purchases. The new books are, as a whole, 
much better than the old. With a uniformity of books, it is now 
possible to grade the schools. 
A system of grading and a programme for Primary schools 
and Secondary schools have been. adopted by the teachers and 
prescribed by the Superintendent for use in the county. The 
grading is in successful operation.
-P-A-G-E-261
— 252 — 
The length of the school term has been increased 9.3 days. 
The pro rata per pupil will be about fifty or sixty cents more 
next year, and it is expected that the school term will thus be 
lengthened twenty days, or even more. _ 
Our Directors are wanting better teachers, and many of the 
teachers are making preparation by better training in better 
schools. 
The county has been thoroughly organized for meetings of 
patrons, teachers, and friends every Saturday during the school 
terms in different sections of the county. These meetings have 
done much to arouse the people in favor of public education. 
The outlook in Wilson County is hopeful.

REPORTS FROM STATE 
INSTITUTIONS. 
PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE. 
  
Sir: I have the honor to submit my report as President of the 
Peabody Normal College for the year ending June 30, 1900. 
The table attached hereto will show that the attendance (602) 
was practically the same as for the preceding year. There is 
much reason, however, to believe that the number would have 
been larger, but for the prevalence of smallpox in many parts of 
the city for some months during the winter. One case which 
oceurred in Lindsley Hall on January 8, just prior to the be- 
ginning of the second semester, when many students usually 
enter the College, caused much uneasiness and some students 
went home; but practically all submitted promptly and. cheer- 
fully to vaccination, and there were no other cases. 
The Peabody Board has maintained for the State a scholar- 
ship for each Senatorial District (thirty-three in all), the holder 
of which receives one hundred dollars per school year and trans- 
portation to Nashville and return. The Board has, in addition, 
given five hundred dollars for the Library, five hundred dollars 
for apparatus for the Departments of Chemistry and of Physics, 
and has authorized the painting for the College of a portrait of 
Dr. Sears, the first General Agent of the Board. 
During the year a committee from the Peabody Board, con- 
sisting of Rt. Rev. H. B. Whipple, of Minnesota; Hon. W. C. 
Courtenay, of South Carolina; Hon. J. L. M. Curry, of Vir- 
ginia, General Agent of the Board; and Hon. James D. Porter, 
of Tennessee, spent several days in Nashville, and warmly com- 
mended the work of the College. 
The Trustees of the University of Nashville continue to the 
College the use of their valuable grounds and buildings, and 
from their income maintain the chair of Modern Languages, and 
provide for the insurance of, and make some improvements on, 
/
-P-A-G-E-267
— 256 — 
the property. They have completed the stone fence inclosing 
the campus and built a large coal cellar for the Winthrop Model 
School. The total cost of tha fence has been nearly eight thou- 
sand dollars. 
Much work has been done on the College buildings during the 
vacation. All the metal roofs and nearly all exposed wood-work 
have been painted, and the interiors have been painted and re 
paired. A large room has been prepared for the Department of 
Physics, and conveniently fitted with closets and lockers for 
apparatus. The want of a room for this purpose has long been 
a sérious inconvenience. 
The work above referred to has been done almost entirely by 
the regular employees of the College, so that only the materials 
used had to be provided. 
Steps have been taken during the year to give general circula- 
tion to information relating to the objects and methods of the 
College. With this view a pamphlet intended to cover this 
ground has been largely distributed, principally in the State, to 
State and County Institutes, to County Superintendents and 
School Directots, in addition to the regular catalogue. 
An informal Bureau of Information has been created in, the 
College to establish communication between. heads of institu- 
tions of learning, school boards, and others who have the selec- 
tion of teachers, and graduates of the College who are seeking 
positions. This is, of course, done without charge to either 
party. It is meeting with some success, and promises, when 
better understood, to be useful in extending the influence of the 
College,.and valuable in providing the educational institutions 
of the country with competent teachers. 
As an evidence of the interest in education felt by our gradu- 
ates, it was stated by the News and Courier, of Charleston, S. 
C., in its report of the proceedings of the National Educational 
Association, held there in July of this year, that the Peabody 
Normal College had more of its students and alumni in attend- 
ance than any other institution in America. 
Efficiency and harmony have characterized every department 
of the College during the past year.
-P-A-G-E-268
— 257 — 
Too much praise cannot be given to the instructors for the 
fidelity with which they have discharged their duties, nor to the 
students for their exemplary deportment and zealous work. 
The College has been fortunate in the cordial codperation. of 
the three boards to whom its management is intrusted, and has 
been honored by visits from the members of the Peabody Board, 
already mentioned ; from members of the two local boards, the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the Governor 
of the State. 
The table attached will show the attendance of the College 
since its organization. The number of students from Tennessee 
for the year was three hundred and two; and of one hundred 
and sixty-six diplomas issued, sixty-six were to. students from 
this State. While the number of Tennessee scholarships regu- 
larly maintained by the Peabody Board is thirty-three, four 
others of equal value were supported the past year by the Col- 
lege. It was hoped that the incidental fund could bear this bur- 
den, but it may be found necessary to discontinue these scholar- 
ships when the terms of the present holders expire, as this fund is 
largely called on to supplement salaries and pay contingent ex- 
‘penses. 
Those holding scholarships for Tennessee were: Lucy Cather- 
ine Bailey, James Tipton Beeler, Edna Grace Beene, Lou Biles, 
Robert Norman Buchanan, Myra Louise Butler, Sara Williams 
Childress, Davis Albert Clark, Sara Belle Conyers, Jesse Max- 
well Corum, Jr., Samuel Richard Cummins, Samuel Johnson 
Davis, Ernest Bunyan Ellis, Lela May Fitts, Lura Barham Gal- 
braith, Joseph Franklin Gross, Augusta Thekla Hasslock, Jo- 
seph Bedford Hix, John Alexander Jackson, Katharine Nelson 
Lea, Sarah Zanie Lewis, Corrie Lynn, Cornelia Childress Mar- 
tin, Eustus Cosmo Mason, Bessie Moore, Birdie Lee McGrath, 
William Monroe McLaurine, Robert Wade Oglesby, Lillie 
Painter, Alice Parr, James Absalom Roberts, Montague S. Ross, 
Robert Harris Scobey, George Robert Shields, Frances Minerva 
Smith, John Hunter Workman, Minnie Elizabeth Yearwood.

It may be of interest to add that each of our students is asked 
at matriculation to state the oceupation of his father, and that 
in many instances, where the father is dead or retired from 
active occupation, etc., this question is not answered; but the 
replies given in four hundred and forty-two cases show the fol- 
lowing approximate percentage: Farmers, .46; merchants, .17;

President. 
UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
Sir: I herewith submit my annual report as Chancellor of 
the University of Nashville for the year ending May 30, 1900. 
This institution owes its origin to a commendable desire on 
the part of the settlers of Middle Tennessee to educate their chil- 
dren, which took practical shape when the town of Nashville was 
less than half a dozen years old, and eleven. years before the 
admission of Tennessee as a State. 
The Legislature of North Carolina granted a charter in 1785, 
incorporating Davidson Academy, and giving to it a body of 
land, on. which a large part of the city of Nashville now stands, 
and of which nothing now remains to its successor; the Univer- 
sity of Nashville, except the old Medical College lot, the grounds 
and buildings oceupied by the Peabody Normal College and the 
Montgomery Bell Academy, and a limited amount of personal 
property. 
Even at this early day Davidson. Academy was able to secure 
as its head a young man of thorough education and decided 
ability in the person of Rev. Thomas Craighead, a graduate of 
the College of New Jersey. 
It is easy to understand that the support given the Academy
-P-A-G-E-271
— 260 — 
was meager and irregular, when for fully nine years after its 
establishment the whole country was subject to frequent Indian 
depredation ; but even as early as 1795 the course of study was 
much above that. in, general use in village schools at the time, as 
is evidenced by a list of text-books belonging to the Academy in 
the possession of the Tennessee Historical Society, and which 
includes such works as Sallust, Ovid, Xenophon, Virgil, Fergu- 
son’s Astronomy, Hutton’s Logarithms, ete. 
In 1800 the General Assembly of Tennessee passed an Act 
incorporating Cumberland College and giving to it all the privi- 
leges and property theretofore held by Davidson Academy, Mr. 
Craighead becoming its President and remaining so until 1809, 
when he was succeeded by Dr. James Priestly. 
The College experienced the vicissitudes usual to institutions 
of learning without endowment and situated in thinly settled 
communities. In 1824 Dr. Philip Lindsley was induced ta re- 
sign the vice presidency and decline the presidency of Prince- 
ton to take charge of the fortunes of Cumberland College. His 
ripe scholarship and his ambition to found an institution which 
would exert a controlling influence on the whole Southwest were 
productive of great benefit to the College and to the interests of 
education. 
By an Act of the Legislature, November 27, 1826, Cumber- 
land College became the University of Nashville and entered 
upon the broader career, which was guided for twenty-five years 
by Philip Lindsley. 
In 1855 the office of Chancellor was created, and Dr. J. Ber- 
rien Lindsley served in this capacity until 1870, when Gen. E. 
Kirby Smith was made Chancellor. 
In 1855 the Literary Department of the College was organ- 
ized as a military school, and so continued, under Gen. Bushrod. 
R. Johnson, until interrupted by the war in 1861. 
After the war the Military School was resumed and continued 
in operation until 1875, when the Literary Department became 
the Tennessee State Normal College, and subsequently the Pea- 
body Normal College. While the Medical College was success- 
fully established in 1850, and law schools and other schools have
-P-A-G-E-272
— 261 — 
from time to time been contemplated, and even their Faculties 
organized, it was not until a period later than this date that. the 
institution began. to earn and justly wear the name “ univer- 
sity.” 
The University as now organized consists of five departments, 
as follows: 
1. The Peabody Normal College, which is the Literary De- 
partment. 
2. The College of Medicine. 
3. The College of Music. 
4. The Montgomery Bell Academy. 
5. The Winthrop Model School. 
(1) The Peabody Normal College closed, on May 30, 1900, 
its twenty-fifth year, which was the most satisfactory in its his- 
tory. 
It is maintained jointly by the State of Tennessee, the Pea- 
body Board of Trust, and the Board of Trustees of the Univer- 
sity, and is especially designed for the education and training of 
teachers. The Peabody Board supported the past year two hun- 
dred scholarships, divided among the Southern States, and given 
to persons who propose to make teaching their vocation. 
There are twenty-cight officers of instruction and government, 
and the enrollment the past year was six hundred and two. An 
extended report of this department has been rendered separate- 
ly,which, with the Secretary’s financial report, is referred to for 
more specitic information. 
(2) The Medical Department was opened on October 11,- 
1850, with a Faculty of seven professors. It, filled a hiatus in 
professional instruction in the South, and immediately became 
popular, and was well sustained. 
In point of age, it is, with two exceptions, the oldest Southern 
medical college. Its work was interrupted by the war, but 
otherwise it has been in successful operation since its organiza- 
tion, and has upon its rolls the names of more than four thou-
-P-A-G-E-273
~~ 262 — 
sand alumni. The building it occupies, erected in 1895, was 
specially designed for medical and surgical instruetion, and is 
thoroughly adapted and equipped for its purposes. 
The Faculty consists of twelve professors and thirteen assist- 
ants. Four years of study are now reqnired before the degree 
of Doctor of Medicine is granted. The enrollment: for the past 
year was two hundred and ten, and eighty-three diplomas were 
given. 
(3) The College of Music, with the end of the present term, 
closed its eighth year. The attendance of students was onc hun- 
dred and ninety. Of this number, a large class devoted their 
time to the Teachers’ Training Class. Ten of these received 
Teachers’ Certificates and are well prepared to teach music. 
The Faculty of the College consists of fourteen members, and, 
in addition to the Teachers’ Training Class, gives instructions 
in all branches of instrumental and vocal music. This depart- 
ment of the College is doing a valuable work in. elevating the 
standard of musical attainment and in supplying thoroughly 
trained teachers of music. 
The Musical Directors for the coming year are Prof. Ivo C. 
Miller, Violinist, and Prof. C. J. Schubert, Pianist. 
(4) The Montgomery Bell Academy is the Academic Depart- 
ment. of the University, and was founded through the benefi- 
cence of a pioneer iron master of Tennessee, for whom it was 
named. 
He devised a sum of money to the Trustees of the University 
for the establishment and maintenance of the school, and pro- 
vided that gratuitous instruction should he given there to twenty- 
five boys hetween ten and fourteen years of age, who are mable 
to support, and educate themselves, and whose parents are wn- 
able to support. and edueate them. 
Mr. Bell died not long before the War of 1861-65, and the 
Trustees of the University were unable until 1867 to establish 
the Academy. The fund devised by him had by that time been
-P-A-G-E-274
— 263 — 
materially increased; the Trustees, from the resources of the 
University, erected a suitable building; and the school has ever 
since been on so successful a footing that in all more than seven- 
teen hundred boys have received instruction there. Jt had the 
past year eighty-nine pupils, and has’a staff of six experienced 
teachers. 
The Academy is divided into a Grammar School, with a three- 
years’ course of study, and a High School, with a four-years’ 
course. The High School is again divided into Classical, Scien- 
tific, and English Courses. Particular attention is given to 
Elocution and to Form Study and Drawing. 
The Academy has a good library, good philosophical and 
chemical apparatus, and large grounds. 
(5) The Winthrop Model School was founded in 1890 as an 
observation school for the students of the Peabody Normal Col- 
lege, which is still its chief function. It occupies a building on 
the College campus, which was erected for the purpose by the 
Peabody Board of Trust, at a cost of about, seventeen. thousand 
dollars, and was named for the President of that Board. By a 
slow, yet steady, development, the School takes a child at six 
years of age, and, by means of its training through eleven grades, 
fits him for the College, enabling him to’secure both preparatory 
and collegiate education within the limits of the campus. The 
School is also useful in aiding students who are prepared for 
college in a majority of branches, but are deficient in one or 
more studies. 
Since the addition of the eleventh grade three years ago, the 
School has graduated from its High School Department ninety 
pupils, the greater number of whom have entered the College. 
It had the past year an attendance of two hundred and seventy- 
eight pupils, under the care of seven teachers. 
The Degree of Bachelor of Arts was conferred upon twenty- 
five persons ; the Degree of Painting, one; the Degree of Letters, 
two; the Degree of Science, three; the Degree of Master of Arts, 
two.

UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
Sir: The education of the people must be discussed under 
two great heads: First, that which educates and develops the 
man, commonly called the “ liberal education; ” and, secondly, 
that. which specially fits the citizen to fulfill those duties which 
the law of the division of labor imposes upon each one of us as 
his contribution to the welfare of all. This last we commonly 
call the “technical education.” It is based upon the scientific 
education, which must, therefore, be considered in the same con- 
nection. No part of this training may be neglected if we would 
prepare the individual or the nation for success in life. The one 
makes the man complete and strong; the other teaches him how 
to use the powers thus developed for the good of society. Mod- 
ern academicians are too apt, in their zeal for the liberal, to lose 
sight of the scientific and the technical education. Some of the 
greatest ancient philosophers, notably Plato and Aristotle, have, 
however, given us the clearest teachings on technical education.
-P-A-G-E-276
— 265 — 
Milton, a great classical scholar, in his too little studied “ Trac- 
tate on Education,” describes the “complete and perfect” educa- 
tion as the one that will train every youth to discharge “ justly, 
skillfully, magnanimously all the offices, both public and private, 
of peace and war.” So taught, also, Comenius, Descartes, and 
Bacon. The writer’s education should fit him for work. 
Through the liberal education we aim to make a man—not for 
his pleasure or for the admiration of his fellows, but, as Paui 
says, “perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good work.” 
The object of education is service, and for service the man needs 
not merely to be perfectly and completely developed in every 
part of his nature, but also thoroughly furnished and equipped, 
both with tools and with the skill to use them. Therefore man 
yaust in some way get the scientific and the technical education 
as well as the liberal education. The one is just as important 
for actual suecess as the other. The liberal training may be the 
more beneficial to the individual, but technical training is very 
Lecessary for the people as a whole. 
Education increases the wealth-producing power of a people. 
Even the common schoo] education increases the productivity of 
the citizen very greatly. It has been shown by statistics, over 
and over again, that where the public schools are the best, there 
the earning capacity of the citizen is greatest. Secretary Hill, 
of the Massachusetts State Board of Education, has shown that 
the power of the people of the different States to earn money is 
proportional to the public school term in those States. The aver- 
age school period for inhabitants of the United States, as a whole, 
was, in 1897, 4.3 years; the average school period for Massaclh:u- 
setts was 7 years. The proportion between the school period in 
Massachusetts and the school period in the whole United States 
is expressed by the figures 70 to 43; the proportion. between 
the productive capacity of each person in Massachusetts and that 
of each person in the whole United States is as 66 to 37. Think 
ot this: 
Public education, as 70 to 43. 
Production of wealth, as 66 to 37. 
This is not a mere coincidence. It is not. true of Massachu-
-P-A-G-E-277
— 266 — 
setts and the United States alone; it is the law throughout the 
world. The productivity of a people is everywhere proportional 
to their education. 
Lf the people of Tennessee and the South would compete with 
the people of the rest of the world in production (and they must. 
do so, whether they will or not), they must educate all their peo- 
ple well—not merely their white people, but their negroes; and 
all these must be educated not poorly for a few months in the 
year or a few years in their lives, but thoroughly through a se- 
ries of years. Many seem to think that our vast resources and 
the marvelous energy and common sense of our people are a suf- 
ficient guarantee of our future success. Our broad, rich conti- 
nent will be useless for the purposes of civilzation and our 
brave, good people cannot save their country from destruction 
without education. Our boasted common sense and our unmeas- 
ured encrgy cannot save it without education. Our people must 
have knowledge, training, and character, or they will fail; in 
other words, they must be educated for intelligent and devoted 
citizenship. 
The power of education in production may be presented in 
this concrete way: Massachusetts expended $13,600,000 for 
her public schools in 1897-98. She enrolled 456,000 pupils, 
had an average daily attendance of 349,000, and taught them an 
average of 186 days. On the basis of a population of 2,805,346, 
working 306 days in the year, every citizen of Massachusetts— 
man, woman, and infant—is credited with the productive capac- 
ity of $90 a year more than the average of the people of the 
United States as a whole. This means that the excess of the 
productive capacity of the people in Massachusetts in that year 
was 280,000,000, or over twenty times the cost of maintaining 
the publie schools. Is not public education a good investment? 
What else pays like this? Tennessee expended $1,600,000 in 
1897-98 for her publie schools, in which were enrolled 481,000 
pupils, with an average daily attendance of 338,000. The aver- 
age number of days that they were taught was only 90. She 
gives her average citizen less than three years of schooling in his 
entire life, counting 200 days of schooling to a year. Massachu-
-P-A-G-E-278
— 267 — 
setts, in other words, spent $12,000,000 more than Tennessee for 
educating about the same uumber of children, and gave them 
twice as many days’ schooling in the year, extending over seven 
vears of their lives. 
It is believed that, at the lower rate of living and other ex- 
peuses in J'ennessee, we could, with $4,000,000 a year, bring 
our average number of school days up to that of Massachusetts 
and educate our children for as many years as she does. 
“But,” says the taxpayer, “ I cannot stand to have my school 
taxes more than doubled in this way.” 
Without appealing to your love of your children, let us see 
whether you can afford it or not as a business proposition. Sup- 
pose that by expending $4,000,000 a year—less than one-third 
of what Massachusetts expends—we could in ten years even in- 
crease the productive capacity of all our citizens just 10 cents a 
day, or one-third of Massachusetts’ excess over all the country, 
to what would this amount? The population of Tennessee by 
the last census is 2,022,723. Tf all these people worked for 306 
days in the year, this would incan a gain for the State of $61,- 
895,323 a year. If our people in twenty years came to earn 
only as much as the people of Massachusetts did in 1897-98— 
that is, 25 cents a day more than the average person of this coun- 
try—they would be better off by $179,496,436 at the end of 
each year. With better natural resources of every kind, with a 
better climate, and with a people of at least as good character 
and intellect as those of Massachusetts, there is no good reason 
why they should not do this. When will we realize that our best 
resources are our own children? This is a sordid view to take of 
public education, but this is an argument that needs to be con- 
sidered. 
A complete system of technical schools comprehends the fol- 
lowing parts: 
1. A system of trade schools, in which very narrow special 
training is given pupils preparing to enter the leading arts. 
2. Polytechnic schools, in which instruction in the applied 
sciences and technical or professional training are offered more 
advanced students. /
-P-A-G-E-279
— 268 — 
3. Institutes of technology or departments of science in uni- 
versities, in which the highest professional instruction in the ap- 
plied sciences is provided for those who have secured the founda- 
tion of the liberal education. 
We need all of these, if we are to develop our resources and 
keep pace with the progress of the day; but how shall we get 
them? The first requirement is trained experts who can build 
them and scientific and technical teachers who can give the in- 
struction. We cannot import all the experts who are to build 
and teach in these schools. Our only chance is to‘ educate them 
at home. This must be the work of our colleges and universi- 
ties. It is evident that the people of the South are very poorly 
organized and equipped to do this. What are the difficulties? 
As I see them, after a study of the situation, the difficulties are, 
chiefly: A want of appreciation of the importance of scientific 
and technical instruction; ignorance among college trustees and 
managers of the methods and requirements of scientific and tech- 
nical work; indifference-——and, in. some cases, prejudice and posi- 
tive opposition—of classical scholars to scientific studies; but, 
chiefly, the want of means with which to properly equip the sci- 
entific and engineering laboratories and machine shops required 
to give this instruction. 
There is no difficulty in accounting for our early indifference 
to science and technology. It was in accordance with the his- 
tory and science the world over and with the laws of its develop- 
ment in all countries. Up to fifty years ago we had all the 
scienca that we could use. We were engaged in getting: out 
raw material, in “skinning” the soil of its fertility, in eut- 
ting down our forests, and in working a few surface mines of 
mineral wealth. England, Germany, and France supplied us 
at first with our science, and England or New England with all 
our technical experts. 
A young people always view their raw material as their chief 
source of wealth, but they are often too ready to barter it for a 
mere mess of pottage. When they become older, they discover 
that it is not upon this alone, but upon the culture of the scien- 
tific intellect, that permanent prosperiy depends. England was
-P-A-G-E-280
— 269 — 
not a manufacturing nation until the Elizabethan age. Though 
coal, iron, and wood were found in abundance in the reign of 
the Plantagenets, they produced little prosperity. Their home- 
grown wool was sent to Flanders to be manufactured and turned 
into cloth. Spain, which had fallen heir to Arabian science, was 
the greatest manufacturing country of those days. When the 
Moors were banished and the political crimes of Spain led to its 
destruction as a nation, England took its position,as the leading 
industrial nation of the world. The invasion of the low coun- 
tries by Philip I]. drove the Flemish manufacturers, as the 
French persecution drove the Huguenots, to England; and they 
introduced the industries of cotton, wool, and silk in that coun- 
try. In none of these countries was science a subject of study 
at this time. The acquisition of wealth must precede the culti- 
vation of science. Technical skill is needed to utilize the raw 
material to the best advantage. The time comes, however, in 
the history of every nation when it must educate its people in 
science and train them in manufactures and industries, or it will 
go down. ‘This higher scientific education is the forerunner of 
higher prosperity, and the nation which fails to develop the in- 
tellectual faculty for production must degenerate, for it cannot 
stand still. 
In society, as in biology, there are three states. In the first, 
the state of primal equilibrium, things grow neither better nor 
worse; the second is the state of evolution, or development, dur- 
ing which animals and plants adapt themselves to their environ- 
ments and take on new characteristics; the third is that of de 
generation, when. they first stand still, then decay, and so go 
back to the earth from which they sprang. The same is true of. 
nations. A nation may remain in equilibrium for a brief time 
in the early stage of its history, but it is impossible to hold its 
forces in balance when its environment is constantly changing. 
To stand still, then, is to die. ‘The life of a people, industrially, 
is science. We must feed its fountains and keep them pure, or 
growth will cease, industry will fall, and the nation will die. 
Our Southland stands at the beginning of the second state. We 
have lived as long as we can upon the bounties of nature, and
-P-A-G-E-281
— 270 — 
have reached that point at. which we must study science, learn 
the arts, use our material resources, and accumulate wealth, or 
else fall behind and go down. 
If scientific and technical education must be provided for in 
our educational system, the practical question is: Shall we make 
the schools of science and technology a part of our universities 
or establish them as separate institutions? You will all agree, 
of course, that the university is not the place in which a man 
‘ should be taught what is commonly called a “trade,” but the 
university is the place to train the student of science and the ex- 
pert in industry. The study of science and the application of 
science always have gone, and always must go, hand in hand. 
As a matter of fact, discoverers and appliers of science are often 
combined in the same person. ‘he interests of pure science and 
of technology are largely identical, and science cannot take a 
step forward without opening new fields for industry. New 
truth in science always leads to new developments in industry. 
Tlence we must have the inventor as well as the investigator. 
So, on the other hand, every advance of industry facilitates the 
experimental investigation upon which the growth of pure sci- 
ence depends. ‘Reeall, for example, how the glass industry has 
promoted the progress of chemistry and how the electric indus- 
try hag in our own time aided physics and mechanical engineer- 
ing. Pure science and technology cannot be separated. If 
there is any difference, the history of technical development is 
the older of the two. Civilization began with man as a tool- 
making animal. It has grown with man as a machine-making 
being. It is not the classics or philosophy that alone makes peo- 
ple strong, else India might have been the ruling nation of the 
world and England its province, instead of the reverse. THis- 
torically, technical progress did not follow the growth of science, 
but preceded it. Mining developed geology; fisheries led to 
biology. If civilization owes so much to technical knowledge, 
why, then, does not that knowledge form a part of our higher 
education? It should, and must, if we would keep step with 
the progress of the world. 
We are frequently told that the Europeans have decided in fa-
-P-A-G-E-282
— 71 — 
vor of the separate organization of schools of science and tech- 
nology. In the minds of some this should be final. I-beg you 
to remember, however, that their universities were organized 
under a very different plan from ours. Most of the continental 
universities had been crystallized in methods long before tech- 
nical education was ever thought of. We know how long it was 
before the English universities established any schools of sci- 
ence and how difficult it has been for the German universities 
to take on technical studies, but now they have both established 
schools of pure and applied science. We must remember also 
that the social conditions are very different, and thus the rela- 
tions between men of different callings are much sharper in En- 
gland and. Europe than here. Jt is very doubtful whether tech- 
nical studies would make any progress in England or Germany, 
or even in France, against the caste prejudice. Conditions are 
so different with them that we should not take their experience 
as our guide in this matter. As a matter of fact, while old uni- 
versities, like Harvard and Yale, built upon European models, 
have been slow to establish such departments, younger American 
universities, like Cornell, Michigan, and Wisconsin, have found 
no serious difficulty in establishing science and technology side 
by side in their institutions. he union of science and technol- 
ogy with classics and literature seems to be the typically Amer- 
Not Yale or Harvard or Princeton is the typically 
American university, but Cornell, Michigan, Wisconsin, and 
Stanford. 
Southern scholars have a profound respect for the opinions 
of that wonderful scholar and soldier, Robert Edward Lee, but 
even among us his educational teachings are not as well known as 
they should be. Ceneral Lee was a great believer in scientific 
and technical education. Prof. Edward 8S. Joynes, who was a 
member of General Lee’s faculty at Washington College, writes: 
“ General Lee’s plans for the development of Washington Col- 
lege were not simply progressive; they were distinct and definite. 
He aimed to make this college represent at once the wants and 
the genius of the country. We fully realized the needs of the 
present age, and he desired to adapt the education of the people   
ican plan.
-P-A-G-E-283
—272— - 
to their condition and their destiny. “He was the ardent advo- 
cate of complete classical and literary culture. Under his influ- 
ence, the classical and literary schools of the college were fully 
sustained. Yet he recognized the fact that material well-being 
is, for a people, a condition of all high civilization; and there- 
fore, though utterly out of sympathy with the modern advocates 
of materialistic education, he sought to provide all the means for 
the development of science and for its practical applicatiom 
He thought, indeed, that the best antidote to the materialistic 
tendencies of a purely scientific training was to be found in the 
liberalizing influence of literary culture, and that scientific and 
professional schools could best. be taught when surrounded by 
the associations of a literary institution. He sought, therefore, 
to establish this mutual connection and to consolidate all the de- 
partments of literary, scientific, and professional education un- 
dey a common organization. Hence, at an early day, he called 
into existence the School of Applied Mathematics and Engineer- 
ing and the School of Law as part of the collegiate organization; 
and later he submitted to the trustees a plan for the complete 
development of the scientific and professional departments of 
the college, which will ever remain as an example of his enlarged 
wisdom, and which has anticipated—by many years, we fear— 
the practical attainments of any school in this country.” 
These were the principles which led Senator Morrill and the 
fathers to establish these institutions for the “liberal and practi- 
cal education of the industrial classes,” and these are the princi- 
ples which have guided us in the organization of the work of 
. the University of Tennessee. Our ideal has been the scientific 
and technical institution on the foundation of the liberal arts. 
It has been our aim to build for the State of Tennessee, as rapid- 
ly as the means was provided, a complete university of this new 
American type. -We found here in 1869, when the land-grant 
fund was received, an excellent literary institution, with the 
usual departments of Languages, Mathematics, History, Chem- 
istry, Physics, Electricity, Mechanical Engineering, Botany and 
Biology, and extensive shops for wood-working, forging, and 
machine work. The liberal education has been stimulated as
-P-A-G-E-284
— 273 — 
the technical education has been developed. Agriculture, the 
chief interest of our people, has received our first attention; and 
we have more money jnvested in land, buildings, and apparatus, 
and more teachers and experts employed for instruction and ex- 
periments in the sciences and arts of agriculture and horticulture, 
than in all other subjects combined. The sciences and mechanic 
arts, which lie at the basis of manufacturing, are represented 
here, alongside of the agricultural studies, in magnificent shops 
and laboratories. There has been no serious difficulty in organ- 
izing all of these departments in one institution. Peace and har- 
mony prevail between all classes of our students and teachers. 
Our only need is more means for the better ecuipment of our 
scientific and technical departments. Let us do all we can to 
teach our people that, since science is the basis of all industry, 
no money can be better invested by the State than that used in 
the endowment and support of scientific and technical education. 
Among ihe material improvements made during the year at 
the University of Tennessee are a dairy laboratory (fully de- 
scribed below) and a dormitory for women students, which is 
under construction at the present time. The woman’s dormi- 
tory will be called “Barbara Blount Hall,” in honor of a daugh- 
ter of Gov. William Blount, whe was one of the first students 
ef the University in the early days. It will contain twenty- 
eight dormitories, in addition to the necessary housekeeping 
apartments, parlors, a gymnasium, and two society halls for the 
women students. 
A short course in agriculture was inaugurated on January 4, 
1900, and the success attending the first session has resulted in 
the determination on the part of the trustees to make the short 
course a permanent feature of the agricultural work of the Uni- 
versity. The first course was attended by sixteen students, who 
took a marked interest, and did well. The principal object in 
this course is to provide instruction in the principles of agricul- 
ture and in improved methods of dairying, animal husbandry, 
farming, and fruit growing at a season of the year when the work 
on the farm is least pressing and in a manner which can be easily 
understood by those who have not had extensive schooling. The
-P-A-G-E-285
— 274 — 
practical stockmen and farmers who have only a common-school 
edueation, and who cannot spare more than a few weeks in the 
winter from their work, have been kept in mind in the arrange- 
ment of this course. No entrance examination. is required. The 
course is designed to be an introduction to agricultural science, 
and so prepare the student to continue his studies by home read- 
ing or by taking the regular four-years’ course at the University... 
It is a thorough, practical course, the greater part of the time 
being spent on the farm, in the barn, the dairy, on the fruit plan- 
tation, or in the greenhouse. Tuition is free, and the expenses 
are made as light as possible. 
During the year the facilities for instruction in practical agri- 
eulture and horticulture have been greatly increased. A new 
dairy laboratory building has been erected on the University 
farm, which, together with its equipment, will cost about $10,- 
000. It is a handsome brick building, with marble trimmings 
and cement floors, and is equipped with the best modern machin- 
ery for butter making, cheese making, milk testing, ete. 
The Department of Horticulture has been provided with an 
extensive equipment. It has a well-built conservatory and prop- 
agating house, grafting room, hotbeds, and an excellent vine- 
yard and experimental fruit farm located on the northern slope 
of a ridge forming part of the University farm. This farm con- 
tains representative varieties of apple, pear, peach, and plum, 
with a large collection of small fruits. The orchard, planted in 
the spring of 1900, has made an excellent growth, and affords 
the best possible material for instruction. 
All of the laboratories in thé Department of Agriculture have 
been improved. ‘The Botanical Laboratory and the Laboratory 
of Chemistry are both doing good work. The chemist has or- 
ganized and carried out a series of codperative experiments with 
farmers, and has secured valuable reports thereon. 
The Experiment Station has published several bulletins giv- 
ing the results of its experiments, and the department has issued 
an agricultural handbook containing a description of the instruc- 
tion in agriculture given at the University and of the experi- 
mental work on the farm and in the orchard. This handboek
-P-A-G-E-286
— 275 — 
was published in an edition of 10,000 copies, and had a very ex- 
tensive circulation. All of the bulletins and other agriculturat 
publications are distributed free to the farmers of Tennessee ap- 
plying for them.

CHARLES W. DABNEY, President. 
TENNESSEE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
Sir: I have the honor to present to you the thirteenth annual 
report of the Tennessee Industrial School for the year ending 
on December 19, 1899. We have many reasons to be grateful 
for the very satisfactory course events have taken during the past 
twelve months, notwithstanding the various drawbacks which 
have presented themselves from time to time and with which we 
have had. to contend. 
Since the opening of the institution we have received 2,286 
children, of whom 1,752 were white boys, 378 girls, and 156 
colored boys; and have dismissed 1,526, of whom 1,275 were 
white boys, 160 girls, and 91 colored boys. Of the entire num- 
ber of children dismissed from the school, only a limited number 
have failed to do well. From the following statisties it will be 
seen that we have remaining in school on December 19, 1899, 
760 pupils, of whom 471 are white boys, 224 girls, and 65 col- 
ered boys. During the year we have received from various 
sources $90,404.85. This, however, includes the special appro- 
priation of $10,760.65 made by the General Assembly of 1899, 
and of which was expended for an addition to the Girls’ Build- 
ing, $5,000; insurance, $2,500; steam cooking appliances, elec- 
trie plant, and enlargement of gas plant, $3,260.65. 
We began the year with an indebtedness of $4,239.52, and 
have expended since that time, on subsistence account, $73,-
-P-A-G-E-288
—~oTT 
083.86; on furnishing account, $5,048.93; and on. general im- 
provements and repairs, $12,497.71; and have an indebtedness 
remaining on December 19, 1899, of $6,235.71. : 
An examination of our books will show that there is due the 
School from persons and counties who have sent children to us 
the sum of $4,943.26, which, if it were possible to collect, after 
being deducted from our total liabilities, would leave us with an 
indebtedness of only $1,292.45. This is comparatively a small 
sum, considering the numerous and substantial improvements 
which have been made. Some of these accounts have been in 
arrears for many years and have necessarily become burden- 
some. 
Everything in the way of general repairs and improvements 
has been kept up in a very substantial manner. We have put 
in new ranges in the kitchens at several departments, and have 
added three new vaults to our system of water closets. We have 
also repaired the roof of the main building at. considerable cost, 
and have replaced the roof at. the Small Girls’ Building, which 
was leaking and badly in need of repairs, with a new metal roof. 
A portion of the rear wall of the main building had to be taken 
down and rebuilt. The recently erected additions to the Girls’ 
Building make that, department a model of convenience. We- 
have also fitted up at that department lavatory and bath rooms, 
fumished with the latest improved appliances in that line, which 
are, I believe, superior to those of any institution of like charac- 
ter in the country. We have also fitted up for the girls apart- 
ments for the study of shorthand, bookkeeping, typewriting, 
and telegraphy, which will be taught on a more extensive scale 
than heretofore. Our library and art studio, also located at 
the Girls’ Department, have proven quite interesting and agree- 
able to the girls. Some of the children have shown much talent 
in these lines and have completed some very creditable work. 
After some little improvement, which we found necessary to 
make, we have transformed one of the outbuildings, formerly 
used as a wood shed, into a broom factory, and are now doing 
some work in that line, making all the brooms used throughout 
the institution, as well as an occasiona! consignment for sale.

We have also refitted and supplied our barber shop with four 
‘ new barber chairs and other necessary furnishings, and have a 
regular class of boys engaged at this business, directed by a com- 
petent barber, who, in connection. with this work, is our brass 
band instructor. 
The manner in which the different workshops and industrial 
branches of the institution have been managed is worthy of 
favorable mention, and without. which our report would be in- 
complete. The greater number of these shops and departments 
have as their foremen and instructors young men. who were for- 
merly pupils of the school, and who have thoroughly learned 
their business here. These young men also have charge of the 
children in their military companies or divisions. 
In the blacksmith shop we do all the repairing of the farming 
implements, wagons, and other vehicles in use at the institution, 
keep our herd of thirty-five head of horses and mules shod, and, 
when necessary, get out a plow or wagon; in fact, everything 
in the general line of blacksmithing is carried on here. The 
large, two-horse spring wagon seen on. the streets of Nashville 
every day, and which conveys our goods and groceries from the 
city to the institution, was built by the class of boys at this work. 
A minute inspection of this specimen of our work will show it 
to be a credit to much more experienced wagon builders. 
All the furniture used throughout the institution is made by 
the class of boys in cabinet work, samples of whose skill and 
workmanship may be seen in our dormitories and buildings at 
any time, and which will be found to compare very favorably 
with the work turned out by the average furniture factory. We 
find a ready use for their productions right here at home, 
although an oceasional piece of furniture is made for the friends 
of the School or parties not. connected therewith. 
The mattress, quilting, and furniture finishing shops will 
also be found very interesting as well as essential departments 
of industry. For several years past we have been making a 
greater part of the mattresses used in some of the public insti- 
tutions in and around Nashville, as well as supplying our home 
demand. Our dormitories are inspected weekly, and any mat-
-P-A-G-E-290
— 279 — 
tresses needing repairs or renovation are removed and new ones 
substituted. In renovating a mattress, as much of the old mate- 
rial is used as possible, and the ticking is well laundered. Thus 
we have a virtnally new matitress at a very small cost. The 
quilting department is well equipped with all necessary ma- 
chinery and furnishings, and the three boys employed there can 
easily complete as many dozens of quilts in a day’s time. 
All the lumber necessary for use in the cabinet department 
and the manual training department is bought undressed and 
got. ready for use in our wood-working machine shops. Here 
we have sawmills and planing mills, turning lathes, and other 
necessary machinery, and are well fitted for the kinds of work 
done. The iron-working machine shop is also an important 
branch of industry, affording employment to six or eight hands, 
who do the greater part. of our general repair work, plumbing, 
etc. The shop is furnished with turning lathes, drill presses, 
and other machines, and is supplied with steam power. Their 
work has alwavs proven quite an item of economy to the institu- 
tion as well as an instructive branch for the pupils. 
We have added several pieces of useful machinery to our shoe 
and harness factories, and are now fully equipped to make all 
the shoes we use, which in a year’s time amounts to nearly 2,000 
pairs. This trade is thoroughly taught, and, upon leaving the 
School, a pupil should be able to make a pair of shoes either by 
hand or with the use of machinery. Whenever necessary, a set 
of harness is made, although we do not carry on this line of work 
toa great extent. 
The printing office is a model of its kind. The Boys’ Lan- 
tern, published by the children and edited by one of our former 
pupils, speaks well for those who have this work in hand. In 
connection with the weekly paper, we do all our job printing, 
as well as an occasional lot of work for outside parties and firms. 
The steam laundry plant, ironing and mending rooms, also 
located at the main building, get out a lot of creditable and in- 
dispensable work. Every care is taken to sce that the clothing 
of the children is properly laundered, mended, and otherwise 
cared for.
-P-A-G-E-291

In the Sloyd Training Department forty of the smaller boys 
are employed. This course of training is intended not only to 
teach the child the use of tools, but to encourage a love for in- 
dustry, to broaden and develop the mind, and to form a, basié 
and foundation for whatever vocation. ha may take up in after 
life, 
Seventeen pupils spend about five hours daily in the freehand 
drawing and fresco painting classes. These classes. are under 
the instruction of one of the best artists in the city. 
The children study telegraphy, shorthand, and bookkeeping, 
both at the Main Building and the Girls’ Department. We 
have about twenty pupils in. each class. These branches are not, 
considered a part of the scholastic work, but are applied as trades 
or professions, and are not taught in the schools proper. Many 
of our children who have learned these branches here are now 
filling lucrative positions in this and other cities. We endeavor 
to keep up with them and to learn: just as much of their progress 
and standing as possible. The result is indeed gratifying. 
Our classes in vocal and instrumental music receive all the 
attention it is possible to give them, and they are considered a 
very important factor in our course of instruction. We have a 
competent teacher employed solely for this purpose, whose duty 
it is to spend her entire time in giving instruction in: these 
branches. Our choir will compare very favorably with that of 
any institution in the State, and our brass band has made for 
itself a. name in keeping with its proficiency and of which we 
are very proud. 
Everything pertaining to the scholastic attainments of the 
children has been. to us very satisfactory. We think each and 
every pupil has put forth his or her best effort to grasp every 
educational advantage, and their advancement along this line 
has been all that we could desire. The teachers and officers 
have also blended their efforts, and have vied with each other in 
the endeavor to train the children in the proper manner, and to 
their careful and efficient work I attribute much of our success. 
Owing to the very unfavorable seasons and excessive drought, 
practically nothing was realized from our farm during the past
-P-A-G-E-292
— 281 — 
year. This has necessitated the purchase of many vegetables 
and fruits, of which, under favorable conditions, we would have 
had more than we could consume. Our potatoes (and, in. fact, 
everything in the vegetable line) were almost, an entire failure; 
however, we have saved a sufficient quantity of Irish potatoes 
for spring planting, but. it will be necessary to purchase all of 
our seed sweet potatoes. In view of the greatly increased prices 
on almost every line of goods, it has been very difficult for us to 
provide the mamy necessities used in an institution of this 
character, and also to keep up the repairs, on the small. per capita 
allowance of $100. 
Our dairy is giving very satisfactory results. We have placed 
this department on a business basis, and have employed a man 
who understands the dairy business thoroughly. We are making 
a greater part of the butter we use, and our cows furnish all 
the milk used at the institution. We find this to be a matter of 
great economy and saving, as the purchase of al] milk and butter 
used by us would prove quite an item of expenditure. 
Before closing, permit me to mention the exceedingly good | 
health we have enjoyed during the period of time covered by 
this report.

TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
Sir: The fifty-sixth session, commencing on September 1, 
1899, and ending on June 7, 1900, has been the most prosper- 
ous period in the history of the School. A larger number of pu- 
pils have entered than ever before, more interest and earnest- 
ness have been manifested, and the results have been far more 
satisfactory. Last year we enrolled 158 pupils; this year, 205. 
Last year we had considerable sickness and one death; this year, 
little sickness and no deaths. Our imperfect heating system 
last year produced discomfort and actual suffering, while this 
year the greatest comfort was experienced by all even in the cold- 
est. weather. 
For nearly two months our School quarantined successfully 
against that dreaded disease, smallpox, allowing neither in- 
gress nor egress. This shutting out the world from one’s 
daily life had a depressing influence, provoking unrest and dis- 
satisfaction. The fact that one is deprived of some privilege
-P-A-G-E-296
— 285 — 
or right makes him want it all the more, and what ordinarily 
would not be cared for is the very thing wanted when we cannot 
get it. Nevertheless, we managed to live through the enforced 
seclusion without very much friction. Our greatest trouble was 
the loss of the services of nonresident teachers, who were also 
excluded from the building, which threw extra work on the other 
teachers, whose classes were already too large. As Idleness is 
the mother of Disorder, I took some of the work myself, and the 
rest was taken by Senior pupils. 
The annual declamatory contest for the Sallie E. Armstrong 
medals took place on April 27, and was attended by an excep- 
tionally fine audience. Mayor Head, Hon. G. N. Tillman, and 
General Thruston presided as judges. The speakers acquitted 
themselves in a most creditable manner. The medals were 
awarded to Landon Cary, of the Senior Class, and Bennie Nich- 
olson, of the Junior Class. 
_ The Retail Merchants’ Association, through their president, 
Mr. Hf. M. Brennecke, invited the School to take part in the 
flower parade and to attend a concert given on the Centennial 
grounds. I accepted the invitation, and had the band hoys put 
in uniform. Their appearance as well as the music made elic- 
ited no small amount of genuine interest and complimentary re-_ 
marks. The tallyho in which the boys rode was tastefully decu- 
rated by the teachers with flowers made by our own girls, 
On May 21 we arranged an entertainment complimentary to 
the Peabody Normal College. As the greater part of its stu- 
dents are from Tennessee, I thought they would likely carry 
home with them a remembrance of this School, and, if they . 
heard of a blind child in their neighborhood, would tell what 
they saw here. The chapel was filled with students, and Chan- 
cellor Payne and a large number of his Faculty honored us with 
their presence. The Chancellor the next, morning spoke in, the 
Normal chapel in most complimentary terms of this School, and 
impressed upon his students the lessons to be learned from what 
they witnessed here the night before.
-P-A-G-E-297
— 286 — 
On Sunday, June 3, Rev. Dr. Ellis preached the commence- 
ment sermon, which was very appropriate and instructive. 
On the evening of sune 6 the closing exercises were held. A 
very large and superior audience was present. All did their 
best. The people were highly pleased, and I was fully satisfied. 
Judge Lea conferred the diplomas in his always happy form. 
The next day the children left for their homes, except a few who 
went by water. 
The regular quarterly examination of classes was held on 
May 29-31. The scholarship is higher this year than, ever be- 
fore. Great interest has been manifested. in studies and work. 
During this session our gymnasium was completed, and 1 
thought the opening of the handsome and costly building should 
be attended with befitting ceremony; for we now have what has 
long been needed: a sufficient and splendid heating system, suit- 
able and ample shop accommodation away from the street, and a 
handsome gymnasium fully equipped and second to none in the 
city in its appointments. I considered it was only due the com- 
mittee to give a public expression of appreciation and thanks for 
the faithfnl manner in which they discharged their trust. On 
December 7 the dedication took place in the gymnasium. The 
programme was short. It was opened with prayer by Dr. W. 
¥. Ellis, and consisted of choruses and selections by the band. 
The architect, in a few well-chosen words, delivered the keys 
to Mr. Litterer, chairman of the Building Committee, who, in a 
short address, expressed his satisfaction with the entire building, 
and placed the keys in the hands of Judge East, president of 
the board. At the conclusion of a very interesting address the 
president delivered the keys to the Superintendent, in trust. 
Speeches were made by Hon. Morgan Fitzpatrick, State Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction; Chancellor Payne, Comptroller 
King, Mr. Dortch, and others. Major Weakley presided in his 
usual graceful manner. 
The Schoo! for the Colored Blind on Tennessee street has been 
thoroughly repaired and put in first-class condition. It presents 
a fine appearance, and is by far the most attractive-looking house
-P-A-G-E-298
— 287 — 
in that part of the city. It will compare favorably, I think, with 
any similar institution in the United States. 
I find among the people generally a misapprehension of the 
real physical condition of the blind. There are still many per- 
sons who believe that the loss of one sense strengthens the re- 
maining senses. This absurd theory is called the “ law of com- 
pensation.” It would no doubt be very comforting to the af- 
flicted to know that Nature makes up to them in some way or 
other the loss of their limbs or of one or more of their senses. 
The senses are avenues between the brain and the outer world. 
If these avenues are perfect, then the impression made upon the 
brain must be perfect; but if the sense is impaired by disease, 
then tho impression is imperfect, or it may be altogether wrong. 
If the sense is dead, there is no other nerve to perform its func- 
tion. Nature has been very kind to provide similar nerves for 
both sides of the body. So if one eye is lost, we have one left: 
if one ear becomes deaf, we still have'the other. The eye can- 
not convey to the deaf the faintest idea of sound, nor can the ear 
convey to the blind the faintest idea of color. Each nerve has 
its allotted task to perform, and when either ceases to act, the 
gateway to knowledge is sealed up forever. ‘The brain may be 
just the same in strength and in quality, but is differently cir 
cumstanced. It must fit itself to its new conditions. Hearing 
and Feeling are its chief servants, and they must be well and 
carefully trained, so that they may perform their duty with ex- 
actness and precision. 
Alcove than half the knowledge we aequire comes through the 
eye-—all that pertains to light and shade, to color, form, distance, 
and, in short, the whole visible universe. So great is the differ- 
ence between sight and the other senses as a channel of communi- 
cation that it has been compared to one of those great thorough- 
fares such as Broadway, Piccadilly, or the famous boulevard 
in Paris, that gayest of all cities—-a street with magnificent mar- 
ble palaces, sparkling fountains, brilliant shops, gayly-dressed 
men and women, nodding plumes, glittering uniforms; a picture, 
a poem of life and motion never to be forgotten by the beholder 
of this grand pageant, this splendid show of the wealth, beauty,
-P-A-G-E-299
— 288 — 
and refinement of our twentieth-century civilization. Compare 
with this great street the narrow, dark by-streets lying on either 
side. They have their own people, their little cafés and shops. 
They have no room for the multitudes which daily throng the 
boulevard. Suppose that great street is obliterated, then the 
chief support and income of the city is gone. The remaining 
quarters must get on in their small way as best they can. So 
it is with the blind. The great avenue to the universe of light is 
closed. They must be content to work with humbler means; 
and although the progress made is very slow and painful, yet, 
with patience and determination, under the guidance of good 
and capable teachers, much, very much, may be accomplished. 
The belief that the loss of sight leads to the exaltation of the 
other senses, especially touch and hearing, has been exceedingly 
injurious to the interests of the blind. If a blind child has 
a retentive memory or can “catch” tunes easily, he is at once 
put on exhibition. The friends and neighbors pronounce the 
performance wonderful, and the child is taught to believe that 
he possesses remarkable talents. His vanity is cultivated far 
more than his manners. He becomes egotistic and hard to con- 
trol. The precociousness and parrotlike sayings of a child five 
years of age are not at all interesting in a child at twelve. The 
damage has been done; and when a child enters School, he has so 
much to unlearn and forget and so very much to learn that we 
keep him as much as possible under new influences and occupied 
with new thoughts. , 
It is important, I think, that our blind children be kept from 
specializing early, particularly in music. They should be kept, 
rather, at other things through games and plays and occupations. 
He who specializes ceases to broaden. 
For those who can see, kindergarten schools, primary schools, 
intermediate schools, high schools, colleges, and special schools 
are provided, into which, respectively, only the pupils of corre- 
sponding grades are received. In this School, however, the Pri- 
mary, Secondary, and higher departments of instruction are in- 
eluded; and pupils of all ages are received, for whom instruction 
corresponding to each of these grades must be provided, and in
-P-A-G-E-300
— 289 — 
a great variety of subjects. - For this reason the proper education 
of a comparatively small number of blind pupils, assembled as a 
School under the conditions that obtain here, requires the same 
extended classification as to age, grade, and subjects as are rep- 
resented in the whole system of schools for those who see. 
Therefore we need more room, more teachers, and a larger per 
capita.

J. V. ARMSTRONG, Superintendent. 
TENNESSEE DEAF AND DUMB SCHOOL. 
Sir: In compliance with your request. of June 27, I have the 
honor herehy to make report for the school year ending on that 
date. 
There was some delay in opening our School in the fall of 
1899 because of a few cases of scarlet fever in the neighborhood 
of the institution at the usual time for the opening of the term, 
the beginning of the session being delayed till the latter part of 
September. Apprehension was soon relieved, and the School 
happily escaped scarlet fever, as well as other diseases of an. 
epidemic character, during the year. However, we lost one 
pupil by death—Oscar Ray, a bright, manly little fellow, from 
Wayne County. He died on October 27, 1899, from typhoid 
fever, contracted, doubtless, before leaving home. As a rule, 
the general health of the pupils was good during the year. 
Our new hospital building is nearing completion, and will be
-P-A-G-E-302
— 291 — 
ready for occupancy at the commencement of the next school 
term. 
Among other more important improvements made during the 
past year J may mention the enlargement of bedroom accom- 
riodations for smaller boys and the providing of a well-equipped 
bath room for them, also a new floor in the dining room and a 
partial renewal of bedding. 
The total attendance of the School for the session was 235— 
in the white department, 201; in the colored department, 34. 
The average attendance was 224. The session closed with 226 
pupils in attendance. Perhaps the most striking feature of the 
attendance was the large number of new pupils admitted, fifty- 
two new pupils having been enrolled, the largest number in the 
history of the School for any year. These, with quite a number 
who had remained at home the previous session, made our pop- 
uation a greatly changed one, though the excess of pupils en- 
rolled above the attendance of the preceding year was not large. 
Our purposes and methods were substantially those explained 
in the report for 1898-99. The desire to make industrious, in- 
telligent, moral, and self-supporting citizens of our pupils was, 
as ever, the constant aim of our work. We followed, as hereto- 
fore, what is known among the educators of the deaf as the 
“Combined System,” both manual and oral methods being em- 
ployed. . Those engaged in the work of educating the deaf, as 
well as educators in other lines, find much help through an inter- 
change of views and experiences, which may be had in conven- 
tions and other general gatherings. 
The Convention of American Instructors of the Deaf, which 
is composed of all those connected with the education of the deaf 
in America, has an attendance of several hundred enthusiastic, 
intelligent, and progressive teachers. ‘his body meets trien- 
nially, the last session having been held in 1898. 
Thave recently returned from the Eighth Conference of Prin- 
cipals and Superintendents of American Schools for the Deaf, 
which convened on June 30, 1900, at Talladega, Ala. Through 
the kindness of the trustees of the Alabama Institute for the 
Deaf and of Principal J. H. Johnson and his assistants the con-
-P-A-G-E-303

ference was most hospitably entertained, and the session was a 
pleasant and profitable one. Many questions affecting the man- 
agement of schools for the deaf and the instruction and welfare 
of the pupils were presented and discussed very fully. 
Tt may not be amiss here to review or restate in part matters 
presented in our last report as to the objects and work of this 
School. The great State of Tennessee provides here for the 
education of that class of her children who, without special pro- 
vision for their education, must grow up in ignorance and prob- 
ably in vice and worthlessness. It is the earnest desire of the 
management of this School that no deaf child in Tennessee who 
is capable of being edneated and trained for usefulness and hap- 
piness shall grow up in ignorance; hence much effort is directed 
toward securing information concerning such children and in se- 
cuzing their attendance upon the School. As was suggested 
last year, the teachers throughout the State who will see the re- 
port of the Superintendent of Public Instruction may do the 
State a patriotic service, may assist the management of the 
School, and may confer an inestimable blessing upon perhaps 
the most needy children of the State by taking such interest in 
the deaf children of their respective communities as will result in 
such children being sent to the School. Information or inquiry 
addressed to the Principal will receive prompt attention. 
Many of the fifty or more beginning children who came to us 
last September without any knowledge of language, most of 
them kaving no idea even that the persons and objects all about 
thert have names, left for their homes in June happy in the 
knowicdge that they had begun to come into the possession of a 
key, that they may eventually possess fully, by which they may 
open the great storehouses of knowledge and happiness which 
were sa completely closed against them when they were with- 
out this means of receiving or communicating thought. These 
children acquired the ability to write a legible hand and learned 
several hundred words during the session. They also gathered 
much information of the world in which they live, and they be- 
gai to realize in some measure the obligations and privileges of 
their moral and spiritual natures.

The pupils of longer standing made most satisfactory progress 
in their various studies, which consist, mainly, of the elementary 
English branches. Some industrial trainmg was given to all 
pupils, habits of neatness and industry being carefully inculeated. 
The trades taught were printing, shoemaking, carpentry, dairy- 
ing, gardening, and dressmaking. 
The progress of the great majority of the pupils in their work 
and studies was encouraging; and, taken all in all, I may report 
as satisfactory and successtul a year as the Tennessee Deaf and 
Dumb School has ever experienced. 
Very respectfully submitted, 
THOMAS L. MOSES, Principal. 
WATKINS INSTITUTE. 
Sir: [t is with great satisfaction the commissioners of Watkins 
Institute have to report the enlarged influence and efficiency of 
the Night School. As the public realizes more and more each 
year the advantages offered by this educational factor, they are 
showing their appreciation in increased measure, and this feature 
of the Institute hids fair to prove an important element in mold- 
ing ihe youth of our city. The attendance being entirely volun- 
tary, an enrollment is a declaration on the part of the student 
that he is willing to put forth especial efforts to secure an educa- 
tion; and, stimulated by this spirit, the application and zeal of 
the members of this school have been most satisfactory, and we 
are persuaded that the sphere of usefulness of this school will 
enlarge far beyond the conception of the benevolent founder of 
Watkins Institute and the Commissioners who first gave shape 
and direction to this most commendable charity. The history 
of similar institutions in other communities and the entente 
cordiale existing between teachers and pupils in our own school 
warrant us in entertaining very sanguine expectations concern- 
ing its future. 
We have the pleasure to append a very comprehensive and sat-
-P-A-G-E-305

isfactory report from our Superintendent, Capt. W. R. Garrett, 
which shows in detail what has been aceoinplished in the difter- 
ent departnents. 
The good work accomplished by Toward Library, which is 
under the direction of the Commissioners of Watkins Institute, 
ecntinues to enlarge, and more persons are constantly availing 
themselves of this opportunity to secure free of cost the best of 
mental food. 
A financial statement will be made later, at the end of the fis- 
cal year. Very respectfully, 
JOHN HELL KAKIN, Chairman;

SUPERINTENDENT GARRETT’S REPORT. 
Nasuvitiz, Tenwn., December 31, 1899. 
To the Commissioners of Watkins Institute. 
GeytrirMen: I have the honor to submit to you the follow- 
ing report of the Night School for the session beginning on Sep- 
tember 4 and ending.on December 20, 1899: 
The School was opened and conducted in accordance with 
your published cirenlar of announcement. It embraced in its 
organization five classes, each under the charge of a competent 
instructor. The literary course was divided into three grades, 
or classes, designated, respectively, A, B, and C. These three 
classes covered the work of the Primary and Grammar Sehoo) 
grades of the publie schools. 
Class A (Primary) was taught by Mrs. A. J. Cavert, who sne- 
ceeded Miss Julia A. Doak. 
Class B (intermediate) was taught by Mrs. Alexander Fall. 
Class C (Advanced) was taught by Mrs. L. T. Davis. 
There is no High School Department in the School, its place 
being supplied by the Business Department, including Classes 
D and FE.  
-P-A-G-E-306
— 295 — 
Class D is devoted to instruction in Stenography, Bookkeep- 
ing, Typewriting, and Practical Business Courses. It was 
taught by Prof. Alexander Fall. 
Class E is devoted to practical instruction in mechanical draw- 
ing, and was tanght by Prof. A. C. Webb. 
The enrollment and attendance are shown in the following 
table:

The ages of the pupils ranged from ten years to fifty years. 
The ages have not been recorded, and no exact statement. of the 
average age can be given; but it may be safely estimated that the 
average age of the pupils was above twenty-one years. No one 
was admitted who was attending a day school, except in two or 
three special instances. The main body of the pupils consisted 
of those who are engaged in business during the day, and attend 
this School at night to acquire the elements of an education or to 
cure defects of education in some of the branches which they 
failed to study in youth. 
The two classes in the Business Course have been of direct and 
immediate use to young people engaged in business who are am- 
bitious to qualify themselves for higher positions, 
An interesting element of the School is a class of foreigners, 
some of whom are well educated, but who find an elementary 
school the best place to acquire familiarity with the English lan- 
guage and to correct faults of pronunciation and diction. 
The preportion of the average number belonging to the school
-P-A-G-E-307
—~ 296 — 
to that of the total enrollment is larger than the average of night 
schools, yet it does not reach the average of well-organized day 
schools. Many persons who are at hard labor during the day 
make an earnest effort to devote the night to study. After a 
short trial, some of them find the strain too great, and others find 
it impossible to adjust their work to admit of devoting their 
nights to study. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the School 
has maintained a larger regular attendance than ever before. 
The spirit of the pupils was admirable. Their earnest work 
and exemplary deportment have made any “ case of discipline ” 
unnecessary during the entire session. 
T recommend that the School open for the next session on Mon- 
day, August 27, 1900, in order that it may close on Friday, 
December 14, thus avoiding the week before Christmas, during 
which week the services of many of the pupils will be required 
by their employers at night in order to prepare for the Christ- 
mas trade. 
I cannot close this report without testifying to the sbiity and 
faithfulness with which the teachers in the several departments 
have performed their respective duties. Indeed, more is due 
them than formal testimony; for their skill and tact have con- 
verted the difficult task of conducting a Night School into a 
source of pride and pleasure. 
Mr. Joseph S. Oarels, superintendent of the building, has con- 
tributed largely to the success of the School by his kind and in- 
telligent codperation. 
In conclusion, I express to the Commissioners the thanks of 
myself, the teachers, and the pupils for their uniform considera- 
tion and kindness and for the interest they have manifested in 
our work. Respectfully submitted, 
W. R. GARRETT, Superintendent.

SCHOOLS FOR THE COLORED. 
The following regulations governing the appointment of ap- 
plicants of African descent to Normal school scholarships were 
adopted by the State Board of Edueation on September 8, 1891: 
“Senators are authorized to appoint, from their respective 
Senatorial Districts, two students of African descent, subject: to 
examination by the institution to which they are appointed. 
Said students must be examined in the following studies: Spell- 
ing, Reading, Writing, English Grammar, Geography, Arith- 
metic, and United States History. In case of the rejection of 
any student upon examination by the institution to which he is 
appointed, the Senator is authorized to fill the vacancy under 
similar conditions. 
“This scholarship is good for two years. Persons once ap- 
pointed, and who have received the benefits of a scholarship, 
cannot be reappointed. 
“ This Board agrees to appropriate to each student of African 
descent who may be appointed for Normal Scholarships, under 
the late Act of the General Assembly, the sum of fifty dollars 
per annum, provided a student shall attend eight or more months 
during a scholastic year; but if a student shall attend for a 
period of less than eight months during any scholastic year, he 
is to be allowed credit at the rate of six dollars and twenty-five 
cents per month for such time as he has actually been in attend- 
ance, this being agreed to by those having charge of the Colored 
Normal Schools. 
“This will give to each Senatorial District two scholarships. 
This Board also designates and recommends as proper institu- 
tions for the education of such appointees, Knoxville College, 
Knoxville; Freedman’s Normal Institute, Maryville; Fisk Uni- 
versity, Nashville; Roger Williams University, Nashville; Cen- 
tral Tennessee College, Nashville; LeMoyne Normal Institute, 
Memphis: Morristown Normal Institute, Morristown; Lane 
Institute, Jackson; and Athens Academy, Athens. Each ap- 
pointee may select from. this list the school he will attend.
-P-A-G-E-311

“ The applicant for a Scholarship under the State appropria- 
tion must be at least sixteen vears of age, of irreproachable moral 
character, gentlemanly or ladylike habits, presumed good health, 
declared intention to make teaching a profession, and intention 
to teach at least two years in the public schools of the State.” 
The form of Certifieate of Appointment, approved by the 
State Board of Education, is as follows:

The following are reports from schools for the colored in- 
cluded in the list of institutions approved by the State Board of 
Education : ‘ 
CENTRAL TENNESSEE COLLEGE. 
Sir: The past year has been one of prosperity at Central 
Tennessee College, Nashville. 
The following is the enrollment for 1899-1900: College 
classes, 17; College Preparatory, 33; Normal, 45; English, 
185; Theological, 29; Law, 8; Medical, 175; Dental, 19; Phar- 
maceutical, 16; Instrumental Music, 80; Vocal Music, 196; 
Art, 15; Shorthand and Typewriting, 19; Tin Work, 4; Print- 
ing, 41; Blacksmithing, 3; Sewing, 9. Total enrollment, omit- 
ting those counted twice, 540. 
The following is the number of graduates in the past year: 
College, 4; Normal, 5; English, 16; Law, 5; Medicine, 34; 
Dentistry, 2; Pharmacy, 1; Instrumental Music, 1; Sewing, 5. 
The following is the number of graduates from the opening 
of the College: College, 51; Academic, 14; Junior Normal, 
49; Senior Normal, 63; Instrumental Music, 3; Theology, 18; 
Pastor’s Course, 2; Law, 41; Graduate Courses, 2; Medicine, 
410; Dentistry, 89; Pharmacy, 50; Obstetrics, 2. Total num- 
ber of graduates, exclusive of English and Industrial Courses, 
TAA. 
Of the forty living College graduates, exclusive of the class 
of the present vear, six are preaching, seventeen are teaching, 
tavo are editors, four are phvsicians, two are lawyers. one is in 
the United States postal serviee, four ara college professors, 
one is a college matron, and three (female graduates) are mar- 
ried. 
Of the three hundred and forty living medical graduates, ex- 
elusive of the class of the present vear, the occupation of ten is 
unknown, three are permanently disabled on. account of sickness, 
two are in the service of the United States Government, one is 
a pharmacist, one is practicing dentistry, eight are preaching, 
ome is a bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one
-P-A-G-E-314
— 803 — 
is-a medical missionary in South America, and the remaining 
three hundred and three are successfully practicing their pro- 
fession. 
The white physicians of the South have been uniformly kind 
in their treatment of our medical alumni, consulting with them 
in serious cases, lending them books, and assisting in dangerous 
surgical operations. A large proportion of our medical gradu- 
ates have purchased homes for themselves, and their professional 
income is probably greater than any other class of colored pro- 
fessional men. 
The course of medical study is thoroughly graded, and four 
sessions of six months each are required to complete it. 
The latest vital statistics of the principal cities and towns of 
the South show that the death rate of the colored population is 
nearly twice as great. as that among the whites. This is largely 
owing to the deaths resulting from what are known as “ pre- 
ventable diseases.” Consumption, which was formerly one of 
the rarest diseases among them, is now alarmingly fatal, the 
death rate being nearly four times as great as among the white 
people. This death rate is greatly owing to ignorance of the 
laws of health and lack of proper care when sick. As a remedy 
for this excessive mortality, a large increase in the number of 
colored physicians is urgently demanded. 
The Dental Department was opened in 1886. Since that 
time thirty-nine students have completed the required course 
and received the degree of D.D.8.. They have been welcomed 
by the white members of the dental profession, who have kindly 
assisted them in their work. The patronage which thev have 
received in the cities where they have located has been most 
encouraging, and at. the present time there is a promising, use 
ful, and Inerative field open in this direction. This school is a 
member of the National Association of Dental Faculties. 
The Pharmaceutical Department was established in 1889. 
Since that time fifty young men and women have completed the 
prescribed course. The demand for properly qualified colored 
druggists at the present time far exceeds the supply. The 
course of study consists of three sessions of six months each.

The College has recently met with a great, and irreparable 
loss in the death of Rev. John Braden, D.D., which occurred on 
dune 10, 1900. With the exception of one year, Dr. Braden 
had been President of Central Tennessee College since its first 
organization, in 1867. He was born of Scotch-Irish parentage, 
on August 18, 1826, in New York City, in which city his 
boyhood was spent. His father having died when he was a very 
young man, he went West—to Illinois—at the age of sixteen 
to care for himself, and soon after was converted and joined 
the Methodist Episcopal Church, of which he was a member 
until the time of his death. He graduated at the Ohio Wes- 
leyan University in 1853, and the same year became a professor 
‘in Xenia Female College. He entered the Cincinnati Confer- 
ence of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1854, continuing his 
connection with the Conference until 1867. From 1859 to 1861 
he was president of New Carlisle Academy. At the break- 
ing out of the Civil War this school was closed and he was sta- 
tioned at York Street Church, Cincinnati, O. At the close of 
the war workers were wanted for the field opened among the 
freedmen of the South, and he came to Nashville in 1867 to 
engage in this work, in which he remained until the time of his 
death. : 
Dr. Braden’s great work consisted. in the organization and 
upbuilding of Central Tennessee College. He was the first 
Acting President. His life and labors are interwoven with its 
entire history. He had witnessed the organization and develop- 
ment of its manifold departments. He had undoubtedly signed 
more diplomas for colored youth than any other man. His 
life has gone into the characters and achievements of more than 
six thousand students who have come under his consecrated 
enthusiasm and inspiring influence. His life was one of in- 
cessant toil and sacrifice. 
This College is under the care of the Freedmen’s Aid and 
Southern Education Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. 
The Meharry Medical Department received $1,500 from the 
John F. Slater fund during the past year.

FISK UNIVERSITY. 
Sir: Fisk School, founded by the American Missionary Ass» 
ciation for the education cf negro youth of both sexes, was 
opened on January 9, 1866, with a corps of fifteen teachers and 
over a thousand pupils. 
Owing to the condition of the then recently emancipated peo- 
ple, and the fact that at that time there were no public schools 
for negro children in Nashville, the instruction was confined to 
the elementary English branches. 
On Angust 22, 1867, a charter was secured under the laws of 
Tennessee for Fisk University, a prophetic name, proclaiming 
the purpose to prepare negro youth, by Jong-extended and thor- 
ough courses of study, for edueational and professional work 
The University, while in perfeet sympathy with all institutions 
that are seeking to give industrial education, holds unswervingly 
to the ideal set at its founding. 
The following statistics give some idea of the results of these 
thirty-two years of work: 
Students have been graduated from the various departments, 
as follows: Theological Department, 7; College Department, 
201; Normal Department, 213; Musical Department, 18. To 
tal, 484, 
Of these alumni, eight are college professors, fifty-seven are 
principals or teachers in high schools or Normal schools, one 
hundred and twenty are principals or teachers in public schools, 
thirty-eight are in the professions, and sixteen are in profes- 
sional schools, 
In addition to the work of the graduates, it is safe to say that 
several hundred undergraduates are engaged in teaching in vari- 
our portions of the South. 
A classification made last year shows that one hundred and 
six of the alumni are located in Tennessee, fifty-two in Texas, 
thirty-four in Alabama, twenty-six in Georgia, eighteen in Ken- 
tucky, seventeen in Arkansas, fourteen in Mississippi, fourteen 
in North Carolina, thirteen in Tlinois, ten in Missouri, ten. in
-P-A-G-E-317
— 306 — 
Florida, six in South Carolina, five in Virginia, and from one 
to four each in twelve other States, Southern and Northern. 
The present year has been a successful one for the University. 
There have been ‘enrolled in all departments 504 students, of 
whorn 221 were boarders in the University. 
The company of Jubilee Singers which was sent North a 
year ago with the hope of raising money for a building for the 
large Department of Music met with reasonable success, and, 
as we hope, paved the way for greater success the coming year. 
There were in attendance during the year fifteen students 
under the appointment of Senators to State Normal Scholar- 
ships. As in past years, these students made a good record and 
proved themselves worthy of the help extended by the State.

Students were in attendance from twelve different States and 
from Indian Territory. 
The Faculty numbers fourteen—five men and nine women. 
The closing exercises occurred on May 16, 1900, at which time 
the degree of Master of Arts in course was conferred upon three 
men graduated in 1897, and the degree of Bachelor of Science 
was conferred upon one graduate of 1890. The Academic di- 
ploma was granted to nine, and the regular Normal diploma. was 
granted to twenty-two. 
The institution has graduated from its various departments 
in all 407 persons, the most of whom hold positions of usefulness 
and responsibility in their several communities, not a few of 
them holding the most responsible position of all —that of 
mother in a Christian home. 
The distribution of the graduates from the College Depart- 
ment since the power to confer degrees was granted in 1877 is 
as follows: Presidents of colleges, 8; principals of high schools 
and city schools, 16; teachers in higher schools, 21; pastors of 
important churches, 9; physicians, 6; attorneys at law, 3; busi- 
ness men, 3; United States foreign consul, 1; United States 
postal clerk, 1; State missionary, 1; pursuing advanced studies, 
1; wives, not otherwise counted, 2; deceased, 10. Total, 82.
-P-A-G-E-319
— 308 — 
This distribution of trained workers, and not an idle one 
among them, would seem to be a sufficient refutation of the 
charge that a college course spoils the negro. 
During the past year fifteen students in this institution en- 
joyed the benefit of the Tennessee State Scholarships, and by 
their earnestness and diligence showed their appreciation of the 
same. 
This University has no sympathy with an. endeavor to create 
an aristocracy of learning beyond that which superior advan- 
tages and education will always create. The endeavor is to 
keep constantly before students the fact that nothing is of value 
except real attainments and real character; to inculeate and 
emphasize the responsibility which superior advantages entail 
upon the student-——to be the most: conservative, the most public- 
spirited, the most upright, and the most useful member of his 
community. . 
P. B. GUERNSEY, President. 
LANE COLLEGE. 
Sir: T have the honor to report another successful, and in 
many respects a satisfactory, session of Lane College, beginning 
on September 18, 1899, and ending on May 30, 1900. 
When the Civil War began. in 1861, the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, South, had in tts membership over 200,000 colored 
members. The war having closed and the relation of the colored 
people being changed, it was deemed wise to set off the colored 
membership in an organization of their own. Accordingly, 
Bishop H. N. MeTyeire, Bishop Robert Paine, and others met 
the colored representatives in the city of Jackson, Tenn., in 
1870. The meeting resulted in the organization of what is 
known as the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in. America.
-P-A-G-E-320
— 309 — 
The leaders in this new church soon saw the necessity of 
schools of their own. Tn the fall of 1878. in the city of Nash- 
ville, at a session of the Tennessee Conference of said Colored 
Church, the project of establishing a school was beeun. Prop- 
erty was purchased in Jackson and a. house was erected. In 
1882 the first session was opened, and the school was called the 
“High School of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church,” 
and two years later it was chartered under the laws of Tenneés- 
see as Lane Institute. 
Necessities multiplied as the institution prospered. Bishop 
Isaac Lane began to travel abroad with the view of raising 
monev for the erection. of a more commodions school building 
and boarding departments for its increasing patronage. In 
1897 the new house was completed. It is a neat, three-story, 
brick building with thirteen recitation rooms. Separate board- 
ing departments for girls and boys have been built and fur 
nished. In 1896 its name was changed to “Lane College” in 
honor of Bishop Lane, who has done so much for it. It is sup- 
ported in its finances by the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, 
and the Colored Methodist: Episcopal Church in America. 
Since the organization of this College, in 1878, it has sent out 
one hundred and sixteen graduates from the Normal Depart 
ment, and many of them are filling responsible positions and 
giving satisfaction and making good citizens. 
The students appointed by Senators for the State Normal 
Scholarships are doing well and are worthy of the help extended 
them by the State. 
The last session was prosperous, the College having a larger 
enrollment than in any previous session. Fifteen graduated 
from the Normal Department.

LE MOYNE NORMAL INSTITUTE. 
Sir: T have the honor to submit the following report of the 
work of this institution for the school year ending on June 30, 
1900: 
The enrollment for the vear in all grades and departments of 
the school has aggregated 718 pupils. Of these, 258 were en- 
rolled in the three grades of the Primary Department, 123 in 
the two grades of the Intermediate Department, 133 in the two 
grades of the Grammar Department, and 204 in the Normal De 
partment. The last-named department comprises five years’ 
work, making a course of school training, in all, twelve years in
-P-A-G-E-322
—311— 
duration, from the first. Primary to the senior year of the Nor- 
mal Department. 
The attendance for the vear has heen quite regular and steady 
at between 500 and 600 in daily attendance. In all the work of 
the school the aim has been to teach thoroughly the regular Eng- 
lish branches of a graded and high school course of study, with 
additional special work in the Normal Department for the train- 
ing of teachers for the public schools of Tennessee and adjoining 
States. 
The graduating class of the present year numbered twenty— 
eleven young women and nine young men—averaging twenty 
and one-half years of age. The average time of attendance of 
these students at Le Movne Institute is a fraction over six years, 
and at other schools a little over five years. Seventeen of them 
intend to teach, and eight have already taught from one to five 
terms in the schools of Tennessee. 
Aside from the scholastic and Normal training, the pupils of 
the first. four grades have one lesson and period of practice each 
week in sewing; while the girls of the fifth, sixth, and seventh 
grades have four lessons and periods of practice every week in 
the art of sewing and cutting and making of garments. A spe 
cial teacher is employed for this work. Cooking, household 
work, and nursing are also regularly taught to the young women 
of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh years in the Normal Depart- 
ment; while the young men of the corresponding grades have 
lessons and daily practice in the use of wood-working tools, print- 
ing, ete. 
The following outline comprises the course of training of the 
Normal Department, thorough training in Vocal Music being . 
given in each grade:

In addition to the courses of study as above, the following 
will serve as an outline of the special professional or “ Teachers’ 
Course: ” 
1. (a) A knowledge of the hnman mind and its application 
to the work of education. (b) The order and conditions of de 
velopment and growth of the mental faculties. (c) General 
principles of education. (d) Methods of school government and 
organization. 
2. Objects and aims of education. 
3. Motives to mental activity. 
4. Laws that govern attention and conditions of its proper 
training. 
The object of special training is to prepare teachers for their 
special work, The teacher’s work is to educate his pupils. He 
should have two aims in view: : 
1. To develop the minds of the pupils. 
2. To furnish instruction. 
As the teacher’s work is upon the mind, he needs to know 
something about it—-what it is made to do and how it is made to 
do it. . 
The teacher teaches when he causes his pupils to exercise 
their own powers in the acquirement and use of knowledge. 
He teaches best who causes his pupils most effectually to use 
their faculties. 
Pestalozzi has given rules in regard to “ Good Methods: ” 
“1. A good method must be adapted to the nature of the sub- 
ject taught as well as to the character of the pupils. 
“9. A good method must be an uninterrupted progress to the 
pupil from the easy to the difficult. The purpose of the method 
work is to instruct the teachers how and in what order to develop 
the faculties of the pupil, and the natural order in which the sub- 
ject should be taught.” 
Each teacher will receive twelve weeks of practice teaching 
under a critic teacher. 
The value of hand training in education has been largely over- 
looked until quite recently. After an experience of some years, 
in which we have sought fairly and faithfully to combine the
-P-A-G-E-325
— 314 — 
training of the hand and eye with the more purely intellectual 
training, we are convinced that the two should not be separated 
jn graded or high school courses of study. 
The attention and intellectual effort required in guiding the 
eye and hand to the deft and accurate performance of any task 
calling for skill must secure some of the highest results sought 
for in education. 
The best. fruits of education are obtained by “ the cultivation 
of a legitimate familiarity betwixt the mind and thing.” Aside 
from the value of manual training as a factor in education, all 
must recognize its practical bearing and importance with refer- 
ence to the future life and suecess of the pupil. To secure these 
results, manual training takes its place in the course of study on 
the same footing and is treated in every respect as of the same 
importance as any other branch of study. 
If the home is to be the nursery of all virtues, the home keeper 
must understand how to order the affairs of her household with 
intelligence and economy. The practical training provided for 
the girls of the school has this end in view. 
The work comprises recitations and practice through ten: years 
of the course of study. 
The first. three years, Primary grades, follow the excellent 
practice of stitch work outlined by Miss Kirkwood, of New 
York. 
The fourth-year pupils review the stitch work of the lower 
grades and spend some time on patchwork. 
The fifth-year pupils have hemming, darning, making of 
plain aprons, and similar work. 
The sixth-vear pupils take mending, darning, cutting, and 
making of plain garments, ete. 
The seventh and last year in needlework have cutting, basting, 
and making of plain garments, with some fancywork. 
The girls of the ninth vear have two lessons each week in. the 
theory of household economy and work, ineluding study of foods 
and cooking. 
The girls of the tenth year do practical work in the experi- 
mental kitchen.
-P-A-G-E-326
— 315 — 
The girls of the eleventh year take up the subject. of Nursing 
and Hygiene for the year, two lessons a week. 
In the care of the sick and hvgione, the “ Handbook of Nurs- 
ing,” prepared for use in the New Haven School of Nursing, is 
used as a text-book and guide. In household economy and cook- 
ing, we follow out the lines of work as marked out in “Household 
Economy,” a. manual for schools, published under the direction 
of the Kitchen-Garden Association, of New York, and “ First 
Principles of Household Management and Cookery,” bv Miss 
Parloa, of New York. In addition to lessons of forty minutes, 
the class has actual practice in cooking certain days of the week, 
when the class time is extended to two hours. On each practice 
day four dishes are usually prepared by the girls under the 
supervision of the regular instructor. These exercises include 
lessons in bread, meats. vegetables, and pastries, varied so as to 
give practice in preparing most of the wholesome dishes found 
on the average table. Special attention is given to economical 
cookery throughout. 
Thus far provision has been made to give the boys of the 
school some practice in the use of wood-working tools and in 
typesetting and printine—the former for bovs of the seventh, 
eighth, and ninth vears of the course, and the latter for boys 
and girls of the Junior vear. 
For the wood-working classes, fourteen. benches and as many 
sets of carpenter’s tools are provided. Each set consists of one 
steel square, one trv square, one rule, one draw shave, one spoke 
shave, three saws. three chisels, two gauges, two planes, one 
serew-driver, one hammer, one mallet. one nail set, one oi] stone, 
one oil can, ete. Tn. addition to this outfit, the instructor has a 
bench furnished with a very complete set of tools. 
So far as possible, the elements of construction are kept, in 
view; but the main object of this work is to train the eve and 
hand of the pupils and. to give thorough understanding of the 
typical tools in use by them. The shop is also provided with a 
number of lathes and other foot-power machinery, with the work- 
ing of which the pupils are made familiar. 
A thoroughly equipped newspaper and job office furnishes
-P-A-G-E-327
— 316 — 
opportunity for instruction in the theory and art of printing. 
This work has been very successful, both in practical results 
and as a valuable auxiliary in the intellectual training of the 
school. The entire time of a special instructor is required in 
this department, as is also the case in the Wood-working Depart- 
ment and in the Girls’ Department of Industrial Instruction. 
A. J. STEELE, Principal. 
ENOXVILLE COLLEGE. 
Sir: The year 1899-1900 in Knoxville College was one of the 
best in its history. The total attendance in all departments was 
218. One student graduated from the Theological Department, 
two from the Medical Department, and one from the Classical 
Department. Owing to the lengthening of the Normal Course 
one year there was no graduating class in this department.’ This 
makes the Normal Course equal to the full Preparatory Course 
for the Collegiate Department. , 
Knoxville College is under the control of the Board of Mis- 
sions to the Freedmen of the United Presbyterian Church of 
North America. . This board is located at Pittsburg, Pa. By 
arrangement with the University of Tennessee the College is also 
the Industrial Department of the university for colored students. 
For this purpose the university has added largely to the equip- 
ment of the Agricultural Department and the Mechanical De- 
partment, provides for the salaries of the professors of these de- 
partments, and sets aside $600 annually to pay for the labor of 
students in these departments. The same conditions prevail in 
Knoxville College regarding free tuition for State students as 
prevail in the university for white students. State students are 
assigned work in one of the industrial departments, if they de- 
sire it, and receive compensation in proportion to the work ac- 
complished. Thus they are enabled to earn somewhat of their 
expenses, and especially is each one taught a trade. Aside from
-P-A-G-E-328
— 317 — 
the funds received from the university as indicated above, the 
College is supported by voluntary contributions of the church. 
Knoxville College stands for the most thorough training possi- 
ble in an intellectual way, and at. the same time provides for the 
most helpful industrial training. It is in hearty sympathy with 
all efforts to teach the trades to the colored people, and is main- 
taining a thorough Industrial Department for that purpose. At 
the same time the literary standard is not lowered one whit, but 
is being constantly elevated. . The courses of study offered are 
Classical, Scientific, Medical, Theological, Normal, and Liter- 
ary. The Industrial Department offers training in Agriculture. 
Carpentering, Electric Work, Printing, Sewing. and House- 
work, The Agricultural Department is not confined to the 
twenty-two acres of land owned by the College, but a considera- 
able tract adjoining is rented, and gives employment to a large 
number of students. An electric light plant is run entirely by 
the students, and by it all the buildings are lighted. A steam- 
heating plant, also run by the students, heats the various build- 
ings. The Printing Department is under the direction of a 
thorough and practical printer. Besides doing all the printing 
for the College, a large amount of job work is done for outside 
parties. A large cylinder press, run by steam, does the heavier 
work, while job presses do the lighter work. Thus the students 
are trained in all that prepares one for taking charge of a job 
printing office. , 
The College oceupies a commanding site on one of the hills 
made historic by the siege of Knoxville during the Civil War. 
The buildings consist of the Recitation Hall, MeCulloch Hall 
(Boys’ Dormitory), Elnathan Hall (Girls’ Dormitory), Boys’ 
Home, Girls’ Home, Mechanical Building, Heating Plant, Presi- 
dent’s Cottage and Barn. Its property is valued at $100,000. 
The only building erected during the past year is a greenhouse, 
which will materially add to the equipment of the Agricultural 
Department. While the students come from all the Southern 
States and many of the Northern States, yet Tennessee furnishes 
by far the larger number. 
There have been ten State Normal students in attendance dur-
-P-A-G-E-329
, — 318 — 
ing the year, under appointment by State Senators, and thus en- 
titled to the State Normal Scholarship of $50. 
The work that the College is doing is best seen: in the lives of 
those who have gone out from it. The profession of teaching 
elaims the larger number; but these, for the most part, do not 
confine their efforts to the one profession, but teach both by ex- 
ample and precept some manual art—farming, sewing, printing, 
or some other useful occupation. While in College, students 
are taught that labor is honorable. ‘They are encouraged to go 
back to their homes and devote their lives to the uplifting of their 
fellow-beings in the communities where they have been brought 
up. 
The expenses in the College are merely nominal. Tuition is 
only 50 cents a month. Boarding, heat, light, furnished room, 
and tuition are charged for at the rate of $6.35 a month. Very 
little charity help is given, but by furnishing work to worthy 
students and keeping the expenses at the very lowest, self-help is 
encouraged and the foundation laid for useful citizenship. 
R. W. WGRANAHAN, President. 
MORRISTOWN NORMAL COLLEGE. 
Sir: The year was closed with the spring session, and was in 
many respects the most successful of our institution. We had a 
much larger eurollment of students from abroad than in any 
previous year. ‘The Faculty was increased by the addition of 
three teachers, making the total number in the Faculty fifteen. 
The course of sindy for the Normal Department was revised, so 
that it now affords a complete and thorough training for the edu- 
vation of teachers. The course covers a period of four years, 
and will compare favorably with that in any Normal school in 
the country. During the year a Commercial Department wae 
organized and placed in charge of a competent instructor. Not 
only is a course given in Bookkeeping and Business Training,
-P-A-G-E-330
— 819 — 
but also in Stenography and ‘l'ypewriting, thus opening a new 
field of usefulness to our students. The Musical Department 
has been much improved by the addition of a number of pianos 
and organs. 
For the coming year we have arranged to open a Department 
of Nurse Training. A full and comprehensive course of study 
has been prepared, and an opportunity will be given the students 
in the practical work of taking care of the sick. 
The building formerly used as a dormitory will be remodeled 
and fitted with machinery, tools, etc., for the Boys’ Industrial 
Department. Various useful trades will be taught under expe- 
vienced instructors. 
Crary Hall, which is one of the best buildings of its kind in 
the South, was opened for the first time last year. It has 100 
rooms, which are well furnished; a magnificent dining room and 
kitchen, in which the work is done by the students. . The build- 
ing is thoroughly heated by furnaces and lighted by electricity. 
The Girls’ Industrial Department has been in successful oper- 
ation for nine years, and continues to give satisfaction and most 
excellent results. Every girl in connection with the school re- 
ceives training in all the arts of domestic economy, including 
dressmaking and millinery. 
During the year we have paid off all the incumbrances, so 
that to-day the property, costing $75,000, is free from debt. 
The outlook for the coming year is most hopeful.

INSTRUCTIONS GOVERNING THE EXAMINATION 
OF CANDIDATES FOR COUNTY 
SUPERINTENDENT. 
The examination of those who expect to be candidates for 
County Superintendent will be held on October 1, 2, and 8 at 
the county seat, and on no other date. Questions have been pre- 
pared upon every subject provided by law to be taught in the 
public schools. These questions are mailed direct to the Exam- 
ining Board in three envelopes, upon the outside of which are 
indicated the subjects contained in them and the date when such 
subjects shall be given to applicants. 
The Board of Examiners shall meet daily at 8:30 each morn- 
ing, and, in the presence of the applicants, break the seal and 
open the envelope containing questions for that day only. The 
questions should be placed upon a blackboard, subject by sub- 
ject, and each subject should be completed before another is 
placed upon the board. No communication shall be permitted 
among applicants, and it would be best if they could occupy sep- 
arate seats. After questions are placed upon the board, no ap- 
plicant should be permitted to leave the room until the exami- 
nation upon that subject is completed. If the applicant does 
leave the room, such person. should not be permitted to answer 
questions then on the board upon his return. 
I recommend that the board, after the first morning, fix the 
hour for opening, closing, and dinner. So arrange the exam-
-P-A-G-E-353
— 338 — 
ination that the subject upon the board will be entirely com- 
pleted before adjournment for dinner, and that in the afternoon 
the subject then upon the board shall be completed before ad- 
journment for the day. 
The especial duty of the three men appointed by the chairman 
of the County Court is to see that this examination is conducted 
fairly and impartially. Simply place the questions upon the 
board; let each applicant for himself answer the questions; do 
not permit conversation among applicants or friends; let the ex~ 
amination be so conducted that there can be no question about 
its fairness. I desire that the applicants receive grades upon 
their answers fairly and freely made, without. aid or assistance 
from any source. 
Let each applicant write his name and address an‘l county 
upon every sheet of paper used in answering the questions, so 
that the papers may not he confused when transmitted to me. 
When the examination is completed, all papers should be se- 
eurely packed in one bundle and either mailed or expressed to 
me, at Nashville, and with them this certificate: 
“ The examination of applicants for County Superintendent 
was conducted by the committee appointed by the chairman 
and in accordance with the regulations of the State Superintend- 
ent in every respect. No communication was permitted among 
applicants and no aid was allowed any person, and in all other 
respects the specific instructions of the State Superintendent 
were followed; and this examination was honestly, fairly, and 
impartially conducted.” 
The questions should be returned to this office at once, so that 
papers can be graded and applicants notified of the result.

give comfort and pleasure to its visitors. 
Every Southern State will he represented, and a number of 
them by hundreds of educators; and I hope that the school-teach- 
ers and school officials of Tennessee will attend this association 
in Jarge numbers, not only for the good to be accomplished, but 
in order to personally welcome this educational association and 
convince those from our sister States that our public schools, col- 
leges, and universities are not surpassed in power, influence, and 
excellence by these of other States. Every county in the State 
should be represented at this association by its County Super- 
inlendent and a large number of its teachers.

To Public School Teachers and Officials: 
The thirteenth annual meeting of the State Public School Of- 
ficers’ Association will be held in the Tulane Auditorium, this 
city, on January 16, 17, and 18. I call your attention to the 
interesting programme inclosed, and assure you that every ar- 
rangement necessary will be made for your comfort and pleas- 
ure while attending. this meeting. All City Superintendents, 
County Superintendents, ex-County Superintendents, and pub- 
lic school teachers in Tennessee are eligible to membership; and 
it is not only a privilege, but a duty which the teachers and pub- 
lic school officials in Tennessee owe to their schools and to them- 
selves, to become members of this association and active partici- 
pants in all.its preceedings. It would be gratifying to see at 
this State meeting every County Superintendent, with a repre- 
sentative body of his teachers, those interested in public schools, 
in amendments to the public school law, in raising the standard 
of teachers, and in every way bettering educational conditions in 
Tennessee, assemble in the capital city annually, and IT urge you 
to attend this gathering and enroll yourself as a permanent mem- 
ber of the organization. I shall ask County Superintendents 
and Directors to give especial credit in every possible way to 
these teachers who attend regularly our Teachers’ Associations, 
County and State Institutes.

I hope to be able to definitely announce, at an early date, the 
times and places where I will hold the six State Institutes this

summer. In addition to these six Institutes, two for each Grand 
Division, I will be able to aid some of the counties in their 
County Institute work. I will announce the times and places of 
holding State Institutes at an early date in order that no County 
Institute will be purposely commenced at a time which will con- 
flict with the work of the State Institutes. I believe the County 
Superintendents, on learning the date of these Institutes, will fix 
the time of their county meetings either before or after the State 
Institute located nearest them. In order that I may have be- 
fore me full information, you will please inform me: 
1. Will you have an Institute this year? 
What date had you expected to have it# 
3. How long will it continue? 
4, What was the length of your Institute last year ? 
5. Who aided you in conducting it? . 
6. If your Instructor was paid, from what source did he re- 
ceive his pay ? : 
7. When did you receive State aid in your county, and what 
was the amount of it? 
Task these questions so that I may have information before me 
which will enable me to fairly and practically distribute my aid 
tothe work. Please answer in inclosed envelope at your earliest 
convenience. Yours very truly,

To County Superintendents: 
The last Legislature amended the law relative to the election 
of School Directors in certain districts by providing in Chapter 
218, page 471, Acts of 1899, that: : 
“Tt shall be the duty of the Commissioners or other officers of 
elections in the various counties of this State to open and hold
-P-A-G-E-373
— 356 — 
elections in the varions school districts of this State on the fourth - 
Saturday in May, 1900, and biennially thereafter, for the pur- 
pose of electing three School Directors for each school district; 
provided, that this Act shall not apply to any county in this State 
where school districts and civil districts are coextensive, or may 
hereafter he made so; provided, this Act shall not apply to incor 
porated towns which have a sehool system of their own; provided, 
this Act shall also inchide districts composed of portions of dif- 
ferent counties. Said election shall be held and governed by 
and under the laws now governing general electicns, except that 
these elections shall be held at the schoolhors2s in the various 
schoo] districts, or such other places as said election officer may 
direct, and that the polls shall be opened at 1 o’elock P.M., and 
shall be closed at 5 o’clock P.M.; and the ofticers holding said 
elections shall not receive any compensation therefor.” 
Different constructions having been placed upon the intent 
and effect of this Aet, [ addressed a letter to the Attorney-general 
for che State asking his construction of the clauses quoted herein, 
and his opinion is contained in the following letter: 
“ Knoxville, February 2, 1960.—Lon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, 
Nashville, Tenn.—Dear Sir: Replying to your letter of recent 
date, requesting my opinion upon certain matters relating to the 
clection of District School Directors. Prior to Chapter 218, 
Acts of 1899, it seems that all elections of [istrict School Di- 
rectors were had at the regular August election and at the regu- 
jar voting places in the several districts, This system operated 
satisfactorily in all cases where the school district was coexten- 
sive with the civil district, but was obviously very unsatisfactory 
where the school districts and the civil dist 
sive. In the latter case it usually happened at a regular election       
ets Were not coexten- 
  that the voters of a school district could not all attend and vote 
at the same regular voting place. The civil district being com- 
posed of portions of two or more school districts, the voters were 
seattered and much confusion raised as to the election of Schoo! 
Directors. To obviate this diiliculty seems to have been the ob: 
ject of the Act of 1899. That Act leaves the former law re- 
quiring the election of School Directors at a regular voting
-P-A-G-E-374
— 357 — 
place and at the regular election in August in all cases where the 
school districts and civil districts are coextensive and in all incor- 
porated towns haviug a school system of their own. In this re- 
gard the law has not been changed by the Act of 1899, but un- 
der the Act of 1899, where its school district or school districts 
in any county are not. coextensive with the civil districts, or 
where a school district includes parts of civil districts situated in 
different counties, the election for the District School Directors 
is required to be held on the fourth Saturday in May, 1900, and 
biennially thereafter. ‘The Act fixes the place of holding the 
election in such places—not at the required polling places, but 
at: the schoolhouses in the various districts, or at such other places 
as the Election Commissioners may select. 
“T am of the opinion that the Act applies to any school dis- 
trict. in any county which is not coextensive with the civil dis- 
trict, although there may be other school districts in that county 
which do correspond with the civil districts. School Directors 
elected under the Act of 1899 are required to enter upon their 
duties within thirty days of their election, just as those elected 
under former Acts are required to do. 
“ Yours very truly, 
“G. W. PICKLE, Attorney-general.” 
From the opinion of the Attorney-general, in which I fully 
eoneur, it will be seen that this Act leaves the former law in full 
force and effect in all cases where the school districts and civil 
districts are coextensive, and in such districts the election for 
School Directors should be held at the regular August election, 
as heretofore. In all other districts the election should be held 
on the fourth Saturday in May, 1900—that is, if in any county 
there is a civil district and school district coextensive, an election 
should be held in August; but where a school district is composed 
of only a part of a civil district, or a part of two civil districts in 
a county, or a part of two civil districts in adjoining counties, 
then in all such cases the election should be held on the fourth 
Saturday in May, 1900. In all cases where school districts and 
civil districts are coextensive an election for Directors should be
-P-A-G-E-375
— 358 — 
held in August; in all other cases the election should be held 
on the fourth Saturday in May. This construction should not 
be misunderstood. 
It is the duty of the County Superintendent to ascertain the 
exact status of the school and civil districts in his county and to 
confer with the commissioners of election for his county and see 
that publication is made and that the election is conducted in 
May, in accordance with the provisions of this Act. If in any 
district a voting place has not been established, it is the duty of 
the Commissioners of Election for the county in which such dis- 
trict is located to designate some plaée—a schoolhouse or other 
place convenient to the voters—for holding the election, -appoint 
officers, and in all other respects supervise this election in ac 
cordance with the law, just as other elections at other times ure 
held. All Directors should qualify within thirty days after 
their election. Directors now in office should leave the selection. 
of teachers for the fall term of schools to their suecessors to be 
elected in May. 
Yours very truly, 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK, 
State Superintendent. 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Devartmenr or Posric Lysrrvcrion, 
Nashville, March 13, 1900. 
To County Superintendents, School Officers, and Teachers: 
Complaints are daily coming to this office against, the method 
of sale and the irregwiar and unlawful purchase of school charts 
and other apparatus in many counties of the State. There are 
excellent works of this kind upon the market, and some of them 
are legitimately sold at reasonable prices, and with such trans- 
actions I have nothing to do, provided purchases are made in a 
lawful manner. The Directors of Tennessee have already ex- 
pended more than $200,000 of the public school funds for charts, 
etc., for the schools. The fact that more than seventy-five per
-P-A-G-E-376
— 859 — 
cent of such publications now in the schools are not used proves 
conclusively that the purchase of them was a mistake, and that 
a large amount of money has already been wasted. I have never 
advised any Superintendent, teacher, or Director to make any 
purchase of this kind, and will not do so during my term of of- 
fice. Though often asked for an opinion by agents and pub- 
lishers, I have given my opinion of but one article; and, finding 
that that was misused and purposely misconstrued by certain 
' agents, I revoked it. 
No person or publisher has any right or authority to use or to 
quote me as indorsing any publication. On the other hand, it is 
my opinion that the Directors should not make such purchases 
as long as the school term is less than ninety days annually and 
teachers are paid on an average less than $30 per month for these 
short terms. : : 
Agents are now saying to Directors in many counties that the 
Text-book Commission has adopted charts, and that that Com- 
mission under the Jaw requires their use in publie schools. This 
false statement is made knowingly by these agents in order to 
deceive the Directors, and such sales upon such incorrect state- 
ments are void, and the County Superintendent should at once 
notify the Trustee not to pay the warrant. The Text-book Com- 
mission has not adopted, and will not adopt, these charts or rec- 
ommend their use. Complaints of such deception and improper 
conduct on the part of agents have come to me from so many 
counties in the State that [ feel it my duty to call the attention 
of school officials to the reprehensible methods employed in such 
sales. It is the duty of the Directors for each district to meet 
and organize by electing one of their number chairman and an- 
other secretary, and no business can be lawfully transacted un- 
less the Directors are convened in actual session. Directors 
should not sign warrants in the hands of an agent and permit 
him to go alone to the other Directors, seeing each of them sep- 
arately and making such statements as will effect a sale in many 
cases. When such sales are made, the County Superintendent 
should refuse to approve the warrant issued; and when the Trus- 
tee pays such warrant, he and the Directors are liable in a civil
-P-A-G-E-377
— 360 — 
action for its amount, and it is the duty of the County Superin- 
tendent to institute proceedings for its recovery. 
In counties where this wanton profligacy of the public school 
fund exists the Superintendent should obey the law, protect the 
school fund, and, if he doubts his authority in any particular 
case, confer with the State Superintendent. Directors have a 
great deal of latitude in the management. of school affairs, but 
their duties are well defined and the law says what they shall 
and shal] not do. Publishers have a right to offer their products 
in an open market and at reasonable prices, and Directors, before 
spending the publie school fund, should meet as the law requires 
and satisfy themselves that they need such publication, that it 
would be used if bought, that it is worth the price asked, and 
that such purchase will not shorten the term of school or decrease 
the teacher’s salary. 
T hope to have the earnest codperation of Superintendents, 
teachers, and Directors in this matter; and, if necessary, we 
should invoke the aid of courts to protect the public school fund.

STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Department or Pustic Instruction, 
Nashville, April 17, 1900. 
To County Superintendents: 
On June 29, 1899, the Text-book Commission adopted the in- 
closed list of text-books for use in the public schools of Tennessee.
-P-A-G-E-379
— 362 — 
Contracts were made with publishers to furnish such books at the 
prices fixed by the Commission for a period of five years. The 
publishers, in aceordance with the law, entered into contracts 
with the Commission to exchange the new books for old books in 
use in the schools prior to this adoption until the first day of May, 
1900, receiving old books in accordance with the exchange prices 
quoted, which prices are not in any case more than one-half the 
price of the new book or books. On the back of each book are 
printed the contract and exchange prices, the contract price: be- 
ing that which the purchaser pays for a new book and the ex- 
change price the amount which the purchaser must pay for a 
certain book when offering an old book in exchange for it. I 
call your attention to this adoption and to these terms of the con- 
tracts in order that you may immediately communicate with 
teachers and Directors in your county, so that each person who 
has not already exchanged the old books will not negleet to do 
so. The time is now limited in which exchanges can be made, 
and I hope you will urge those interested to make the exchanges 
at once. Notify them that old books will not be received in ex- 
change for new ones after midnight of May 1,1900. This ap- 
plies to books adopted on June 29, 1899, and to all books adopted 
by the Commission, except Geology of Tennessee, History of 
Tennessee, Mental and Higher Arithmetic, which books can be 
exchanged until November 15 of this year. Do not allow your 
people to misunderstand these limitations as to exchange or to 
confuse the two adoptions. 
Yours very truly, 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK, 
State Superintendent.

To County Superintendents: 
I have located nine State Peabody Institutes for the teachers 
of Tennessee—six for white teachers and three for colored teach-
-P-A-G-E-380

ers. The Institutes are located at the following places, with 
corresponding dates: 
For white teachers: 
CLARKSVILLE, JUNE 11; 
UNION CITY, JUNE 11; * 
JACKSON, JUNE 11; 
COOKEVILLE, JUNE 18; 
CLEVELAND, JULY 2; 
GREENEVILLE, JULY 2. 
For colored teachers: 
NASHVILLE, JUNE 11; 
UNION CITY, JUNE 11; 
KNOXVILLE, JUNE 11. 
You will notice that two Institutes for white teachers and one 
for colored teachers are located at practical distances in each 
Grand Division, so that all teachers who desire may attend some 
one of them. These Institutes will continue four weeks, each 
Tnstitute having four Instructors, and the work will embrace all 
subjects required by law to be taught in the Primary and Sec- 
ondary public schools of the State as heretofore. 
I give you this information at this time with the hope that you 
will fix the time and place of meeting for your County Institute, 
so that it will not conflict with the State Institute most accessible 
to your teachers. In a few days I will communicate to you the 
names of all the Instructors for the various Institutes, and in 
that communication I will give you full and specific information. 
concerning the work to be done, certificates to be issued, railroad 
rates, board, etc. 
The work of the State Institutes last year was most encourag- 
ing and satisfactory, and, with your hearty codperation, the at- 
tendance can be largely increased and the many benefits of In- 
stitute instruction carried into the schools of the State.

A State Normal Institute will be held at Clarksville, beginning on 
Monday, June 11, 1900, and continuing four weeks. This Institute is 
free to all teachers who will attend it, and the public school teachers of 
Middle Tennessee are urged to take advantage of the practical, thor- 
ough, and professional work thus offered. Capt. W. R. Garrett, former 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, a teacher of experience, 
and at present a professor in the Peabody Normal College, has been 
selected as Conductor, and will be assisted by Superintendents Fred. 
J. Page, P. L, Harned, and S. E. Hunt, all capable and efficient Instruct- 
ors. 
Instructors have been selected because of their ability, experience, 
success, and recognized efficiency im school work in all its departments. 
This is a summer school of methods for teachers, and the work will 
embrace all subjects required.by law to be taught in the Primary and 
Secondary public schools of Tennessee. The work will be thorough, 
practical, systematic, and in accordance with the most improved meth- 
ods of teaching, school management, and supervision. The Institute 
is a business institution for teachers, and is conducted by authority 
of the State and under the supervision of the State Superintendent. 
The Conductor, as the presiding officer, after conference with the 
members of the Faculty, will assign Instructors and teachers their 
work from day to day, determine the order of business, the time of 
meeting, the number of hours consumed daily, and, upon advice of the 
members, will make other necessary regulations for the convenience 
of the teachers and the success of the Institute. 
Supplementary work, lectures upon school law, school manage- 
ment, the best method of conducting Institutes, etc., will be an impor- 
tant feature, All local arrangements will be made by the Citizens’ 
Committee. 
ROLL OF HONOR CERTIFICATES. 
  
The State Institutes were established, and are now maintained, ae 
summer schools for teachers. Under the law, all teachers must be 
examined annually, except those holding diplomas from the Peabody 
Normal College or those receiving certificates from a State Institute. 
The course requires two years for completion. The Primary Course 
should be taken the first year and the Secondary Course the second 
year. Teachers, however, may take the work in either the Primaty 
Course or the Secondary Course at will. Any teacher may take the 
Primary examination, but the Secondary examination will not be al- 
lowed any teacher, except such person as may present a Primary Cer- 
tifieate from a State Institute. All teachers taking the Primary 
Course, who stand a satisfactory examination, will be given a certifi- 
eate freeing them from county examination for one year; all teachers 
who successfully pass an examination upon the Secondary branches 
will be given a Roll of Honor Certificate, which exempts them from 
examination for a ‘period of four years. No teacher will be permitted 
to stand either examination or receive either certificate unless such 
teacher has attended this or another State Institute at least fifteen 
days. 
There will be a Secretary of the Faculty, whose duty will be to 
keep a correct record of the daily attendance. Certificates will be 
signed by the State Superintendent, the Conductor, and the Secretary 
of the Institute.

Regulations Governing the Examination and Certification of 
Public School Teachers by the County Superintend- 
ents of Public Instruction. 
THE LAW. 
It shall be the duty of the State Superintendent “to prescribe 
the mode of examining and licensing school-teachers, and their 
necessary qualifications.” (Section 7, Subsection 9.) 
It shall be tha duty of the County Superintendent “ to per- 
form such duties in relation to the examination of teachers, and 
issuing to them certificates of qualification, as may be required 
of him by the State Superintendent.” (Section 9, Subsec- 
tion 4.) 
“To observe such directions and regulations as the State 
Superintendent of Schools may from time to time prescribe.” 
(Section 9, Subsection 6.) 
“No teacher of public schools shall be employed, or receive 
any pay from the public funds, unless he or she have a certificate 
of qualification, given to him or her by the County Superintend- 
ent for the county within which he or she is employed.” (See 
tion 26.) 
“ Diplomas shall be granted to those who honorably complete 
the course of study prescribed in Normal schools established by 
the State Board of Edueation, and possession of such diploma 
shall exempt the holder thereof from the examination prescribed 
as a condition precedent. to employment in the public schools of 
the State, any such graduate being eligible as a teacher in any 
county of the State.” (Section 54, Subsection 8.) 
REGULATIONS OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION, 
Under authority of the State Board of Education, the Pea- 
body Normal College, at Nashville, issues certificates and di-
-P-A-G-E-387
—— 370 — 
plomas to graduates, which exempt the holders from examina- 
tion before the County Superintendents. 
“ Parties holding Roll of Honor Certificates issued by the 
State or Peabody Institutes shall be exempt from examination 
for Teachers’ Certificates in any of the counties in the State; 
provided that no certificate hereafter issued by any such Insti- 
tute, or Conductor thereof, shall be good for a period exceeding 
four years from date of issuance.” (Minute Book, 1899.) 
Heretofore Life Certificates have been issued, exempting 
teachers from further examination; but the above action of the 
State Board means that Life Certificates are forbidden, and 
that all who stand examinations this or any succeeding year’ shall 
be granted certificates which will expire four years from date, 
instead of for life. This ruling does not interfere with parties 
now holding Life Certificates. 
“ATl persons who are exempt from examination for Teachers’ 
Certificates by authority of the State Board of Education shall 
conform to the requirements of the State Superintendent as 
to the time when said persons shall make application. to the 
County Superintendent for Teachers’ Certificates.” (Minute 
Book, 1895, page 29.) . 
REGULATIONS OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT.

ates of the State Normal Colleges, of the State Peabody Insti- 
tutes, and to all who shall average in examination at least 85 on 
the following subjects: 
Orthography, Reading, Writing, Mental Arithmetic, Written. 
Arithmetic, English Grammar, Geography, History of Tennes- 
see, History of the United States, Physiology and Hygiene, Ele-

Institute; provided that such certificates shall not be issued, 
without examination, after one year from the time such State 
Peabody Institute was held. Examinations for Primary Cer 
tificates shall be held on the following subjects: 
Orthography, Reading, Writing, Mental Arithmetic, Written 
Arithmetic, English Grammar, Geography, History of Tennes- 
see, History of the United States, Physiology and Hygiene, The- 
ory and Practice of Teaching, and School Law. 
TIMES OF EXAMINATIONS. 
County Superintendents are requested to hold publie exami- 
nations at the following times, and to give no private examina- 
tions: 
Annual Examination—First Friday and Saturday in July. 
Second Examination—First Friday and Saturday in August. 
Quarterly Examination—First Friday and Saturday in Octo- 
ber. 
Quarterly Examination-—First Friday and Saturday in Jan- 
ary. 
Quarterly Examination — First’ Friday and Saturday in 
March. 
All certificates expire at the close of the scholastic year, June 
30. 
Instructions are hereby given to issue no certificate to any 
applicant—eraduate of the State Normal College or of any 
State Peabody Institute—except at the dates above specified. 
If the two days named are not sufficient to conclude the examina-
-P-A-G-E-389
—~ 872 — 
tion of applicants, continue from day to day until the work is 
finished. 
Have’ your examinations on these dates, and no other. Let 
them be nniform. “Under no cireumstances hold individual or 
private examinations. One whole day, at least, is necessary for 
the Primary examination, and it will require two whole davs for 
a satisfactory examination for the Secondary Course. Treat 
all teachers with absolute justice, fairness, and impartiality. 
This can be done by fixing the time for examination, the place, 
the number of hours to be consumed, and making no. exception 
for or against any person or teacher. I recommend a strict, 
thorough, practical, and uniform examination on all the branches 
as prescribed by law. You have no right to license any person 
to teach school who is not worthy and well qualified and of the 
highest moral character and personal worth. License no others, 
it mattars not what their grades may be. 
A Teachers’ Institute should be held in each county, and every 
teacher in the county, whether exempt. from examinat'on or not, 
should be encouraged to attend. It is recommended that these 
Institutes be held so as to close on the first, Friday and Saturday 
in July, the date of the annual examination. 
The best teachers usually attend County Institutes. I, there- 
fore, recommend that those teachers in your county who attend 
regularly your County Institutes and Teachers’ Meetings be 
given due credit for the same by you in your annua] examina- 
tion for Teachers’ Certificates. 
TEACHERS EXEMPT FROM EXAMINATION. 
1. Graduates of the Peabody Normal College. 
2. Graduates of State Peabody Institutes. 
You should examine all applicants for certificates, except 
those expressly enumerated herein. The fact. that a teacher is 
a graduate of some school or college does not. free him from 
examination. Examinations are not hardships upon thoroughly 
qualified teachers, and you have no other way under the law to 
test. the teacher’s fitness and ability, except by an examination. 
Examine applicants for First Grade and Second Grade Cer-
-P-A-G-E-390
373 — 
tificates, not exempt from such examination, in Theory and 
Practice of Teaching, and School Law; and applicants for 
Third Grade Certificates in Theory and Practice of Teaching. 
A public school certificata is not a lieensa to teach school, nei- 
ther is a public school diploma. Do not issue a certificate to 
an incompetent person, no matter what pressure mav be brought 
to bear. Use every means possible to improve the teachers of 
your respective counties. Urge upon them the value of attend- ~ 
ing Institutes, reading school journals and professional litera- 
ture. Start a Teachers’ Library, if one has not already bean 
established, and encourage Reading Circles.

for me to submit this report, with tabulated statement, unless

adjournment of your Institute, the names of the Instructors em- 
ployed, the number of teachers in attendance, ths number of 
certificates issued, and such other matters as will be of interest 
to your teachers and the public. .

instances, do not readily submit their reports, and in some cases 
those heretofore submitted have been incomplete. The State Su-

submitted by the City and County Superintendents. You will 
notica in the report recently mailed to you from this office sta- 
tistical tables which should be of interest. to schoolmen. These 
tables are not complete, because many Superintendents failed to 
make complete and satisfactory reports. T am satisfied that 
you want your town represented fully, and that, in the work of 
preparing my Annual Report, soon to be submitted to the Gov-

Dear Sir: 
T have just mailed you a copy of my Annual Report. This 
report was delayed largely because: those in charge of institu- 
tions supported in part or in whole by the State neglected to 
make report as they were requested to do. The law fixes the 
time when my report shall be submitted to the Governor, and 
this year I shall endeavor to comply with the law. I now request 
that, you send me, within the next twenty days, an account of 
the work done in your institution during the scholastic: year 
ending June 30. I desire that this report from you shall con- 
tain material enough to make five or six printed pages in the

attention to this matter.

To County Superintendents and Teachers: : 
The Tennessee State Teachers’ Association will meet at Mont- 
eagle, July 24, and its sessions will continue four days. Re 
duced hotel and railroad rates have been secured, and every 
arrangement for the accommodation. of the teachers of the State 
has been made. Reductions in, these rates are so reasonable 
that the cost. of attending this meeting will amount to but little. 
Monteagle is a delightful summer resort. Its hotel accommo- 
dations are excellent, and halls suitable for our meetings have 
been secured. 
This is an important business meeting of educators of Ten- 
nessee. At this session matters affecting public and private 
schools, high schools, and colleges will be discussed, and. the pro- 
gramme has been especially arranged so that every interest of 
popular education in Tennessee will be represented. These 
meetings are invaluable to our schools, and should be attended 
by every teacher in the State. The State Teachers’ Association. 
has much to do with shaping legislation in the interest of educa- 
tion, and its recommendations will have much weight with 
the incoming Legislature. It is proper that schoolmen should 
assemble annually, and, as the representatives of their schools, 
discuss educational matters, methods of teaching and needed 
legislation, and codperate in all matters of concern to our schools 
and the State. . 
I urge you to attend this Association, and to induce others of 
your county and your locality to go with you. If Superintend-

ents and teachers in Tennessee will take that interest. in our 
State Association that they should, we will convince other States 
that our system. is as good as theirs, and that our teachers are 
more active, more capable, and more efficient, and at the same 
time render material and permanent aid to the cause in which 
we are all so much interested.

To County Superintendents and Public School Teachers: 
Section 56 of the Public School Laws makes it the duty of 
the County Superintendent to designate some day in November 
as “Arbor Day ” for the public schools of the State. I respect- 
fully suggest that you appoint Friday, November 16, rext. T 
am not authorized to fix the day and manner of this ce’ebration, 
but suggest this date in order that all the schools in Tennessee 
may, on the same day, plant, trees about the schoolhouses of the 
State. It adds to their comfort, renders them more beautiful, 
and is ever an indication of refinement and culture, and the 
day’s work well done will merit and receive the grateful com- 
mendation of those who succeed us. 
I hope that “Arbor Day ” will be appropriately observed with 
songs, exercises, and the planting of trees by the hundreds of 
thousands of boys and girls attending the public schoo!s of Ten- 
nessee. The day can be made one of social pleasure as well as 
substantia] and permanent improvement.

tion. The Executive Committee has endeavored to present for 
discussion subjects of vital interest’ to you and of great impor- 
tance to the public schools of the State. T believe that this will 
be the best meeting of the Association, and I have reason to hope 
that its attendance. will be verv large. T appeal to you to use 
your efforts and influence to induce the teachers in your county 
to come with you to this meeting. The State Legislature will be 
in session during that time, and you will have an opportunity 
personally and as a member of the Association to impress upon 
the members of our General Assembly needed changes and. 
amendments in existing public school laws. All public school 
teachers and officials, as well as City and County Superintend- 
ents, are eligible to membership in the Association. This Ass»-

Committee. 
The following report of the Committee on School Law was 
unanimously adopted : 
Mr. President: 
The special committee appointed by this Association to suggest to 
the incoming Legislature some perfecting amendments to our school 
laws is of opinion that conservatism and discretion should control this 
representative body in all of its actions and in all of its recommenda- 
tions to the Tennessee Legislature. The committee believes it to be 
the duty of the State to train its teachers; to raise the standard of 
teachers; to foster education in all its branches; to magnify the office 
of County Superintendent, to give him a salary commensurate to the 
duties performed; to increase assessments, State and county, untir 
reasonable salaries are paid efficient teachers and longer terms guar- 
anteed to pupils—terms in the rural districts equal in length to those 
in towns and cities. There should be specific legislation fixing the 
time and manner of election, of qualification and induction into office 
of Directors, County Superintendents, and all other school officials. 
Their powers shoyld be increased and penalties fixed for failure to dis- 
charge official duties as the law directs. Uniformity in school affairs, 
in the time and manner of election, in beginning and ending of schools, 
in the examining and licensing of teachers by the State, is desired. 
The committee, therefore, recommends that the Committee on School 
Laws be directed to ask the incoming Legislature to pass amendatory 
laws as follows: 
. 1. The levy by the State of increased taxes for school purposes;
-P-A-G-E-404
~~ 387 — 
amendments to existing laws conferring upon County Courts power 
ta levy county taxes sufficient to run the schools in counties as our 
original law intended, such taxes to be reasonable and their levy dis- 
eretionary with the court, but in no case restricted, limited, or in any 
way controlled by levies made by the State. 
2. The Legislature should repeal all Acts creating special school 
districts and those authorizing County Courts to create new school 
districts. The civil district and schvol district should be coextensive, 
and this can be accomplished by one general] Act, the passage of which 
we urge. 
3. The Legislature should enact a general law repealing all existing 
laws concerning the election of School Directors, and then provide that 
Directors be elected biennially in August; that they qualify not later 
than September 1, and in specific terms state the duties and powers of 
Directors, and with especial reference to the selection of teachers and 
the management of schools. 
4, The signature and official approval of the County Superintendenr 
of all school warrants, except for teachers’ salaries, is right, and no 
warrant should be paid without such approval. Penalties should be 
placed upon violation of this law by either Superintendents or Trus- 
tees. 
5. The County Superintendent’s salary should be commensurate with 
services rendered, and of such amount as will justify him in devoting 
all his time to the duties of his office. A minimum and reasonable sal- 
ary should be fixed by the Legislature, one below which the County 
Court cannot go, and then the court left free to raise such salary at 
will. 
6. Many efficient teachers desire State certificates and the avoidance 
of county examinations and their consequent inconveniences. Your 
committee favors a State Board of Examiners, whose duty shall be to 
prepare questions and annually conduct examinations at fixed times 
and places for teachers: desiring State certificates. The committee 
doubts the propriety of making this at this time mandatory, and is, 
therefore, of the opinion that County Superintendents should examine 
and license teachers as heretofore, the State Board of Examiners 
to conduct examinaticns for the State. A brief time will test and com- 
mend the efficiency and desirability of State examination of teachers; 
and when this occurs, the State will be prepared for it. 
7. There should be legislation giving power to State Superintend- 
ents to require reports from County Superintendents and County Trus- 
tees about all matters affecting the public schools of the State and nec~ 
essary information for the preparation of his annual report. A pens 
alty should be fixed, specific in its terms, for the failure or refusal of 
County Superintendents to make these reports. The County Super- 
intendent should have the same right, the same authority, and the 
same power to ask and receive reports from Directors and from teach-
-P-A-G-E-405
— 388.— 
ers, and power should be given him to compel the prompt transmission 
of such reports. There is no reason why reports should be required 
for duties mentioned unless the law goes further and makes it imper- 
-ative upon officials to comply with its provisions.

port: 
‘We, your committee, beg leave to make the following report: 
Whereas it is the desire of the teachers of the private schools of Te

PUBLIC SCHOOL OFFICERS’ 
ASSOCIATION. 
The Thirteenth annual meeting of the State Publie School 
Officers’ Association was held in the auditorium of the Tulane 
Hotel, Nashville, on January 16-18, 1900. The attendance 
was larger than at any previous meeting, The Association was 
called to order by President P. L. Harned, of Clarksville, After 
prayer by Rev. J. O. Rust, pastor of the East Nashville Bap- 
tist Church, the President introduced Gov. Benton McMillin, 
who delivered a cordial address of welcome. This was responded 
to by Superintendent T. C. Gordon, of Dyersburg, on behalf of 
the Association. President. Harned then delivered his annual 
address. This was followed by reports from the several City 
Superintendents and County Superintendents present. 
The Committee on School Law, composed of Morgan C. Fitz- 
patrick, W. R. Garrett, C. 8. Douglass, S. G. Gilbreath, and H. 
C. Weber, reported as follows: 
Mr. President: 
The committee appointed by this Association last year to present 
certain matters to the Legislature and to the State Board of Education 
directs me to submit this report of what was done: , 
1. The committee was requested to ask the State Superintendent to 
require each teacher to file a copy of his contract with the County 
Trustee when such teacher presents his first warrant for salary, and 
that the County Superintendent be given authority to revoke teachers’ 
certificates for immoral conduct when the same is properly established. 
The spirit of these two requests has been practically complied with by 
the State Superintendent. 
2. Your committee submitted to the State Board of Education the 
request of this Association that neither the State Superintendent nor 
the County Superintendent should, under the direction of the State 
Board, issue certificates 10 teachers for a longer period than five years, 
and the State Board fixed the longest term for which certificates should 
be issued by the State at four years, and the State Superintendent re- 
quires all public schoo] teachers other than those holding State Certifi- 
cates to be examined annually by the County Superintendent, 
3. Your committee was requested to present to the Legislature bills 
changing the method of selecting the State Superintendent and mak- 
ing the term of his office four years instead of two years. This was
-P-A-G-E-411
— 394 — 
not deemed practical by the legislative committee when presented, 
and no action was taken upon it. The Legislature complied with the 
request of your committee in appropriating traveling expenses for the 
State Superintendent. The State Superintendent, in compliance with 
the wish of this Association, has endeavored in every possible way, 
under the law, to secure the attendance of teachers at both State and 
County Institutes annually. 
Your committee drew some bills amending the public school law 
and presented them to the Legislature. Heretofore the law has pro- 
hibited public school teachers and officials from writing, editing, or 
owning an interest in any book, map, chart, etc., which was in use or 
to be used in the public schools. Your committee, under your direc- 
tion, prepared and presented a bill, which was passed, authorizing and 
encouraging the writing of schoolbooks, ete., for use in the public 
schools of Tennessee by teachers of the State. 
The bill prepared by the committee empowering County Courts ot 
the State to create a County Board of Education, to levy additional 
taxes, and to establish one or more county high schools in each county 
of the State, was likewise presented to the committee and enacted into 
a law by the Legislature. This high school bill contains everything 
asked by this Association, and other details which suggested them- 
selves to the committee when preparing it, which makes it suited to 
our laws and to conditions in the State. The law leaves the matter 
entirely to the County Court and to the people. Under it any county 
in the State may establish or decline to establish a county high schoo. 
Heretofore the largest appropriation made by the Legislature for State 
and County Institutes was $1,500 per annum, and your committee pre- 
sented the claims of this Association for an appropriation of $2,500 per 
annum, subsequently made by the Legislature. In securing this legis- 
lation, this committee had the cordial support of our Governor, and 
was materially aided by other friends of education throughout the 
State. 
Without disparagement to former Legislatures, it is but just to say 
that the friends of public and popular education in this State found 
the members of the last General Assembly active, earnest, and pro- 
gressive Representatives, always ready to gladly coéperate with school 
people and to enact into law such measures as would improve the sys- 
tem and best serve every interest of the almost 800,000 children in Ten- 
nessee of free school age. 
‘Lhe report of the Committee on School Hygiene, prepared by 
Miss Jeannette M. King, 8. G. Gilbreath, and H. C. Weber, was 
then received and adopted. 
The Committee on Public School Attendance, composed of 
F, M. Bowling, W. F. Albright, Mrs. L. Sparkman, Z. K. Grit- 
fin, and R. W. Caldwell, then reported.
-P-A-G-E-412
—- 895 — 
TLe zeport of the Committee on Classification or Grading and 
Promotion of Pupils of County Schools was made through its 
chaiyman, Samuel Hixson. 
Miss Jeannette M. King, John W. Paulett, J. B. Clark, J. R. 
McDonald, Mrs. Lyde P. Thomas, and F. M. Bowling, the Com- 
mnittee on “ Should the Power of County Superintendents be 
Increased?” reported as follows: 
We fail to find wherein the power of County Superintendents should 
be increased, except in the selection of location and plan and the gu- 
pervising of the building and remodeling of schooihouses. 
T. O. Gordon, A. H. Wright, T. T. Hardy, H. L. Higgs, E. 
8. Norden, and C. B. Ijams, the Committee on “ How to Secure 
Better Qualified Directors and Better Supervision for County 
Schools,” reported as follows: 
We, your committee on the above topic, submit that the directory 
of three members for each school district shouid be continued; that 
the law fixing the election of the Directors biennially in May is wise, 
and should be made applicable to the Directors of every class of dis- 
tricts; that the qualification of the Directors, “that they must be able 
to read intelligently and write legibly,” is also wise and good; that 
the best interests of the schools would be promoted, the efficiency of 
the Directors increased, if the County Superintendents were empow-~ 
ered to call the directory in convention twice each year for the pur~ 
pose of deliberating upon the best interests of the schools of their re- 
spective counties and discussing important school matters; and to se- 
eure the success of these conventions of Directors we think a law 
should be passed providing for the payment of the per diem and mile- 
age of the Directors who attend the Directors’ conventions. We think 
also a better supervision would be had if the County Superintendents 
were paid more adequate salaries and made to devote their entire time 
to the work. 
Homer L, Higgs, J. B. Clark, J. C. Brooks, J. B. Cummings, 
and R. L. Bynum, the Committee on “How May County Courts 
be Induced to Levy the Full Limit of School Tax Allowed by 
Law?” submitted their report. In connection with their re- 
port the following recommendation was adopted: 
That the legislative committee be requested to present to the leg. 
islative committee of the next General Assembly the petition of this 
Association for additional tax levy for school purposes and the law be 
So amended as to permit the annual levy of at least three mills by 
county and State.

The Committee on Siate Uniform Examination of Teachers, 
eoraposed of Samuel Hixson, Fred. J. Page, OC. B. Ijams, Z. K. 
Griffin, and J. B. Cummings, reported as follows: 
We believe that the best interests of the public schcols of Tennes- 
see would be subserved by the passage of a law requiring uniform ex- 
aminations for all the public school teachers of the State. To inaugu- 
rate such a system we would recommend: 
1. That a State Board, consisting of three members, appointed by 
the State Board of Education, be provided fer, whose duty it shall be 
td prepare all questions, which shall be sent under seal to the County 
Superintendent, who shall open them in the presence of the teachers. 
2. That all manuscripts be graded by a County Board of three mem- 
bers, of which the County Superintendent shall be chairman, the other 
members to be appointed by the chairman of the County Court, and 
‘shall receive such compensation as the County Court may decide. 
3. That there be three examinations held each year—on the last Fri-~ 
day and Saturday in June, July, and December. 
4, That. in each of the two departments—Primary and Secondary 
schools—there be two grades of certificates issued, a First Grade and 
a Second Grade; that the First Grade Certificate require a general 
average of ninety per cent and be issued for two years, and that the 
Second Grade Certificate require a general average of eighty per cent 
and be issued for one year. 
The following resolution, introduced by Superintendent L. S. 
London, ‘was unanimously adopted: 
The attendance at this Association and the marked spirit of inter- 
est manifested are matters of gratification to the friends of education, 
It has been the most successful meeting the Association has ever held, 
and for this we feel that we are indebted to the State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction. He has earnestly, energetically, and with un- 
flagging zeal worked for the snecess of the meeting, impressing its im- 
portance upon schoolmen and urging the attendance of Superintend- 
ents, teachers, and officials. During its sessions the Association has 
had at all times the full benefit of his advice and hearty codperation 
and inspiring personality. He has rendered invaluable service dur- 
ing his term of office and before as a legislator in securing the enact- 
ment into laws of measures advocated by this Association and caleu- 
lated to perfect the school system, and his suggestions for the future 
are heartily approved by us. We, as public school men of Tennessee, 
feel a deep sense of gratitude to State Superintendent Fitzpatrick for 
the work that he has done and is doing for the schools of the State. 
From the first day of his induction into office the people of Tennessee 
‘have felt the power, value, and influence of his peculiarly fortunate 
executive ability; and the life, activity, energy, and enthusiasm mam-
-P-A-G-E-414

fested here at County and State Institutes and other school meetings 
give evidence of what is being done under his administration; there- 
fore be it 
Resolved, That this Association, representing every branch of the 
public school system of Tennessee, heartily indorses, fully approves, 
and congratulates the State upon the able, capabie, and efficient ad- 
ministration of the office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction 
by Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, and we pledge him our cordial support 
and hearty codperation in the future. 
Appropriate resolutions were adopted upon the death of Miss 
Flora Fitzgerald, Superintendent of Gibson County; Superin- 
tendent Elbert Kimes, of Overton County; Superintendent J. 
Hi. C. Hutchison;’and Prof. M. R. Abernathy, of McNairy 
County. These were members of the Association who had died 
sinee the Jast mecting.

railroads and of the Tulane Hotel for courtesies extended; the 
Nashville press, for extended notices of the meeting; Secretary 
Frank Goodman, for “his prompt and efficient service; ” Claude 
J. bell, for courtesies extended; President P. L. Harned, for

CAPT. A. D. WHARTON. 
The following resolutions were adopted by the State Board of 
Education at its meeting on August 10, 1900: 
Whereas Capt. A. D. Wharton, one of the most esteemed members of 
the State Board of Education, departed this life at his home in Nash- 
ville on April 3, 1900, in the sixtieth year of his age; therefore be it 
Resolved, That the State of Tennessee has sustained a loss in the 
death of one of its ablest and most distinguished educators, and this 
board has been deprived of the services of one of its most honored and 
efficient members. While we deplore the loss which the public has 
sustained, we cannot forbear to express the deep sentiments of grief 
which we feel as individuals in the death of our beloved associate and 
valued friend. 
Capt. A. D.. Wharton has been for many years identified with the 
educational interests of the State. He was born at Mount Pleasant, 
Ala,, on July 19, 1840; removed at an early age to Nashville, Tenn.; and 
was educated in the city public schools. He entered the United States 
Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1856, and graduated with distinction. 
He continued in the service of the United States Navy until 1861. 
When the war broke out, he turned from the flattering prospects of 
promotion in the United States service, bade farewell to his comrades 
of his class (among whom was Admiral Schley), resigned his commis- 
sion as lieutenant, and tendered his services to the Confederate States. 
He rendered gallant service as an officer in the Confederate Navy on 
the Mississippi and Red Rivers, on the ram Arkansas, and on the bai- 
tle ship Tennessee. He gained especial distinction in the battle of 
Mobile Bay, and subsequently in command of a desperate expedition 
on the Tennessee River, in which expedition he was taken prisoner. 
Immediately after the war he entered upon his career as an edu- 
eator, serving successively as principal of Montgomery Bell Academy, 
of the University of Nashville; principal of the Nashville City High 
Schools, principal of Wharton’s Academy School, and again principal 
of the Nashville City High Schools. He also served for many years as 
one of the Conductors of the State Teachers’ Institutes and as a mem- 
ber of the State Board of Education. In 1886 he was appointed a mem- 
ber of the Board of Visitors of the United States Naval Academy. In 
1899 he rendered valuable service on the State Text-book Commission, 
of which he continued to be a member to the time of his death. 
Not alone in publie service, but in the private walks of life, he was 
a useful and honest member of society. Intellectual, learned, just, 
and generous, he was admired, and beloved by all who knew him.

HON. JOHN M. FLEMING. 
Hon. John M. Fleming, who was the first State Superintend- 
ent of Public Instruction under the present system, serving from 
1873 to 1875, died at Knoxville on October 28, 1900. He was 
born near Rogersville, Hawkins County, on December 12, 1832. 
He graduated at Emory and Henry College, where he took the 
first honors of his class. He was a brilliant student and a gen- 
eral favorite, and made the best record in all classes that has ever 
been made at: that college. He began the practice of law at 
Knoxville. It is said of him that he never sought a political 
honor, yet his great intellect was so appreciated by his fellow- 
citizens that he was twice called upon to represent them in the 
State Legislature. During the stirring events preceding the 
Civil War he was prominent as a Union man; but being im- 
pressed by his sound judgment and scholarly attainments, Gen. 
John C. Brown, when he became Governor, appointed Colonel 
Fleming State Superintendent of Public Instruction, aud as- 
signed to him the duty of putting into practical operation the 
present school system. This he did ably and satisfactorily. 
After this he engaged in journalistic work. THe was editor of 
the Knoxville Sentinel when his health failed and he went into 
retirement. 
In May, 1860, Colonel Fleming married Miss Annie H. Boyd, 
who died several years ago.

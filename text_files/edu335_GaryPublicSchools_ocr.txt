PREFACE 
The study of the Gary Schools was undertaken by the 
General Education Board at the request of the Board of 
Education and the City Superintendent of Gary. The 
results of the study will be published in a series of special 
reports, dealing with the more characteristic or important 
aspects of school work at Gary, and the present volume 
which endeavors to present a general account of the entire 
system. Inthewriting of this volume, the separate reports 
have been summarized in the chapters dealing with their 
respective subjects. For the remaining chapters of the 
book and for the general presentation, the authors are 
alone responsible. 
The general volume has been issued first, in order that 
a comprehensive view of the entire situation might be 
presented. It will be promptly followed by detailed 
studies of (1) Organization and Administration, (2) 
Costs, (3) Industrial Work, (4) Household Arts, (5) 
Physical Training and Play, (6) Science Teaching, and (7) 
Measurement of Classroom Products. : 
The authors desire to make grateful acknowledgment 
to the City Superintendent and other school officials 
of Gary for their codperation and courtesy, and to their 
associates in this study for their unfailing patience and

helpfulness. Special thanks are due to Mr. Frank L. 
Shaw for his services in compiling and arranging statis- 
tical data, and for his reading and correction of proof; 
to Miss Edith Holman, who assisted in the statistical 
work, and to Miss Anna C. Thornblum who in the ca- 
pacity of secretary has rendered valuable aid at every 
stage of the undertaking. Mr. Trevor Arnett, of the 
University of Chicago, Dr. Frederick Cleveland, of Bos- 
ton, and Dr. Frank E. Spaulding, Superintendent of the 
Cleveland Schools, read the report on Costs and made 
important suggestions regarding the arrangement of the 
tables contained in that volume. Miss Anna M. Cooley, 
of Teachers College, read the report on Household Arts, 
Mr. Shattuck O. Hartwell, Superintendent of the 
Muskegon Schools, the report on Organization and Ad- 
ministration, and Dr. Frank W. Ballou, Associate 
Superintendent of the Boston Schools, the report on 
Measurement of Classroom Products. The whole of the 
present volume was read by Professor Paul H. Hanus, of 
Harvard University. To all those who have thus assisted 
the authors take pleasure in acknowledging their indebt- 
edness.

I: GARY: ITS INDUSTRIES AND ITS PEOPLE 
HE town of Gary is located twenty seven miles 
| southeast of Chicago, on the southern point of 
Lake Michigan,! in a region that a bare decade 
ago was given over entirely to swamp land, sand dunes, 
and forests of scrub oak. It is one of many industrial 
centers which in recent years have sprung up, almost 
over night, on the outer rim of a large city. To provide 
space for its own plants and those of its subsidiaries, to 
secure in advance abundant room for future expansion, 
with necessary terminal, transportation, and housing 
facilities, the United States Steel Corporation purchased 
14,000 acres of land, with eight miles of unbroken lake 
frontage. The present investment in site and plants 
runs well above $100,000,000; the population of the town 
has reached, perhaps passed, fifty thousand. 
On the extreme east of the strip, facing the lake, is the 
plant of the National Tube Company, now under construc- 
tion; directly south, the Coke By-Products Company, with 
its hundreds of ovens; westward, across an artificial harbor 
large enough for great ore vessels, lies the Indiana Steel 
Company, with a square mile of furnaces and mills; on 
its western flank are the American Sheet and Tin Plate

Company, the Kirk Railroad Yards, the proposed site of 
the American Car and Foundry Company, and the plant 
of the American Bridge Company, the second largest 
fabricator of structural steel in the world. Two miles 
westward, amidst mountains of slag brought from the 
blast furnaces and used as basic material, is situated the 
Universal Portland Cement Company, with a daily 
capacity of 40,000 barrels. South of the Grand Calumet 
River, and to the extreme east, a site has been reserved 
for the American Locomotive Company. Near by are 
two independent organizations—The Gary Bolt and 
Screw Company and The Union Drawn Steel Company. 
Together the companies mentioned form an industrial 
colony of gigantic proportions, already employing be- 
tween 12,000 and 15,000 men, and likely to require in 
the near future twice or thrice the number. 
Gary is thus a steel town. The steel mill workers form 
the basis and the bulk of the population; there are, be- 
sides, executives, clerks, shopkeepers, etc., enough to 
carry on the business of the mills and to sustain the life 
of the community. Leisure class there is practically 
none; Gary is a working town. Its occupations center 
about the production and fabrication of steel, and about 
such business, trades, and professions as are required to 
care for a community of, say, fifty thousand people. 
Complete occupational data are not available, but we 
know how young men and women between nineteen 
and twenty, heads of families with children under twenty 
one, and working mothers—a total of 5,321—are occu-

pied. The data, while covering the principal occupation 
groups, are, of course, no index to the total number en- 
gaged in particular pursuits, and may not show correctly 
the relative proportions of skilled, semiskilled, and un- 
skilled workers. However, on the face of the figures, 
it appears that three fifths of all Gary wage earners are 
employed in manufacture, and that not more than a 
fourth of those engaged in gainful pursuits are skilled 
workmen. 
The population of the town is predominantly foreign in 
origin. In 1910, only 27 per cent. were native born of

native parentage; 22 per cent. more were natives, but 
both parents of four fifths of these were foreign born. 
Thus well nigh two thirds of the total population of 
Gary in 1910 may be regarded as of actual or recent 
foreign stock. (Figure 1.) 
Of the foreign stock, two thirds come from Austria, 
Hungary, Russia, Italy, and Greece, a fourth from 
Germany, Great Britain, the Scandinavian countries, 
and Canada, with scattered representatives from almost 
every other quarter of the globe. (Figure 2.) A census 
in April, 1916, limited to persons under twenty one years 
of age, makes a similar showing. Of the 12,876 youths

this foreign stock, slightly more than three fourths come 
from southern and eastern Europe. (Figure 4.) Since

  two thirds of the population of Gary are either for- 
eign born or of full foreign parentage. But these 
foreigners did not all ship direct for Gary; a considerable 
proportion have gone thither from other American cities, 
for a canvass of the foreign born heads of families shows 
that 44 per cent. have been in this country eleven years 
or more, their immigration thus antedating the founding

of Gary! A little under half (46 per cent.) of the present 
heads of families with children under twenty one have 
been in Gary less than five years, 47 per cent. have been 
there longer, 7 per cent. are unaccounted for, Two per 
cent. have been there since the city began, ro per cent. 
have been there less than a year. 
The composition of the population of Gary is an edu- 
cational factor that needs constantly to be held in mind. 
All American cities are more or less foreign, but the Gary 
situation is distinctly more difficult and complex than is 
usual. The Gary statistics for general population date 
back, as before stated, to 1910; since then the population 
has more than trebled and it is practically certain that 
this increase. has taken place more largely on the non- 
American than on the native American side. Even so, 
on the basis of the roro figures, 49 per cent. of the Gary 
white population is foreign born as against Boston’s 
36 per cent., Detroit’s 34 per cent., St. Louis’s 18 per 
cent., and Kansas City’s 10 per cent., considering the 
larger cities; and Akron’s 19 per cent., South Bend’s 
25 per cent., and Hammond’s 27 per cent., considering the 
smaller cities of industrial type.2 Thus Gary has an un- 
usually large proportion of foreigners and continues to 
receive additional increments with perhaps unprece- 
dented rapidity. 
1Data were collected as to heads of families having children under 
twenty one years of age, a total of 4,633—2,772 foreign born, 1,758 native 
born, and 103 unknown. 
See Table II, Appendix D, page 217.
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
A given school organization will undoubtedly accom- 
plish more satisfactory results with a homogeneous than 
with a heterogeneous school population recruited largely 
from culturally backward peoples. Hence, Gary is 
fairly entitled to a measure of discount on this score. 
On the other hand, too much should not be made of it, 
for every American city faces a more or less similar prob- 
lem, though for the most part on more advantageous 
terms. 
We turn now from the people to the conditions under 
which they live. Through a subsidiary organization 
called the Gary Land Company, the Steel Corporation 
was instrumental in laying out and building that part 
of the city which lies mainly between the Grand Calumet 
River, on the north, and the Wabash Railroad, on the 
south—an area of about nine square miles. Modern 
methods of city planning were not employed. A checker- 
board scheme was followed; lots of thirty feet frontage 
with a depth of one hundred fifty to two hundred feet 
were marked off; the streets all cross at right angles. 
Two reservations were made for park purposes—one of 
twenty acres on the east side, another of ten on the west. 
The heart of the city lies at the intersection of Broadway, 
a wide thoroughfare running north and south, and Fifth 
Avenue, running east and west. Broadway is the main 
business street; the Carnegie Library, the Young Men’s 
Christian Association, and the federal post office are 
situated on Fifth Avenue on sites donated by the Gary 
Land Company.

  GARY Ir 
Most of the dwelling houses in this section of the city 
were erected by the Gary Land Company and sold 
on easy terms. Though close together, they are com- 
fortable, well lighted, sanitary, and attractive. The 
monotony is somewhat relieved by other structures— 
churches, apartment houses, and more ambitious resi- 
dences, and by the well kept lawns characteristic of this 
part of the town. Here dwell nearly one half of the 
total population—local corporation officials, skilled steel 
workers, professional and trades people. 
There is, however, another side to housing in Gary. 
One half of Gary, as we have scen, lives in decency and 
comfort; not so the other half. South of the holdings 
of the Gary Land Company lay a large tract, which was 
quickly seized by land speculators who undertook to 
provide shelter for the vast majority of Gary’s unskilled 
laborers. Hundreds of ramshackle houses, generally 
wood, occasionally brick or stucco, were thrown to- 
gether. Some accommodate a single family, others two 
families; still others are two story structures of indeter- 
minate capacity, twenty five to thirty feet wide, a hun- 
dred or more feet long, with a room for a saloon or a small 
store on the first floor front. For the most part, these 
structures make little provision for either health or safety. 
Few of these houses are without boarders, and the 
boarding houses frequently receive both day and 
night shifts. Scattered about these subdivisions, but 
located principally along Broadway, were 178 saloons, 
numerous cabarets and dance halls. Thus the con-
-P-A-G-E-26
  12 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
ditions under which Gary’s “other half” lives leave 
much to be desired. 
The different schools reflect the contrast just por- 
trayed. The Emerson and Jefferson schools serve 
the Gary Land Company district; of persons under 
twenty one years of age in the Emerson and Jeffer- 
son sections of this district, 44 and 54 per cent., 
respectively, are native white of native parentage. 
The Froebel school serves the workers’ section to the 
south;! of the youth from which it is recruited, 87 per 
cent. are of foreign stock—6g per cent. come of foreign 
parents, and 18 per cent. were born under a foreign flag.” 
(Figure 5.)? Of the foreign stock of the Froebel section, 
86 per cent. come from Austria, Hungary, Russia, Italy, 
and Greece, i.e., southeastern Europe, while only 5 per 
cent. come from western and northern Europe and Cana- 
da, and 9 per cent. from all other countries. (Figure 6.)4 
This concentration of southeastern European peoples 
in an essentially unrestricted and “wide open” section 
creates a social—hence an educational—problem of 
great difficulty. 
  
1The Froebel district comprises the principal section south of the 
Wabash; Emerson and Jefferson are north, the one east and the other 
west of Broadway. Near the center of these respective districts are the 
Froebel, Emerson, and Jefferson schools. (See frontispiece map.) 
*The school census of 1916 showed, for the entire city, 12,876 youth 
under twenty one years of age. Of these, exclusive of the colored, 5,854 
were in the Froebel, 1,023 in the Emerson, and 2,506 in the Jefferson 
district.

   GARY 15 
It must be clear now that from the start the Gary 
schools had to deal with a new, rapidly increasing, and 
undeveloped population, mostly industrial in occupation, 
mostly foreign in origin. The field was, however, open 
for the development of an educational system adapted 
to local conditions. There were no antiquated school 
buildings,’ there was no teaching staff with uniform,. 
fixed habits. The very mobility and rawness of a large 
part of the population were from this point of view an 
advantage, for the patrons of the schools were without 
the educational traditions that might readily have 
resisted departures from common usage. The Steel 
Corporation has neither helped nor hindered. Its 
business relations have been limited to the sale by the 
Gary Land Company of the Jefferson school and sites 
for other schools; in matters of school policy, it has exer- 
cised no influence whatsoever. The school authorities 
thus enjoyed, and, as we shall see, in certain highly 
important respects took advantage of, the opportunity 
to break away from established practices. 
Thus, while Gary would hardly have been selected de- 
liberately as the fittest place for a considerable experiment 
in public education, nevertheless, from one point of view, 
perhaps no place could have been chosen where there were 
fewer obstacles and where conditions were more favor- 
able to innovation. 
Though the facts about the Gary schools will emerge 
     
   
       
   
              1 However, two adjacent small towns have been annexed to Gary, and 
these possessed very meager school buildings, which are still in use. 
        
-P-A-G-E-30
  16 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
as our study proceeds, it may be worth while to give in 
advance a brief historical and statistical summary. The 
Gary school organization began in September, 1906, 
school opening with one teacher, occupying a one 
room building. In October of the same year, Mr. 
William A. Wirt, at that time superintendent of the 
Bluffton (Indiana) schools, was appointed superintend- 
ent, although he did not take full charge until July, 
1907. There are now in the system nine separate build- 
ings and groups of portables; two of the buildings, 
Emerson and Froebel—the only permanent ones erected 
since Mr. Wirt took charge—are large and medern. 
There were employed during 1915-16 in the regular day 
schools two assistant superintendents, two medical in- 
spectors, three supervisors, four principals, 136 teachers, 
and 11 shopmen, together instructing a total of 5,654 
pupils. The combined total current expenditure for the 
regular day schools during 1915-16 was $203,682.38.
-P-A-G-E-31
  Il. THE PLAN AND PLANT! 
when they are viewed in the light of the general 
educational situation. For years, while the prac- 
tice of education has in large part continued to follow 
traditional lines, the progressive literature of the sub- 
ject has abounded in constructive suggestions of far- 
reaching significance. Social, political, and industrial 
changes have forced upon the school responsibilities 
formerly laid upon the home. Once the school had mainly 
to teach the elements of knowledge; now it is charged 
with the physical, mental, and social training of the 
child as well. To meet these needs, a changed and en- 
riched curriculum, including, in addition to the common 
academic branches, community activities, facilities for 
recreation, shop work, household arts, has been urged 
on the content side of school work; on the side of meth- 
od and attitude, the transformation of school methods, 
discipline, and aims on the basis of modern psychology, 
ethics and social philosophy has been recommended for 
similar reasons. No better formulation of this point 
of view has been made than that by Professor Hanus 
in his “Modern School”: 3

  18 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
“The education demanded by a democratic society to- 
day is an education that prepares a youth to overcome 
the inevitable difficulties that stand in the way of his 
material and spiritual advancement; an education that, 
from the beginning, promotes his normal physical devel- 
opment through the most salutary environment and ap- 
propriate physical training; that opens his mind and lets 
the world in through every natural power of observation 
and assimilation; that cultivates hand-power as well as 
head-power; that inculcates the appreciation of beauty 
in nature and in art, and insists on the performance of 
duty to self and to others; an education that in youth 
and early manhood, while continuing the work already 
done, enables the youth to discover his own powers and 
limitations, and that impels him through oft-repeated 
intellectual conquests or other forms of productive ef- 
fort to look forward to a life of habitual achievement 
with his head or his hands, or both; that enables him 
to analyze for himself the intellectual, economic, and 
political problems of his time, and that gives the insight, 
the interest, and the power to deal with them as success- 
fully as possible for his own advancement and for social 
service: and, finally, that causes him to realize that the 
only way to win and to retain the prizes of life, namely, 
wealth, culture, leisure, honor, is an ever-increasing 
usefulness and thus makes him feel that a life without 
growth and without service is not worth living.” 
The conception set forth by Professor Hanus makes

  THE PLAN AND PLANT 19 
an instantaneous appeal. We are, however, in some 
danger of begging the question, when we call a curriculum 
modern, progressive, or enriched. Obviously, the tradi- 
tional course of study is expanded or extended, whenever 
additions are made to it; whether or not it has been en- 
riched depends on the results obtained as evidenced by a 
critical examination of school performance. Those who 
participated in the present study of the Gary schools 
were all hospitable to modern educational ideas, in the 
sense that they believe in the importance of developing 
new types of educational opportunity; but they also 
believe that every departure must render a satisfactory 
account of itself. The innovator must give a definite 
reason for his innovations and the results must bear him 
out. It is with a constant realization of the experi- 
mental nature of the undertaking that the present volume 
deals with the Gary schools as an effort to embody mod- 
ern educational ideas. ae 
Primarily, modernization is a question of the curricu- 
lum, in the broadest sense of that term. The first step 
in modernizing the school is to modernize the course of 
study, by the introduction of new subjects and activities, 
the elimination of other subjects or parts of subjects, 
the redistribution of emphasis, the change of school spirit 
and attitude. The moment, however, that such changes 
take place, it becomes necessary to make corresponding 
changes in the school plant and facilities, to provide a 
daily program of more extensive and complicated char- 
acter with a different type of school organization, and to 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
procure a specialized staff competent to administer the 
richer and more complicated scheme. Most of the pres- 
ent volume will be devoted to the successive consider- 
ation of these details, since, given the Gary plan as a con- 
ception, upon them depends its success in execution. 
Gary furnishes an admirable example of what expan- 
sion of the curriculum means. It offers in the elemen- 
tary school instruction or opportunity of four different 
types: (x) academic work in the traditional school 
subjects,! (2) science, industrial training, and domestic 
arts,? (3) community or group work in the auditorium,’ 
(4) physical education and play. A given class will every 
day devote two or three hours to the common school sub- 
jects, two hours to special work in shop or laboratory, 
an hour or two to play, and an hour to the auditorium. 
The school day thus runs seven hours, not counting the 
luncheon period. Of these seven hours, the ordinary 
school subjects get on the whole about the same amount of 
time as is allotted to them in conventional schools, though 
obviously they lose their exclusive emphasis, while 
science,-drawing, and shop work, the auditorium, and 
physical training receive at Gary a degree of attention 
that is quite unprecedented.* Thus, the Gary curricu-

lum embodies the modern standpoint as above charac- 
terized, for it takes explicit account not only of the in- 
tellectual, but of the physical and social needs and possi- 
bilities of the child. 
We have said that the moment the curriculum is 
modernized, corresponding facilities must be provided. 
The old-fashioned school, teaching the three R’s, 
needed merely classrooms with little or no equipment. 
The course of study outlined above makes far dif- 
ferent demands in the way of buildings and equip- 
ment. The Gary school plant is not indeed by any 
means of uniform excellence; but every part of it shows 
even amidst most unfavorable conditions a distinct ef- 
fort to make possible something in the way of an ex- 
panded curriculum, while two of the nine schools—the 
Emerson and the Froebel—belong to the very best type 
of modern school construction and can hardly be paral- 
leled outside our largest and richest communities. The 
Emerson school contains thirty classrooms, seven special 
rooms used for laboratory or studio purposes, shops, 
rooms for domestic arts,” auditorium, gymnasium and 
swimming pool, and abundant playground space, well 
stocked with apparatus. The building contains both 
elementary and high school, but is mainly devoted to 
the former, since 64 per cent. of the pupils in attendance 
belong to the elementary grades. Viewed as an elemen- 
tary school, the laboratory and shop equipment are

probably not equaled in any other elementary school 
in the United States. The Froebel school is in its es- 
sential features a duplicate of the Emerson, though a 
different set of shops! is provided. 
Of the remaining schools, the Jefferson, erected in 1907, 
was of conventional type, but has been remodeled so as 
to offer facilities for a certain amount of laboratory, 
shop, and auditorium work; the Glen Park and Beveridge 
schools, built by neighboring communities prior to their 
annexation to Gary, are inadequate buildings, in which 
only a few of the features of the Gary plan are at- 
tempted. The other four schools, situated in outlying 
districts, are mainly portables, destined before long to be 
replaced. It is, however, worthy of note that the entire 
system, including the makeshifts just mentioned, is 
characterized in greater or less degree by the effort to 
fill a lengthened school day with a diversified curricu- 
lum. The least favored school is in position to carry on, 
more or less well, nature study, gardening, physical edu- 
cation, recreation and play, while the schools that may 
be regarded as permanent parts of the plant are, all the 
circumstances considered, really notable. 
This, then, is one side of the Gary plan—the enrich- 
ment of the curriculum and the provision of necessary 
facilities in the form of buildings, grounds, and equip- 
ment adjusted thereto. These things did not, it is true, 
originate at Gary, nor are they by any means limited to 
Gary; every one of them can be found in some form or

THE PLAN AND PLANT 23 
other somewhere or other. In almost every large 
city in the country efforts have been made, especially in 
the more recent school plants, to develop some of the 
features above mentioned. It is none the less true that 
perhaps nowhere else have the schools so frankly adopted 
the policy in question, and perhaps nowhere else does 
every school in the system so plainly endeavor to carry 
an extended course of study within the limits set by 
conditions. 
It is, however, not to be supposed that the plan was 
applied in precisely its present form at the outset. Far 
from it. There has been a distinct process of develop- 
ment at Gary, at times such rapid and unstable develop- 
ment that our account will in some respects be obsolete 
before it is printed. When the Emerson school was 
opened in 1909, the equipment in laboratories, shops, 
museums, while doubtless superior to what was offered 
by other towns of the Gary type, could have been 
matched by what was to be found in the better favored 
larger towns and cities at the same period. The gym- 
nasium, for example, was not more than one third its 
present size; the industrial work was not unprecedented 
in kind or extent; the boys had woodwork, the girls 
cooking and sewing. But progress was rapid: painting 
and printing were added in 1911; the foundry, forge, and 
machine shop in 1912. The opportunities for girls were 
enlarged by the addition of the cafeteria in 1912. The 
auditorium reached its present extended use as recently 
as the school year 1913-14. The Froebel school, first oc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  
24 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
cupied in the fall of 1912, started with facilities similar to 
those previously introduced piecemeal into the Emerson. 
On the side of educational opportunities and facilities the 
present situation represents then the culmination of a de- 
velopment that has occupied the entire life history of 
the community. 
The second characteristic feature of the Gary plan is 
the administrative arrangement by means of which an 
effective and economical use of the increased facilities is 
sought. The organization in question is commonly called 
the “duplicate” school. The term is really a misnomer, as 
we shall see, but its tentative use will assist the reader to 
understand the Gary plan of organization. 
For the sake of clearness, it will be well to explain the 
theory of the so-called “duplicate” school by a simplified 
imaginary example: 
Let us suppose that elementary school facilities have 
to be provided for, say, 1,600 children. If each class is 
to contain a maximum of 40 children, a schoolhouse of 
4o classrooms would formerly have been built, with 
perhaps a few additional rooms, little used, for special 
activities; except during the recess (12 to 1:30) each reci- 
tation room would be in practically continuous use in the 
old line subjects by one and the same class from 9 to 3:30, 
when school is adjourned till next morning. A school 
plant of this kind may be represented by Figure 7,! each 
square representing a schoolroom, belonging to a par- 
ticular class.   
1See page 25. 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  
THE PLAN AND PLANT 25 
The “duplicate” school takes care of its 1,600 pupils 
very differently. Instead of providing 40 classrooms for 
4o classes, it provides only 20 classrooms, capable of 
holding 800 children; but it provides, in addition, play- 
grounds, laboratories, shops, gardens, gymnasium, and 
auditorium, also capable of holding 800 children. If, 
FIcuRE 7

40 rooms for 4o classes, of 4o children each, i.e., facilities for the 
academic instruction of 1,600 children. A school yard and an 
extra room or two, little used, for special activities are also usually 
found. 
  
  
  
  now, 800 children use the classrooms while 800 are using 
the other facilities, morning and afternoon, the entire 
plant accommodates 1,600 pupils throughout the school 
day; and the curriculum is greatly extended for all alike, 
since, without taking away anything from their classroom 
work, all pupils get the other activities also. A school 
thus equipped and organized may be represented by

  This method of visualizing the “duplicate” school 
serves to correct the misconception above mentioned. 
The plan aims to secure the intensive use of enlarged and 
diversified school facilities; yet it would be incorrect to 
say that 20 classrooms, instead of 40, as under the old
-P-A-G-E-43
THE PLAN AND PLANT 27 
plan, accommodate 1,600 children. For though the 
number of classrooms has indeed been reduced from 
40 to 20, special facilities of equal capacity have been 
added in the form of auditorium, shops, playground, etc. 
The 20 classrooms apparently saved have been replaced 
by special facilities of one kind or another, under an 
organization that uses both simultaneously. 
The extended curriculum and the new type of organiza- 
tion therefore support one another. The social situation 
requires a scheme of education fairly adequate to the entire 
scope of the child’s activities and possibilities; this cannot 
be achieved without a longer school day and a more varied 
school equipment. The “duplicate” school endeavors 
to give the longer day, the extended curriculum, and the 
more varied activities with the lowest possible investment 
in, and the most intensive use of, the school plant. The 
so-called “duplicate” school is thus a single school 
with two different types of facilities in more or less 
constant and simultaneous operation, morning and af- 
ternoon. 
Though the point is one to which we shall shortly 
return for a fuller discussion, it is perhaps worth while 
to call attention in this connection to the schematic 
nature of the preceding discussion. We have assumed 
that the capacity of regular classrooms is exactly equal 
to the capacity of special facilities and that intensive use 
means fairly constant and simultaneous use of both types 
of facilities. We shall discover that this is not strictly 
the case; that is, if the program is controlled by 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  28 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
educational principle rather than administrative con- 
venience, the two types of facilities are not necessarily 
exactly equal in capacity, and there is a certain amount 
of inevitable wastage in the use of the special facili- 
ties. 
It is nevertheless true that the Gary plan is economical 
as respects the use of elaborate facilities. But,the sense 
in which the word is used requires explanation. Nothing 
could of course be more economical than the old-fashioned 
school in which each room is occupied all day long by the 
same class. That is, from the standpoint of economy, 
a bookish school, organized by classes, cannot be sur- 
passed. When, however, the curriculum is expanded 
so as to include science, shop work, and other activities, 
the conventional type of school organization is ill 
adapted. The Gary plan of organization appears, 
as will be shown, to utilize such facilities with less waste 
than any other type of organization yet suggested. 
Though the plan is economical when viewed in the 
light of the opportunities offered, it sprang from 
educational considerations, not from considerations of 
economy or convenience. There was no problem of 
congestion at Gary; nor was the town seeking to reduce 
expense. The duplicate organization is simply an intel- 
ligent attempt to make efficient use of varied facilities— 
classrooms as well as shops and laboratories. Obviously, 
the more efficiently facilities can be used, the more pupils 
a given plant will handle and the lower will be the per 
capita cost at which each child will enjoy the particular

advantages offered to him. But though the plan lends 
itself to the relief of congestion, and though, as we shall 
see, equal educational opportunities can probably not be 
obtained so cheaply on any other basis, the conception 
itself is in its origin educational—not administrative or 
financial. As such, it represents a distinct contribution 
to educational organization.

  Ill. ORGANIZATION! 
\ r JE HAVE pointed out that the Gary plan is 
characterized by two features: (1) an ex- 
tended curriculum, with facilities to correspond, 
(2) a peculiar type of school organization, devised for 
the purpose of operating efficiently and economically 
the more complicated program. In the present chapter 
we shall endeavor to show how the extended curriculum 
is converted into a daily school program and how the 
new type of organization procures an effective and eco- 
nomical use of school facilities. 
The Gary elementary curriculum provides, as has been 
stated, four distinct types of training: (1) academic work, 
that is, instruction in the three R’s, geography, and 
history; (2) special work, that is, science, shop work, 
and domestic arts; (3) physical training and play; (4) 
auditorium activities, including choral singing, individual 
performance on violin or piano, dramatic and other group 
exercises. In subsequent chapters we shall consider the 
amount and quality of instruction in each field; for the 
present we are concerned simply with the making and 
operating of the daily time schedule.

The manner in which the four different types of ac- 
tivity are combined in a daily class schedule may be 
illustrated by the program of a primary grade at the 
Emerson school:

2:15— 3:15 Auditorium

The class in question has its school day of seven hours 
divided as follows: 
Ordinary academic work, two hours; 
Special work (science, shop, domestic arts), two hours; 
Play and physical training, two hours; 
Auditorium, one hour. 
At a higher level, the following program of a fourth 
grade class shows the types of work done in the successive 
periods:

cal training and auditorium. 
What is true of the types of work at the Emerson school

is true of the Froebel, Jefferson, and Beveridge schools, 
and in a measure true of the very smallest Gary schools. 
The following schedule of a primary class at the 24th 
Avenue school shows this:

11:45— 1:00 Luncheon 3:45—4:00 Language 
The plant of the 24th Avenue school consists of five 
portables and an old one room rural school building. 
There are two kindergarten and five first and second 
grade classes. Yet these primary classes go to three 
different teachers and have three separate types of work: 
(x) the usual primary academic instruction; (2) special 
work, including literature, music, drawing, nature study; 
and (3) play. 
A moment’s consideration of the fourth grade pro- 
gram above given will indicate the problem and alinost 
inevitably suggest the manner in which it has been 
solved. 
The class in question has an hour of academic work 
with a regular grade teacher the first thing in the morn- 
ing in, let us say, room 29. The next hour the class has 
special work, let us say nature study, in the nature study 
laboratory, for which purpose the class obviously vacates 
room 29 and leaves the grade teacher with whom it spent

ORGANIZATION 33 
the previous hour; the third hour is given to academic 
work of other kinds, for which it goes to another grade 
teacher in, let us say, room 20; after luncheon it continues 
its academic work, for which purpose it may go to room 
29 or to room 20—in either case, using only one of the 
two rooms it has occupied in previous academic periods. 
Special work—this time presumably in a shop—carries | 
the class somewhere else in the following period; physical 
training leads next hour to gymnasium or playground; 
and the final hour is spent in the auditorium.” In the 
course of the day, the class will almost necessarily have 
occupied two, perhaps three, different academic class- 
rooms, a laboratory, a shop, the gymnasium, and the 
auditorium. 
It is clear that if room 29 and room 20 and the teachers 
occupying them are required by this class only two or 
three hours in the day, some other uses must be found 
for both rooms and teachers during the rest of the day; 
that is, rooms must be occupied and teachers employed 
by other classes at other hours, since during these hours 
the fourth grade class which we are following is busy else- 
where—in shop or laboratory or playground. In shops 
and laboratories the same condition prevails—the given 
class spends an hour in the woodworking shop, another 
hour in the nature study laboratory; obviously other 
classes must precede and follow in both, and what is 
true of the rooms and shops and laboratories and in- 
structors needed by the class in question is equally true 
of all other rooms, shops, laboratories, and teachers.  
-P-A-G-E-54
  34 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
What has this fourth grade class actually been doing? 
Hour after hour it has changed rooms and changed 
teachers, in order that it may recite or work in rooms 
specially adapted to the purposes for which they are 
used under teachers specially qualified to conduct the 
several exercises. Instruction is, in other words, organ- 
ized on the departmental basis. Instead of assigning 
each class to a classroom teacher who conducts instruc- 
tion in all the branches in one room continuously occupied 
by the same class, the departmental plan involves the 
use of several teachers for each class, each of the several 
teachers being in charge of one subject or related group of 
subjects; and every class circulates among the rooms, 
shops, and laboratories in carrying out the details of its 
day’s program. The departmental plan, with rotation 
of classes, necessarily accompanies expansion of the 
curriculum, since no single teacher can possibly teach so 
many diverse subjects and no single room can possibly 
contain the different kinds of apparatus and equipment 
required for several kinds of subject or activity. De- 
partmentalization thus ought to secure more highly 
specialized teaching and a more-nearly continuous use of 
elaborate school facilities than can be otherwise secured. 
The device itself is of course not new. In American 
colleges work is ‘‘departmentalized.” There is a teacher 
of Latin, a teacher of mathematics, a teacher of physics, 
not a separate teacher of each class in all subjects; and 
classes move from room to room in order to meet their 
teachers in succession. In recent years departmentaliza- 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
ORGANIZATION 35 
tion has spread from the college into the high school, 
until nowadays well organized high schools and latterly 
the upper grades of elementary schools are often “de- 
partmentalized,” i.e., organized with special teachers 
for the several subjects, rather than with one teacher 
for each grade. The innovation at Gary lies in the 
extension of the device into the lower grades of the ele- 
mentary school. 
If teachers and facilities are to be thus employed, it 
follows that different classes must pursue their studies 
and activities in different orders of succession. Instead, 
therefore, of the fairly uniform order of subjects which 
obtains in conventional schools, Gary exhibits an almost 
endless variety of combinations. Conventional schools 
are inclined to start the day with classroom work, to be 
relieved after an hour or two by play or exercise. At 
Gary, one class starts its day’s work with academic les- 
sons and ends with play; another completely reverses this 
order, starting with play and closing with classroom 
work.! 
The arrangement just described is, in popular phrase, 
said to keep “all school facilities going at full capacity 
all the time.” This is, however, not strictly true. How 
nearly the scheme can come to attaining continuous and 
complete use of school facilities is indeed a nice question. 
First as to capacity: A simple old-fashioned schoolhouse 
is used to the limit of its capacity if there is a class in

different time arrangements.

each room every hour of the school day. Thus, if the 
schoolhouse contains forty classrooms, there would be 
forty classes, each occupying its home room all day long, 
with an intermission for recess and an occasional period 
for the boys at manual training and for the girls at cooking 
and sewing. The capacity of the plant would be the sum 
of the capacity of the several classrooms, viz., 1,600 
pupils, and it would be used to capacity during the entire 
school day. The real capacity of a complex plant like the 
Emerson school is not, however, simply the sum of the 
pupil capacity of the several classrooms, shops, labora- 
tories, etc., but is highly variable, depending on the pro- 
gram and the kind of class combinations employed. 
Thus, for example, the auditorium of the Emerson school 
has a capacity of 764. Ifa program is constructed which
-P-A-G-E-57
eS ee ee ee 
ORGANIZATION 37 
fills the auditorium hourly—and to do this very dissimilar 
classes would have to be brought together—the Emerson 
school plant will have a greater capacity than under a pro- 
gram which brings into the auditorium hourly—or less 
frequently—smaller, but more homogeneous, groups. 
The same is true as regards gymnasium, shops, etc. 
If care is taken to keep gymnasium groups relatively 
small and homogeneous enough for effective individual as 
well as group work, the capacity of the gymnasium and 
with it the capacity of the school shrinks; if gymnasium 
groups are large and heterogeneous, total plant capacity 
is increased. If the shops are full every hour, there are 
rooms available elsewhere, and plant capacity isincreased; 
if younger children assist as helpers, the rooms which 
they vacate can be used by others, and thus plant ca- 
pacity is increased; if, on the other hand, children are 
not employed as helpers, they must be cared for else- 
where and total capacity is by somuch reduced. Obvi- 
ously, therefore, while an old-fashioned plant has a 
readily calculable capacity, a complicated plant may ac- 
commodate a greater or smaller number of pupils, accord- 
ing as this, that, or the other program is followed. Judg- 
ment and administrative skill of a high order are required 
to steer a safe course. 
A similar situation exists as respects continuity of 
use. One room in the old-fashioned schoolhouse is used 
just as long as another; all rooms are indeed continuously 
in use all day long, be the day five hours or six. The 
Gary situation is more complicated, partly because of the
-P-A-G-E-58
  38 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
new facilities, like the auditorium and the gymnasium, 
and partly because the school day is seven hours for pu- 
pils and eight hours for the plant. If we assume six hours 
as a normal school day for a regular teacher, while the 
school day for the pupil is seven and for the plant eight 
hours, classrooms can still be used for the entire plant 
day if a few extra teachers are employed, even though no 
teacher works more than six hoursaday. Butifalabora- 
tory is to be used for an additional hour or two daily, a 
second instructor is likely to be needed, a step which 
would entail disproportionate expense. Practically, there- 
fore, when the plant day is eight hours, auditorium, 
shops, laboratories, that is, all special facilities, must be 
idle at least two hours a day, or one fourth of the time. 
Equally continuous use of all facilities is therefore prac- 
tically impossible, if the school day extends beyond six 
hours; it is difficult to attain even with a school day of 
six hours, unless there is unusual regularity in the number 
of classes in the different grades. Nevertheless, the 
Gary type of organization procures a larger use of modern 
facilities and of a modern plant than the common type 
of organization, which requires a room and a teacher for 
. each class and allows regular rooms to be idle when 
special facilities are in service.

   Iv. ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION! 
HE management of a system of schools conducted 
on the Gary plan is obviously a highly complicated 
affair. Despite the fact that the success of such 
a system depends very largely on effective management, 
it is not easy to tell precisely what the administrative 
and supervisory arrangements of the Gary schools are. 
At the head stands the superintendent. The superin- 
tendent of schools in an American city has usually both 
business and educational duties; directly as well as 
through assistants he carries out the provisions of the 
law and the orders of the board of education in respect 
to all matters involving business, and, in the same way, 
both directly and through assistants, exercises general 
control of educational policies—meeting supervisors and 
the teaching staff for conference, calling for examinations 
and reports, and, as occasion offers, visiting classrooms 
and laboratories, now for the purpose of making an in- 
spection, again to satisfy himself as to the quality of 
some special classroom procedure, or the competency 
of particular individuals. The activities in progress 
are so many, even in a small system, that no superin-

-P-A-G-E-60
  
40 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
tendent can possibly keep in constant touch with all; 
but there is assuredly danger of collapse somewhere un- 
less the superintendent’s hand is distinctly felt in both 
the main fields of his responsibility—business manage- 
ment and education. 
In consequence of the repeated and prolonged absences 
of the superintendent during the year 1915-16, central 
control at Gary appeared to be limited to general direc- 
tion, mostly on the business side. Educational super- 
vision was of a general character only. The superin- 
tendent gave time and thought to plans connected with 
building and similar needs, selected and assigned teach- 
ers, received written and oral reports from the assistant 
superintendents and school principals, and explained 
the broad educational aims and policies to the staff. 
The execution of educational details did not, however, 
come directly within his sphere. In other words, of the 
two important concerns of the ordinary city superintend- 
ent, the supervisory function did not seem to bulk 
large. 
Supervision fell almost altogether to assistants—an as- 
sistant superintendent who directs the night schools and 
supervises the higher elementary grades, an assistant 
superintendent in charge of kindergarten and primary 
grades, a supervisor or special teacher of handwriting, a 
supervisor of physical education, who also has teaching 
duties, a supervisor of the industrial arts, who at the 
same time has charge of repairs, certain heads of high 
school departments, who, though teachers, appear to
-P-A-G-E-61
ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 41 
have a sort of general responsibility for their several sub- 
jects throughout the system, and school principals.- 
The theory of general supervision, which accords 
with the practice observed, can best be expressed by 
saying that the assistant superintendents, and all 
supervisors, for that matter, develop plans and outline 
ideals in accordance with the Gary plan, and then 
leave the teaching staff largely to realize these aims 
in their own way. However, it is not to be inferred from 
this that the assistant superintendents are not concerned 
with the efficiency of the schools. They hold teachers’ 
meetings three or four times a year; they visit classes, 
inspecting the instruction and making suggestions for its 
improvement, and finally grade the teachers. They give 
a good deal of attention to the needs of individual pupils, 
seeing that they are properly classified; to this end, they 
assemble reports on children’s work, determine whether 
or not they shall be promoted, and oversee the make-up 
of their daily programs and the organization of classes. 
The special supervisors deal with given branches of 
instruction only—the handwriting supervisor, for ex- 
ample, with handwriting. This particular special super- 
visor corresponds, however, more nearly to what is known 
as a special teacher. He goes from building to building 
and room to room actually teaching classes, particularly 
of the upper grades; at the same time, he counsels teach- 
ers, gives suggestions about their work, and at long inter- 
vals brings them together for conference. The super- 
visor of physical training works in much the same way.  
-P-A-G-E-62
  42 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
The supervisor of the industrial and household arts, 
as stated before, also looks after repairs for the entire 
system, and oversees some of the new constructive work. 
He is in and out of the several shops and even the cook- 
ing and sewing rooms almost daily and knows in a general 
way what is going on in every shop. He also meets with 
the shopmen two or three times a year for an evening’s 
discussion of their problems. 
The school principal is an executive or administrative, 
rather than a supervisory, officer. He has, indeed, little 
to do with the educational side of the school. After 
organizing his school in consultation with the superin- 
tendent and assistant superintendents, he looks after the 
building and grounds, meets parents, handles special at- 
tendance and discipline cases, orders books and supplies, 
and makes reports to the superintendent; he also ar- 
ranges the programs of teachers and supplies substitutes, 
holds weekly teachers’ meetings after school hours, and 
occasionally visits classes; but he has no responsibility 
for the quality of the teaching. Records of enrollment, of 
promotion, and of scholarship come to his office, but the 
responsibility for what pupils do and for their promotion 
belongs to the teachers and general supervisors. 
These supervisory arrangements are hardly calculated 
to meet the unusual problems that arise in a situation as 
complicated and novel as that at Gary. Supervision 
of the kind above described is not likely to determine 
whether departures from conventional practice do or do 
not make good, nor is it likely to overcome the obstacles
-P-A-G-E-63
ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION = 43 
arising from the quality and antecedents of the pupils. 
In the course of these pages, these statements will be 
more than once justified. But it is worth while in this 
connection to record a few instances of administrative 
and supervisory laxity, such as tend to obscure or defeat 
the demonstration of some of Gary’s innovations. 
We have referred to the fact that young children are 
regularly detailed to act as ‘“‘helpers” or “observers” to 
older pupils engaged in shop or laboratory work, while 
older pupils frequently take charge of classes, assist in 
keeping records, correct papers, etc. This practice is 
defended on the ground that participation in such re- 
sponsibilities is educative, since it reproduces an impor- 
tant human relationship. But does it work? As we 
shall see in subsequent chapters, our own investiga- 
tions suggest, in the main, a negative answer. Would it 
work if efficiently controlled? That, of course, no one 
can yet say. A striking though not essential character- 
istic of the Gary system is thus imperiled because its 
operation has not been carefully watched. 
Again, we have called attention to the unusual se- 
quence of studies sometimes followed. We have pointed 
out that class schedules are so arranged that one 
class will play in the early morning and do its work in 
the early afternoon, while another class—or the same 
class another term—reverses the arrangement. Now, 
is there any reason why children should not play in the - 
early hours of the morning and do their classroom work 
in the early hours of the afternoon? Gary assumes and 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  44 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
believes that there is no objection. Is there? No one 
really knows. The question lends itself, however, to 
experimental inquiry. Given classes might readily be 
carried for a series of years alternating the former ar- 
rangement with the latter, while others are carried with 
the common order of studies. A series of graphs might 
show whether the level of class work is affected by the 
factor here under discussion. Or, perhaps some other 
experiment could be devised for the purpose of deter- 
mining the question. Similar questions should be asked 
in reference to the wisdom of extending departmentaliza- 
tion into the lowest grades. In any event, these are 
experimental problems to be worked out coéperatively 
by the teachers and supervising staff; but supervision in 
this sense—the very type required by a system rich in 
novelties and possibilities—has not been instituted. 
One more illustration may be employed. Diversity 
of facilities and activities coupled with the unusual length 
of the school day makes for flexibility of program. Gary 
indeed believes that its program is more nicely adjusted 
to the individual child than is the case elsewhere. To 
what extent and in what sense is this true? The term 
“flexible” is properly applied to leeway used in order to 
defer to a particular child’s need or opportunity. A 
child may be backward or unusually capable; a “‘flex- 
ible” curriculum places him accordingly. Flexibility 
has nothing to do with accident, caprice, or instability, all 
of which are hostile to the formation of good habit. The 
Gary organization lends itself to individual adjustments,

  ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 45 
but whether or not they are wisely made depends on 
administrative supervision. Thus, for instance, a 
seventh grade class (No. 44) in the Froebel school con- 
tained many weak pupils in unquestionable need of 
individual consideration and attention. Its official 
spring program was as follows: 
8:15 Gymnasium (play) or library 
9:15 Music 
to:15 Arithmetic 
rr:15 English 
z2:15 Luncheon 
a:15 Auditorium 
2:15 Shop (boys); Cooking or sewing (girls) 
3:15 United States history 
The entire class of 31 pupils recited together in arith- 
metic at the scheduled time. Only two other subjects, 
gymnasium and English, were pursued by all members, 
but in neither of these branches were they all in the same’ 
class. Twenty three took no music, seven no history, 
and four did not attend the auditorium. On the sur- 
face, these variations might be interpreted as represent- 
ing real educational adjustments. In point of fact, 
they were not adjustments to serve the interests of 
particular pupils or to secure their regular advancement, 
but merely chance arrangements, the product of loose 
administration and supervision. 
The most surprising variations occur in the 9:15 and 
2:15 periods. At 9:15 the class is scheduled for music. 
At that time, thirteen pupils were in the gymnasium, seven 
were taking music,one arithmetic, two shop, six cooking or 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  46 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
sewing, and two drawing. At 2:15 the boys were sup- 
posed to be in shop and girls in cooking or sewing. Ac- 
tually, eight went to gymnasium or library, one to 
music, seven to shop, nine to cooking or sewing, five to 
drawing, and one to history. Again, the official program 
calls for only one period a day in each of the several 
studies; and yet fourteen pupils took two hours of gym- 
nasium or library and two took three hours. Twelve 
pupils did double and one treble duty in practical work. 
All told, there were thus not less than fifty four deviations 
from the official class program, but only three were to 
afford additional academic instruction—one in arithmetic 
and two in English. All persons concerned—teachers, 
principal, and children—were questioned about these 
changes. The principal, whose written endorsement is 
required, had no recollection of the reasons for them 
and no record of them. Although the pupil’s Program 
Card reads, “No dropping of class nor change of program 
will be permitted without the written consent of the 
assistant superintendent,” the children had not consulted 
that official. A teacher employed to advise with children 
about their practical work could throw no light on the 
situation. Register teachers,! supposed to have on 
file ‘Permission to Change Class”’ slips, had barely a 
half dozen of them—not one completely executed—and 
were, therefore, almost wholly unaware of what had 
happened. The truth is that, in a few instances, the 
Seventeen register teachers kept the records of this one class, each 
doing a part of the work.
-P-A-G-E-69
  ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION = 47 
regular teachers, on their own authority, had excused 
pupils from their classes, but in most instances children 
had dropped what they did not want and elected what 
they wanted, provided they could get it, without con- 
sulting anybody. Prolonged inquiry showed clearly 
that with five or six exceptions all the changes were the 
result of childish caprice exercised without restraint. 
Nor does class 44 stand alone. Out of eleven addi- 
tional Froebel and Emerson classes similarly tabulated, 
in six there was not a single pupil taking double work in 
any of the regular studies, and in the remaining five, not 
more than a single pupil in any one of them. Inno class 
were there as many deviations from the official program 
in special work as in class 44. Still, such deviations as 
there were, were rarely educational adjustments; they 
were due mostly to the child’s own choice, or to accidents 
‘of organization at the time. 
The upshot of our consideration of the Gary plan and 
the Gary organization may be put intoafew words. The 
Gary plan is as large and intelligent a conception as 
has yet been reached in respect to the scope and bear- 
ing of public education. The administrative scheme by 
which Gary undertakes to carry out the plan is in- 
genious to the point of originality. The arrangements 
for controlling and supervising the operation of the 
scheme are, however, defective; there is, therefore, 
reason to fear that the execution of the plan will fall 
short of the conception.

way in which the daily class programs are con- 
structed, frequent reference has already been made 
to the subjects taught and the special activities pur- 
sued. The present chapter will, however, give a more 
detailed account of the course of study, with special 
reference to the ordinary school subjects. 
The Gary schools—like the schools of all other Indiana _ 
towns—are guided by the state course of study. They 
teach the usual school subjects and “‘such other branches 
of learning and other languages as the advancement of 
the pupils may require and the trustees from time to time 
direct.” Fortunately, the official course of study is “not 
intended to limit the teacher’s personality or freedom,” 
and teachers are expressly enjoined to adapt their in- 
struction “to the needs of their particular schools and 
communities.”! On the other hand, the state prescribes 
a uniform series of textbooks for all schools. Though 
the Gary teachers exercise freedom in using these pre- 
scribed texts and are liberally supplied with additional 
material, the fact remains that the legally desig- é DESCRIBING the Gary plan and explaining the

nated text may hamper a competent and progressive 
teacher. 
At Gary, as elsewhere, it has been impossible, for 
reasons that must be clear, to provide uniform 
school facilities. The nine schools therefore differ greatly 
in size, situation, and equipment. The West Gary 
school, consisting of two portables with an open play- 
ground, must necessarily offer a course of study quite 
different from that of the Froebel school, with its modern 
equipment, gardens, and playgrounds. The West Gary 
program is therefore made up more largely of the three 
R’s, geography, and history, though a certain amount of 
music and drawing is given, the last named including 
nature study and handwork.? 
The programs of the Froebel, Emerson, and Jefferson 
schools* contain the usual studies—the three R’s, geog-

  50 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
raphy, history, nature study, manual training, house- 
hold arts, drawing, music, and physical training. Over 
and above these subjects attention should be directed to 
the separate courses in botany, zoology, physics, chem- 
istry, mechanical drawing, and shop work in great 
variety—the shop work including woodwork, forge, 
foundry, machine practice, sheet metal, printing, paint- 
ing, and shoe repairing. Certain unusual terms occur- 
ring on the program, such as “helpers” and “teachers? 
assistants,” “expression,” “application,” and “audito- 
rium,” have already been more or less fully explained. 
“Helpers” and “‘teachers’ assistants” are pupils distrib- 
uted in groups of four or five among the shops, labora- 
tories, and classes in the regular subjects to observe, 
study, or assist. “Expression” denotes instruction 
meant to develop power in oral language and taste for 
good literature, as contrasted with “reading,” which 
refers simply to the mechanics of the reading process. 
“Application” represents a similar division of labor; 
teachers in the fundamental branches teach the formal 
or technical phases of their branches, whereas in “ap- 
plication” children are supposed to be drilled expressly 
in applying what they have learned. Perhaps the most 
marked departure from common practice is the ‘“audi- 
torium,” with its hourly assemblage of several classes in a 
single group for entertainment and general instruction by 
means of moving pictures, lectures, and other exercises. 
_ The studies and activities included in the program 
above given are grouped in two divisions: (1) ‘“‘regu-
-P-A-G-E-73
  COURSE OF STUDY 5I 
lar work,” pursued continuously by all children and 
comprising reading, language, spelling, writing, arith- 
metic, geography, history, “auditorium,” and physical 
training; and (2).“‘special work,” under which are under- 
stood handwork, freehand and mechanical drawing, na- 
ture study and science, music, “expression,” “‘applica- 
tion,” manual training, shop work, and household arts. 
No class pursues at one time all the “special work” of- 
fered in its grade or in the course as a whole. For ex- 
ample, during the spring term 1915-16, only seven of the 
twelve first grade classes in the three schools under dis- 
cussion had nature study; only two of the ten fifth 
grade classes had freehand drawing! The other classes 
in these grades may have had these branches during 
some other term. 
In theory, all children in the lower grades are supposed 
to have an equal amount of nature study, handwork and 
freehand drawing, music, “expression,” and “applica- 
tion”; and all children in the upper grades, an equal 
amount of drawing, science, and shop work, though the 
kind of drawing and science studied, and the particular 
shop entered, may differ with the pupil, the class, and the 
school. 
Equality of opportunity in respect to these special 
activities in a given school is obtained by rotating children 
from one special activity to another. By means of 
properly arranged cycles, pupils are enabled to pur- 
sue in succession four or even five special activities, 
1Table IV, Appendix D, page 219.
-P-A-G-E-74
  52 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
each for a given number of weeks. For example, in 
the Jefferson school, 1915-16, the first four elementary 
grades rotated more or less regularly through nature 
study, handwork and drawing, music, “expression,” and 
“application”; the upper grades rotated through nature 
study, drawing, and cooking or sewing for girls, and shop 
for boys.! In the Froebel school, the four lower grades 
were scheduled for manual training, drawing, and nature 
study one half of the year, and for music or ‘“‘expres- 
sion,” and “application” the second half; the upper 
classes rotated through science, drawing, and shop 
work.? The Gary practice thus concentrates the atten- 
tion of the pupil on a particular activity for a definite 
period. Instead, for example, of having a certain sub- 
ject or activity twice a week for a half year, he pursues 
it every day for a shorter period. The scheme presents 
no peculiar difficulties in respect to organization; it is 
advantageous from the standpoint of economy, and edu- 
cationally, as far as any one knows, may be as effec- 
tive as any other arrangement. 
The-three large Gary schools, with which we are pri- 
marily concerned, differ considerably as to the kinds of 
special activities provided. The science work is prac- 
tically the same in the Froebel and Emerson schools— 
both offering nature study and separate courses in zool- 
ogy, botany, physics, and chemistry. But here the 
similarity stops; in the practical activities Emerson

offers poultry raising, forge, foundry, machine shop, and 
printing; Froebel, manual training, cabinet making, shoe 
repairing, painting, plumbing, sheet metal, and printing. 
Jefferson, in contrast, has a single shop, where children 
from the third grade up get a composite of manual and 
industrial training. These differences in special advan- 
tages arise from various causes. In the first place, no 
single school, no single group of school children can 
possibly exhaust the special activities which possess 
educational value. While an expanded curriculum en- 
deavors to make a varied appeal to different types of ef- 
fort and interest, it cannot make every possible appeal. 
There is therefore no reason for uniformity. Inasmuch, 
also, as the shops serve production and repair as well as 
education, those shops have been installed which could 
be made more or less self-supporting, and for this same 
reason shops have not been duplicated. 
Shop work, science, and auditorium exercises are of 
course found elsewhere than at Gary. The Gary pro- 
gram does not therefore differ from other school pro- 
grams because Gary offers these activities and the other 
schools do not.' Gary differs simply in the prominence 
which it gives to the activities in question in the ele- 
mentary school, in the unusual facilities provided for 
them, and in the emphasis placed upon them. Other 
schools have auditorium exercises; but nowhere else does 
’ the auditorium play the part it plays at Gary. Other 
1Table VII, Appendix D, page 224.
-P-A-G-E-78
  54 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
schools teach science in the elementary grades; but 
where are the elementary schools that give botany, chem- 
istry, and physics in such admirable laboratories? Other 
elementary schools provide manual training; but where 
else in one school is there work in machine shop, forge, 
foundry, printing, and gardening? It is the number and 
the excellence of these opportunities that give to the 
Gary course of study its novelty. 
One other feature should be included at this point, 
viz., the library. The Gary plan in its full form con- 
templates an effort to cultivate in children a discrimi- 
nating reading taste, and to teach them how to use a 
library. Conditions are favorable to this effort. The 
public library maintains branches at the Emerson and 
Froebel schools; there is also a branch in the Bever- 
idge school section, and Jefferson is within a short walk of 
the main library building. All classes of these schools 
are supposed to have a library period once a week or once 
in two weeks, the period being taken from physical train- 
ing and play. The library authorities have outlined a 
simple graded course of eight years, consisting of five 
lessons a year, on the use of books and the use of the 
library. In addition, children are introduced to good 
reading and they are assisted with such reference work as 
their regular class teachers may have assigned to them. 
The Jefferson school, however, is the only one that carries 
out the plan with anything approaching completeness. 
No other school gives library instruction. At Beveridge 
the children attend the library regularly, using the hour 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
COURSE OF STUDY 55 
for reading. At Froebel, although assigned to the 
library, the children go at irregular intervals, while at 
Emerson there is no assignment, the library being used 
chiefly by high school students as a study room. 
The precise amount of time given at Gary to each sub- 
ject—regular or special—is not readily made out. The 
schools are organized on the basis of sixty minute periods. 
As the sixty minute period is, in the lower grades, at least, 
too prolonged for, say, nature study, the teacher may 
devote part of the hour to the three R’s, or to drawing, 
thus lessening the time nature study actually receives. 
On the other hand, some kind of music—group, class, 
or solo singing, the school orchestra, or the victrola— 
almost invariably makes up a part of the auditorium ex- 
ercises. Besides the school orchestras of Emerson and 
Froebel, which meet regularly for practice, pupils who 
are to take part in the orchestra receive individual 
lessons on the violin, etc., particularly on Saturdays. 
Music, therefore, receives at Gary a greater emphasis 
than the formal time allotment would indicate. Again, 
the schools do not all schedule the same amount of time 
for the special activities; there is, also, as will appear 
later, some discrepancy between the amount of time 
scheduled and the amount of time given. 
A similar—and perhaps even more marked—uncer- 
tainty exists as to the amount of time really devoted to 
the more common subjects. These subjects are supposed 
to occupy at least two hours daily in the lower, and not 
less than three hours in the upper, grades. But teachers 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  56 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
are not held to a uniform and exact division of time, with 
definite periods for reading, spelling, language, writing, 
arithmetic. They divide a period as in their judgment 
seems best; and, as their ideas differ, the time actually al- 
lotted to each of the regular studies varies from teacher 
to teacher. 
In consequence of these difficulties, the time table con- 
structed by us for the Gary schools' does not represent 
daily practice as closely as the official schedules of con- 
ventional systems. Still, the average number of hours 
ascribed to the several studies and activities indicates— 
at least, roughly—common Gary practice, and depicts 
with sufficient exactness for general purposes the central 
tendencies of the schools, although, as we shall see, there 
are some marked deviations from these time averages. 
When studies and activities are serially arranged on the 
basis of the total number of hours assigned to them by 
the schedule, general school practice is distinctly chal- 
lenged.? Physical training and play, drawing and 
manual training and the auditorium, or the special sub- 
jects, all take precedence over the conventional sub- 
jects. Physical training and play get twice the time 
assigned to reading and three times the amount assigned 
to arithmetic; science gets as much time as geography and 
history combined. In fact, fifty five per cent. of the total 
time of the elementary school schedule goes to physical   
Table VII, Appendix D, page 226. 
*Table IX, Appendix D, page 228.
-P-A-G-E-81
    COURSE OF STUDY 57 
training, play, shop work, auditorium, music, and 
German; 35 per cent. to the three R’s—reading, language, 
spelling, and arithmetic. The schedule is, however, 
not strictly carried out. For example, during 1915-16, 
all classes in Jefferson and the first four grades in Froebel 
and Emerson were scheduled for two hours of physical 
training and play daily, and, with a few exceptions, all 
classes from the fifth grade up in Froebel and Emerson 
were scheduled for one hour. But these assignments— 
particularly those in the lower grades—represent op- 
portunities for physical training and play rather than 
time actually given to them. In the first place, chil- 
dren are not held to regular attendance. Frequently, 
though they are scheduled for two hours of physical 
training daily, attendance upon one period is optional. 
This is almost invariably true when the two hours 
come together at the beginning or at the end of the school 
day. In the second place, time needed for outside activ- 
ities, such as library and religious instruction, special 
home work in music, drawing, or assisting at home, is 
usually taken from the physical training and play 
assignment. While it is therefore statistically correct 
to report the schedule allotment as 2,697 hours to physical 
training and play, 1,600 hours (one hour daily through- 
out the elementary school course) approximate more 
nearly the time given. Even so, the time allowance is 
decidedly unusual. 
The Gary schedule does not get this liberal time 
allowance for special activities by reducing the time
-P-A-G-E-82
58 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
allotment of the common or fundamental branches; it 
gets the additional time by lengthening the school day. 
The usual school day in the fifty cities of the country 
having a population of 100,000 or more is five hours. In 
the one hundred and twenty cities with a population of 
25,000 and less than 50,000 (the population group to 
which Gary belongs), the average school day is approxi- 
mately five and a quarter hours; forty seven of the 
hundred and twenty have a five hour session, fifteen are 
content with less, and only thirty six exceed the average.” 
The official school day at Gary, in the three schools under 
discussion,® is for children seven hours—from 8:15 to 
4:15, with sixty minutes for luncheon. The lengthened 
school day provides the additional time needed for the 
special branches. Meanwhile, the common branches 
continue on the whole to receive as much time at Gary 
as elsewhere. Fifty representative cities’ average 5,388 
hours of instruction in the ordinary studies, as compared 
with 5,048 hours at Gary, a total difference of 340 hours 
spread over eight years. The three R’s are allotted 
3,904, as against 4,022 in fifty cities. Gary’s departure 
1Table X, Appendix D, page 229. 
Table XI, Appendix D, page 229. 
Beveridge also has a seven hour day, but in the other schools the day is 
six hours. 
‘Moreover, the playgrounds at Froebel, Emerson, and Jefferson, 
and the gymnasiums and swimming pools at Froebel and Emerson, are 
open until five o’clock. 
’Table XII, Appendix D, page 230.
-P-A-G-E-83
  
COURSE OF STUDY 59 
is thus almost wholly in the field of the special activi- 
ties; the 2,732 hours gained by lengthening the school 
day keep the children off the streets and make time for 
physical training, shop work, drawing, and the audi- 
torium. 
The different schools, however, show considerable de- 
viations from the foregoing rankings and reported time 
allotments.1 For example, the average allotment to 
fourth grade reading in Froebel, Emerson, and Jef- 
ferson during the spring term 1915-16 was 292 minutes 
per week. All classes in Jefferson had more; all in Emer- 
son, less; in Froebel there was one above the average and 
three below. The minimum assignment, 150 minutes, 
goes to 4A classes in Emerson and Froebel, and the maxi- 
mum, 450 minutes, to a Froebel 4C. Relatively greater 
variations occur in eighth grade geography. One class 
had more, and four had less, than the average of gt 
minutes per week. A Froebel 8A having the equivalent 
of a single weekly forty minute period, and an Emerson 
8B enjoying five such periods, represent the extremes. 
The allotments to the other fundamental studies reveal 
similar differences. So far as these time differences 
grow out of a conscious effort to adjust instruction to 
the needs and abilities of different groups of children, 
they are profitable. But it is clear that not infrequently 
they arise at Gary—as in other school systems—from 
lack of proper adjustment or from the caprice of individ- 
ual teachers.

  60 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
We have been occupied up to this point with the ele- 
mentary course of study. A word will suffice for the 
high schools. 
Gary has two high schools, one at the Froebel, the 
other ‘at the Emerson school, the buildings and equip- 
ment serving simultaneously elementary school and high 
school purposes. The attendance totals 547 pupils, of 
whom 331 enrolled at the Emerson, 216 at the Froebel.! 
The programs of the two schools follow closely the uni- 
form state course,” which does not differ materially from 
the ordinary high school course found throughout the 
country. Emerson offers only seven units of work in 
excess of the minimum state requirements, of which three 
units arein foreign languages; Froebel barely reaches the 
minimum. Despite the unusual facilities in the way 
of shops and laboratories, the high schools do not offer 
to high school boys or girls more than a single year 
of well organized instruction in the industrial and

COURSE OF STUDY 61 
household arts. In addition to the conventional work, 
there is a commercial course, open to both boys and 
girls. 
Having students enough to justify a separate high 
school, does Gary do well to use the same building and 
equipment for both an elementary school and a high 
school? Something can be said on both sides of the 
question. It can hardly be regarded as economical in 
respect to space or money. High school teachers, seldom 
having full high school schedules, are assigned to ele- 
mentary school classes. Equipment essential to high 
school work is either idle, or is used by young children, 
even if not to best advantage. Among the compen- 
sating gains, however, are the democratic spirit developed 
between elementary and high school pupils, the familiar- 
ity of elementary pupils with high school opportunities, 
and the knowledge which high school teachers acquire 
regarding elementary pupils, their methods of work, and 
their achievements. 
On the elementary course of study described in this 
chapter, one general comment naturally suggests itself. 
The fear has not infrequently been expressed by devotees 
of traditional education that modernism in education 
may signify merely the “practical,” “utilitarian,” ‘“vo- 
cational,” as opposed to the cultural or ideal. The 
breadth and variety of the Gary elementary curriculum 
ought to remove this apprehension; for it is more broadly 
and variously cultural in its scope than any merely bookish 
curriculum can possibly be. It contains the necessary

instrumental studies—writing, reading, spelling, and 
arithmetic—as well as the traditional cultural subjects, 
geography, history, and literature. Science and indus- 
try add further opportunities to develop the child and 
to give him an education that will bring him into contact 
with life at all its vital points.

T= program described in the preceding chapter 
calls for (1) grade teachers, (2) an unusual num- 
ber of specialized teachers to take charge of the 
departmentalized subjects and special activities of the 
elementary schools, and (3) high school teachers. The 
total number of teachers employed at Gary increased 
from 4 in 1906-7 to 147 in 1915-16.1 
In selecting elementary teachers, the Gary authorities 
have endeavored to procure graduates of a standard 
normal school, but they have not always reached this 
level. Of the 45 regular elementary teachers in service 
at the end of the school year 1915-16, 13 fell short in this 
respect, 20 were normal school graduates, while 9 had 
attended college without graduating and 3 had finished 
a full college course.” A majority of the less well

64 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
equipped have entered the staff recently; some of 
them are local high school graduates, beginning to teach 
in the elementary schools with little professional prepara- 
tion. In so far as the staff is trained, the training is 
that obtainable in ordinary normal schools throughout 
the country. The 12 kindergartners are a more homo- 
geneous group; all have had the equivalent of a standard 
course, that is, after graduating from high school they 
have had at least two years of specialized training. 
As has been pointed out, Gary draws no hard and fast 
line between the elementary school and the high school. 
The two schools are housed in the same building, and, 
although regular elementary teachers do not give high 
school instruction, high school teachers usually instruct 
some elementary classes; the chemistry teacher takes 
grade classes in chemistry, the physics teacher, grade 
classes in physics. Of the 26 regular high school teach- 
ers, 19 have completed a full four year college course or 
more. Of the 7 with non-standard credentials, 2 hold 
degrees from small colleges, 3 have had some college work, 
1 is a normal school graduate, and 1, although never go- 
ing beyond the high school, has had a broad business ex- 
perience.” A majority of them have also had some pro- 
fessional training at colleges or schools of education. 
In addition to kindergarten, regular elementary and 
high school teachers, Gary employs 50 special teachers. 
The teachers of handwork and nature study deal only 
~‘Table XVII, Appendix D, page 237. 
?Table XVI, Appendix D, page 236. 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
TEACHING STAFF 65 
with elementary children, principally of the lower grades; 
all others—teachers in charge of auditorium work and 
expression, music, manual training, household arts, free- 
hand drawing, mechanical drawing, and physical train- 
ing—instruct, in varying proportions, both elementary 
and high school pupils. It is needless to discuss in detail 
the training of these special teachers. Suffice it to say 
that, with few exceptions, they are well fitted, although 
there are, as is common elsewhere, surprising differences 
in the length and the character of the preparation of 
those giving the same kind and grade of instruction.! 
Eleven shopmen, not classified as teachers by the Gary 
authorities, complete the corps. Engaged on general 
repair and construction, such as forge, foundry, and 
plumbing, they were chosen primarily on the basis of 
trade experience, which ranges from four to twenty five’ 
years; practically all are union men. 
Besides trained teachers, the Gary schools utilize high 
school pupils as assistants in one way or another. In the 
year 1915-16, 127 pupils were thus used, chiefly in the 
three largest schools, Emerson, Froebel, and Jefferson. 
Their duties, though various, are mainly routine; they 
grade papers, prepare material for younger children, tell 
stories, play games, assist pupils over difficulties, keep 
the class register, and occasionally take charge of a class 
and give instruction. 
As a rule, Gary employs not only trained but experi- 
1Table XVIII, Appendix D, page 238.

-P-A-G-E-92
66 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
enced teachers. Academic and professional preparation 
being equal, preference is given to- the seasoned instruc- 
tor. To be sure, beginners are engaged, but probably 
not in greater numbers than is usual elsewhere, for in 
most large cities the teaching force—at least, of the 
kindergarten and elementary school—is recruited di- 
rectly from the local training school. Of the 132 teach- 
ers of whom we have record, only 23, or 17 per cent., 
were without experience when first employed! and not 
exceeding 6 of these beginners were engaged in any one 
year. Together, the 132 had had an average prior experi- 
ence of five years, a half having had less than four years, 
and a half having had more. Indeed, if the Gary author- 
ities have erred, it is on the side of employing teachers with 
too much classroom experience behind them, for 20 
per cent. of the staff had had a service record of ten 
years or more before coming to Gary. 
Though Gary teachers are as a body experienced, they 
are all new to Gary.? A single decade measures the 
length of the service of the oldest; less than half of them 
have been in Gary four years, and, if we include the 11 
who have been there less than a year, the 8 who are 
completing their first year, and the 33 who are completing 
their second year, 40 per cent. may be called newcomers. 
The unusually large proportion of newcomers is a con- 
sequence partly of the recent origin and rapid growth of 
the city, and partly of the frequency of resignations. Ob-

viously this fact must be taken into account in judging 
the Gary schools. Teachers so recently brought to- 
gether from many different sources cannot be rapidly 
molded into a unified staff. 
The annual loss is unquestionably heavy, ranging 
from 14 to 23 per cent. of the entire staff.1_ How this 
compares with that of school systems in cities similar in 
size and character we do not know. Whether compara- 
tively high or low, the causes operating at Gary to this 
end are apparently the same as elsewhere. Of the losses 
between 1912 and 1916, 30 per cent. were due to mar- 
riage, 27 per cent. to taking positions in other systems, 5 
per cent. to illness, and 17 per cent. to remaining at 
home, returning toschool, and goinginto business, while 21 
per cent. are said to have been dropped from the service. 
Teachers’ contracts are drawn on a monthly scale, 
with ten months of continuous service expected, but not 
guaranteed.” For convenience in computing salaries, we 
use the rate for a ten month year. The principals of 
the Emerson and Froebel schools receive $2,000 a year, 
Jefferson pays $1,300, and Beveridge $1,100;3 these 
salaries include regular week day and Saturday service, 
but there is extra pay for night and summer work. None 
of the other schools has a principal, although there is a 
teacher in each who acts as principal and receives an 
additional $100 for such service ($90 for the regular day   
1Table XXII, Appendix D, page 242. 
In 1913-14 the regular day schools were in session only nine months.

school and $10 for the Saturday school). This addi- 
tional compensation is included in the rate at which such 
teachers are reported to be employed. 
The kindergartners are at the foot of the salary ladder. 
The median wage is $750, with salaries varying from 
$600 to $950. 
Regular elementary teachers fare better, their median 
rate being $800. Six receive the minimum salary, $600 
a year; only four receive as much as $1,000. 
Special teachers are better paid. The median for 
the group rises to $900, with $600 at the lower and $1,200 
at the upper extreme. 
The annual pay of regular high school teachers is still 
higher, the median mounting to $1,100, more by $100 
than the salary of the best paid elementary teachers. 
The range is, however, wide, salaries running from $800 
to $2,000, with five receiving $1,300 or more. 
In most cases, shopmen receive union wages. When 
these are reduced to a ten month rate, the median for 
the group is $1,000, which brings them next in salary to 
the regular high school teachers." 
1The salary schedule according to which the teachers were paid in 
1915-16 is as follows: crave TEACHERS 
FIRST YEAR SECOND YEAR THIRD YEAR FOURTH YEAR FIFTH YEAR 
PER MO. PER MO. PER MO. PER MO. PER MO. 
Class A $60.00 
Class B 70.00 $75.00 $80.00 $85.00 $ 90.00

month. Auditorium head teachers: An assistant principal is selected 
for auditorium work and is paid an additional salary of $10.00 per month.

TEACHING STAFF 69 
Gary teachers have unusual opportunities to add to 
their regular day school pay. They may teach Satur- 
days, receiving one twentieth of their regular monthly 
wage per day. In the night schools they can earn as 
much as $3 a night. During the summer most of the 
shopmen are busy with repairs and construction, and the 
two months’ summer school engages at full pay about 
one third of the staff. Finally, the Sunday school gives 
employment to a few. 
It would be impossible for Gary to carry on these 
outside activities without calling heavily on regular 
day school teachers. The pay schedule shows what they 
may earn in this way. For example, a teacher receiving 
a regular salary of $600 for day work may earn in a single 
year as much as $330 more, a $900 teacher may earn in all 
$1,320, a $1,200 teacher, $1,710, and a $1,500 teacher, 
$2,100.1 
All but 27 of the force in service at the end of 1915-16 
did work in addition to the regular day school.? Ninety 
seven taught also on Saturdays, 79 at night, and 49 in the 
summer school. The additional work of 27 was confined 
to Saturdays and of 18 to the night schools. But 30 
worked both Saturdays and at night, and 24, Saturdays, 
at night, and during the summer, while 3 were now and 
then on Sunday duty besides. 
The amount of extra service varies. For example, 83 
teachers, exclusive of the shopmen, served in the regular 
1Table XXIV, Appendix D, page 244. 
?Table XXV, Appendix D, page 245.
-P-A-G-E-96
7o THE GARY SCHOOLS 
day school the full 200 days. Of these, 17 did no addi- 
tional work.! The extra service of the remaining 66 
ranged from 4 to 132 days, half of them working less and 
half working more than 19 days. In a word, these 66 
teachers were on duty during 1915-16 the equivalent of 
not less than eleven months. 
The pay for this extra service materially increases the 
total earnings of the teachers. To illustrate: The aver- 
age regular salary of the 13 high school instructors serv- 
ing in excess of 200 days was $1,201; their total income 
averaged $264 higher, or $1,465.2_ The increment from 
extra work averages about 15 per cent., but there are 
teachers who increase their incomes by as much as 40 to 
60 per cent. of their salaries. Nevertheless, in making 
salary comparisons, these additional earnings should 
not be regarded as a part of the Gary salary schedule. 
In most respects the conditions of service that obtain 
elsewhere in Indiana prevail at Gary. A county or state 
certificate is required; contracts are made for a single 
year. The state provides a pension system, which 
the Gary teachers, however, have not as yet accepted. 
No allowance is made by the state for sickness or other 
enforced absence, but Gary teachers can partially re- 
coup themselves, since they receive the difference between 
their own salary and the amount paid to a substitute. 
The only important novelty in the conditions of service 
at Gary is the length of the school day. In the smaller

  TEACHING. STAFF 7a 
schools this is six hours, from 9 to 12 and from 1 to 4. 
In the four larger schools the day runs from 8:15 to 4:15, 
less an hour for luncheon. The physical training teach- 
ers give seven hours daily to instruction, shopmen, eight; 
all other teachers give six hours and they have in addition 
a seventh hour, which is supposed to be a,free period, but 
which is usually devoted to the making of records and 
reports. Thus a majority of the regular teachers work 
seven hours a day at school, although approximately a 
third of them are excused, on request, by the superin- 
tendent from attendance during the seventh hour. Of 
120 other cities scattered through the country having, 
like Gary, a population between 25,000 and 50,000, the 
average school day is five anda quarter hours. Eight of 
the 120 have a six hour day; one runs six and three quarter 
hours.!. It should be remembered, however, that where 
there is a short school day, teachers as a rule give time 
after school to records, reports, and outside duties, mak- 
ing for them approximately a six hour day. It should 
also be noted that there is a decided movement through- 
out the country, notably in New York and New Jersey, 
toward lengthening the school day in cities. 
Several different problems are involved in the question 
of the length of the school day; the extended use of the 
building is one question, the interest of the pupil another 
question, the strain upon the teacher still another. 
Financial and social considerations alike recommend 
that school buildings should be used longer each day   
1See Table XI, Appendix D, page 229. 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  “42 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
than is now the case. There are equally valid arguments 
for a lengthened school day for pupils, especially in cities, 
provided, of course, that, as at Gary, varied activities 
of a non-bookish character are provided. Whether a 
seven hour day for teachers is desirable is a different 
matter. Accurate data bearing on the health and vigor of 
teachers working seven hours a day are not available. 
If, however, one may trust daily observation running 
through several months, one would be inclined to regard 
the seven hour day, particularly when teachers have 
additional night work and Saturday work, as of doubt- 
ful wisdom. It leaves too little energy for the outside 
interests which ought to refresh and invigorate the daily 
lesson; and it probably tends to a mechanical handling of 
classroom work. There is, however, no reason why the 
school building and the pupil should not have longer 
hours without equally increasing the length of the teach- 
er’s day. In fact, one advantage of the Gary organiza- 
tion is that the day for the building may be one thing, 
that for pupils another, and that for teachers still another. 
Indeed, the teacher’s day can be made of any length 
whatsoever, though, of course, the shorter the teacher’s 
day, the more teachers are required and hence the larger 
the budget for teachers’ salaries, or the smaller the salary 
per teacher.

VII. CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION? 
E HAVE now discussed the main factors that 
determine the content and quality of classroom 
instruction—organization, supervision, course 
of study, teaching staff. We learned that the course of 
study is, in the first instance, necessarily that outlined 
by the state; that the members of the teaching staff 
do not differ essentially in education, training, and ex- 
perience from the corresponding types of teacher in 
other systems; finally, that, while the Gary system is 
devoted to a modern conception of education, supervi- 
sion has been too uncertain to mold the teaching staff into 
an effective organ for concerted effort toward its achieve- 
ment. 
A moment’s consideration will, however, show that 
under even the most favorable conditions an entire 
school system can only gradually promote radical reform 
in the substance and manner of classroom instruction. 
1This chapter deals with the teaching of reading, composition, spelling, 
arithmetic, geography, and history in the elementary schools, and with 
English, French, German, mathematics, Latin, and history in the high 
schools; science, shop work, etc., are dealt with in special chapters and 
special reports. 
A tabular statement showing the amount of observation of classes on 
which the present chapter is based is given in Appendix A, page 210. 
73 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  74 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
The course of study may indeed be expressed in 
terms so general that large leeway is left to the grade 
teacher; principal and supervisors may be favorable to 
innovation; the fact remains that at this day the conven- 
tional training of the teachers and the conventional 
character of available textbooks in most subjects, gen- 
erally speaking, handicap wide departure by an entire 
system from established practices. 
In the case of Gary, certain special factors already 
mentioned should also be taken into account. The 
population being foreign, the children come in large 
numbers from homes where no English or very poor 
English is spoken; the increase in population is taking 
place so rapidly that there is a steady infiltration into 
the schools of new and crude, even though ultimately 
promising, material; finally, the teaching staff, expanded 
to meet the pressure described, is composed of teachers 
of such varied training and experience that unity of 
purpose is extremely difficult to obtain. 
One gathers the impression that, carried along by its 
splendid conception of public education but misled, 
perhaps, by the ease with which an adequate material 
embodiment was so swiftly attained in the Froebel and 
Emerson plants, Gary failed to appreciate the extreme 
difficulty of converting new educational principles into 
new educational practice. It would be both unjust and 
unwise to make too much of this error, for it does not 
disprove the fundamental soundness of the scheme or 
destroy its stimulating influence on public education.
-P-A-G-E-103
  CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION 75 
The truth is that anything like general success was at 
the outset impossible, because of the lack of proper tools 
and proper agents. Had this been clearly perceived, 
doubtless details would have been more carefully watched 
and thus a larger measure of practical success would 
undoubtedly have been attained. In the present 
and succeeding chapters the actual teaching at Gary 
will be described in the effort to present an objective 
account of the instruction offered, as respects both 
content and quality. In view of the fact, however, 
that serious defects will be pointed out, the authors 
drop this word of caution lest the real scope, courage, and 
intelligence of the Gary vision be obscured by the errors 
made in the first attempts toward its realization. 
We have said that thoroughgoing reform can proceed 
only as a new body of teaching material is developed and 
teachers of a new type are trained. Fortunately, the 
situation has in recent years been ameliorated by the dif- 
fusion among teachers of sounder ideas as to values and 
methods and by the publication of a large body of supple- 
mentary school texts in the principal classroom subjects. 
Even teachers trained in the most cut and dried fashion 
have in large numbers been aroused to the futility of 
abstract drill in grammar and arithmetic and to the use- 
lessness of a mechanical grind in geography and history; 
and though the textbooks in common use continue to 
contain much irrelevant, uninteresting, and indigestible 
detail, the intelligent and resourceful teacher is not 
usually so strictly and unsympathetically “supervised”
-P-A-G-E-104
  76 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
that she is kept from supplementing or partly supplant- 
ing the textbook by utilizing materials and paraphernalia 
rich in content and in emotional value. While, as we 
have said, it would be unfair at this stage to expect any 
school system to organize its classroom instruction on a 
consistently modern basis, it is entirely fair to demand 
that the formal methods and sterile material of a past 
generation should be noticeably relieved by the intro- 
duction of a fresher spirit and by the use of concrete 
and fertile subject matter. 
In so far as classroom instruction is concerned, the 
Gary schools show the confusion inevitably incident to 
transition, but aggravated unquestionably by ineffec- 
tiveness of central control. The conventional school 
framework has been shattered; new ends, new activities 
have been freely introduced; directly and indirectly, the 
inadequacy or unsoundness of certain common school 
aims has been emphasized. Self-control, initiative, re- 
sourcefulness have been very properly set up as essential 
characteristics of training for life in a democratic so- 
ciety. Unfortunately, many of the teachers have not 
been at Gary long enough to catch the spirit; some who 
sympathize with its spirit have not been effectively as- 
sisted to abandon or modify their former habits; in con- 
sequence, despite some excellent work, which we do not 
overlook, many teachers at Gary are probably not doing 
so well as they have previously done under other condi- 
tions. 
These statements are particularly true of the regular
-P-A-G-E-105
  CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION 7 
primary teachers. They devote two hours daily to 
work in the three R’s, but departmentalization tends 
in a measure to interfere with the direct use of literature, 
science, and games as means of making the three R’s less 
formal and more appealing. The danger—never far 
distant—that the work of the primary teacher will be 
technical and mechanical is therefore increased at 
Gary. A teacher might, of course, even under this 
organization, so familiarize herself with what her pupils 
are doing in the special branches that she would be able 
to bring what they have learned in them to bear upon 
the mastery of the regular studies. Most of those obser- 
ved were not doing so. Primary instruction too rarely 
radiated from a central topic, from which were derived 
the materials for reading, spelling, language, arithmetic, 
handwork, dramatization, and even science and music, 
each portion thus reénforcing every other part; it was 
more apt to be handled in separate compartments, 
arithmetic, language, reading being more or less inde- 
pendent of one another, with the result that much of 
the primary teaching was mechanical and slow. This 
was not, be it repeated, universally the case; but it was 
the rule, rather than the exception. 
Take reading for an example. Some excellent in- 
struction in beginning classes was observed. Appropri- 
ate stories about familiar objects were developed by the 
teachers and written on the blackboard for the children 
to read; phrase reading and natural expression received 
attention; the meaning of the new words selected for 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  78 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
mastery was conveyed through the use of the children’s 
experiences, real objects, picture cards, and action; and 
well directed repetition through the use of the black- 
board and picture word cards pressed home the desired 
word image. Such teaching represents the occasional 
“high points.” More commonly appropriate prepara- 
tory work was slighted; inadequate emphasis was given 
to the meaning of new words and to the development of a 
well chosen reading vocabulary; the children imitated 
the standard of expression set by the teacher and under 
such conditions the reading became mere word naming. 
Of the reading heard in the upper primary grades, 
some of it was good, but in the main it ranged from ordi- 
nary to poor. The selections were usually excellent, 
comprising the best of myths, fairy tales, fables, folk- 
lore, poems, and descriptive narrations of famous events 
and characters—that is, the best available material had 
been selected, but the teaching technique was often seri- 
ously at fault. The pupils of a room were, as a rule, 
divided into two sections, one reciting, while the other 
did seat or board work. The section engaged in reading 
occupied kindergarten chairs about the teacher. The 
children had seldom made any preparation; seldom did 
the teacher ask the subject of the lesson or seek to bring 
out the main theme. She merely directed the children 
to prepare silently the first sentence or paragraph. On 
the completion of this task, the pupils raised their hands; 
thereupon a pupil began. The teacher might ask a ques- 
tion to introduce the next story or paragraph, but more
-P-A-G-E-107
  
CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION 79 
frequently she called upon a child to read on; and there- 
after the exercises became sight work. If pronuncia- 
tion became too bad, the teacher might write the words 
upon the blackboard for drill. Little attention was 
devoted to meaning or use. Only once in the classes 
observed were children required to re-tell the story or to 
summarize the main points of the narration after the 
reading. Classes were usually dismissed without as- 
signments, and even when assignments were made 
the teacher did not regularly give suggestions as to the 
preparation of the new lesson. The work was too fre- 
quently characterized by listlessness' and indifference; 
after the first few minutes of the period only part of the 
class appeared to attend to the work in hand. 
After reading, the time remaining to the regular pri- 
mary teachers is taken up mostly with spelling, writing, 
and arithmetic. In spelling, common words chosen by 
the teacher from the daily life of the children and from 
their current school work were emphasized, and well 
selected lists were also supplied by the primary super- 
visor. Patience was exhibited in drilling children 
in the number combinations and in the fundamental 
processes. No small part of the drill in these subjects 
was carried on by helpers—children from the sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grades. By way of creating inter- 
est in drill, competitive devices were freely employed. 
For example, a competitive game was thus made of spell- 
ing: The teacher wrote the words on the blackboard— 
“snow,” “cow,” “foreign,” etc. After the children had
-P-A-G-E-108
    80 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
studied these for a moment, the teacher called by turns, 
from the two sides into which the class had been divided, 
upon the children, who indicated by raising the hand 
that they were ready. The pupil signaled took his place 
before the class, with his back to the blackboard, and 
endeavored to pronounce and spell each of the words of 
the lists. The side which had the greater number of 
successes to its credit won the contest. The difficulty 
with these competitive devices is that the same aggres- 
sive children were always in evidence, while the timid 
and the children who are probably in greatest need 
of individual attention kept to their seats. Little was 
done toward using the more recently contrived meth- 
ods for the teaching of primary spelling or primary arith- 
metic. 
In the middle and upper grades some efforts to vitalize 
arithmetic were observed. To make the topic of stocks 
and bonds real, an upper grade teacher organized his class 
into a joint stock company for the time being. There is 
also displayed in the hall of Emerson some work showing 
the application of percentage to baseball club standings, 
and a graph of the temperature of a schoolroom at dif- 
ferent hours of the day. But for the most part, in these 
grades, the best teaching of arithmetic seen was of 
the old-fashioned sort, where children are held rigor- 
ously to a mastery of processes and to the solution and 
explanation of problems of every conceivable kind. Few 
signs of the new arithmetic were noted. For example, 
two middle grade classes were learning liquid measure. 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION 81 
In the one, the teacher exhibited a gill, a pint, a quart, a 
half gallon, and a gallon measure. But there was noth- 
ing for the children to measure; they merely looked at 
the measures, observing their relative sizes. In the 
second class, the table of liquid measures was presented 
altogether as something to be memorized from the book. 
There were no measures for the children to handle and 
compare, nothing to measure, no appeal to experience, 
no mention of use. 
In the higher grades a few teachers were doing well 
in reading. The selections, generally of excellent char- 
acter, were studied seriously. Interpretive discussion 
preceded oral reading. Appreciation and taste were 
conscious objects of the instruction, and the selections 
were employed to present in concrete form the larger 
ideals of successful personal and community living. But 
the bulk of the reading in both the middle and upper 
grades was not of high quality. Asin the primary grades, 
the pupils were too often listless and indifferent. 
Periods devoted to history and geography were usually 
divided equally between so-called study—a form of silent 
reading—and recitation. There was no supervised study. 
Lessons were invariably assigned by pages or by general 
subject, mostly without comment by the teacher. The 
children read over the assignments chiefly with a view to 
finding the answers to the questions printed at the end of 
the section. At the end of the allotted study period, the 
recitation began. The teacher, with book in hand, put 
seriatim the above mentioned questions, occasionally add- 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
    
82 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
ing one or more on her own initiative. For example, if in 
history :“‘ What was Jefferson’s purposein securing the pass- 
age of the Embargo Act?” ‘What was the Embargo 
Act?” etc. Orin geography: “In what part of the United 
States is New England?” ‘Name the states.” “Which 
state is largest?” etc. The answers of the children were 
brief and deficient in detail; this, whether they remembered 
for the moment what the text contained or whether 
they read the answers from the open books before them. 
The teacher usually added very little; there was little 
or no class discussion, outside reading was seldom re- 
quired. Some of the seventh and eighth grade geography 
and history, and almost all that of the middle grades, was 
indeed little more than a sight reading exercise. 
Asin the primary grades there was usually in the middle 
and upper grades too little connection between the differ- 
ent parts of a pupil’s daily work. In part, this is due to 
the fact that in the higher grades the “fundamentals” are 
sometimes distributed among several teachers. Making 
clear to children the cross relations existing between 
studies is nowhere easy, and departmentalization rather 
increases the difficultyat Gary. But more could be accom- 
plished than is now attempted. The teach‘ng of arith- 
metic, for example, could take more account of what is 
going on in the laboratories, the shops, the cooking and 
sewing rooms; the influence of geography upon history 
could be more frequently pointed out. The main evi- 
dences of correlation noted were the effort to bring into 
the spelling lesson words common to the special and
-P-A-G-E-111
  
CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION 83 
practical activities; and a similar and sometimes remark- 
ably successful effort to draw composition themes from 
the shops, the laboratories, and the gymnasium or play- 
ground. A really admirable paper on swimming, in 
which abundant material was systematically organized 
and clearly presented, is a case in point. 
The generally meager and formal character of the class- 
room instruction may be in part due to the assumption 
that exercises in shops and laboratories, reading in con- 
nection with science, history, and industry will supply 
the vital elements which mere drill omits. To what 
extent this is the case will appear in the chapters dealing 
with the activities in question, and in the chapter de- 
scribing the objective tests designed to measure skill in 
reading, spelling, arithmetic, and composition. 
In a measure, excessive formality in regular class- 
room work may arise from the theory that an application 
teacher is provided, whose special concern it is to assist 
backward pupils and to place “before the children real 
problems of the type that the world of industry, busi- 
ness, and citizenship will place before them when they 
leave school.” Without raising any question as to the 
wisdom of divorcing the child’s learning of fundamental 
processes from the application of those processes, the 
facts at Gary do not bear out the theory of a separate 
application teacher. There were only four application 
teachers in the system during the spring term 1916, of 
whom one gave regular departmental instruction, while 
the remaining three confined their efforts to the lower  
-P-A-G-E-112
ST ee eee 
84 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
middle and primary grades. Observation of the work re- 
vealed nothing beyond the same kind of formal drill upon 
elements and processes that was observed in regular 
classes. Moreover, application teachers are handicapped 
by not knowing intimately the precise ground covered 
by the class teacher and the particular difficulties of 
the children in hand. The same amount of time could 
certainly be employed to better advantage in regular 
work of proper type. 
It is not easy to make out how classroom instruction 
as a whole is affected by departmentalization. In the 
earlier grades excessive departmentalization may tend. 
to separate into independent teaching units subjects 
which at that stage might better be presented by one 
teacher, constantly solicitous to connect activities one 
with another. On the other hand, it is doubtful whether 
in the middle and upper grades departmentalization is 
complete enough to procure real continuity in the teach- 
ing of the regular classroom studies. For in these grades 
pupils change teachers in the fundamental subjects on 
advancing from the third to the fourth grade, and also 
on passing from the sixth to the seventh. Unquestion- 
ably, the Gary type of program requires more depart- 
mental teaching than the conventional school, but effi- 
cient supervision and careful organization can alone 
secure for the pupil the advantages inherent in it. 
Of the high school subjects, no departure from conven- 
tional handling was observed in mathematics. In the 
Emerson school the teacher of Latin had undertaken

CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION 85 
to relate the instruction in Latin to English and to every- 
day life and her efforts unquestionably aroused en- 
thusiastic interest on the part of her pupils. In both 
schools, the spoken use of French and German was 
stressed; and general history was taught with conscious 
reference to the requirements of citizenship. But much 
the most important novelty was the work in English 
composition, already alluded to above. 
Instead of short daily or weekly themes, an entire 
term was concentrated upon a single effort. The work 
was done not hurriedly at home, but deliberately at 
school. All the steps necessary to successful writing 
were taken in consultation with and under the direction 
of the teacher. A practical atmosphere surrounded 
the work, and it was executed as nearly as possible in the 
spirit of the professional writer. Free choice of topics 
was permitted, but these were carefully canvassed in 
order to decide whether they were of sufficient general 
interest, timely, and worth while. Pupils were taught 
how to assemble data, how to observe, how to use refer- 
ence books and the library, and how to take, keep, and 
arrange notes. With the preliminaries out of the way, 
the original outline was revised for the writing. The 
first draft was freely made, without too much regard 
to choice of words, form, or organization. The teacher 
reviewed this draft with the pupil, leading him to discover 
for himself its weak places and discussing with him ways 
to improve them, leaving him to make the needed revi- 
sions. This procedure was repeated again and again. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  86 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
The outcome was an elaborate essay into which the pupil 
had put himself and from the doing of which he had de- 
rived real training. 
High school teaching was unfavorably affected by the 
practice of placing in one class pupils of different high 
school grades—a necessary expedient in the small high 
school. The tendency was marked in the special 
studies and activities; somewhat less so in the old line 
high school disciplines. Commercial classes almost 
always comprised pupils from each of the four high 
school years, special students of uncertain preparation, 
and even eighth grade children. To add to instruc- 
tional difficulties, this promiscuous group usually pur- 
sued typewriting, stenography, and bookkeeping, all 
at the same time, under a single teacher. Mathe- 
matics classes were frequently made up of pupils from 
three different high school years; at times all took the 
same kind and grade of instruction; again each group had 
different work—for example, arithmetic and solid ge- 
ometry, first and second term algebra. The same mix- 
ture of pupils from the different high school years oc- 
curred in Latin, modern languages, English and history. 
These promiscuous groupings and combinations are ac- 
counted for on the grounds of irregularity and economy. 
The situation at Gary as regards instruction is thus con- 
fused. The newness of the city and of the enterprise and 
the ambitious scale on which the schools are projected not 
only account for some of the defects pointed out, but ought 
in fairness to be regarded as in some measure extenuating 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  
CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION 87 
them. Itis, nevertheless, clear that, so far as the modern 
schoolinvolves the elimination of obsolete materialand the 
vital handling of all material in the usual classroom sub- 
jects, Gary’s contribution is not considerable. The mod- 
ern attitude is indeed encountered here and there in 
almost every subject, but, while heartily encouraged, it 
is still exceptional and individual rather than character- 
istic and general. Under existing conditions the absence 
of efficient supervision cuts both ways. Teachers with 
ideas—such as the teacher of English whose work is 
described above—are not hampered by a supervisor who 
has different notions; on the other hand, less competent 
instructors working amidst difficult conditions are also 
left to their own devices. In the main, therefore, the 
teaching is of ordinary type, ineffectually controlled. 
There is nothing in the Gary plan that requires this; 
there is no reason why a school of the Gary type should 
not be well organized, well administered, and well super- 
vised. Indeed, as we have already urged, the enrichment 
of school life inevitably results in complications which 
give added importance to good organization, good admin- 
istration, and good supervision.

T= judgments expressed in the preceding chapter 
embody the results of prolonged and impartial 
observation; nevertheless, it is perfectly fair to 
say of them that, after all, they represent opinion only. 
Some day, let us hope, it may be possible to replace such 
observations fully by measurements of an objective char- 
acter. At the present time, expert opinion based upon 
inspection is in many respects our only means of estimat- 
ing the value of educational procedure. In certain of 
the fundamental subjects’—e. g., handwriting, spelling, 
arithmetic, composition, and reading—we are, however, 
in position to measure performance by means of objec- 
tive tests; and in these subjects tests were given in the 
four larger Gary schools—Froebel, Emerson, Jefferson, 
and Beveridge. In recent years these tests have been 
widely used. Unfortunately, however, they have not 
always been applied with equal care or under exactly 
the same conditions. In consequence, for purposes of 
comparison the results obtained cannot usually be taken

ucts, by Stuart A. Courtis. 
?Practical tests were also given in shop work, household arts, physical 
training, and the sciences. These are discussed in the chapters dealing 
with the respective subjects.

at their face value. Moreover, there is in most subjects 
as yet no general agreement as to what constitutes satis- 
factory performance: Comparison should therefore be 
made with extreme hesitation, except in the simple 
handwriting, spelling, arithmetic, and reading tests 
for which something like a standard has been derived 
from scores made by large numbers of children. The 
few comparisons employed in this chapter are of this 
kind. 
Handwriting may be tested in several ways. A child 
may be asked to do his ‘“‘best,” with the result that he 
achieves something quite different from his usual writing; 
or he may be left free to determine for himself the rate 
and quality of his writing—ie., to exercise his “free 
choice”; or he may be called on to write a dictated pas- 
sage—in which case the quality of the writing is condi- 
tioned by the rate at which the passage is dictated. 
Finally, specimens of handwriting may be secured from 
papers written for other purposes—a composition or an 
essay, for example, written by the child without knowl- 
edge that it may be used as the basis for a judgment on 
the quality of his handwriting. It is obvious that the 
various specimens of a single pupil’s handwriting thus 
procured may differ considerably in merit. At Gary 
no effort was made to procure samples of a child’s ‘‘best”’; 
but the remaining three methods were employed, i. e., 
the child wrote a specimen as he pleased, he wrote from 
dictation, and specimens were obtained from composi- 
tions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  go THE GARY SCHOOLS 
Between the average specimens taken from the compo- 
sitions of eighth grade pupils and average specimens 
taken from the “free choice” test, in which children 
write as they please, there is practically no difference at 
all. Figure 9 represents this characteristic 8th grade 
product. That is, of the children in the last year of the 
elementary schools of Gary, half write as well as or 
better than the sample given in Figure 9,! and half 
write less well than this sample. 
A comparison of the results obtained in successive 
grades shows that pupils learn to write faster without 
learning to write much better as they go forward through 
the grades. (Figure 10.) Comparison with the results 
of similar tests in other cities must, of course, be made 
with caution, since the methods employed are so new 
and the factors to be controlled so many that different 
situations are not strictly comparable. With this 
qualification, it is perhaps still worth noting that, on the 
whole, when compared with those of other cities, Gary 
results in the free choice writing test are lower in quality. 
(Figure 10.) Apparently, the Gary children write 
more freely than other children, but pay less attention to 
the quality of their work. On these points the three 
different tests practically agree (Figure 11). And no 
clear difference is to be made out as between the quality 
of the handwriting in the various schools at Gary, that

is, there is no certain evidence that one school does better 
or worse than another. 
Spelling, like handwriting, was measured in three dif- 
ferent ways. Carefully selected lists of words were 
used to test the pupil’s ability to spell disconnected 
words—much as an old-fashioned spelling lesson was 
conducted; next, sentences were dictated at a definite 
rate so as to compel children to write without giving 
them too much time to think of spelling; finally, their

composition papers were marked as exercises in spelling. 
The conclusion reached as to the ability of Gary school 
children as spellers rests thus on three distinct types of 
objective evidence.

The list tests are so constructed that the words given, 
say, to the fifth grade are for that grade approximately 
as difficult as are the words giyen to, say, the eighth 
grade for that grade. Different grades ought, therefore,

to do equally well on their respective lists. Previous 
studies indicate that, on the average, American school 
children in each grade, at the time of year the tests were 
given, may be expected to reach a score of 76 per cent. 
on the words appropriate to their respective grades. 
At Gary, the grades, taken all together, averaged 55 
per cent.—a difference of 21 per cent. An innovation
-P-A-G-E-124
  94 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
was, also, tried. The list framed for the eighth 
grade was given to grades 9, 10, 11, and 12; with 
the result that by the end of the twelfth grade the 
words were spelled with 80 per cent. accuracy. It 
would appear, therefore, that, as thus tested, grade by 
grade, the Gary children spell less well than the chil- 
dren of the 84 cities on which the standard of 76 per cent. 
used above was based; on the other hand, those who re- 
main through the twelfth grade reach and slightly excel 
the common eighth grade standard. (Figure 12).! 
In order to measure the development of spelling ability 
from grade to grade, a dictation test was employed. 
Several sets of sentences of gradually increasing difficulty 
were used, each set being dictated to several successive 
grades; thus, Test 1 was dictated to grades 2, 3, and 4; 
Test 2, somewhat more difficult, to grades 4, 5, and 6, etc. 
The change in score noted from class to class thus indi- 
cates the extent of improvement. In general, the results : 
of the dictation test confirm those of the list tests. The 
eighth grade score on the easy words for the grade was 
69 per cent., on the difficult words, 50 per cent. In 
grades 2 to 4 the improvement shown in the two year 
interval was 41 percent. For grades 4 to 6 it was but 34 
per cent., from grades 6 to 8, 20 per cent., from grades 8 to 
12, 33 per cent. In other words, the results show that 
improvement from grade to grade is small and relatively 
decreases as the difficulty of the words increases. This

As a check upon the formal spelling tests, misspellings

-P-A-G-E-126
    96 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
in papers written in the composition test were tabulated. 
The errors noted were of two sorts: slips, or trivial mis- 
takes, such as the omission of “d” in the word “and”; 
and more serious misspellings, such as ‘“‘peise”’ (piece). 
In the eighth grade papers, 27,610 words were used, and 
720 misspellings occurred—or, omitting slips, 580. The 
general accuracy of the spelling was in either case very 
high—g7 or 98 per cent., according as slips are counted 
or not—a result that conflicts with that of the two tests 
already described. Even if the fifty common words, 
used altogether 14,598 times, are omitted, the percentage 
of the remainder correctly spelled is still high (96 per 
cent.). The list thus abbreviated still contains many

short and easy words, but it also contains some of the 
so-called “spelling demons”—words commonly mis- 
spelled by children everywhere and in all grades. Hence 
the meaning of the discrepancy between the list tests and 
the composition tests must remain a matter of speculation. 
V The products of training in arithmetic are many and of 
varying complexity. They range from such simple skills 
as addition and multiplication to such complex products 
as ability to reason in arithmetical terms. Measure- 
ment of the simple skills is comparatively easy, but 
just what constitutes a legitimate thinking or reasoning 
problem at each stage of school progress has not yet been 
determined. Accordingly, no reasoning tests were given 
at Gary. The skills selected for measurement were 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of 
whole numbers and fractions. These abilities are at 
least fundamental for all arithmetical work, both in 
school and in later life. 
Measurement of the skill of the Gary children in carry- 
ing out the four fundamental operations with the Courtis 
Tests, Series B, shows regular though small gains in both 
rate of work and in accuracy throughout the elementary 
grades, a growth that continues also through the high 
school, except’ in multiplication, in which little gain in 
accuracy is made beyond the eighth grade. (Figure 14.)! 
In general, the Gary results compare unfavorably with 
scores elsewhere obtained. Thus, the Gary eighth grade

outset that American school systems, in general, make a 
poor showing. At Gary testing was limited to simple 
narration. Children were asked to write a story of some 
interesting or exciting experience that they had them- 
selves passed through. Subjects were suggested, and, for 
the most part, their selection of a topic conformed to the 
suggestions made to them. Children wrote freely in the 
presence of the examiners and were given ample time— 
fifteen to twenty minutes. 
The following paper illustrates the average composi- 
tion ability of the best eighth grade class at Gary (50 
Hillegas): 
AN ACCIDENT 
We were out at camp No 133 which is sittua- 
ted ## e8 near the banks of Deep River. One of 
the men that stayed at this camp owned a old 
duck boat which leaked and if you wanted to 
ride in it you would have to set a certain way ot 
it would fill with water and soon sink. 
My brother saw me paddaling around in it 
and he decided that he would do it himself. 
He weighed about twenty-five Ibs. more than 
me I told him the way to set in it but he would 
not listen but said that one end was as good as 
the other. 
He jumped in and sat down on the nearest end 
which was the wrong end and paddaled out in- 
to the river. He paddaled down the river for

some distance and then turned around to come 
back. By this time the boat was nearly sink- 
ing and we saw him paddeling as fast as he could 
go to get back to the bank. 
But it was of no use the boat began to sink 
and he tried to get to the right end but in trying 
to get to the right end he upset the boat and had 
to swim with all of his clothes on. The water 
wasn’t very cold and he swam all the way up to 
the bridge pushing the boat with him. He soon 
was in dry clothes and was none the worse for 
the accident. 
A study of the scores assigned to the eighth grade 
compositions shows that of the 122 eighth grade pupils 
tested, but one pupil in three wrote a composition in 
merit equal to or better than the above sample. It is 
therefore fair to infer that the elementary school train- 
ing does not give much power in the selection of sub- 
ject matter, the organization of material, or the choice of 
words. The admirable teaching singled out for com- 
ment in the preceding chapter is thus clearly exceptional 
and does not reach any considerable number of pupils. 
Teachers of English hold that there should be in 
compositions increasing freedom from error from grade 
to grade, and increasing power both to choose the words 
best adapted to the expression of a given thought and to 
organize ‘the words chosen into coherent discourse. Ac-

cordingly, the eighth grade papers were subjected to a 
series of analyses in order to determine the number 
and character of the various errors made. Papers were 
marked for gross errors in capitalization, punctuation, 
spelling, and grammar. On the average, a Gary eighth 
grade child makes a total of 675 gross errors in his first 
draft of an original composition of 214 words. 
Even more complicated than composition is the sub- 
ject of reading. What do we mean by the ability to 
read? Do we mean merely ability to pronounce a given 
series of words correctly? Or is it implied that the series 
of words in question should be read with intelligent 
expression? Does “‘reading” involve capacity to re- 
produce the thought in one’s own language, or the 
ability to answer questions about the contents of the 
passage read? Is there any difference between reading 
aloud and reading to oneself—oral reading and silent 
reading so-called? This is not an exhaustive list, but it 
serves to show the necessity for careful procedure, and 
an equally careful interpretation of results. 
Both oral and silent reading tests were given at Gary. 
For the former, Gray’s scale was employed. This yields 
a score based on the difficulty of paragraphs to be pro- 
nounced, the time taken to read them, and the number 
of errors made. When so tested, the Gary children, 
with the possible exception of the second and third 
grades, read more slowly and make slightly more errors 
than children of other systems, for example, the children 
of 23 Illinois cities (Figure 15).

  Io2 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
v The Kansas Silent Reading tests, among others, were 
used to measure the silent reading of the Gary children. 
These consist of short paragraphs, each requiring the 
child to make some response; the accuracy with which 
the response is made indicates whether the paragraph 
has been correctly read and comprehended. The test is 
therefore not only a reading but an intelligence test, af- 
fording an index of the degree of development attained 
in the ability “to read and think about what is read.” 
The results show that Gary children respond to a com- 
plicated test of this kind about as well as children gen- 
erally. (Figure 16.)! . 
The results of the two chapters dealing with instruc- 
tion may be briefly summarized. The impressions 
gained through inspection and the results of the tests 
are not entirely consistent. For example, silent reading 
makes a distinctly better showing in the tests than one 
would have expected on the basis of classroom observa- 
tion. Spelling makes a poor showing on the list test and 
a very good showing on the composition test. It is not 
possible to reconcile these divergencies without adducing 
considerations as to which different opinions could 
fairly be entertained. Without, however, seeking to 
ignore the conflict of evidence, the authors still feel that 
the quality of classroom instruction at Gary falls short 
of what is necessary. 
We are interested, however, not only in the Gary 
classroom work as such, but in making out, if possible,

whether it has been favorably or unfavorably affected 
by the so-called duplicate organization and the unpre- 
cedented development of special activities. From this 
point of view, let us recall certain important differences 
between the schools. The Froebel and Emerson schools 
are the only schools completely equipped on the Gary 
plan; the Jefferson and Beveridge schools, though organ- 
ized on the duplicate basis, offer a much simpler pro- 
gram. Again, the Froebel school, containing 36 per 
cent. of the entire school population, is more recent in 
origin and more foreign in composition than the Emerson. 
Do the results of the tests reflect these differences? Is 
the classroom work of the fully developed Gary schools 
consistently different in quality from that of the less com- 
plicated Gary schools? The facts are these: 
In the handwriting tests there is almost no trace of 
constant differences from school to school; the differ- 
ences in spelling are slight, but, such as they are, lean 
in favor of the Jefferson and Beveridge schools; in arith- 
metic, Beveridge leads, Jefferson comes second, Froebel, 
despite its handicaps, surpasses Emerson; in composi- 
tion, the order runs, Jefferson, Emerson, Froebel, Bev- 
eridge; in oral reading, Emerson is distinctly better 
than the other three schools; in silent reading, Froebel 
and Beveridge read more rapidly than Jefferson and 
Emerson, while in the reproduction test, Jefferson comes 
first, Emerson second, and Beveridge last. 
It is clear that in both the more complicated Gary 
schools the teaching is in some subjects relatively better

than the teaching in the simpler schools and that in other 
subjects the reverse is true. The extent to which the 
Gary plan is carried out is not therefore in itself the 
decisive factor. We are inclined to believe that low- 
ness of score is attributable to lack of unity of effort on 
the part of an ineffectively supervised teaching staff, 
recruited from many different sources, and to confusion 
due to the constant infiltratiom of pupils from other 
school systems, while the fluctuations from school to 
school and from subject to subject are probably to be 
ascribed to local and individual causes. However this 
may be, it must be recognized that no educational sys- 
tem can be considered to have completely established 
itself until, whatever else it achieves, it has also secured 
the fundamental educational values represented by the 
essential tools of learning. The results of testing the 
Gary schools do not invalidate the effort to socialize 
education, but it is evident that the Gary experiment 
has not yet successfully solved the problems involved 
in the socialization of education, in so far as efficient 
instruction in the necessary common school branches is 
concerned.

IX. SCIENCE TEACHING! 
HE teaching of science necessarily plays an im- 
i portant part in an educational scheme constructed 
with deliberate and adequate reference to the 
world we live in. This does not mean that place is to be 
made for science by excising from the curriculum studies 
and activities that derive their sanction from other, yet 
equally cogent, considerations—literature, for example, 
and history, music, and art. The various efforts needed 
in order to touch the pupil at vital points must harmon- 
ize the conflicting demands upon his time and energy—a 
problem rendered easier of solution by the lengthened 
school day, improved school equipment, and the better 
use of the child’s environment. An education of this 
type will, as we have already pointed out, include the tra- 
ditional humane studies for their social and esthetic 
value; industrial activities, because they give an addi- 
tional outlet for constructive impulse, at the same 
time utilizing important aspects of current life; and, 
finally, science studies, not only because they give scope 
and play to senses and judgment, but because through

SCIENCE TEACHING 107 
them alone can the child gain insight into the world of 
nature. 
In connection with science and shop work, the mere 
cultivation of dexterity and the exercise of the senses 
have, of course, an undeniable value. It is worth a boy’s 
while to be “handy,” and certainly worth his while to be 
observant. Thus even at the sense level, a case can be 
made out for work of this type. But it takes a deeper 
and stronger reason to justify the elaborateness of outfit 
which Gary has installed and the seriousness with which 
the subject is viewed. This is not far to seek. It is, for 
intellectual reasons, a sound philosophy of education 
which insists that the child do things rather than read 
about them or see them done. But mere doing of concrete 
tasks—whether artificial tasks from thelaboratory manual 
or real tasks from everyday life—fails to prolong the exer- 
cise into the intellectual region. To realize large educa- 
tional value the exercise needs to be carried far enough to 
bring out explicitly the intellectual side of processes. The 
pupil must study and study hard about the factors which 
he is manipulating; he must think and think hard about 
the causal and purposeful relations involved in the con- 
crete processes that he is carrying out. “He must eventu- 
ally be able to express results in generalized form, and to 
deal in the abstract with laws and relationships. A de- 
velopment of this kind does not take place sponta- 
neously, as a result of the pupil’s working with metals, a 
printing press, a dynamo, or a camera. Yet in these ap- 
pealing tools and objects—camera, dynamo, or lathe— 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
    
108 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
innumerable intellectual values and factors are involved 
—the origin and history of culture, the properties of 
materials, the application of laws and principles of wide 
scope. Only a skillful instructor, pursuing a well thought 
out and well wrought out plan, requiring interested 
and protracted effort on the pupil’s part, can teach sci- 
ence in this fashion. But science and shop teaching 
will not otherwise meet expectations or realize their possi- 
bilities. 
Great hopes attended the introduction of science 
studies into education—hopes that to a considerable ex- 
tent have thus far been disappointed. If we assume— 
as we do—that this disappointment does not really imply 
simply a mistaken enthusiasm on the part of those 
who believe in the importance of science in the child’s 
educational development, several reasons may be as- 
signed for it—the lack of sufficient school time, the lack 
of trained teachers, and the employment of an unsound 
method. These factors go far to account for the unsat- 
isfactory outcome of the early efforts to teach science in 
the elementary and the high school. The subjects usually 
got only a “stepmotherly” position on the school sched- 
ule; often the teachers had not been properly trained; 
finally, the method of presentation was excessively 
formal and abstract, i. e., the subjects were presented to 
children in the severe logical fashion appropriate only to 
mature minds. 
A method of approach that seeks to remedy these de- 
fects has often been urged by educational reformers and
-P-A-G-E-141
  SCIENCE TEACHING 10g 
has already in a measure been successfully demonstrated 
in a few places. Gary has, however, undertaken the ex- 
periment on a larger scale and with more elaborate facili- 
ties. 
The science teaching of the Gary schools falls natur- 
ally into two divisions, (1) nature study and gardening, 
carried on in the primary grades, (2) study of the sepa- 
rate organized sciences, carried on in the upper grades of 
the elementary school and in the high school. Nature 
study and gardening are common to practically all the 
schools of the system, while the study of the separate 
organized sciences in the intermediate and higher 
grades is practically limited to the Emerson and Froebel 
schools. Theoretically, the science work of all schools 
is viewed as a department under the supervising 
direction of the teacher of chemistry in the Emerson 
school, but this organization is only nominal. No gen- 
eral statement of purposes, no outline or plan of work 
aiming to secure coherence and progression throughout 
the system had been prepared. The several schools 
were left free to define things, each for itself, without 
careful oversight. 
In respect to scheduled time allotment in the 
elementary schools, science exceeds six subjects and 
is itself exceeded by six subjects; it gets more time 
than German, music, geography, writing, spelling, or 
history, less than reading, language, arithmetic, manual 
training (including drawing), auditorium, or physical 
training. In this matter, Gary does distinctly better
-P-A-G-E-142
  110 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
for science subjects than other systems. While the 
fifty cities, whose programs were tabulated by Pro- 
fessor Holmes of Harvard, schedule on the average 331 
hours to science in the elementary school, Gary schedules 
567—i. e., 70 per cent. more. Of the total school time, 
science gets in the fifty cities on the average 4 per cent.; 
at Gary, 5 percent. This, however, be it observed, is the 
scheduled allowance. At Gary, practice falls short of 
theory, though we are unable to state how far short. 
The time set apart for science is not infrequently found to 
be otherwise occupied. 
For the nature study work of the primary grades, which 
is conducted by special teachers except in the very small- 
est schools, all the schools possess more or less equip- 
ment. The large resources of the Emerson and Froebel 
schools easily supply the requisite material. Of the 
smaller schools, the Jefferson provides a remodeled class- 
room, containing a plant growing house, animal house, 
and work place for children, mounted specimens, birds’ 
nests, etc.; the Beveridge school possesses less, the Glen 
Park school, almost nothing, and the remaining schools, 
nothing. All the schools, however, with the exception 
of Ambridge and West Gary, have ample and flourishing 
gardens.’ 
The work in these early grades is formless and 
discontinuous in character. Not onlyis there no general   
1It is difficult—and properly so—to draw a sharp line between nature 
study and botany, especially at the Froebel and Emerson schools, where 
the teachers of botany are in charge of the school gardens,

program, but no teacher has developed a compre- 
hensive program of her own. At the Jefferson, for 
example, one of the earlier grades was at the time of 
the survey attempting observational work on the pussy- 
willow. Another class was engaged in developing the 
subject of climate with particular reference to the cause 
of winds; at the close of the discussion a home experiment 
to show how air currents are affected by heat was sug- 
gested, though the explanation was too vague to guaran- 
tee a successful result. At the Beveridge school, nature 
study, which does not go beyond the third grade, was 
of the same occasional character, consisting of things 
that seemed to “‘fit in best”—now a field trip for fruit 
branches, again a bird lesson, later, an observational study 
of beans. In the absence alike of a program, and of 
appropriate records, it was not easy to ascertain just 
what had preceded or what was to follow. In the 
Emerson school, the children were particularly interested 
in the observation and care of. living animals. The 
clearest evidence of interest and activity appeared in 
certain schools, where the pupils had mounted seeds 
of the wild plants of the region, birds’ nests, pictures of 
birds, photographs, and landscape drawings. In all the 
schools, with the exceptions noted above, gardening is 
the most substantial and regular feature of the nature 
work. It is, of course, not to be supposed that nature 
work should be uniform throughout the schools. Much 
latitude. may be wisely allowed, in order to permit 
the most effective use of varying conditions and oppor-
-P-A-G-E-144
  112 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
tunities; but, whatever the divergencies, a definite pur- 
pose should guide the entire system and a certain orderly 
development ought to be discernible in the successive 
classes. 
In the upper grades of the elementary school, where 
subjects of study become more definite and where more 
highly organized material can be utilized, science instruc- 
tion is, as has been stated, practically confined to the 
Emerson and Froebel schools. The subjects offered 
include botany and gardening, zoology, physics, and 
chemistry. The equipment of the two schools, while 
not uniform, is good and in some respects remarkably 
so. Thus the Froebel school possesses an excellent 
botanical laboratory, the Emerson, an unusually attrac- 
tive zoological laboratory with aquaria, an animal 
room, incubators, and an_ extensive out-of-door 
“700”; the physics laboratory of the Emerson contains 
apparatus needed for regular high school work and a 
considerable amount of machinery and various mecha- 
nisms—cameras, automobile engine, etc., that can be 
utilized in demonstrating applied principles; the 
chemical laboratories in the two schools do not differ 
essentially from what is found in the usual modern high 
school. 
The courses of study vary in the two schools. In 
botany, the work of the seventh grade pupils in the 
Emerson is based primarily on care of the garden, the 
shrubbery on the school grounds, and the potted plants 
in the school greenhouse and corridors; an outline had
-P-A-G-E-145
SCIENCE TEACHING 113 
been prepared, covering systematically and in detail 
such subjects as the soil, plant analysis, plant reproduc- 
tion. dangerous plants, farm crops, etc. At the Froebel 
school, the teacher was making excellent use of out-of- 
door experiences as well as classroom studies by organ- 
izing these into definite topics or projects. An extremely 
interesting project was made of harvesting; other topics 
of the same character were handled in similar fashion 
with unmistakable evidence that the pupils were inter- 
ested and were profiting. With high school classes, 
the Emerson school used, but did not closely follow, a 
printed outline of practical botany. There was evidence 
of considerable use of the microscope. At the Froebel, a 
regular textbook was employed, but extensive readjust- 
ments of order and content were made. Coherent se- 
quence of topics was regarded as of less importance than 
vitality of appeal. Effective use was made in the audito- 
rium of exercises developed in the laboratory and garden, 
with unquestionable increase of interest on the part of 
pupils. 
In physics, grade work at the Emerson school covers 
a period of thirteen weeks and is of a topical or project 
character, closely related either to common experience 
or shop work. The weight and density of the air, mois- 
ture, the thermometer are examples of the former; 
problems derived from the bicycle, automobile, electric, 
gas, or water meter, of the latter. The instruction ob- 
served was excellent, the instructor securing the interest 
and active participation of the class in the development of
-P-A-G-E-146
  
  114 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
successive themes. Moreover, the pupils saw through- 
out the meaning and application of facts elicited and 
principles discussed. Less well organized and _ less 
effective was the grade work in physics at the Froebel 
school. In general, the teacher conducted demonstrations, 
which the pupils followed and at times repeated. 
The high school work, consisting of a set of laboratory 
experiments covering the main divisions of the subject, 
did not differ materially from the usual high school 
courses. 
More systematic is the Emerson course in zoology, 
covering forty weeks, made up of two months’ work on 
insects, three or four months’ study of the most important 
animal groups, a month or six weeks of human physiology, 
the remaining weeks of the year being devoted to collect- 
ing and studying the zoological materials character- 
istic of the environment. The course was a happy 
combination of scientific order with practical interest. 
The study of insects, for example, involved the use of 
both textbook and laboratory; but the teacher had an 
eye for such topics as insects and plants, insects and hu- 
man disease, beneficial insects, etc. Among the most 
successful and elaborate projects in operation may be 
mentioned care of poultry—a subject conscientiously 
pursued through all its phases from incubator to market 
—though one would hardly be warranted in placing 
complete confidence in the records kept by the pupils. 
The Froebel work in this subject was distinctly inferior. 
In chemistry similar conditions prevail. The grade

work is topical in character. At the Emerson school, 
starch conversions, fermentation, carbon compounds are 
among the subjects concretely presented to pupils in the 
upper elementary grades. In both high schools, a year 
is systematically devoted to the subject. A well known 
textbook is in use, supplemented, especially at the 
Emerson school, by illustrations drawn from industrial 
processes. Thus, for example, the school coal was tested 
by the teacher and pupils in codperation. So, again, 
the dyes used in commercial jellies were investigated; 
pupils were also employed at the City Health Depart- 
ment, assisting in the bacteriological examination of 
milk. 
Classroom and garden work in all the sciences is sup- 
plemented by the use of science materials in the audito- 
rium, to which, as we shall shortly see, Gary has given a 
quite unprecedented development. Through a large part 
of the school day, successive groups of classes assemble 
there to witness a varied program—now a film, now a 
dramatic representation, now a class exercise. Science 
frequently finds a place on the program—one day, a sim- 
ple piece of nature study offered by little children, again 
a really substantial topic carefully prepared by high 
school pupils. On one occasion each child in a group 
of seven explained to a large audience how seeds are 
distributed, under such titles as Why Seeds Travel, 
Some Little Tramps, Seed Sailboats, etc.; on another, a 
high school pupil, under the guidance of the English 
teacher in codperation with the teacher of zoology, ex-
-P-A-G-E-150
    
116 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
hibited two Mallard ducks, which he had himself shot 
and mounted, and then discussed the entire life history of 
the ducks in question, how they mate, nest, breed, their 
enemies, their haunts, uses, migration, etc. The various 
stages of the extended poultry project, noted above, lent 
themselves admirably to auditorium presentation from 
time to time. It should be observed also that the use of 
the auditorium brings about codperation between science, 
shop, and English instructors. 
In science classes, as in the shops and kitchens, Gary 
makes considerable use of “helpers,” younger children 
assigned to work with a more advanced class. Adults 
who in childhood attended ungraded schools occasion- 
ally testify to the stimulus derived by them from listen- 
ing to older pupils. The sharp classifications of our 
highly organized schools undoubtedly involve a loss in 
this respect. On the other hand, the “helper” situation 
is stimulating only if there is some real participation, 
intellectual or otherwise, on the part of the younger 
pupils. No educational advantage comes to them from 
sitting idly by, without interest or responsibility. In 
the science classes at Gary, as in the shops, one feels at 
times that assignment as helpers is a device resorted to 
in order to relieve the schedule rather than profitably 
to employ pupils. The plan should not be discarded, 
but it should be less freely and more discriminatingly 
used. 
The foregoing account makes it clear just what Gary 
has done to cure the defects of science teaching. We
-P-A-G-E-151
  
SCIENCE TEACHING 117 
stated at the outset that science is still in most schools 
grudgingly treated in the way of time and facilities, and 
that science materials, largely because they lack con- 
creteness, make too feeble an appeal to children. Gary 
has been comparatively generous in giving time and pro- 
viding equipment, and has thus explicitly stamped the 
subject as important. 
It is, however, quite impossible to characterize the 
instruction in general terms. Here and there—notably 
in the high school grades of the Emerson school—it was 
good, that is, the instructor pursued an orderly plan in 
choosing and arranging material and constantly sought 
to show the way in which science principles are nowadays 
applied in the common mechanisms of modern society. 
The pupils were interested, but they were more than 
interested—they were being trained. So, also, the teaching 
of botany at the Froebel school was in a high degree 
intelligent and effective; it was not deficient in scientific 
order, but nevertheless kept in close contact with the 
facts of life. Elsewhere, however, the instruction 
was too frequently formless and aimless. It had 
too often abandoned the safe though usually dispiriting 
support of the textbook, without finding other safe 
anchorage. 
In science, as in shop work and household arts, practical 
tests were given. The difficulties encountered are 
obvious. There are as yet no standardized tests in these 
practical activities, hence Gary results cannot be com- 
pared with results elsewhere. Again, in the absence of 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  118 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
previous efforts to test the pupils and of definite records of 
what ground the several classes had covered, it is not 
possible to say to what extent the results of the tests are 
to be ascribed to the instruction received. Despite these 
drawbacks, it was felt that a precedent should be set, in 
order that teachers of science might be stimulated to 
define their purposes and to set about the preparation of 
objective tests of their teaching. 
Nine tests were given to all eighth grade classes, to the 
seventh grade of the Beveridge school,! and to the high 
school classes in the Emerson and Froebel schools. Three 
types of ability were tested—first, ability to observe and 
to discriminate objects placed before the pupils; next, 
ability to recall past experiences and apply their out- 
come to new, but similar, experiences; and lastly, ability 
to interpret and explain phenomena which undergo 
changes in the pupil’s presence. To test ability to ob- 
serve and discriminate, children were asked to note 
what they saw when an oak leaf and ‘an elm leaf were 
placed before them, or when colored pictures of birds 
strikingly alike or strikingly different were submitted 
to them. Ability to recall was tested by asking the pupil 
to name birds or insects which he had seen or studied. 
Ability to interpret changing phenomena was tested by 
performing in the pupil’s presence experiments involving 
gravity, the properties of air, and air currents due 
to variations in temperature. 
The results showed beyond all question that in vary- 
1Where there is no eighth grade.  
-P-A-G-E-153
SCIENCE TEACHING 119 
ing degrees the Gary pupils can observe, discriminate, 
recall, and reason about phenomena, though individual 
variations within the several classes are very marked. 
The Beveridge school, where science teaching is limited, 
makes an unfavorable showing as compared with the 
Emerson, Froebel, and Jefferson schools, though of 
course there are individual exceptions. Despite the 
fact that its opportunities are inferior to those of 
Emerson and Froebel, the Jefferson school makes, in 
general, the best showing of all, partly, perhaps, because 
the school is more homogeneous in composition, partly, 
beyond all doubt, because the school program is 
better organized and better supervised. On the whole, 
however, the results cannot be regarded as satisfactory. 
The performance is too uneven and excellence is too 
infrequent. 
This unsatisfactory showing would seem primarily 
attributable to lack of continuity and design. Even sci- 
ence teaching of conventional type cannot run itself; 
still less so, science teaching which abandons the beaten 
path. Supervision and staff organization, necessary 
under ordinary circumstances, need to be more efficient, 
more intelligent, even if also more flexible, under the con- 
ditions that obtain at Gary. But Gary’s science super- 
vision is nominal and its staff conferences far too rare 
to answer their purpose. In such circumstances, con- 
ventional teaching would be unlikely to be good of its 
kind; a large experimental undertaking is foredoomed to 
an unsatisfactory result,  
-P-A-G-E-154
  120 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
Gary has, however, shown courage and resourceful- 
ness in trying to deprive science teaching of its remote 
and abstract character, in trying to bring it into touch 
with the child’s experience and to relate it to his other 
school work. Teachers of English and teachers of science 
occasionally attack a large problem together; the shop 
and the laboratories are at times brought to bear on 
identical problems. This is excellent as far as it goes, 
and contains the germ from which a rational course in 
school science may ultimately be worked out. But it is 
not enough merely to break away from the formal, cut and 
dried type of science teaching represented by most text- 
books and to introduce concrete problems from time to 
time. Chaos supervenes unless aims have been sharply 
defined and the orderly development of laws and princi- 
ples assured through intelligent and forceful guidance. 
Beyond a general, and, be itadmitted, a sound predilection 
for the concrete as embodied in the environment and 
experience of the child, it is impossible to discern at Gary 
a principle of organization or progression in science 
teaching. Unquestionably, the children are interested 
in their science work and derive pleasure from it. But 
science fulfills its educational mission, not simply by 
arousing interest in a disconnected series of phenom- 
ena or giving pleasure through a- disconnected series 
of experiences, but by cultivating the child’s capacity 
to deal intelligently and vigorously with problems. 
This ought indeed to be both an interesting and a 
pleasurable task; but unless it involves order, persistence,
-P-A-G-E-155

and hard work, its educative effect is probably of minor 
importance only. Unless so presented, science is likely 
to be a transient diversion rather than a profoundly 
formative and disciplinary influence in the child’s 
development.

  X. INDUSTRIAL WORK! 
‘ X y E HAVE stated in a previous chapter that the 
Gary scheme springs from a thorough analysis 
of the existing social situation. The truth of 
this statement is particularly evidenced by the pro- 
visions made for industrial work for boys, household 
arts for girls, and recreation for all. 
As contrasted with children brought up in the country, 
urban children usually find little in their environment 
that places upon them any real responsibility or tends to 
develop manual skill. The city home has practically 
ceased to carry on productive tasks; the operations fun- 
damental to industry and transportation are so remote 
and so intricate that we quickly become their passive 
beneficiaries without participation or even understanding. 
The growing child’s experience has thus been distinctly 
impoverished, while the leisure and energy once produc- 
tively and codperatively enlisted in the home find 
nowadays too easy an outlet in demoralizing amuse- 
ments. 
The special activities, to the consideration of which 
we now pass—the shops, kitchens, sewing rooms, and 
proucculed account, see report on Industrial Work, by Charles R. 
S.

-P-A-G-E-157
  
INDUSTRIAL WORK 123 
recreational facilities—are thus justified by a variety 
of considerations. They are physically helpful, for they 
contribute to a complete development of muscles and 
senses. They are socially wholesome, for they break down 
the false scholastic distinction between intellectual 
and manual tasks; they are in the stricter educational 
sense important, because they supplement the printed 
word with actual experiences, which, intelligently handled, 
give new and real meanings to formal school exercises, 
enlarge the child’s range of vision, and disclose otherwise 
unsuspected needs and aptitudes. 
Industrial equipment and opportunities vary greatly 
in the different Gary schools. They are most highly 
developed in the Emerson school, where provision is 
made for machine work, foundry, forge, and printing, and 
in the Froebel, where carpentry, plumbing, sheet metal 
work, painting, printing, pottery, and cobbling are pro- 
vided. Printing is the only industrial opportunity com- 
mon to both schools. In Jefferson, a single combina- 
tion shop offers carpentry and a limited opportunity in 
metal work, and there is a single woodworking shop at 
Glen Park and at Beveridge; the remaining schools 
have no special shop equipment. The industrial facili- 
ties of the Emerson and the Froebel schools are, as has 
already been stated, exceptionally diversified and ex- 
tensive. 
The amount of time given to industrial instruction 
varies considerably. At the Emerson, where the school 
year consists of three terms of thirteen weeks each, 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  124 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
grades 4 to 8 devote approximately two hours daily for 
one term to science, two hours daily for a second term to 
shop work, and divide two hours daily of the third term 
between drawing (one hour a week) and an elective— 
which may be shop work, if the boy so desires. At 
the Froebel, where the year consists of four terms, 
each ten weeks in length, pupils in the fourth and fifth 
grades work at printing, plumbing, and painting; pupils 
in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades are scheduled to 
spend two hours a week for a term each in drawing, shop 
work, science, and as teachers’ assistants. 
These theoretical schedules hold fairly well for the 
several classes of a school, as before pointed out, but are 
only loosely followed in actual practice by the different 
members of a class. Individuals were by no means in- 
frequently found who had spent an entire year, instead 
of a single term, in this or that shop; pupils were found 
who had had several shop terms, but no training in 
mechanical drawing. Of 20 cases in which special rec- 
ords were obtained at the Emerson school, 11 had taken 
some form of shop work in each of the three terms of 
1915-16; 7 had done shop work during two terms, and only 
2 had had a single term of shop work and one term of 
mechanical drawing. The record of these pupils in pre- 
vious years was much the same; in many instances every 
term for three years, sometimes every term for four years 
had included shop work. 
Similar conditions prevail at the Froebel school. Of 
the elementary pupils enrolled in all Froebel shops

-P-A-G-E-161
INDUSTRIAL WORK 125 
during the four terms, 603 worked one hour, 225 worked 
two hours, and 5 worked three hours. Of 28 pupils 
whose records were obtained, 5 had had shop work in 
each of the four terms of 1915-16; 4 had had three terms 
of shop work and one term as store attendant; 4 others 
had had three terms of shop and one of mechanical draw- 
ing; 6 had had three terms of shop work; 2, two terms of 
shop and one of mechanical drawing; 6, two terms of 
shop work; only 1 pupil had had but a single term of 
shop work during the year. For previous years, the 
records of the same pupils were similar. 
Whether the frequent departures from schedule are 
to be interpreted as indicative of flexibility or laxity must 
depend to some extent on the care taken by the school 
to ensure intelligent choice. It would be absurd to hold 
all pupils to the same formula; it does not follow, how- 
ever, that it is wise to allow children to do what they 
choose or as they please. A flexible curriculum is not a 
curriculum subject to unaccountable and irresponsible 
modification; it is, as we have already urged, a curricu- 
lum adjustable on the basis of carefully considered in- 
dividual needs, capacities, difficulties, and opportunities. 
Thus viewed, the Gary administration of shop instruction 
is lax rather than flexible. The uncontrolled preference of 
the pupil appeared frequently to be the main determining 
factor in regard to the disposition and extent of the shop 
periods. At the Emerson school, pupils assigned to shop 
work are designated to particular shops by a clerk in 
the shop supervisor’s office. No discrimination appears
-P-A-G-E-162
126 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
to be exercised, no counsel to be given. Questions ad- 
dressed to the pupils showed that a shop choice is often a 
matter of accident. Conditions were but little better 
at the Froebel school, where the distribution of pupils 
to the various shops was made by an instructor, who, 
however, during the period of the survey gave very little 
attention to serious counsel with children as to their 
shop elections. 
The children in earlier grades (fourth and fifth, ages 
ten to twelve) participate in shop, science, and art work 
not as regular pupils, but as “helpers.” The school 
is viewed ‘as a large family, wherein the younger chil- 
dren learn consciously and unconsciously from the older 
children, while the latter learn to assume responsibility 
and to take the initiative.” The youngerpupils, it is held, 
learn more by working with older pupils than they can 
be taught in separate classes by themselves. 
On the strictly educational side, the “helper” system in 
the shops might be defended on the ground that a more 
or less unsystematic experience forms an excellent basis 
for more systematic effort at a later stage. Once more, 
practice and theory do not fully agree. Observation 
in the Gary shops indicates that the younger children 
do not really “help” their elders, but themselves con- 
stitute groups to which separate and definite tasks are 
assigned, groups to which instructors give time and at- 
tention in the same manner, though not always to the 
same extent, as to older pupils. For example, in the 
forge and foundry of the Emerson school there were 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  INDUSTRIAL WORK 127 
classes made up of 9 to 16 boys from the third, fourth, 
and fifth grades, with only one or two older boys; obvi- 
ously, a dozen children cannot “help” two older pupils. 
Again, from 12 to 16 fourth grade pupils constituted a 
group in which there were no older boys at all. Never- 
theless, in all the instances, the third, fourth, and fifth 
grade pupils are called “helpers” on the program. So 
at the Froebel school, the majority of regular assign- 
ments on the program of February 1, 1916, in the print- 
ing, plumbing, and painting shops consist of fourth and 
fifth grade pupils without admixture of older pupils. 
The word “helper” was not used to designate. these 
groups, though they were composed entirely of pupils of 
the “helper” grades. 
Of how much educational value is such experience? 
Something would depend on the alternatives open. If 
the child were not in a shop, where would he be and what 
would he be doing? In so far as the direct value of the 
experience itself is concerned, it may perhaps be fairly 
said that third grade children—found in considerable 
numbers despite the schedule—have too little power of 
sustained attention, too little mental development, and 
for certain shops not enough physical strength to gain 
much direct advantage. The situation in respect to 
the fourth and fifth grades is less definite and varies 
with the shops. In the forge shop, they potter away 
ineffectually at work beyond their strength and skill. 
In the foundry, however, barring the lifting of the loaded 
flasks, they can not only appreciate the common pro-
-P-A-G-E-164
  128 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
cesses, but they can master the simpler operations. In 
printing, the exacting work of typesetting requires more 
care and patience than boys and girls of this age are usu- 
ally capable of. In woodworking, simple work can be 
satisfactorily accomplished, and this is to a small extent 
perhaps true of elementary tinsmithing. The work of 
cutting and threading pipe in the plumbing shop requires 
more strength and muscular coérdination than boys of 
this age can bring to bear. In painting, very simple 
work can probably be accomplished, but it is doubtful 
whether sustained effort can be counted on for a two hour 
period. In the shoe shop, substantial though somewhat 
rough work can be done by these pupils. In general, it 
would seem true that the presence of these children in 
the forge, printing, and plumbing shops results in little 
that is of value and that the only shops for 
which any argument can be made are woodworking, 
painting, shoe repairing, and to some extent the foun- 
dry. Even with this assumption, it still remains an 
open question whether work in special shops by pupils 
from these grades returns an educational value propor- 
tionate to its cost. 
Primarily, the industrial training offered at Gary 
aims simply at the enrichment of the child’s school ex- 
perience. To some extent and in a limited number of 
cases, it may serve a useful prevocational purpose, that 
is, the future artisan may be assisted by his school experi- 
ence to select his vocation intelligently. But for voca- 
tional training itself the experience gained is too slight

INDUSTRIAL WORK 129 
to be as such of real importance. It is justified not be- 
cause it introduces boys to vocations, but because it 
gives their constructive instincts and abilities something 
to do and because it brings them into sympathetic touch 
with the modern industrial world. 
The realization of this aim, in so far as concerns the 
Emerson and Froebel schools, is sought through main- 
tenance and repair jobs. The pupils are not set to do 
tasks devised to meet definitely conceived educational 
ends; rather, the educational end is a by-product. The 
instructors are journeymen mechanics, who receive the 
regular union scale of wages. Care has been taken 
to choose men who are intelligent, kindly, and inter- 
ested in boys; the instructors are patient, helpful, 
and industrious; but, as might be expected, they 
vary greatly in respect to skill as teachers. They are 
not apt to extract the intellectual elements from a given 
situation—that is, to bring out the reasons for a particu- 
lar method of work or to pursue inquiries beyond the 
execution of the task in hand. Again, the tasks them- 
selves are determined not by simple educational consid- 
erations, not by selection on educational grounds from 
the large mass of jobs that need attention, but by prac- 
tical daily need in the school system or the home. Pu- 
pils engaged in painting actually assist the school painter, 
who is also school instructor, in a painting job required 
somewhere in the school system; pupils working in tin 
make buckets or pails for which there is or will be a use; 
pupils engaged in cobbling mend their own shoes; and 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  "130 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
the boy’s task is not cut off when the educational purpose 
might be judged to have been served, but is likely to 
continue until the practical need has been met. 
The character and extent of the productive and repair 
work carried on in the various shops may be gathered 
from the following items taken almost at random. At 
the Emerson, the machine shop turned out drilling pipes 
for soap retainers, lock castings, woodworkers’ bench 
vises, printing chases, and made repairs to arc lamp, 
seats, emery grinder, and a model locomotive; the forge 
shop produced damper rods for furnaces, iron brackets, 
stencil knives, stairway railings; the foundry turned out 
castings for playground equipment, for automatic locks, 
for lathes, and for pump valves; from the printing shop 
came report and record blanks, program schedules, trans- 
fer cards, excuse blanks, deposit slips, letterheads, en- 
velopes, etc. At the Froebel, the cabinet making shop 
carried on much repair work, and made, besides, window 
brackets, building blocks, Montessori sets, and thirty 
teachers’ desks; in sheet metal work, dustpans, desk 
trays, water buckets, paper trays, mail boxes, and light 
reflectors are reported; the productive and repair work in 
plumbing included the installation of sinks, basins, and 
shower baths, the repairing of drains, faucets, sinks, etc.; 
the painting shop was busy in refurbishing outside sashes 
and frames, repainting classrooms, shellacking building 
blocks, oiling gymnasium floor, etc. In the shoe shop 
any child may repair his own shoes or shoes belonging to 
a member of his family. The child may furnish material
-P-A-G-E-169
  
INDUSTRIAL WORK 131 
or buy it at the school. In general, the work turned out 
is creditable, but it is of course manifestly impossible to 
determine the degree to which the instructor has par- 
ticipated. 
Somewhat elaborate practical and written tests were 
given in order to provide an objective basis for judgment 
as to what is achieved by the system of industrial instruc- 
tion just described. For example, in order to test the 
work done in the machine shop of the Emerson school, the 
seven high school students who had had the longest 
experience in this shop were provided with a piece of soft 
rolled steel, which they were required to manipulate in 
accordance with the outline of a blueprint furnished to 
them. Subsequently the boys took a written test de- 
signed to ascertain how far they comprehended the rea- 
sons for what they had done and also whether they had 
been led to see the wider uses and implications of the 
machines and processes that they had been employing. 
On the whole, the boys displayed confidence, familiarity, 
and a fair degree of skill in dealing with common machine 
shop operations, but oral as well as written questions 
showed that their grasp did not penetrate below the sur- 
face. They gave little evidence of knowing the mechan- 
ism of the various tools, the nature of the materials used, 
or the place that the machine shop occupies in the indus- 
trial world. To boys working in the foundry a test in 
the use of patterns was given. On the whole, their work 
was well done; they attacked the task with readiness and 
confidence, and carried it through in a businesslike way, 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  
132 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
with little loss of time through mistakes or hesitation. 
A written examination and oral questions showed, how- 
ever, that only limited attempts had been made to form 
a background of ideas and knowledge drawn from this 
and related industries. Little attention, for example, 
had been paid to illustration, study, or even enumeration 
of the products of the great mills that are the reason for 
the city’s existence. Again, in the sheet metal shop, of 
seven pupils asked to make a galvanized iron pail, four 
acquitted themselves creditably; but the written tests 
disclosed a poverty of information and thought, though 
the replies of eighth grade pupils were noticeably more 
intelligent and better informed than those of seventh 
grade pupils. In general, it is fair to say that, while dis- 
playing considerable practical competence, pupils had 
not been led to reflect and had, in consequence, extracted 
little of intellectual value from their shop work. 
The discussion up to this point has been concerned 
entirely with the Froebel and Emerson schools. At the 
Jefferson school, a single combination shop is provided, 
the equipment of which consists of several woodworking 
benches, a hand drill, a vise for holding iron pipe, cutting 
and threading tools for the same, and a few simple tools 
for sheet metal work. At one end is a stock room in 
charge of a pupil during class hours, and at the other 
a steam engine which supplies power for the electric 
light plant. 
The work carried on differs radically in principle 
from that of the two schools already considered. The

  INDUSTRIAL WORK 133 
Froebel and Emerson shops endeavor to procure educa- 
tional results from maintenance and repair activities; 
the Jefferson shop defines its objects in terms of the 
conventional manual training philosophy. Practical 
construction cuts: little figure; repairs and equipment 
are attempted only on a very inconsiderable scale; the 
bulk of the work takes the form of projects for home 
or personal use. The instructor is not an artisan, but a 
school trained man of enthusiasm and devotion; the 
building engineer serves as his assistant. 
The schedule of the Jefferson school provides drawing 
and bench work, one hour daily for twenty weeks, for 
children from the first to the lower fifth grade; from the 
upper fifth to the eighth grade the schedule calls for 
twenty weeks of shop work in one hour periods and for 
half as much drawing. The major part of the time goes 
to woodworking; exercises are used, followed by individ- 
ual or school projects; the pupils built the tool room, shop 
cupboards, and bookcases for the school. A small amount 
~ of metal work has also been turned out. At intervals 
of three weeks, two boys are assigned to assist in running 
the heating and power plant. 
In this connection a word should be said about draw- 
ing and handwork. In the first three grades, for 
example, of the Emerson and Froebel schools a daily 
period is scheduled for such work. While there are 
no uniformly planned courses, the teaching is carried 
along the usual lines with considerable ability. Above 
the third grade pupils choose between mechanical
-P-A-G-E-174
  134 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
and freehand drawing—the boys commonly electing 
the former, the girls, the latter. In mechanical draw- 
ing, the children below the sixth grade are occupied with 
drawing wooden objects or copying and modifying, 
according to directions, a series of blueprints—an expedi- 
ent which keeps the children busy, not altogether un- 
profitably, without requiring much attention from the 
instructor. The three upper elementary grades and the 
high school offer practical instruction, including archi- 
tectural drawing, well adapted to the interests and 
capacities of the pupils. The work is carefully planned 
and the results obtained are excellent. Freehand draw- 
ing in the elementary grades includes practice with water 
color, crayon, and design. In the high school design is 
especially emphasized; the pupils had achieved some 
good work in book covers, metal, and costumes, and in 
still life with pencil and crayon. 
It is not easy to express a definite judgment on the 
type of industrial work carried on in the two large schools. 
Unquestionably, the reality, the genuineness of shop 
instruction based on maintenance work makes an effec- 
tive appeal to the boy. He is interested in his shop work; 
he enjoys it. ‘One gains a strong impression,” writes 
Professor Richards, “that at Gary school is not a second- 
ary thing in the boy’s life, but that it is the big thing. 
To this attitude of mind the shop work contributes an 
important element. The shops themselves, although 
conducted with considerable freedom, generally reflect 
an atmosphere of real work, and the pupils are often 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  INDUSTRIAL WORK 135 
found successfully carrying on operations and achieving 
results ordinarily judged quite beyond the capacity of 
boys of their age. The relations between the boys and 
the instructors are for the most part satisfactory 
and commendable. The instructors as a rule show 
much patience in directing the boys, helping them 
out of difficulties, and answering their many questions. 
In some of the shops there is much true comradeship 
between the boys and the instructors built on mutual 
confidence and respect. Furthermore, the pupils un- 
doubtedly gain a first hand contact with many real 
phases of industry, and a healthy stimulation of interest 
through dealing with real problems and real quantities. 
All this means a vitality and educative influence far 
superior to the conventional manual training.” 
On the other hand, the work is narrow in scope, empir- 
ical in method. Urgent demands to make this or that 
repair block instruction; the execution of orders may 
leave little time for discussion of principles involved or of 
the methods by which similar tasks are d’sposed of in 
current industrial and commercial practice. In some 
shops, indeed, the artisan-instructor is at times called 
away and the pupils left for the time without guidance. 
The limitations pointed out do not, however, affect 
all shops equally. Plumbing suffers most seriously; 
in the forge shop, foundry, sheet metal, and par- 
ticularly in the printing shop, where the entire class 
is often at work on one job or several similar jobs, 
group or individual instruction is feasible. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  136 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
To instruction on the basis of maintenance and repair, 
there is the further objection that the opportunities 
which are thus developed are not necessarily those that 
are of the highest educational value. Moreover, there 
may prove to be a lack of sufficient material and of suf- 
ficient variety, unless the school system grows steadily 
and the shops are confined to two or three central schools. 
If, for example, the school system should come to consist 
wholly of buildings of the Froebel and Emerson type, 
each with a full complement of shops, maintenance and 
repair might fall short of providing educative tasks 
enough to keep the shops throughout the schools effec- 
tively occupied. 
The shop men are themselves doubtless under the im- 
pression that they are constantly giving instruction, be- 
cause they are continuously called on for directions and 
explanations. But the truth is that instruction in a 
large sense has not been a part of the serious business of 
the department. The pupils take no notes; no tests of 
shop or industrial information have been made; no 
practical correlations of shop experience with mathe- 
matics or science work were observed; no charts or 
sketches on the blackboard are employed; trade cata- 
logues, abounding in illustrative matter, have been used 
only to a very limited extent. In some cases, it is hardly 
an overstatement to say that the shop work represents 
a maximum of activity with a minimum of thought as to 
the thing done. In part, these defects are ascribable to 
the employment of artisan teachers; but they could un-

-P-A-G-E-179
  INDUSTRIAL WORK 137 
doubtedly be more or less fully remedied by adequate 
supervision. 
As an offset to the defects of the maintenance and 
repair system, it may be urged that it is after all the only 
system available under the financial conditions that ob- 
tain at Gary. This argument, however, relies on the 
assumption that the shops are self-supporting. Were 
this the case, it might well be asked whether a school 
system unable to afford shops organized on educational 
principles does not do well to organize them on the main- 
tenance basis. The situation, however, is neither so 
simple, nor so favorable to the maintenance type of or- 
ganization. It will appear, when we come to the discus- 
sion of school costs, that, when credit is allowed for 
labor and material cost of production, even the shops 
which are operated primarily on the maintenance basis 
are only 69 per cent. self-supporting. The question is 
therefore whether the sum needed to make up the deficit 
could not be put to more effective use. A positive an- 
swer can hardly be given at this time. Moreover, before 
it is attempted, the Gary shops should be given a chance 
to show how far the defects and objections urged in this 
chapter can be overcome by effective supervision, and 
a further chance to determine experimentally how far the 
maintenance plan can, without perhaps greatly increas- 
ing the expense, be so qualified as to meet the objections 
which we have urged. 
It remains to be emphasized that the shop work at 
Gary is not primarily a preparation for earning a liveli-

hood as a mechanic or artisan. In the long run, the 
importance of the work depends on its general educa- 
tional value—on what it does to develop the child’s 
senses, to broaden his vision, and to furnish an outlet 
for abilities that might otherwise go uncultivated. On 
the other hand, it is only fair to add that the training 
received by some pupils in some of the shops proves of 
direct vocational value when they enter certain of the 
industries on which the prosperity of the city is based.
-P-A-G-E-181
XI. HOUSEHOLD ARTS! 
the industrial work for boys is not vocational in 
aim. ‘The shop activities are not meant to make 
carpenters, painters, and plumbers, but to furnish growing 
boys with concrete opportunities for the development of 
senses and muscles, and concrete experiences which will 
enable them to participate intelligently in a social order 
in which industry bulks large. The same holds of the 
practical work for girls; it is not primarily intended to 
make expert seamstresses or teachers of cooking. How- 
ever, instruction in cooking and sewing is not on pre- 
cisely the same footing as instruction in foundry work or 
carpentry; for, in addition to their educative value, 
the household arts carry for girls in general a large pros- 
pect of actual application. ‘ 
Cooking is taught regularly in the elementary school 
in the seventh and eighth grades, with pupils from the 
lower grades acting as helpers. The instruction is con- 
densed into courses from ten to thirteen weeks in length, 
one or two hours daily. Pupils must enroll for at least 
one course one hour daily, and may take more. While I: THE preceding chapter, the point was made that

-P-A-G-E-182
140 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
cooking is thus compulsory for elementary pupils, it is 
optional for high school girls, and may be elected by 
them in the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades 
at the Emerson and Froebel schools, which alone have 
high school students. In point of fact, few high school 
students pursue the subject. 
It is difficult to determine definitely the content of the 
cooking instruction in either the elementary schools or 
the high schools, since there was no systematic course 
of study for either all schools or any one school. More- 
over, the year of the survey chanced to be one of unusual 
disorganization. The teacher at Froebel had been in the 
system only since September and was preparing to leave, 
as was also the instructor at Emerson. Teachers 
changed at Jefferson during the spring, and at Glen Park 
all cooking gave way in April to gardening, while at 
Beveridge nothing more than the preparation of the 
school luncheon has ever been attempted. However, 
effort was being made—at least at the Emerson, Froebel, 
Jefferson, and Glen Park schools—to meet the minimum 
elementary, and at Emerson and Froebel the minimum 
high school, requirements of the State Department of 
Public Instruction. Beyond these minimum require- 
ments, each teacher is free to plan and to execute such 
daily tasks as in her judgment are calculated to meet 
local and individual needs. 
The preparation of food for the cafeteria forms the 
basis of the Gary work whether of elementary or high 
school grade. There are no cooking laboratories other

than those employed in the preparation of the noon 
luncheon. The same equipment is used by both ele- 
mentary and high school students and the same instruc- 
tor directs both groups. The children help to prepare 
the food, set the tables, and do the serving, the older 
pupils being held responsible for the more difficult tasks, 
Under these conditions, the content of the cooking 
instruction can be best inferred from typical menus:   
      
MONDAY TUESDAY 
Cream of tomato soup Roast pork 
Boiled ham Sweet potatoes 
Baked potatoes Stewed tomatoes 
Tuna fish salad Cabbage salad

WEDNESDAY THURSDAY 
Lima bean soup Hot roast beef sandwiches 
Roast beef Scalloped meat 
Boiled potatoes Steamed cabbage 
Banana salad Ham sandwich

It is possible to cover the field by means of varied 
menus quite as thoroughly as by means of definitely 
organized courses, provided the teacher keeps track of 
what the pupils have done and what remains for them 
to do. Unfortunately, however, except in one school 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  142 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
there were no such records, so that between the absence 
of records and the frequent change of teachers, there 
was danger of repetition without progress. 
The classes in cooking are always small, never con- 
taining over twenty and averaging from twelve to 
fifteen. This would be admirable, if the group were 
homogeneous; unfortunately, a class in cooking is seldom 
made up of pupils from one grade and not always from 
closely related grades. Not infrequently a class com- 
prises pupils from the third to the ninth grades. To be 
sure, the younger children, the so-called “helpers,” are 
supposed to assist the older; but their presence renders 
difficult concentration of attention upon the needs of the 
advanced pupils. 
The time allowance for cooking is unusually liberal. 
On the basis of 2 hours per day for 5 days a week for 13 
weeks, 130 hours are offered as compared with 2 hours 
per week for 40 weeks in the average school system. 
On the basis of the minimum of 1 hour per day for 10 
weeks, 50 hours are devoted to this subject. But 
the allowance does not work out in practice. Term 
lengths vary in the different schools; the instruction 
periods are sometimes one hour, sometimes two. More- 
over, the groups are in continuous flux. Pupils are 
withdrawn in the course of a term; new pupils are ad- 
_ mitted irregularly. Thus, for example, eighth grade 
pupils at Emerson had one hour of cooking daily in the 
first term of 1915-16, while those who took cooking in 
the second term had twice as much. At Froebel, on the
-P-A-G-E-187
  HOUSEHOLD ARTS 143 
other hand, the eighth grade pupils were enrolled for 
two hours during the first and second terms, but in the 
other terms for a single period. Again, the helper system 
extends at Emerson as low as the third grade, but at 
Froebel not below the fourth. 
The teachers fall into three groups. Emerson, Froe- 
bel, and Jefferson have professionally trained instructors. 
Their salaries range from $600 to $1,000. At Glen Park 
a regular teacher with slight special preparation guides 
* the work, and at Beveridge a practical housekeeper, with 
no professional training, is in charge. Practical house- 
keepers receive from $40 to $65 a month, 
As stated before, the work in cooking centers about 
the school luncheon. Many of the children go home at 
the noon recess; many get their entire luncheon at school, 
while others bring a luncheon from home, supplementing 
it with hot soup, cocoa, or dessert. The lunch rooms 
are open from 11:15 to 1:15. During 1915-16 Emerson 
served 44,582 persons, including teachers and guests; 
Froebel, 17,842; and Jefferson, 7,889. The quality of 
the food is good, the prices are reasonable. The average 
luncheon charge per person at Emerson was 13.9 cents; 
at Froebel, 14.2 cents; and at Jefferson, 15 cents. 
The entire operating expenses of the cooking depart- 
ments, with the exception of fuel and the salaries of the 
instructors at Emerson and Froebel and half the salary 
of the teacher at Jefferson, were met from the proceeds of 
the cafeteria. The experience of these schools thus 
demonstrates that cooking departments of the Gary

type may be operated, after the original capital outlay, 
without cost to the system, other than for minor items 
and for the salaries of professionally trained teachers, and 
may even be made to pay a part of these expenses. 
V A single or simple verdict on the instruction in cooking 
at Gary is impossible, for there are two sides to almost 
every one of its characteristic features. For example, 
the introduction of domestic arts into the lower grades 
through the helper system revives in a measure the 
wholesome participation of the child in the activities 
of the home—an order now all too rapidly passing away. 
But the helper system, as has been pointed out in other 
connections, is not free from dangers and drawbacks. 
Children cannot really gain unless they are helping older 
persons who fully understand what they are engaged in 
doing. Too often the older girls do not measure up to 
this standard. The instructors labor therefore at a 
threefold task—they guide the older girls, their proper 
task, keep the helpers out of mischief, and must have 
the school luncheon ready at the stroke of eleven. Under 
this burden the capable instructor becomes discouraged; 
the weak instructor solves the problem by turning over 
to the practical cook the preparation of the important 
dishes. 
So also the cafeteria. Much is to be said in its favor. 
Pupils learn to work with proper regard for time, to handle 
quantities, to consider money values, to contrive dietetic 
combinations. Thus the cafeteria not only supplies the 
school lunch, but enlarges the scope of school work in
-P-A-G-E-189
  
HOUSEHOLD ARTS 145 
cooking and gives practical point to the child’s effort and 
interest. But danger lurks in the division of responsi- 
bility. One and the same individual at one and the 
same time teaches cooking and conducts a commercial 
enterprise; few persons are equally interested and equally 
effective in both fields. When, for example, the instruc- 
tor’s attention inclines to the commercial side, the pupil 
suffers. Little or no risk can be taken with the food, for 
the quantities are large and the hour approaches. The 
practical cook therefore scarcely realizes how often she 
prompts the pupils or does things for them; nor does the 
teacher realize how small a part of the responsibility for 
the menu is borne by the children. The theory that 
children must learn to cook by cooking is sound. But, 
in practice, the importance of the interests at stake seri- 
ously infringes on educational independence. In the main, 
the exigencies of the situation tie the pupils to recipes— 
paid helpers and instructors constantly aiding even 
when recipes are followed. So wedded are the pupils to 
recipes that they are well nigh helpless without them. 
Practical and written individual tests were given to 
pupils in the higher elementary grades in order to ascer- 
tain what they could do and with what degree of intelli- 
gence. They were asked, for example, to cook potatoes, 
to bake a cake, to prepare a salad or dessert. In a 
majority of cases, the results were satisfactory, except 
for the fact that all the pupils used recipes, failures 
occurring even under these conditions. Written ques- 
tions requiring the pupils to explain some of the funda-  
-P-A-G-E-190
  146 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
mental principles of good housekeeping—i. e., what are 
the essentials of a good meal, what are the main classifica- 
tions of food, what determines the kinds of food needed 
—were for the most part meagerly answered. Evidently 
little effort had been made to explain the bearing or draw 
out the implication of the practical work carried on in the 
cafeteria. In this respect the same defects were revealed 
as were remarked by Professor Richards in the industrial 
work, Obviously, the mere doing of concrete tasks does 
not carry the pupil far enough to answer legitimate edu- 
cational requirements. 
It must be frankly admitted, therefore, that the prac- 
tical outcome of the cooking instruction at Gary is disap- 
pointing. It must also be frankly admitted that home 
making in its well rounded aspects has not been devel- 
oped, and cannot be so long as cooking is confined almost 
entirely to the cafeteria. 
What now of the sewing? Instruction in sewing at 
Gary centers around the practical needs of the children, 
Accordingly, no course of study is mapped out. Pupils 
work on what they want or need to make, or on garments 
suggested by parents. For example, a younger sister 
needs a dress, which at once becomes a project, even 
though the elder sister, who is expected to make it, does 
not know how. In such a case the instructor cuts the 
dress, while the pupil looks on. In the making, all the 
elementary stitches are explained and tried before the 
child proceeds. Over-refinement of execution is, of 
course, not emphasized, as the child would become bored
-P-A-G-E-191
HOUSEHOLD ARTS 147 
and the mother impatient at the delay in finishing the 
article. Thus, no time is lost on preparatory stitches or 
on samplers; the children work from the beginning on 
real things. Parents provide the necessary materials, 
or teachers buy them at wholesale and sell them to the 
pupils at cost. 
While sewing is optional for high school girls, elemen- 
tary pupils are required to take a minimum of fifty hours 
in either the seventh or eighth grade. As in cooking, 
most of the elementary pupils choose to take more. It 
was also found that greater numbers were enrolled in the 
sewing classes than in cooking and at a much younger 
age. The courses run from ten to thirteen weeks in 
length, varying with the school. 
)Although the majority of the pupils in the sewing 
classes come from the fifth and upper grades, pupils as 
young as those of the third grade are found engaged in 
class work. They are usually enrolled as helpers, but 
handled as students. In fact, the helper system is not so 
conspicuous in the sewing as in the cooking department. 
Only in rare instances is it employed, in which event, as a 
rule, the helpers are seated in groups at the side or in the 
corner of the room. The instructors give them a certain 
amount of attention, teaching them crocheting stitches, 
how to knit, or how to put an article of underwear to- 
gether. They apparently enjoy the sewing room, and 
seemingly do not annoy or hinder the work of the older 
pupils, who have no responsibility for them. 
At Emerson, sewing is in charge of an academically 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  
148 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
trained teacher, who also teaches geography and history. 
At Froebel, the domestic science instructor directs the 
work. In each school there is a practical woman assist- 
ant, and these assistants do most of the teaching. This 
arrangement should bring about an admirable balance. 
The practical woman learns approved methods of instruc- 
tion and comes to appreciate the step-by-step explana- 
tion necessary in guiding pupils, while the professionally 
trained teacher learns the “short cuts” of trade work. 
It would be difficult to find a harder working corps 
of trade assistants than those in the sewing departments 
of Emerson and Froebel. They teach seven hours a day 
and are constantly on the alert. The teaching is highly 
individualized, and, although the pupils are assembled 
in classes, no two members are likely to be at work on 
the same kind of article, or to be at the same point even 
if making the same thing. Each step is taught to the in- 
dividual child as it comes up. 
There is no doubt that sewing instruction in the past 
has erred by too close application to the A, B, C’s of 
technique, and by devoting too much time to drill on 
valueless objects. Gary has done well to break away 
from this lock step procedure. But in attempting to 
construct a course in sewing around personal and family 
needs, it is quite possible that Gary has gone to the other 
extreme. ; 
The Gary work in sewing assumes that the reality of 
the task assures the child’s interest and that, as compared 
with this, logical sequence in the tasks set is of inferior

HOUSEHOLD ARTS 149 
importance. The proposition cannot, however, be ac- 
cepted in this simple form. While the older model exer- 
cises have been rightly banished, some form of regular 
progress is unquestionably indispensable. It is the 
teacher’s business to advance the child more or less 
regularly through the main steps of plain sewing, dress- 
making, and millinery, with constant regard at each step 
for what is possible. Ability to do things and to do them 
well is desirable, but it is also important that children 
give attention to the kind and character of the garments 
required for different purposes, to the worth and quality 
of different fabrics, to dyes, and to a multitude of other 
matters essential to the proper clothing of a modern 
family. 
Owing to the lack of appropriate records, it was im- 
possible to determine the amount of sewing the children 
had had or to judge their accomplishments in the light 
of the amount of time given to their training. Observa- 
tions of the classroom work and inspection of garments 
yielded a few vivid impressions. 
In the first place, the standard of accomplishment i is 
by no means high. In the lower grades this may be due 
to the fact that pupils with little or no prior experience 
often begin at once to make garments. Under these con- 
ditions a finished product of high quality could not be ex- 
pected. Much of the work of the advanced pupils is also 
below standard. While it is true that trade work and 
school instruction differ, still, in so far as the processes are 
common, the home making standard should equal the
-P-A-G-E-196
150 . THE GARY SCHOOLS 
trade standard. Gary certainly judges its products more 
leniently than does the trade. 
Again, the instruction is hardly calculated to result in 
capacity to do independent work. Obviously, not much 
can be expected at the outset of children who begin their 
school work in sewing with garment making. The dif- 
ficulty is that throughout the course the teachers are apt 
to do so much of the thinking that it is doubtful whether 
many pupils can, on completing their course, put a dress 
together by themselves. There are, to be sure, excep- 
tions and for these the system is entitled to full credit. 
On the whole, however, it remains true that sufficient 
drill is not given in the principles of garment making, 
nor is the power to think, as applied to sewing and gar- 
ment construction, satisfactorily developed. 
Two written tests were given high school students to 
ascertain whether the explanatory and supplementary 
instruction was sufficient to make the practical work 
intelligible. Such questions as these were asked: Ex- 
plain a French seam. Give an example of its use. How 
do you test a pattern? What points should be remem- 
bered in sewing a sleeve into a garment? The pupils 
did reasonably well with questions calling for facts and 
for information related closely to their experiences, but 
they were weak when the questions called for general 
information or reasoned answers. In justice to them, 
however, it should be said that there is practically no 
class discussion. And in justice to the teachers, it should 
be remembered that only a small number of pupils were   
     
-P-A-G-E-197
HOUSEHOLD ARTS 151 
tested, that the courses in sewing are narrow, and there 
is no leeway for related work. Though the teachers 
recognize the value of supplementary comment and in- 
struction, the opportunities for them are very limited. 
In the household arts as in the industrial work, Gary’s 
experience shows that mere practical occupation is not 
alone broadly educative. There are indeed physical, 
social, and intellectual values in these practical activities; 
but the values do not spontaneously and necessarily ac- 
crue to the individual workers. Rather they require to 
be developed, and therein lies the opportunity for the 
trained teacher and supervisor.
-P-A-G-E-198
XII. PHYSICAL TRAINING AND PLAY! 
HE Gary authorities take a broad view of the 
place of physical education in modern education, 
giving to it an emphasis double that of the average 
American city. In the three largest schools, the first 
four grades ordinarily have two hours of physical train- 
ing and play daily, and all upper grades at least one hour. 
Even the very smallest schools give some time to daily 
exercise and physical recreation. 
The facilities for carrying out this program are un- 
usually extensive. Of the nine schools, all except two 
have gymnasiums, ranging from 600 square feet at 24th 
Avenue to 7,956 at Froebel. Two schools—Emerson 
and Froebel—have swimming pools. All have play- 
grounds, ranging from 5,300 square feet at the two room 
24th Avenue school to 84,496 at Emerson. Three— 
Emerson, Froebel, and Jefferson—possess athletic fields,” 
the smallest, at Jefferson, containing 32,130 square feet, 
and the largest, at Emerson, 173,602. Thus, however 
small the school and humble the plant, there are out- 
side provisions for play.

Lee F. Hanmer.

by the board of education.

PHYSICAL TRAINING AND PLAY 153 
Fifteen physical training teachers, as a whole well 
equipped, have charge of the “play” activities. They 
receive from $600 to $1,000 per year and average $859; 
by assisting in special activities outside of the regular 
day schools they bring their average annual compensa- 
tion up to $998. The entire amount paid to them for 
regular day school services amounted in 1915-16 to 
$11,825.25, making the per pupil cost for teachers alone 
$2.09 on total enrollment, or $2.86 on average daily 
attendance. 
There is also a supervisor, who, in addition to regular 
teaching duties, has general jurisdiction over all. His 
supervisory duties are, however, ill defined, and he has 
neither the time nor the authority to organize and stand- 
ardize the instruction, with the result that teachers work 
more or less independently of each other. 
The staff thus made up covers everything done in 
physical training. Classroom teachers are not required 
to give any attention whatever to the subject. 
There is no marching to and from classes, there are 
no “setting up” or breathing exercises given in the 
classrooms, and regular teachers do not concern them- 
selves about posture. Only in the small schools on the 
outskirts of the city do the teachers in charge attend 
to the physical training. It is possible that here and 
there a classroom teacher, prompted by personal interest 
in good posture and right physical development, may 
give some drill in proper walking, standing, and sitting, 
but no teacher is expected or required to do so. The
-P-A-G-E-202
  154 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
physical education of the children, therefore, centers 
almost exclusively in the gymnasium, swimming pool, 
and playground. 
The department prefers out of door work, but in prac- 
tice the gymnasiums are used more than the playgrounds. 
These are open for classes six hours daily, also for play 
during the two hour luncheon period and for an hour after 
school, that is, they are open from 8:15 to 5 o’clock. 
Accordingly, the physical training teachers have a seven 
hour day. They teach six hours, look after the gymna-* 
siums during the two hour luncheon period, and also have 
charge of the after school play activities. Their burdens 
are further increased by the large classes which they are 
frequently called upon to handle. Thus a teacher at 
Jefferson has six groups a day, in all close to 700 pupils. 
The separate hourly divisions, varying from 76 to 147, 
contain boys of all school ages and from the first to the 
eighth grades. Occasionally, groups of a single class of 
from 12 to 15 pupils are found, but the larger groups are 
more common. However, the attendance often falls be- 
low the scheduled number, because pupils may be excused 
from play in order to go to the library, to attend relig- 
ious instruction, or to assist at home, and, further, be- 
cause one hour of physical training is optional whenever 
two hours are assigned. 
Under these conditions, exercises and games suited to 
each of the different age and grade groups cannot be 
given. Consequently, ‘“‘free play” predominates, dan- 
gerously near to the exclusion of everything else. This
-P-A-G-E-203
  PHYSICAL TRAINING AND PLAY 185 
“free play” is of an aimless, running about, and “‘fool- 
ing” character that has little value except as a means of 
“letting off steam” and stimulating blood circulation— 
both of which are desirable, but may be secured inciden- 
tally in connection with a more constructive use of play 
time. Even in the brief periods of calisthenic exercises 
it is not unusual to see several pupils standing idly in 
their places or taking the exercises listlessly and incor- 
rectly. Snappy, vigorous work is not insisted upon. 
Hence, much of the physical value of the exercise is lost 
and the habit of doing work in a slipshod manner is 
formed. The general aspect of playground and gym- 
nasium suggests, indeed, not school training, aiming to 
bring about definite results, but rather the more or less 
unorganized, though in itself wholesome, play appropri- 
ate to public playgrounds. 
Nor can it be said that proper oversight is employed 
in checking up the work, for the roll is not regularly called 
and careful records are not available. Physical examina- 
tions are not systematically made and no record of physi- 
cal development is kept. Several instances were found 
of late comers in the high school who were to be graduated 
without having had any physical training or any atten- 
tion whatever given to their physical development. The 
physician in charge of medical inspection has recently 
undertaken, with some volunteer assistance from local 
hospital nurses, to make physical examinations and keep 
records of the physical progress of the children. His 
chief tasks, however, are to guard against the spread of 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
156 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
communicable diseases, examine for defects of eyes, ears, 
and throat, and exercise general oversight of heating, 
lighting, ventilation, and sanitation. 
The most systematic work seems to be done in the 
swimming pools, to which all classes go at regular inter- 
vals. The children are taught to swim and dive, and 
tests of skill and speed add zest and interest to this 
branch of the work. Life saving and first aid are also 
taught and well mastered by drill. Very little use is 
made of group leaders, although much might be done in 
this way in handling the large numbers. 
At times efforts are made to correlate the activities of 
the play periods with the academic work. For instance, 
drill in numbers is secured by the use of games which re- 
quire the players to keep their individual or team scores; 
points are added, penalties subtracted, totals divided 
to get averages, etc. The pupil who cannot do this is at 
such a disadvantage, it is claimed, that he feels the 
necessity of improving his number work. It also gives 
him a practical demonstration of the value and applica- 
tion of his classroom studies. Much playground appara- 
tus has been made in the school shops and installed by the 
children under the direction of the physical training 
teacher. Equipment thus secured seems to be more 
highly appreciated, and added interest is undoubtedly 
given to the shop work. 
For some years certain physical tests for elementary 
and secondary school boys have been used quite gener- 
ally throughout the United States. They are known as

PHYSICAL TRAINING AND PLAY 157 
the athletic badge tests. These are not a complete meas- 
urement of physical efficiency, but serve as a fair indica- 
tion of heart, lung, and general muscular development. 
The tests consist of a run, a jump, and a pull-up. Any 
normally developed boy ten to thirteen years of age 
should be able to run 60 yards in 83 seconds, do a stand- 
ing broad jump of 5 feet 9 inches, and pull up four times. 
Boys of the next group—those having the development of 
normal thirteen year old boys and older—are expected 
to do the run in 8 seconds, to jump 6 feet, and to pull 
up six times. These tests have been accepted and used 
so generally that the Playground and Recreation Associ- 
ation of America has prepared bronze badges to be 
awarded to boys who pass all three tests in either group, 
in order to encourage boys to bring themselves up to a 
fair standard of physical development. The special 
emphasis given to play in the Gary schools has afforded 
abundant opportunity for the boys to run and jump, and 
the bars, ladders, and rings on their playgrounds provide 
the means for developing the arm, shoulder, back, and 
chest muscles that function in the pull-up. 
As a basis of comparison the scores of 1,100 boys in 
other cities have been taken. These tests were made in 
New Orleans, Seattle, Buffalo, and New York City. 
The conditions under which the testing was done were 
practically the same as at Gary—that is, the boys were 
taken in groups from the classroom and all were tested. 
In the pull-up and sixty yard dash, the Gary boys were 
in every age group inferior to boys from other school
-P-A-G-E-208
  158. THE GARY SCHOOLS 
systems; in the standing broad jump, Gary boys of thir- 
teen and fifteen years of age surpass boys of the same 
age from other schools. Thus, in twenty one possible 
comparisons the Gary boys excel in only two instances. 
How far this poor showing may be due to the presence 
of newcomers, we do not know. 
The ability to jump, run, and pull up are not, however, 
absolutely conclusive indices of general health conditions 
and all around bodily vigor. Other ways of reaching 
conclusions on this phase of the Gary school product 
were sought. The children were observed at their play 
and in their athletics to determine the effect of strenuous 
and prolonged activity. It was plainly evident that they 
were not easily fatigued. Both boys and girls were able 
to compete in such vigorous and lengthy events as potato 
races, obstacle races, sack races, basketball and volley 
ball, without undue exhaustion and with well sustained 
vigor. This conclusion was borne out by the scores in 
basketball games with teams from other cities. Prac- 
tically without exception the scores for Gary mounted 
up rapidly in the last half of the playing period, indi- 
cating comparatively strong power of endurance. Also 
when “‘time out” was called and the visiting players 
would drop to the floor or the benches for a bit of rest, 
the Gary team would invariably practise passing the 
ball and shooting baskets. 
Comparatively low markings in the tests with simul- 
taneous evidence of a high degree of bodily vigor are not 
the results that would naturally be expected. But the

PHYSICAL TRAINING AND PLAY 159 
freedom allowed the children and the absence of require- | 
ments of exactitude and finish in their work, coupled with 
the generous amount of time allotted to play and other 
forms of physical activity, may easily account for these 
apparently conflicting results. Which is the more im- 
portant and whether it is not possible to secure both pro- 
ficiency and all around bodily vigor are questions open to 
debate. Certain it is that habits of inexactness and lack 
of finish in doing work are a serious handicap and that 
health and strong power of endurance are most valuable 
assets. 
The events in the girls’ tests are comparatively new, 
having recently been adopted for general use. There 
are, therefore, no accumulated records with which to com- 
pare them. It seemed desirable, however, to make the 
tests. The girls measured up no more nearly to the 
standard requirements than did the boys. Yet, like the 
boys, in the events requiring sustained effort, such as 
running and catching, the girls gave evidence of unusual 
power of endurance. 
Both the merits and the defects of the Gary work in 
physical training lie on the surface. The time allotted 
affords ample opportunity for orderly exercises of a cor- 
rective, body building character, as well as for recreative 
games and free play. The facilities and equipment are 
generous; the teachers, on the whole, well trained and 
enthusiastic. However, the number of pupils in the in- 
struction groups is frequently so large that it is impos- 
sible to give attention to individual needs and to use

exercises suited to the widely varying stages of phys- 
ical development. The result is an excessive use of free 
play, which too often is hardly more than an aimless 
running about and scuffling, without definite aim or re- 
sults. This type of recreation cannot be fully justified 
on the theory that the schools treat the gymnasiums and 
playgrounds as public play spaces, although it is true 
that the long school day includes some of the time chil- 
dren usually have for free play. Such an attitude is 
well enough for out of school hours, when, undoubtedly, 
unorganized play on the school grounds is far better for 
the child than running the streets. But this is not a sound 
reason for making a similar use of all school time. Satis- 
factory bodily training and the cure of individual physi- 
cal defects cannot be obtained in that way.

XIII. AUDITORIUM AND RELIGIOUS 
INSTRUCTION 
HE modern school, we have been saying, holds 
| itself responsible for the proper development of 
the entire child. It undertakes to train him 
thoroughly and well in the fundamental school subjects; 
to stimulate the development of such special abilities 
as he may possess; to bring him into intelligent relation 
with the physical and social world in which he lives; to 
care for his physical well being. These various purposes 
are met in different ways. Classroom instruction ac- 
complishes one set of ends; shops and laboratories, an- 
other; the playground and gymnasium, still another. 
As one—not, be it noted, the only—method of developing 
initiative, creating a social spirit and exposing children 
to a rich variety of stimulating experiences, Gary makes 
unprecedentedly liberal use of the auditorium. 
Most large modern schools possess an auditorrum 
where the entire school assembles for a brief period, some- 
times daily, sometimes not oftener than once or twice a 
week. The assembly promotes school self-consciousness; 
exercises are held, announcments are made, occasionally 
a performance is given. At Gary, however, the audito- 
rium in the larger schools is, as a regular and active factor 
in school work, in fairly continuous use during the day 
161 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  162 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
by groups of classes; it is as much a feature of the regular 
school day as the shops, the gymnasium, or the labora- 
tory. 
On the educational side, the theory underlying the 
extended use of the auditorium may be stated as follows: 
The child is eager for constructive and creative oppor- 
tunities; he grows in power, in self-control, in interest, in 
ability to codperate through doing things with, for, and 
in the presence of his fellows. The auditorium gives 
him an incentive to organize and practise activities 
of every conceivable kind. On one occasion: he may, 
with or without the assistance of his classmates, present 
to an audience of his fellows the result of his efforts to 
master a regular classroom task; on another, a program— 
literary, musical, or dramatic—deliberately put together 
for the purpose; or again, the entire group may be assem- 
bled to listen to a lecture or demonstration by a com- 
petent outsider. From this point of view the extended 
use of the auditorium is based on the proposition that 
large groups of children at approximately the same 
stage of development can advantageously be brought to- 
gether to participate systematically in activities of cer- 
tain types. 
There is also another consideration to be kept in mind. 
The child’s development is compounded of positive and 
definite increases in knowledge or skill plus the enlarging 
but unorganized volume of contacts, associations and 
interests which constitute what may be called his mental 
or spiritual background. If these contacts are varied
-P-A-G-E-215
  AUDITORIUM AND RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION 163 
and significant, one’s general intellectual life is corres- 
pondingly full or rich; if they are few and weak, one’s 
general intellectual life is meager. Environments vary. 
enormously in the value and suggestiveness of what they 
thus offer to growing children, just as individuals vary 
enormously in their absorptive capacity. Generally 
speaking, a new country is deficient in cultural stimulus; 
new communities, by reason of their composition, their 
brief existence, and their pressing practical needs, are 
likewise lacking in background. The school may, under 
such circumstances, try to relieve the unfavorable en- 
vironment by giving the child informally a wide range 
of insights and experiences. The auditorium at Gary is 
employed for this purpose. To children whose daily 
lives pass in the unattractive setting of a new industrial 
community, the auditorium affords from time to time 
glimpses of natural wonders, of foreign cities, of ancient 
ruins. It ministers to the child’s vagrant interests and 
to his appreciative needs. The classroom is not, of 
course, expected to ignore these interests; but the audi- 
torium can deal with situations difficult, if not impossible, 
in the classroom. If, in a word, it is good for children to 
attend concerts, to go on excursions, to visit factories, to 
listen to lectures, to take part in plays—even though 
the precise benefit cannot be measured—then the audi- 
torium exercise representative of such activities and in- 
terests has a value, especially in the case of children whose 
opportunities for enjoyment and enlargement of horizon 
are meager. This, then, is the second point made in
-P-A-G-E-216
  164 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
favor of Gary’s larger use of the auditorium—that certain 
types of activity there developed are calculated to enrich 
the child’s experience and to stimulate the imagination. 
It must be admitted that of all the features of the Gary 
schools, use of the auditorium on the present scale is the 
most highly experimental. Of the nine schools, the Froe- 
bel, the Emerson, and perhaps one may add the Jefferson, 
each contain a well built auditorium; at Beveridge 
and Glen Park, a former classroom is used in order to 
provide a more or less tolerable makeshift; the four small 
schools have neither auditorium nor regular auditorium 
exercises. The Emerson auditorium seats 764; the Froe- 
bel, 833; the Jefferson, 234. The acoustics of the Froebel 
and Jefferson are good, of the Emerson, unsatisfactory, 
although said to have been recently improved. 
The problems connected with the management of the 
auditorium reduce to three: (1) proper grouping of 
pupils, so that the group in attendance is fairly homo- 
geneous; (2) management; (3) content of programs. We 
shall discuss these problems in order. 
An auditorium group to which a film, a lecture, a con- 
cert, or an organized performance of some sort is pre- 
sented need not, obviously, be as homogeneous as a 
class formed to receive specific instruction. On the 
other hand, it is not practicable to offer intellectual 
entertainment to a wholly miscellaneous assemblage. 
Theoretically, the Gary auditorium brings together at 
any one period groups made up of classes not too widely 
disparate. The kindergarten and beginning classes do

AUDITORIUM AND RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION 165 
not usually participate at all. The remaining classes are 
divided into four groups, grades 1 to 3 forming one group, 
grades 4 to 6, a second, grades 7 to 9, a third, and grades 
ro to 12, a fourth. 
This alignment is, however, frequently disturbed, as 
the auditorium programs of Emerson and Froebel show." 
For example, at Emerson, for the 3:15 period, the group 
includes classes from the fourth to the eighth grade. 
Similarly, at Froebel, the 9:15 group comprises classes 
from the first to the fourth grade, and the 3:15 period, 
from the third to the sixth grade. However, in the larger 
schools when lower grade children are listed for audito- 
rium with upper classes—for example, a fourth grade 
with an eighth grade—the smaller children do not go to 
the main auditorium, but report to the expression teacher 
for half of the period and to the music teacher for the 
other half. Even with this precaution, the grouping is 
not always fortunate. 
The groups vary considerably in size. They range 
in Emerson from two classes, with an enrollment of 
85, to five classes, with a membership of 157; and in 
Froebel, from five to nine classes, with from 135 to 276 
children. These differences do not spring from theory; 
they are rather the natural outcome of difficulties en- 
countered in making up the program for the entire school. 
When pupils provide the entertainment—report on a 
visit to the city bakeries or on experiments illustrative 
of class work—the size of the groups may prove a serious

factor, as children’s voices do not carry far. In general, 
however, the size of the group is of secondary import- 
ance, provided only the group is sufficiently homogeneous 
and the program well adapted. 
A uniform system of management has not been evolved 
and is probably not desirable, since the schools vary so 
much in scope, size, and facilities. Emerson and Froebel 
might indeed follow the same plan, just as the smaller 
schools on the outskirts of the town may find a common 
solution; but the two solutions could not possibly be 
identical. At present the schools are experimenting 
independently, while endeavoring to keep in touch with 
one another through a conference committee of audi- 
torium heads and workers, which meets at regular inter- 
vals. It must be remembered, however, that, though 
the auditorium has from the first received unusual em- 
phasis at Gary, it is, on the present scale of use, only 
three years old. It is therefore not to be wondered at 
that its problems have not been as yet completely for- 
mulated or solved. 
At the Emerson school three years ago no particular 
person was responsible for program or management, the 
teachers simply taking turns; during the last two years, 
however, the teacher of English and the teacher of 
physics constituted a committee of management. At 
the Froebel school there has recently been a special audi- 
torium head, whose business it has been to provide the 
program; at the Jefferson school the teachers of music 
and expression divide the responsibility for the audito- 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
168 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
rium, other teachers giving occasional programs; at the 
Beveridge two teachers give their entire time to this 
work. In all cases those in charge of the auditorium 
arrange with the teachers who are to present programs at 
future dates; from time to time they procure outside 
speakers or performers. At the Froebel each teacher was 
responsible for the program eight times in the course of 
the school year, and the same program was repeated four 
times to different audiences during the day, sometimes 
with different groups of children taking part. At the 
Emerson the individual teacher became responsible for an 
exercise every three or four weeks. There were twelve 
regular auditorium sessions weekly, two each on four days 
and four on Thursday. At the Jefferson, as there is only a 
small staff, a teacher takes charge of an auditorium period 
on the average once a week. Occasionally the arrange- 
ments made may be disturbed in order to take advantage 
of some unexpected opportunity. 
Whatever the system of management adopted, a suc- 
cessful auditorium exercise must be characterized by 
good group discipline. Irregular attendance, lack of 
comprehension or interest are disintegrating in their 
general effects. A well executed program adapted to the 
particular audience assembled develops group spirit, 
stimulates emulation, and makes some, even if an in- 
finitesimal, contribution to the child’s slowly and mys- 
teriously accumulating stock of ideas and impressions. 
In point of discipline, the various schools differ widely. 
Generally speaking, exceptions are freely allowed in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  
AUDITORIUM AND RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION 169 
matter of attendance; children are excused to attend 
religious classes, for music, or other individual causes; 
there are no records to show to what extent such 
irregularities occur. Also, in just the opposite direc- 
tion, unexpected elements are introduced, when classes 
or portions of classes, their regular routine being in- 
terrupted, are added to the group that chances at that 
hour to occupy the auditorium. The auditorium leaders 
differ also in the ease and completeness with which they 
guide or control the group. Some are quite ineffective, 
with the result that the hour is worse than wasted; others 
succeed even when the program lacks holding power. 
An auditorium exercise is planned to last within a few 
minutes of an hour. The precise manner of disposing of 
the time varies with the resources of the school. At the 
Jefferson, for example, a few minutes are spent in taking 
attendance, twenty or twenty five minutes are devoted 
to music, vocal and instrumental, five minutes to march- 
ing, the remaining half hour or less to the day’s feature— 
an exercise, a film, ora lecture. At the two large schools, 
the material, though naturally more varied, is of the same 
general character; information films are exhibited, classes 
or individuals present subjects that have been prepared 
for the purpose, individuals or the school orchestra 
render musical numbers, a teacher—less and less fre- 
quently an outsider—gives a lecture or demonstration. 
The manager searches the school for work adapted to 
auditorium exhibition; the laboratories, the shops, the 
playground, and the classrooms, as regularly conducted,  
-P-A-G-E-224
    170 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
furnish usable material. Again, the teacher, in prepara- 
tion for her coming turn, undertakes a special task, 
sometimes with an individual, sometimes with a group. 
Thus, recitations, debates, projects, films, dramatic 
exhibitions, games, music, lectures, and demonstrations 
all figure in the activities of the auditorium. 
At its best, the auditorium is a forum where a pupil, a 
group, a teacher, or an outsider may make a definite 
presentation of one kind or another to a fairly homogene- 
ous, interested, self-controlled audience of school chil- 
dren. Here, for example, is a group of, say, 250 children, 
who, entering the hall in an easy but orderly manner, sit 
buzzing and expectant—like a mature audience—until 
the teacher in charge rises and by her presence on the plat- 
form procures complete quiet. The preliminaries take 
place without incident. To-day the feature of the pro- 
gram is a discussion of swimming by the high school girl 
who, under the direction of the English teacher, had pre- 
pared an elaborate and highly creditable memorandum on 
that subject; to-morrow a high school boy will expound 
the comparative merits of different automobiles from the 
salesman’s point of view; on another occasion the subject 
of folk dancing will be presented with illustrative dances 
prepared by the teacher of physical training. Again, an 
industrial film—the process of hat making, for example— 
is exhibited and explained; or a travel film, touching 
countries whose history or literature has been studied in 
regular class work. A vigorous and telling address by a 
demonstrator of the International Harvester Company
-P-A-G-E-225
  
AUDITORIUM AND RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION 171 
on the topic “Swat the Fly” fills one day; musical or 
dramatic numbers fill the next; again, a science class 
makes a demonstration of their work on the subject of 
liquid air; an outdoor group does the same for their bird 
work, or their playground activities. 
So much for the auditorium at its best. At its worst, 
the auditorium simply consumes an hour of the child’s 
time, alternately boring and amusing him with material 
of little or no educative value because it is either 
inherently insignificant or poorly done. Much of the 
work, especially in the smaller schools, is of this sort. 
Here, for example, an inferior film is run off without 
comment by a listless teacher to a group of children 
whose pennies already procure them too much diversion 
of precisely this kind; again, a group of a dozen children 
mount the platform to give a poor exhibition in reading 
to an audience that has nothing to gain even were the 
performance a good one. At times more promising ma- 
terial is spoiled by lack of careful and intelligent prepa- 
ration; not infrequently an audience ineffectually handled 
affects the youthful performers disastrously. 
At this time final judgment cannot be pronounced 
on the Gary auditorium. It demands a large amount of 
time on the daily schedule; it imposes an additional task 
and tax upon teachers. Can the outcome justify the 
cost? Itis too early to say. Something depends on the 
possibility of finding and retaining leaders who possess 
marked managerial capacity—leaders who can codperate 
with the teachers in composing programs and training
-P-A-G-E-226
172 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
the participants, while controlling the audience through 
its own effort rather than through police authority; 
something—a good deal, probably—depends on the 
efficiency of the regular school. The auditorium is ex- 
pected to be an educative exercise; on the other hand, it 
is also a source of recreation, enjoyment, and amusement. 
This comes in happily, if elsewhere high standards of 
individual performance are upheld; it may do harm if the 
general attitude is lax. 
Whatever yet remains in doubt, on one point a definite 
opinion may be formed. The makeshift auditorium in 
a small school, without leadership and as a practical sub- 
stitute for class work in music and literature, is a failure. 
A large school may ultimately discover how to keep its 
frequent auditorium periods at a level high enough to 
justify the effort. But for small schools, with their 
preponderance of little children and their limited re- 
sources in teachers, opportunities, and facilities, the out- 
look is unpromising. 
A word may be inserted at this point regarding another 
highly experimental innovation, viz., the arrangement for 
religious instruction. In 1912 the Gary schools proposed 
an arrangement which would enable the churches of the 
city to give religious instruction twice weekly during 
school hours to children whose parents so desired. In 
general, religious instruction was meant to be an alterna- 
tive to the auditorium, so that children attending a class 
in religion would be excused on certain days from audi- 
torium exercises; but in practice they are as frequently
-P-A-G-E-227
  AUDITORIUM AND RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION 173 
excused from physical training and play. The schools, 
however, explicitly disavow responsibility for the child’s 
attendance on the class in religion; he is “to be in the 
custody of his family,” his attendance being a matter 
between the church and the home, not the church and the 
school. The schools have therefore no part in determin- 
ing the character or aims of the instruction offered. 
Of the nine Gary schools, religious instruction was, in 
1915-16, actively carried on only in connection with the 
Jefferson school, where seven churches coéperated. At the 
Emerson, one church, five blocks distant, codperated; at 
the Froebel, two neighborhood houses and a mission; at 
Glen Park, two churches. Eight hundred and forty two 
children out of a total school enrollment of 5,654 were 
in attendance. 
It is too early to express a final opinion as to 
the feasibility or importance of this feature. As has 
been stated, it has not yet proved practicable to develop 
it generally. Whether it is wise for the school to release 
its hold upon the child during school hours is open 
to question; again, codperation between church and 
state involves a change from our traditional policy, ac- 
cording to which church and state pursue their respec- 
tive ends independently of each other. It remains to 
be ascertained how American sentiment will react to 
this innovation.
-P-A-G-E-228
XIV. ENROLLMENT, ATTENDANCE AND 
PUPIL PROGRESS! 
Te purpose of the public school is to pass every 
child of the community through a complete ele- 
mentary, if not a high school, course. “As yet no 
system of public schools has by any means realized this 
purpose. The extent to which a given system succeeds is 
indicated (1) by its success in enrolling the children, 
(2) by their attendance, and (3) by their progress 
through the schools. 
The Indiana law requires that the school census in- 
clude all unmarried persons between the ages of six 
and twenty one years. From a practical point of view, 
however, a distinction must be drawn between the 
children reported by the census, all of whom are legally 
entitled to attend school, and those who under existing 
social conditions may reasonably be expected to attend. 
Obviously it is unreasonable to expect all children to 
remain at school until they are twenty one years of age. 
For our present purposes, we may assume that the ideal 
school population would include children from six to 
1For description of the records and reports on which this chapter, as well 
as other general chapters, is based, see Appendix B, page 211.

ENROLLMENT, ATTENDANCE AND PROGRESS 175 
eighteen years of age. But, even so, a qualification needs 
to be borne in mind. The compulsory school period in 
Indiana ends with the pupil’s fourteenth birthday. Any 
child is legally free to leave school the moment he reaches 
fourteen. ‘ 
However school population is defined, public schools 
never enroll all eligible children. Some parents pre- 
fer private and parochial schools, while many children, 
particularly of high school age, drop out. Gary is not 
unusual in these respects. Private schools are not so 
strong as in older communities, but there are several 
parochial schools, and the general complexion of the 
population, foreign and industrial as it is, augments 
the difficulty of holding young people in school. In 
fact, a comparison by ages of the children enumerated 
in the school census of May, 1916, and the children re- 
ported in school at that time shows that the Gary pub- 
lic schools enroll only 63 per cent. of those from six 
to eighteen, inclusive, private and parochial schools, 15 
per cent., while 22 per cent. are out of school alto- 
gether.1 If, however, the children of different ages are 
grouped into children of elementary school age (those from 
six to fourteen), and of high school age (those from 
fifteen to eighteen), the public schools enroll 74 per cent. of 
the former and 24 per cent. of the latter. (Figure 17.)?

delay beginning school—1g per cent. not being enrolled— 
is readily understood, because the distances they have to 
go are often long and there are many foreigners and new- 
comers. After six, the public, private, and parochial 
schools together reach practically all children up to four- 
teen, about a fifth going to private and parochial 
schools. But the attracting power of both public and 
other schools wanes decidedly with children fourteen and 
over. Still, the Gary schools seem to be unusually suc- 
cessful in attracting children fourteen and fifteen years 
of age, who are beyond the compulsory attendance age, 
as they enroll 67 per cent. of the former and 44 per cent. 
of the latter. But that

87 out of each 100, eighteen years of age, 
should be out of school altogether shows unsatisfactory 
conditions at Gary, as is the case in the country at large. 
But mere enrollment is not enough. Pupils must also 
be held to continuous and regular attendance. Whether 
or not they are thus held can be inferred, in the first in- 
stance, from the number dropping out before completing 
the course. 
Few school systems have complete data either as to 
the number dropping out or as to the age and grade at 
  
1Tables XXVIII, XXTX, and XXX, Appendix D, pages 248-250.
-P-A-G-E-232
  “178 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
which they drop out, and the data at Gary are alto- 
gether inadequate on these points. Nevertheless, from 
such data as are available, the proportion of the enroll- 
ment dropping from the Gary schools during the school 
year appears to be somewhat smaller than is common. 
Furthermore, probably more of such withdrawals are 
due at Gary to changes in population than is the case 
in older and more settled cities. 
In the year 1915-16, the percentage dropping out 
ranged in the elementary school from g per cent. in the 
second and fourth grades to 22 per cent. in the eighth; in 
the high school from 4 per cent. in the twelfth grade to 
23 per cent. in the ninth The average is 14 per cent.; 
Pasadena, Cal., reports, for 1915-16,. 16 per cent.; Deca- 
tur, Ill., 16 per cent.; New Britain, Conn., 15 per cent; 
Williamsport, Pa., 11 per cent.; and Newton, Mass., 8 
percent.’ As elsewhere, the largest numbers, relatively, 
drop from the last three elementary grades and the 
first year of the high school. 
It also appears that children begin to drop out of 
the Gary schools at about the usual ages (fourteen and 
thereafter), and for the usual causes (family moving 
from the city, to go to work, personal and family ill- 
1Table XXXI, Appendix D, page 251. 
Public school reports for 1915-16 for the respective cities, with the 
exception of Decatur, which is for 1914-15. These percentages are at 
best only suggestive. Withdrawal is not always defined; hence the dif- 
ferences in the per cent. of withdrawals may be more a matter of defini- 
tion than actual differences in holding power.
-P-A-G-E-233
  
ENROLLMENT, ATTENDANCE, AND PROGRESS 179 
ness, etc.). The Gary data bearing on these points are, 
however, unusually incomplete. No reasons are re- 
ported for 24 per cent. of the withdrawals; there is 
no record of the grade to which 8 per cent. of those 
withdrawing belonged;! and no record of the ages of 14 
per cent. of the entire number withdrawn.’ 
Again, the holding power of the schools is indicated by 
regularity of attendance. A common method of express- 
ing this is to give the per cent. of the total enrollment 
in average daily attendance. When so expressed, at- 
tendance since 1910 has ranged at Gary from 67 per cent. 
in 1911-12 to 76 per cent. in 1914-15, with 73 per cent. for 
1915-16.3 This method of expressing regularity of atten- 
dance is, however, of little significance, since total enroll- 
ment includes all children in school at any time during the 
year, whether on the register for the entire session or for a 
brief period only. We need to know rather the regularity 
of attendance on the part of children actively on the roll 
a given length of time.‘ This involves comparison of 
the days enrolled with days present during enrollment. 
For example, if a pupil is enrolled 200 days and present 
160, his per cent. of attendance is 80. Regularity of 
attendance when so computed runs for the Gary system 
as a whole as high as go per cent. and as low as 86, with

8g per cent. for 1915-16. That children should be out 
of school after they enroll slightly more than a tenth of 
the time is not unusual. 
Three facts in this connection are worthy of note: 
First, despite the differences among the several schools in 
facilities and programs, and despite the differences in 
nationality and economic status of the children, the per 
cent. of attendance varies little from school to school, 
and in no case is it far from the record for the city as a 
whole. Second, children entering school late attend, 
when once they are enrolled, about as regularly as those 
in school from the beginning, an indication probably 
that the late entrants are mostly newcomers and not 
truant children.” Finally, children living in Gary appear 
to enter school mostly on the opening day, and the num- 
ber entering at each later ten day interval does not seem 
large enough to disturb the progress of school work.3 
We have now seen to what extent the Gary schools 
succeed in getting the children of the community in 
school, and to what extent they succeed in holding them 
to continuous and regular attendance. It remains to 
consider how regularly children advance through the 
schools. 
A common elementary school measure of whether or 
not children are where they should be on their way 
1Table XXXIV, Appendix D, page 253.

through the school is to determine whether or not they 
are entering or have completed the grade proper to their 
age. The significance of this measure lies in the fact that 
when school children fall too far behind their proper 
grade, they are likely to drop out even before completing 
the elementary course, to say nothing of the high school 
course. When the elementary pupils of Gary are grouped 
according to the grade proper to their age,! 22 per cent. 
are under age (that is, ahead of their proper grade), 
4o per cent. are normal age (that is, in their proper 
grade), and 38 per cent. are over age (that is, behind 
their proper grade).? (Figure 18.)* 
When compared with other cities, Gary is doing as 
well as they do, but probably no better, in advancing 
children through the school. The basis of this conclu- 
sion is admittedly narrow, for we have data fairly com- 
parable from only three other cities, Dubuque, Ia., 
Rockford, Ill., and Rochester, N. Y., which are as follows:

each yielding different results. In this report we have used the Bachman 
method. For different methods and differences in results, see Appendix

Gary, it will be noted, has more children ahead of their 
proper grade than any one of the three cities in question, 
fewer children in their proper grade, and as many be- 
hind their proper grade as Rochester (38 per cent.) and 
more than either Rockford or Dubuque.

PROPORTION OF ELEMENTARY CHILDREN UNDER AGE, Norma AGE, 
AND OVER AGE 
  As in other systems, in consequence of differences in 
organization, quality of instruction, promotion stand- 
ards, and especially pupil ability, the age-grade status 
of the children is not uniform for the several schools. 
At Gary the widest differences occur as between Jefferson 
and Froebel; the children under age range from 10 per
-P-A-G-E-237
ENROLLMENT, ATTENDANCE, AND PROGRESS 183 
cent. in Froebel to 35 per cent. in Jefferson, and the 
over age from 56 to 23 per cent. respectively. Jefferson 
not only makes the best showing of all, but conditions 
there are remarkable, more children being ahead than 
behind their grade—35 per cent. as against 23 per cent. 
More significant than the number of over age children 
in a system is the number of years these children are be- 
hind their proper grade. A child less than a year over 
age may, especially if in the lower grades, catch up with 
his class; but it is next to impossible for him to do so if 
he is ten or twelve years of age and two, three, or four 
years behind other children of his age. 
Of the 1,311 over age children at Gary, 789, or 60 per 
cent., are less than a year behind; 353, or 27 per cent., 
are one and less than two years behind; 119, or 9 per cent., 
are two and less than three years behind; 50, or 4 per 
cent., are three years or more behind.” 
At that, over age is probably no more serious at Gary 
than elsewhere, as the following table shows:

  184 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
In slowly growing cities, backwardness in this respect 
is attributed to over age at entrance, or to the failure of 
the schools to advance pupils regularly, or to both causes, 
Failure of pupils to make proper progress at Gary is not 
so easily disposed of. For out of 3,422 enrolled in the 
elementary school, 1,372, or 40 per cent., had started 
school elsewhere.! For example, of the June elemen- 
tary school graduating class, only 15 of the 95 had had 
all their work at Gary; the remaining 80 entered from 
other systems, as follows: 
9 in first grade, A and B divisions 
12 in second grade 
15 in third grade 
12 in fourth grade 
12 in fifth grade 
6 in sixth grade 
7 in seventh grade 
6 in eighth grade 
r unknown 
Under these conditions, the failure of other systems to 
advance pupils regularly may account, in part, for the 
fact that certain children in the Gary schools are now be- 
hind their grades. In fact, 24 per cent. of the children 
coming from other systems were, on entrance, ahead of, 
and 4o per cent. behind, their proper grades. At pres- 
ent 20 per cent. of these chi'dren are under and 48 per 
cent. are over age. While in the Gary schools, the pro- 
  
1Table XL, Appendix D, page 258. 
*Table XLI, Appendix D, page 259.
-P-A-G-E-239
  ENROLLMENT, ATTENDANCE, AND PROGRESS 185 
portion ahead of their grade thus decreased 4 per cent. 
and that behind increased 8 per cent. 
Nor can all the present over age among children who 
started their school life at Gary be charged directly to 
the Gary schools. For, while 32 per cent. of these chil- 
dren are now over age, the Gary schools are directly 
responsible for only 18 per cent., as 14 per cent. of them 
were behind on entrance.! The full responsibility of 
the Gary schools is, however, somewhat larger, for in the 
meanwhile the initial proportion of under age children 
has decreased 8 per cent.; besides, children in relatively 
large numbers enter young, which tends to lessen the 
number falling behind. 
If these two groups—those having attended other 
schools and those starting school at Gary—are now com- 
bined, the actual position of the Gary schools in regard 
to pupil progress becomes clear. The initial age-grade 
status of all Gary children—28 per cent. ahead of grade, 
48 per cent. up to grade, and 24 per cent. behind grade— 
contributes to the making of a good showing later on. 
Failure while in the Gary schools to progress regularly 
reduced the initial proportion of under age 6 per cent.,of 
normal age, 8 per cent., and increased the over age 14 per 
cent. (Figure 19.) Whether these unfavorable changes 
are large or small, we do not know, as there are no compar- 
able data available. We incline to regard them as small.

Ea present 
Support for this view is found when the children now 
under age, of normal age, and over age are grouped ac- 
cording to rapid, normal, and slow progress after entering 
the Gary schools. A child’s progress is normal when he 
is credited with as many terms’ work as he has been 
terms in school, i. e., when he advances without interrup- 
tion or backset term by term. On this basis, when he 
has more credits than terms in school he is rapid, and 
when he has less, he is slow. When so grouped, 19 per
-P-A-G-E-241
ENROLLMENT, ATTENDANCE, AND PROGRESS 187 
cent. of all the elementary children are rapid, 29 per 
cent. normal, and 52 per cent. slow. Thus, half of the 
children failed to keep up, but the Gary schools held the 
other half to normal or better, and of the half falling be- 
hind, 41 per cent. lost only a single term. 
Our position is also supported by a comparison be- 
tween the total number of terms all pupils on the register 
have been enrolled and the total number of terms’ 
work to their combined credit. Those entering the Gary 
schools from other systems suffered a net loss of 8 per 
cent., those having attended no other schools, 14 per 
cent.2 The greater apparent success of outside children 
is due to the fact that such children mostly enter the 
middle and higher grades* where the losses for all children 
are less than in the beginning grades.‘ The average 
net loss for all children is 12 per cent., which means that 
88 per cent. of the entire school advance regularly. To 
accomplish this result a liberal promotion policy is requi- 
site. 
The present organization is, in general, favorable to the 
regular advancement of children. The main drawback 
is the lack of special classes, particularly at Froebel, for 
non-English speaking, backward, or defective children. 
The three classes for defectives at Froebel, if confined to 
1Table XLIV, Appendix D, page 262.

*Table XL, Appendix D, page 258. 
‘Table XLVI, Appendix D, page 264.
-P-A-G-E-242
  188 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
this field, might provide for all such children there; but 
they now serve for all kinds of children needing special 
assistance. The one class of backward pupils, composed 
now of siftings from the primary grades, is inadequate 
for the 109 children two or more years behind their grade, 
and the successful care of a school population predom- 
inantly foreign requires special classes for non-English 
speaking pupils. The need for special classes at Jefferson 
and Emerson is not pressing, but Beveridge, with each 
third child over age, could certainly make good use of 
one or more. 
Among the favorable factors is the promotion of chil- 
dren three times a year, as well as during term time when- 
ever a child can do the work of the next grade; also the 
Saturday and summer schools. Saturday is not a regular 
school day, but the buildings are open and instructors 
are on duty. Pupils who are falling behind, or who 
have been absent, or who wish to make two grades in 
one year, come voluntarily for one or more hours’ 
assistance from their regular weekday teachers. The 
summer school serves the same end, and is even more 
effective than the Saturday school in helping over age 
children to catch up, weak children to make their grade, 
and ambitious ones to advance more rapidly than their 
class. 
The smallness of the classes in ‘‘special work” is 
also a favorable factor; in the old line studies, however, 
classes are of the usual size. The average number of pupils 
on roll in these at the end of the year was 36, half of
-P-A-G-E-243
  
ENROLLMENT, ATTENDANCE, AND PROGRESS 189 
the classes having 38 or more and half having less 
than 38 pupils. 
To conclude, whether the advancement of the Gary 
children through the schools is measured by their present 
age-grade status or by their progress after taking up 
school work at Gary, the Gary schools make a creditable 
showing, particularly if the foreign character of the pop- 
ulation is considered and account is taken of the large 
number of children coming from other systems. But 
the two measures employed show only whether children 
have or have not advanced regularly for their age and 
for their time in school. They shed no light whatever 
upon educational performance or achievement.

XV. COSTS? 
OTHING is easier than comparison of school 
N costs on the basis of printed tables—and, be it 
added. at once, nothing more misleading. A 
simple comparison of school costs is absolutely without 
significance unless the educational advantages for which 
the expenditures were made are taken into consideration. 
Thus, a comparison between general or per capita costs 
in two different cities would be helpful, if substantially 
identical educational opportunities were offered; such a 
comparison is, however, worse than useless, if the educa- 
tional opportunities are notably dissimilar. The same 
holds even as between different schools within the same 
system. A comparison of the per capita cost of instruc- 
tion in one of Gary’s portable schools with per capita 
cost of instruction in the Emerson or Froebel school is 
meaningless, since the educational opportunities are 
themselves non-comparable. Education has one cost 
at the Emerson, another at the Froebel, still another at 
the Jefferson, because in the three schools mentioned 
the town buys different opportunities under different 
conditions. It is therefore difficult to say what is meant

and Ralph Bowman. 
190
-P-A-G-E-245
  COSTS IQI 
when costs as such at these three schools are compared, 
and impossible to say what is meant when they are av- 
eraged. 
This does not mean, however, that it is useless to study 
costs. It means simply that there is little to be gained 
from the exhibition of what may be called’ lumped costs 
or unanalyzed costs. Costs may, however, be profitably 
studied in direct connection with facilities provided, fa- 
cilities used, opportunities offered, and type of organiza- 
tion employed. If, however, a study of this kind is con- 
templated, accounts must be so kept as to provide the 
data therefor. To the extent that such cost accounting 
systems are uniformly introduced, comparisons will be 
valid and helpful. 
For the present we are compelled to content ourselves 
with presenting the main items of the Gary costs and 
showing by their variations how largely the several costs 
vary within a single system according to the quality of 
the facilities provided, the greater or less completeness 
with which they are used, and the educational oppor- 
tunities offered. 
For example, of the three large schools, the cost of the 
Emerson school—grounds, buildings, and equipment— 
was $388,886.07; of the Froebel, $433,517.55; of the re- 
modeled Jefferson, $98,309.99. On the basis of actual 
attendance, these investments represent a capital outlay 
per pupil of $524.11 at the Emerson school, $288.43 at 
the Froebel school, and $135.04 at the Jefferson school. 
The immense discrepancy in these figures is partly as-
-P-A-G-E-246
  192 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
cribable to the fact that the opportunities offered are 
far from uniform, partly to the fact that attendance is 
up to capacity at the Jefferson and far from capacity at 
the Emerson. If Gary’s own estimate of the capacity of 
the Emerson and Froebel schools is correct (2,300 in 
each)—a point as to which there is some doubt—the 
per capita investment at Emerson would be $169.08, at 
Froebel, $188.49. A more conservative estimate of ca~ 
pacity would show a per capita plant investment of 
between $200 and $250. These figures can be fairly 
compared with plant investment in other cities only on 
the basis of similar facilities. It means nothing, for ex- 
ample, to allege that, in respect to capital investment, 
the Gary plan is either dear or cheap as compared with 
some other plan. Such a comparison is significant only if 
one compares the investment required by the Gary plan 
for certain specific opportunities with the investment re- 
quired by some other plan offering equal opportunities. 
The total current expenditures for the entire Gary sys- 
tem (1915-16) were $255,438.41, of which $182,004.39 
went for the day school, $21,677.99 for overhead charges 
(usually added to the day school costs), the balance for 
Saturday school, night school, etc. The per capita day 
school expenditure on the basis of average daily attend- 
ance was thus $49.29. But this average obscures rather 
than sets forth the interesting facts, since per capita ex- 
pense in the three main day schools varies from $34.31 
at the Jefferson to $74.64 at the Emerson. The follow- 
ing table exhibits these variations in detail:

In the crucial matter of instruction alone, considerable 
divergencies exist. In the upper elementary grades, 
per capita instruction costs vary from $20.99 at the 
Jefferson to more than double that sum at the Emer- 
son; between Jefferson and Froebel the difference in 
these grades is also very large. The following table 
summarizes these facts:

Still larger variations would be introduced if the other 
schools were included, while the extreme variation would 
probably be less if the Emerson school were operating at 
capacity. 
Perhaps the most problematical factor in Gary costs is 
the cost of the shops. It has been pointed out that these 
shops serve two purposes—production (including re- 
pairs), and education. In the manual training shops,
-P-A-G-E-248
  : 194 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
production is incidental to instruction, whereas the forge, 
foundry, machine shop, etc., are operated primarily ona 
production basis. When all shops are taken together, to 
what extent does productive and repair work pay for 
the educational opportunities enjoyed? Are the shops 
practically self-supporting? If so, such industrial edu- 
cation as the Gary boy gets would cost the community 
nothing. 
In the year 1915-16, the sum spent on all shops aggre- 
gated $22,535.31. Gary authorities credit the shops 
with an estimated market value of their products. 
Owing to the incompleteness of the records, we were un- 
able to determine the total estimated market value 
placed by the instructors on products of the manual 
training shops and the paint shop. But in the remaining 
shops, the instructors placed, in 1915-16, a market value 
on their products of $16,268, which alone is 72 per cent. 
of the initial cost of all shops. If, on the other hand, the 
several shops are credited, as we have done, with only 
the labor and material cost of their products, the credit 
allowance for all shops amounts to $12,217.62, or 54 
per cent. of their total initial cost; that is, taken alto- 
gether, the Gary shops are 54 per cent. self-supporting. 
If, however, those shops are considered separately which 
are operated primarily on a productive basis, such as 
forge, foundry, machine shop, print shop, etc., these 
shops, when credited with the labor and material cost 
of their products, are 69 per cent. self-supporting. 
The foregoing discussion makes plain that there is no
-P-A-G-E-249
  COSTS 195 
point in considering school expenditures unless at the 
same time one considers the return in educational advan- 
tages. If one has in mind the Gary plan as embodied 
in the Froebel and Emerson schools, it is obvious that 
the plan is not cheap in the sense that its enormously 
increased opportunities cost actually less than the more 
limited opportunities of the old red schoolhouse. Of 
course they cost more, much more, and it is infinitely to 
its credit that Gary has made the greater investment to 
achieve the larger purpose. The real question, however, 
is whether or not the Gary plan costs more for what it 
gives—whether identical opportunities would cost less on 
some other plan. For the detailed evidence bearing on 
this crucial point the reader must consult the technical 
discussions contained in the volumes on Costs and Or- 
ganization and Administration. Suffice it here to re- 
state the conclusion there expressed, that, though addi- 
tional data are desirable, it appears that schools organ- 
ized on the Gary plan promise an extended and enriched 
course of study at minimum cost. In other words, the 
advantages offered by the Gary schools at their best 
probably cost less than the same advantages on a more 
conventional plan of school organization.
-P-A-G-E-250
XVI. CONCLUSION 
worth while to sum up briefly the pros and cons of a 
complicated situation. 
On the credit side of the ledger must be placed the 
fact that Gary has adopted, and taken effective steps 
towards providing facilities for, a large and generous 
conception of public education. Had Gary played safe, 
we should find there half a dozen or more square brick 
“soap-box” buildings, accommodating a dozen classes, 
each pursuing the usual book studies, a playground, with 
little or no equipment, perhaps a basement room for 
manual training, a laboratory, and a cooking room for 
girls. Provided with this commonplace system, the 
town would have led a conventional school life—quiet, 
unoffending, and negatively happy—doing as many 
others do, doing it about as well as they do it, and 
satisfied to do just that. Instead, it adopted the 
progressive, modern conception of school function, 
formulated its conception in clear terms and with all 
possible expedition provided facilities adequate to the 
conception. The adoption and execution of this policy 
required administrative courage and civic liberality. In 
one sense there was nothing revolutionary in it, for not 
196 I BRINGING this volume to a close, it is perhaps 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
CONCLUSION 197 
a few schoolmen have adopted this broad conception of 
public education. But Gary not only adopted this 
conception in theory—it made realization possible by 
providing in its main schools the physical conditions 
needed for its execution. The Froebel and the Emer- 
son schools are not simply fine buildings, that in their 
environment startle the visitor—they are instruments 
formed to embody and realize a distinct educational 
idea. Even the temporary makeshifts required by the 
exigencies of the situation show an intelligent and serious 
effort to do what is feasible in the same direction for 
children unable to attend the well equipped central 
schools. The extended curriculum is therefore a reality 
at Gary, and the general movement toward enrichment 
of the curriculum has been greatly stimulated by Gary’s 
example. 
On the credit side of the ledger belongs also Gary’s 
contribution to school organization. There can be 
no question that a modern plant, consisting of class- 
rooms, shops, gymnasium, laboratories, and audito- 
rium, can be operated on the Gary type of organiza- 
tion so as to accommodate a considerably larger number 
of children than the same plant operated on the 
conventional plan. Indeed, the Gary type of organi- 
zation anticipates such unsatisfactory and deplorable 
makeshifts, as “part time,” by providing on purely 
educational grounds for the intensive use of all school 
facilities. Thus, without waiting to be driven by pres- 
sure of large numbers, Gary has developed a type of
-P-A-G-E-252
  198 “THE GARY SCHOOLS’ 
school organization which permits the effective instruc- 
tion of the maximum number of children in a plant 
having modern facilities. From this point of view, the 
Gary organization is perhaps the most fruitful suggestion 
yet contributed toward the practical solution of the ad- 
ministrative problems involved in realizing a broad con- 
ception of public education. 
Finally, Gary has attempted to practise democratic 
theory in school conduct and discipline. It is a common- 
place that arbitrary or military discipline is alien to the 
American spirit. Codperation, representing the willing 
subordination of the individual in the endeavor to achieve 
necessary and desirable ends, must somehow be pro- 
cured. In various ways—in classroom, corridors, audi- 
torium, shop, etc.—Gary appeals to the codperative 
spirit, relies on it, believes in it, gives it something to do— 
at times perhaps unwisely and to excess. In any event, 
the schools are rich in color and movement, they are 
places where children live as well as learn, places where 
children obtain educational values, not only through 
books, but through genuine life activities. The Gary 
schools make a point not only of the well known measur- 
able abilities, but of happiness and appreciation, which 
cannot be measured, even though they may be sensed. 
It does not follow that Gary obtains no results from these 
efforts, merely because the outcome of its efforts in 
classroom work is unsatisfactory. The final results of 
appreciation and stimulus are too subtle, too remote, too 
readily obscured or augmented by other factors in ex-

CONCLUSION 199 
perience wr environment to be themselves definitely ap- 
praised. But evidence that appeal to the appreciative 
instincts is not made in vain is encountered now here, 
now there, in the activities, interests, and attitudes of 
teachers and children alike. 
There are, it is clear, two distinct bodies of material 
employed at Gary, each having its appropriate method 
of approach: first, definite subjects, that have in the last 
resort to be “learned” in such wise that the pupil may 
attain and demonstrate a reasonable degree of mastery; 
next, esthetic or other activities, giving wholesome pleas- 
ure at the time and tending to establish higher levels of 
need and. taste. The traditional pedagogue concen- 
trates on the first group and relentlessly organizes the 
subjects contained within it. The philosopher, insisting 
that at its best education supplies the means of natural 
growth, emphasizes the second group, not infrequently 
revolting from systematic presentation and precise re- 
sults. A really effective school will undoubtedly harmo- 
nize the two. It will set up high and definite standards of 
workmanship for tasks that represent desired skills— 
spelling, arithmetic, cooking, sewing, or what not—en- 
deavoring to reach these by employing well thought out 
and well wrought out methods of procedure; it will also 
provide a variety of experiences of a stimulating and ap- 
preciative character, without being overmuch concerned 
at the moment to decide why they are good, or what good 
they do, then or thereafter. One gets at Gary the im- 
pression of confusion in this matter. The auditorium, for
-P-A-G-E-254
200 THE GARY SCHOOLS 
example, embodies largely the stimulating and apprecia- 
tive experiences that cannot be closely followed up. But 
the type of procedure that is natural to the auditorium 
not infrequently invades the shops, the cafeteria, and 
the classrooms, as if the passive absorption adapted to 
the auditorium were a generally applicable educational 
method. 
We thus pass to the debit side of the account. The 
readers of this volume already know that the execution 
of the Gary plan is defective. It is of course true 
that no public school system thus far critically studied has 
been pronounced satisfactory—satisfactory in the sense 
that it meets current and reasonable standards of effi- 
ciency. It would therefore be manifestly unfair to de- 
mand that Gary should fully embody and practically 
succeed with every item of its varied and extensive pro- 
gram. A good many extenuating considerations may be 
fairly urged—the newness of the community, the com- 
plexities due to the character of the population, the 
breadth of the conception, the enormous difficulty of 
obtaining a teaching and supervising staff competent to 
execute the plan. But after making every possible al- 
lowance, it remains to be admitted that in respect to ad- 
ministration and instruction Gary might fairly have 
been expected to make a better showing. 
Fundamentally, the defect is one of administration. 
No scheme will execute itself. Precisely because the 
Gary scheme is complicated, extensive, and at some 
points novel, uncommonly watchful administrative con-

trol is requisite. Such control does not exist. In con- 
sequence, results appear to be largely taken for granted. 
Illustrations in proof of this statement may be drawn 
from many of the preceding chapters. For example, 
the present organization assumes that satisfactory 
educational results are obtained when the plant con- 
sists half of regular classrooms and half of special 
facilities, and these facilities are kept in continuous use. 
As the plan works out, the groups assembled at Gary in 
the auditorium or on the playground are large or small, 
composed of a single grade or many grades, according to 
the requirements of a schedule constructed on this basis. 
It would, of course, be most convenient if this somewhat 
mechanical arrangement proved educationally effective. 
But does it? Not, in our judgment, without certain cau- 
tions and qualifications which Gary has thus far neg- 
lected. The ‘‘duplicate” school organization should 
therefore be viewed as an experiment to be watched and 
modified rather than assumed as a principle according to 
which a school schedule may be arbitrarily arranged. 
The execution of the Gary plan is again defective in 
respect to educational supervision. To be sure, teaching 
and discipline in harmony with the Gary idea are to be 
found; side by side, however, are also teaching and dis- 
cipline of old-fashioned type. Of course, this is inevi- 
table. No consistently modern scheme could be com- 
pletely realized at this time, because the materials have 
not as yet been created, the teachers have not yet been 
trained. Criticism is warranted, not because crudities

and inconsistencies occur, but because the agencies which 
ought to be concerned over this situation have failed to 
take hold of it vigorously. Consequently in the so-called 
“old line” branches, the fundamental necessities of edu- 
cation, Gary execution falls short of usual performance. 
In reaching out for something new, Gary has too lightly 
parted with certain essential and established values, 
without being aware of the loss it has inadvertently 
made. 
Not even in those branches to which Gary has given 
impetus and development—the so-called special activi- 
ties—has a high or even satisfactory standard been 
reached. An excellent spirit pervaded the playgrounds, 
gymnasiums, shops, laboratories, and household arts de- 
partments. But high—even satisfactory—standards of 
workmanship did not rule. Some boys and girls did 
well; some did ill; concerted effort to procure generally 
good work, conscientious insistence upon excellent perfor- 
mance are only spasmodically in evidence. Not that 
teachers and principals do not want good work; they 
plainly do. But that patient and close attention to 
details by which alone good work can be obtained was 
far too irregular to be effective. Here, as elsewhere, 
one cannot avoid the conclusion that a large and gener- 
ous scheme, distinguished by intelligence and vision in 
conception, falls too far short in the execution. 
Attention has been called to the ways in which pupils 
participate in responsible activities—record keeping, etc. 
Such participation is admirably calculated to give a fla-

CONCLUSION 203, 
vor of reality to school life. What ought, however, to 
be a credit item is converted into a debit because the 
absence of proper accountability results in slipshod work 
that must do the pupils positive damage. Records 
characterized by poor spelling, arithmetical inaccuracies, 
and grave omissions pass unchallenged. Not only is 
the immediate educative effect lost, but the child tends 
to become habituated to inferior performance. Thus, 
once more sound conception is frustrated by ineffective 
execution. 
Could the Gary scheme be acceptably executed with- 
out additional expenditure? If not, how much more 
would have to be spent? Or can results of higher quality 
be obtained on the present outlay only by attempting 
less? We are unable to say. These questions cannot 
be finally answered until the present administrative 
and supervisory officers either conceive their functions 
somewhat differently or exercise them more effectively. 
Unquestionably, the mere process of gearing up the pres- 
ent organization would substantially improve results; 
for which reason it would be unwise either to curtail 
opportunities or largely to increase expenditure until 
the existing system has shown what it can accomplish 
when on the alert. 
’ An eminent surgeon, accounting for his success in 
treating a recalcitrant wound, recently remarked of the 
hospital with which he is associated: “Here we try 
things.” He did not mean that he and his associates 
follow a hit-or-miss policy. He was, in point of fact,
-P-A-G-E-258

describing an arduous, rigorous, exacting, and at the 
same time strictly accountable procedure. They can- 
vass their resources, select in a critical way the 
moves which may reasonably be expected to prove 
beneficial, and with the most scrupulous care watch 
the outcome, determining the next procedure on the 
basis of ascertained results. They “try things,” but 
they “try things” intelligently and critically. 
It is a severe criticism of much of our current education 
that it does not “try things.” This modern world of ours 
is in many ways a new world, with new peoples facing 
new problems and new opportunities. We tell ourselves 
again and again that only through education can safe 
and happy adjustments be reached; no one pretends that 
education has yet found these adjustments. Never- 
theless, educational inertia is all but invincible. Only 
here and there in the person of this or that teacher or 
principal or supervisor does it “try things.” And the 
moment it is proposed to ‘try things’”’—the only method 
by which progress can be made—the forces of conserva- 
tism organize to check and discredit progressive en- 
terprise. 
It is to the substantial and lasting credit of Gary that 
it has had the courage, liberality, and imagination to 
“try things.” Nor have things been tried blindly and 
recklessly. The social situation to be dealt with has been 
thoughtfully analyzed; the resources at our disposal 
have been intelligently marshaled. That is, Gary did not 
act in ignorance of the situation to be met; it did not em-
-P-A-G-E-259
  
CONCLUSION 205 
ploy ill adjusted tools. It has failed only in caution and 
criticism. Hence, while things have been tried, results 
have not been carefully checked. Disappointment was 
inevitable, but it is disappointment that does not nec- 
essarily imply fundamental error. 
It is not difficult to understand why self-criticism was 
overlooked. Education has for centuries too largely 
consisted of exercises habitually practised, partly for 
known and obvious, partly for unknown, ends. It 
made little practical difference whether the end was 
known or unknown, because in neither case were school- 
men accustomed to examine results carefully in order to 
ascertain what their efforts and processes achieved. In 
failing to scrutinize results, Gary simply did as others 
did. There is also another consideration. The Gary 
scheme was conceived in enthusiasm. The tempera- 
ment of the reformer is not usually associated in the 
same individual with the temperament of the critic. 
The two must, however, be brought together. The in- 
novator must formulate his purposes clearly and con- 
cretely; and his results must be measured in the light of 
his professed aims. If innovation is carried on in this 
critical spirit, conservatism will also have to submit to 
assay. 
The theory of which Gary is an exemplification is de- 
rived from the facts and necessities of modern life. The 
defects of Gary cannot therefore simply throw us back 
on the meager type of education appropriate enough 
to other conditions. Gary’s experience up to this time

means merely that further efforts, at Gary and else- 
where, more clearly defined, more effectively controlled, 
must be made in order, if possible, to accomplish 
Gary’s avowed object—the making of our schools ade- 
quate to the needs and conditions of current life.

AmMouNT OF INSTRUCTION OBSERVED 
Our judgments of the quality of the regular instruc- 
tion at Gary are based on four months of intimate 
contact with the classroom work. Short visits to all 
departments gave us numerous samples of what was 
going on. But our chief reliance is the full notes on 
228 recitations, the unit of observation being the en- 
tire lesson period, which varies from thirty to sixty 
minutes. These observations were distributed as the 
table on the following page indicates. 
Our task had to do with the teaching of the basic 
studies only. But to get the larger view needed to inter- 
pret the regular work, our observations extended to other 
than the fundamental studies. 
The intensiveness of our observations is revealed by 
the amount of time spent with each teacher. The total 
number of teachers, exclusive of physical training teachers

ScHooL REcoRDS AND REPORTS 
From the beginning Gary has had a rather complete 
system of records, covering most of the essential items. 
It centers about the so-called register teacher, who is 
supposed to take the school census, to keep all records, 
and to make all reports for children coming to school 
from a particular section or division of the city, irre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  212 APPENDIX 
spective of whether she has any of them in her classes. 
Current as well as permanent records are stored in the 
rooms of the register teachers. The principal seldom has 
in his office more than a list of pupils in school and 
the register sheets of those who have dropped out. Such 
reports as the register teacher makes concern her dis- 
trict; they are almost never summarized by classes, by 
schools, or for the system as a whole. 
Without published reports for the system and without 
summaries for the several schools, except on enrollment 
and attendance, we were thrown back for the needed 
educational data on the original records of the register 
teachers, and such reports as could be procured through 
regular class teachers. The task of collecting the needed 
data, most of them from pupil record sheets, was a pro- 
digious one, often complicated by the incompleteness of the 
records and by differences which had to be reconciled. 
For example, different reports on class enrollment did 
not agree; the age and grade of pupils as given by the 
register teacher and by the class teacher were often at 
variance; similarly with reports on the length of time 
children had been in the Gary schools.

METHODS OF CoMPUTING OvER AGE AND DIFFERENCES 
IN RESULTS 
There are a number of recognized methods of com- 
puting age-grade status, notably those developed and
-P-A-G-E-267
  APPENDIX 213 
employed by Ayres,! Strayer,? and Bachman.? Inas- 
much as these methods yield different results, all three 
were employed in computing the age-grade status of the 
Gary children. 
The age-grade status of the Gary children necuTTnog 
to these methods is as follows: 
  
  
PER CENT. PER CENT. | PER CENT. 
  — UNDER AGE | NORMAL AGE OVER AGE 
Pyros 2501 fs Wag ate 42 33 25 
Strayer! diode 8 67 | 25 
IBachinane: 7 ca 22 40 | 38   
1The ages of the children were taken as of June 23, and the status determined before 
promotion. 
2For details, see Table XXXVII, Appendix D, page 254A. 
The fact that the reported age-grade status of chil- 
dren differs according to the method of computation 
employed would not be so important if there were at 
hand for each method an abundance of reliable compara- 
ble data. Unfortunately, such data are exceedingly 
meager. 
For example, Ayres computed in ro1r the age-grade 
status of the children in twenty nine American cities.4 
When first published, these data were excellent for com- 
parative purposes, but they are now largely antiquated. 
To illustrate, Ayres reported in 1911 48 per cent. of over

age at Montclair, N. J., whereas the official report for 
1915-16 shows only 16 per cent. Similarly, in 1911 
Ayres gave the over age at Racine, Wisconsin, as 28 
per cent., whereas Racine reports for 1915-16 only 11 
per cent. Moreover, the reports of cities where Ayres’ 
method is now employed reveal so many variations in 
application, such as time of taking the agesof thechildren, 
time of determining the status of the children, and the 
like, that a diligent search failed to uncover compara- 
tive data that could be used with safety. 
With the help of the Michigan study of 1915,! the 
situation with respect to comparable data for Strayer’s 
method is better. It should, however, be kept in mind 
that these data are for a single state, also that the ages 
of the Michigan children are for their last birthday prior 
to December, whereas the ages of the Gary children are 
as of June 23d. The effect of this is to augment the 
amount of Gary over age—just how much we do not 
know. The age-grade status of the children in the 
Michigan cities that might be compared with Gary is as 
follows:

mentary Schools of Two Hundred Twenty-five Towns and Cities of

*In case of continued absence, the child is marked absent until the end of the month, when he is recorded as withdrawn. — This is in contrast to the practice of dropping chil- dren from the active roll after three days of continuous absence.

1Enrollment includes all pupils on register in grades 2 to 8 at the end of the year, except 
40 of unknown length of enrollment. The first grade was excluded because in some cases, 
where pupils were promoted from the kindergarten, the record of enrollment included 
the days both for the kindergarten and the higher grade, but quite as frequently account was taken only of the days in the first grade. Eight hundred and eighty-eight first grade 
pupils were thus eliminated; the cards showed, however, that 573 were enrolled the entire 
year of 200 days. Withdrawals were excluded because there was no way of telling, in most cases, whether they entered early or late.

The REPORTS issued by the Board are official accounts of its ac- 
tivities and expenditures. The STUDIES represent work in the field 
of educational investigation and research which the Board has made 
possible by appropriations defraying all or part of the expense involved. 
The OCCASIONAL PAPERS are essays on matters of current edu- 
cational discussion, presenting topics of immediate interest from vari- 
ous points of view. In issuing the STUDIES and OCCASIONAL 
PAPERS, the Board acts simply as publisher, assuming no responsibil 
ity for the opinions of the authors.

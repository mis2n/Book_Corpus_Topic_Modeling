FOREWORD. 
By CHAS, E. DOWMAN, D.D., 
Ex-President Emory College, Oxford. 
The negro is with us, much has been said and writ- 
ten, but the last word has not yet been spoken, for 
“nothing is settled, till it is settled right.” After the 
strife of words and the ebullition of passion, right and 
truth will remain. No doubt, much that was unwise 
and untrue has been said. Men have discussed this 
question from the viewpoint of prejudice, passion, and 
personal interest as well as from sincere, though often 
misdirected philanthropy. But many of the highest 
minds have carefully considered this problem; some 
are still seeking for a solution; others have thought 
it through, and from their premises have reached a 
conclusion. ~ 
Dr, Willis B. Parks, the author of the essay which 
closes this volume, has rendered a service to the think- 
ing public by collecting and putting in permanent form 
the mature thought of some of the leading men of both 
races, as well as by his own contribution to the dis- 
cussion of this question. The study of the negro from 
a psychological standpoint, gives promise of a better 
understanding of the peculiarities of his character and 
conduct that have been difficult to explain, and fur- 
nishes valuable suggestions of more intelligent meth- 
ods for his improvement. The author, with scientific 
candor and firmness, seeks to check any tendency to- 
ward dehumanizing the negro by showing from the 
application of the principles of psychology that he is 
“not a beast,” but a man.

2 FOREWORD. 
The eloquent and big-hearted Henry W. Grady, and 
the concise and brilliant John Temple Graves, need 
no introduction or commendation. The pure and pa- 
_ triotic William J. Northen enjoys the confidence of 
all races and sections. 
The masterful bishop of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, South, Warren A. Candler, pleads for justice 
toward the negro as opposed to the mob. The ear- 
nest and observant bishop of the African Methodist 
Church, Henry M. Turner, agrees that this question 
can only be settled by the separation of the races, and 
Rev. L. H. Holsey, D.D., the eloquent and big- 
hearted bishop of the Colored M. E. Church, pleads 
for the segregation of the race in some portion of our 
national domain. 
Richard H. Edmonds, editor of the “Manufacturers’ 
Record,” an astute man of business, holds that if wily 
politicians and sentimental philanthropists will let this 
problem alone, the two races will probably work out 
its solution. / 
Many say they are tired of this discussion—but cer- 
tain things are true: The negro is here, and here to 
stay, and so long as there is the want of perfect ad- 
justment between him and the white race, there will 
be the problem, and so long as there is a problem, there 
will be a discussion. 
The position of the negro race is more critical now, 
than at any former period of its history. During the 
time immediately succeeding emancipation, there was 
a kindly and sympathetic relation between the white 
people of the South and their former slaves. But 
with the passing of the old masters and the old serv- 
ants, with the coming of generations who know noth- 
ing of the sentiments of affection and gratitude grow- 
ing out of the relations of domestic slavery, and who 
have been reared under the influence of passion on ~\

the one side and suspicion on the other, it was inevi- 
table that the races should drift apart. 
The Southern white man has easily lost confidence 
in the negro. The increase of crime, the comparative 
failure of education, the frequent divorcement of re- 
ligion from morality, the menace to the safety of the 
home and of innocent women from the rapist have 
turned the feelings of many white men from sym- 
pathetic helpfulness to strained toleration. 
It would be putting the case very mildly to say that 
the negro’s most enthusiastic friends in the North are 
disappointed in him. His moral and social progress 
has not been what they expected as a result of their 
investment of money and help. The laboring classes 
of the North will not admit him. The doors of social 
life are closed against him. Since the Southern States 
have, as a matter of self-preservation, practically elimi- 
nated him from politics, whose affection for “the man 
and brother” was prompted by self-interest, has no 
further use for him. 
With the North indifferent and the South unsympa- 
thetic, the negro would be crushed between the upper 
and the nether millstone. But his future is in his own 
hands. Content with his civil liberty, enjoying educa- 
tional advantages at the cost of his white neighbors, 
with a fair field for his industry, not excluded from 
the ranks of skilled labor, with the fields, the forests, 
the mines of the South, begging for him with the 
monopoly of domestic service, he is in position to 
make rapid progress in the accumulation of property, 
the building of homes, and in the elevation of his so- 
cial condition. 
The South will not have him as a social equal nor 
as a political master, but she needs him, and wants him 
as a powerful factor in her industrial prosperity. His 
labor augments her wealth, his growing demand for
-P-A-G-E-7
4 FOREWORD. 
the necessity of civilized life makes a market for her 
products, his increase of population gives proportion- 
ate influence in national legislation. 
‘Bishop Galloway, one of the most eloquent preach- 
ers of the Methodist church, said in a public address 
a few months ago, that when the negro left the South 
he would go with him, and the utterance was received 
with enthusiastic applause. 
The South is willing to give the negro a chance. As 
the ward of the nation he has been spoiled; as the 
football of demagogues he has been corrupted. As” 
the pet of sentimental philanthropists he has been 
placed in a false and dangerous position. As the prey 
of the avaricious, his vices have been fostered for their 
gain. 
What the future has for him depends on himself. 
The sky is clearing. The views of all sections and 
parties are coming nearer together. The wisest men 
of the negro race are recognizing the time basis of his 
salvation. His best friends, who are among the white 
people of the South, are ready to help him under prac- 
tical ways. 
What shall we do with him shall no longer be dis- 
cussed. With equality before the law, with equity in 
business, with sympathy in all his efforts to better his 
condition on all proper lines, instead of being a 
menace to our safety, a disturbing element in our 
politics, and a peril to himself, he may become a race 
unit in our great cosmopolitan national life, “sepa- 
rate as the billows, but not as the sea,” and under the 
benign influence of the gospel of the Son of man, our 
civilization may show the possibility of which has been 
declared impossible—a superior and an inferior race 
living and working together in true harmony and co- 
operation.

THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 
By JOHN TEMPLE GRAVES. 
(Chicago University Speech.) 
Mr: President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
Permit me in the beginning to acknowledge the 
courtesy which gives me access to a platform so noble 
and to an audience so distinguished as this. 
All sections of our common country pay tribute to 
the merit and equipment of this splendid University. 
Its work is playing a mighty part in the educational 
uplift of the times. Its record has been notable among 
the forces which have given us a reunited country. 
The State and the section from which I come have 
made their yearly vital contribution to its student- 
roll, and the superb beneficence of the founder, joined 
to the noble liberality of citizens of Chicago, and to 
the consecrated talent and attainments of its faculty, 
have made an institution so virile in life, so compre- 
hensive in character, and so national in scope that it 
has come, while yet in early youth, to be the alma 
mater of the sections and the pride of the republic. 
Fortunate am J, and happy, in that I bring the con- 
victions of this hour to a platform so free, and to an 
atmosphere so impartial. Questions of abstract policy 
—problems of humanity—bearing a hint of section or 
a complication of party are not for the ears of faction 
or for the passions of politics. Upon the fierce and 
heated bosom of established prejudice the cold stream 
of reason falls too frequently to steam and hissing, and

men who have convictions that are rather definite 
than popular, may thank God for the calmer air of 
universities, and fer the clear and unbiased minds of 
students seeking truth. It is here, and here only, that 
problems of duty and of destiny can find a fair hear- 
ing and a free solution in the tranquil temper and un- 
fettered vision of republican youth. 
Upon this dear presumption I hasten to my work. 
The problem which I bring to you to-day is yours 
as well as mine. Whoever you are, and from what- 
ever section you come, the problem is yours—inherited 
from the fathers and handed down to the sons—with 
complications. increasing so rapidly, and difficulties 
multiplying so fast that every instinct of prudence, 
and every suggestion of safety plead for its prompt 
and full consideration, while it may yet be solved—a 
problem for the whole country, because it can not be 
settled by a section ; and a problem for this generation, 
because in this generation it must inevitably reach its 
crisis and advance in promise or decline in evil pre- 
sage to its conclusion. 
The thinkers of the Old World, from Gladstone and 
Bismarck, through James Bryce and Arthur Balfour, 
to Chamberlain and Crispi, viewing our country from 
the vantage ground of distance, have with one voice 
proclaimed this the first and foremost problem of our 
national life. 
The thinkers of our own world, who see the prob- 
lem clearly, are appalled at the comprehensive danger 
of its elements, and amazed at the apathy of their 
countrymen toward it. 
Will you bear with me, then, while I state this prob- 
lem briefly and as fairly as I can? 
The Civil War of the sixties was the tragedy of the 
nineteenth century. Its real cause dated back to con- 
stitutional constructions, and to the irrepressible con-
-P-A-G-E-10
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 7 
flict over the nature of the compact framed by the 
fathers. Its provoking incident, its precipitating 
cause, was slavery. 
A republic of white men, living in a country de- 
veloped and established by sturdy colonists of the 
Anglo-Saxon race, prospering under a constitution 
framed by white men—for the author of the Declara- 
tion was a slaveholder—flourishing magnificently un- 
der institutions molded by their united brains, ce- 
mented by their common blood, and sanctified by their 
common patriotism—fell at outs over a black man 
brought from savage Africa and sold from trading 
ships to bondage and slavery, first in Massachusetts, 
and afterwards in the South. We do not halt here to 
wrangle over the mooted responsibility of his bring- 
ing, or the causes of his subsequent concentration in 
one section of the country. He came, he drifted, and 
he divided us. Agitators, sincere but passionate. 
raised the question of his liberty. The sections divided 
in interest and sentiment upon the issue, and over his 
black body brethren of a white race and of a common 
glorious heritage went to war. 
Of equal valor, but of unequal numbers, the men 
of the North and the men of the South grappled for 
four years at each other’s throats; and for this black 
man of Africa the white men of America sacrificed a 
million heroic lives and spent $12,000,000,000 of their 
money. 
Whether it were worth the colossal sacrifice, his- 
tory, and one hundred thousand broken homes, must 
in time declare. And whether the sacrifice were vain 
and profitless, history and the unsolved problem must 
also say. 
From the unequal contest one section emerged vic- 
torious, and the other section lingered solemn and 
broken in defeat.
-P-A-G-E-11
8 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 
The first act of the victor was to free the slaves. 
The next act of the victor was to make the black man, 
just now a slave, a citizen and the equal of his master. 
There were four million black men then. There are 
nine million now, and seven million in the South, 
Here, then, the equations start: 
Two opposite, unequal, and antagonistic races are 
set side by side for government and destiny. One of 
these, by the record, is the strongest race on earth; 
the other, by the record, is the weakest race on earth. 
One, a race whose achievements make, in large part, 
the history of the world; the other, a race which, in 
all its annals, has written no history, built no monu- 
ments, made no books, and recorded no achievement, 
and whose only progress has been from contact with 
the stronger race. One, a race, proud, progressive, 
dominant, and historically free; the other, a race that 
came out of centuries of savagery into centuries of 
slavery, and was transplanted in one tropical and un- 
natural night from barbarism and slavery into liberty 
and full equality. One, a live, vital, twentieth-century 
race, pulsing the hope and progress of the world; the 
other, a race without a record, undeveloped, untrained. 
but lately slaves, and at the utmost a seventh-century 
civilization. 
There they are—master and slave, civilized and 
half-civilized, strong and weak, conquering and servile, 
twentieth-century and seventh-century— thirteen hun- 
dred years apart—set by a strange and incomprehen- 
sible edict of statesmanship or of passion, set by the 
constitution and the law, the weakest race on earth 
and the strongest race on earth, side by side, on equal 
terms to bear an equal part in the conduct and re- 
sponsibility of the greatest government the world ever 
saw!
-P-A-G-E-12
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 9 
It was an experiment without a precedent in history, 
and without a promise in the annals of man. 
Impracticable in abstract form, the proposition is 
rendered impossible by its complications. The mias- 
ter race keenly resents the sudden elevation and the 
forced equality of their slaves. The victorious section 
eagerly demands the trial, and desires the success of 
its experiment. The master race, from long contact 
and close association, carries the ineradicable convic- 
tion of the inherent and incurable inferiority and in- 
capacity of the black man. The victor section, rea- 
soning from abstract philanthropy at the distance of a 
thousand miles, cherishes a fixed faith in the unity 
of race and the equality of man. Sectional jealousies 
compass the experiment with bitterness. Partisah 
politics complicate it with selfish schemes. Frequent 
crimes and recurring violence distort it with passion. 
And behind it all, openly confessed in one section, and 
only half denied in the other section, there lives and 
breathes in both races and in all sections, the deep, un- 
circumscribed, and apparently ineradicable prejudice of 
opposite races, which renders union and sympathy and 
full co-operation hopeless and out of the question for- 
ever. 
So that the problem is one of irreconcilable ele- 
ments. It is one of impossible conditions. Stated in 
a sentence, this is the problem: How the strongest of 
races and the weakest of races, thirteen hundred years 
apart in civilization, unequal in history and develop- 
ment, incongruous, unassimilable and inherently an- 
tagonistic, tossed between party schemes and sectional 
jealousies, irritated by racial conflicts and misled by 
mistaken philanthropy, can live on equal terms under 
exactly the same laws, and share on equal terms in 
the same government-—when no other races, opposite 
and antagonistic, have ever shared, in peace and tran-

10 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 
quility, since the world began, any country or any 
government created by God or fashioned by man. 
This is the question that the times are called to an- 
swer. This is the riddle that the twentieth century is 
asked to read. This is the experiment that the tem- 
porizing statesmanship of a civil revolution has forced 
upon the age. 
The statement of the proposition carries its condem- 
nation, and the equations must be changed before the 
problem can be solved. 
The experiment has had thirty-eight years of trial, 
backed by the power of the federal government and 
by the sympathy of the world. It has failed. From 
the beginning to the hour that holds us, it has failed. 
The races are wider apart and more antagonistic than 
they were in 1865. There is less of sympathy and 
more of tension than the races have known since the 
terrible days of reconstruction made chaos in the 
South. The Fifteenth Amendment is practically re- 
pealed. In nearly every State of his numerical habita- 
tion, the negro is disfranchised under the forms of 
law. In all the States where his ballot is a menace 
to white supremacy, it is restrained. With all these 
years, and all these forces at his back, there has been 
an utter failure to establish the negro in a satisfactory 
and self-reliant position under the law. Four decades 
after his emancipation he is in point of fact less a free- 
man and infinitely less a citizen than he wag in 1868. 
The tumult of the times about ug proclaim the con- 
tinued existence and the unreconciled equations of 
the problem that he makes; and in the common judg- 
ment of mankind the legend, FAILURE, is written 
large and lowering above the tottering fabric of his 
civil rights. 
And yet the experiment goes on. Unchanging and 
unlearning, the republic gropes in solemn stupidity, in
-P-A-G-E-14
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES, It 
helpless apathy, in misguided philanthropy, through 
ceaseless complications and hopeless precedent to the 
hopeless and preordained conclusion. The experiment 
goes on. 
I ask you, men and women of this University, to 
consider with me the difficulties which this vast prob- 
lem entails, and the mighty reasons which, for the 
sake of both races, sternly and imperatively require its 
solution. 
To the white man this problem means division. It 
imperils national unity. It always has done so. It 
always will do so. From the Philadelphia conven- 
tion to the present hour the negro has always been 
a bone of contention. North, East and West, the sec- 
tions tolerate in tranquility divisions of trade and sen- 
timent, and clasp hands everywhere without suspicion 
or distrust. But a Chinese wall of prejudice shuts 
out the South on this question from the sympathy 
of the American people, and although fraternal plati- 
tudes may cross it, and political affiliations may scale 
it, and commercial interchange may run its electric 
wires under and above it, and although but recently 
military loyalty has seemed to shatter it, this wall 
stangls, in the sight of God and of nations, and hedges~ 
in the South as a separate and peculiar people, hin- 
dered with misapprehension, held aloof in prejudice, 
and fretted by a criticism which, if sometimes founded 
in philanthropy, is too often expressed in passién and 
answered in bitterness. 
And so long as the problem stands the old slave 
States of the South, unwillingly, protestingly, despair- 
ingly, and yet inevitably, must be, and will be, the 
continuing gap in the magnificent line of our national 
unity. 
To the white man of the South the problem hampers 
its material development. It halts our growth. By
-P-A-G-E-15
12 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 
the records of the census it frightens immigration 
from industrial competition with the negro. It largely 
deters capital from investment in the shadow of an 
unsolved problem. It makes a standard of labor that 
prejudices all our Southern poor against menial but 
honorable service. It depresses agriculture on the 
farms and property in the suburbs, and drives all who 
can afford the change to the safety afforded by prox- 
imity and police protection in the cities. The South 
is unequaled in the fotir great basic raw materials of 
coal, iron, cotton and lumber. And yet, while $100,- 
000,000 of our money goes yearly to Europe at 4 per 
cent., these great fields are scantily developed. And 
thus, while one great section of our country is halted 
in development, the free movement of men and money 
in all sections is hindered toward the inviting field of 
opportunity. 
It is a problem of moral decay. It demoralizes pol- 
itics. Wherever a black supremacy is threatened 
through a black majority the black ballot is strangled 
without reserve in the black hands that hold it against 
the safety of the State. This is wrong. It is illegal. 
It is monstrous. But it is true. It is true in Georgia. 
It is true in South Carolina. Aye, and it would be 
true in Massachusetts and in Illinois. Put yourself, 
men of Illinois, in the place of the people you perhaps 
condemn. Suppose that by the steady drift of emi- 
gration the negro had come from the South to be a 
majority in every congressional district, in every legis- 
lative precinct, and in every municipal ward of Illinois. 
_ Suppose that, realizing this majority, he had organ- 
ized to utilize it. Suppose that you looked forward, in 
the next election, not only to the probability, but to 
the absolute certainty, that the next governor of Illi- 
nois would be a negro; that you would have two 
negroes in the United States Senate to take the places
-P-A-G-E-16
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 13 
of Hopkins and of Cullom; that you would have a 
solid negro delegation in Congress; a legislature at 
Springfield looking like a blackbird pie; negro judges 
on the bench; negro solicitors in your courts; negro 
mayors in your chairs, and a negro policeman on your 
streets—Iet me ask you, man of Illinois, with your 
pride in the past glories, and your confidence in the 
future achievements of your historic State—let me ask 
you, if, in the shadow of this threat and danger, the 
streets of Springfield and Chicago, and the woods and 
prairies of Illinois, would not be filled with eager 
white men asking how the South suppressed the ne- 
gro vote? 
And will you answer that frank question, man of 
Illinois, or man of Massachusetts, like an honest Cau- 
casian, and like an Anglo-Saxon gentleman? 
But the stern and solemn necessity does not cure 
the moral stain. The deadliest influence that can com- 
pass a popular government is in the decay of the spirit 
that hedges the ballot with sanctity. The ballot is 
the palladium of our liberties. The ballot is sacred. 
A crime against the ballot is a stab at the constitution, 
and the necessity which makes the ballot the 
sport of conditions must be removed if the re- 
public shall survive. And yet the problem shows no 
promise on this line. We might as well be honest 
here. We might as well face stern facts with fearless 
frankness. I do not say it is right. I know it is wrong. 
I do not defend. I do not justify. I do not argue it 
at all. But I am simply here to tell you plainly, defi- 
nitely, resolutely, from the fulness and certainty of 
knowledge, that which you already know, and that 
which, under reversed conditions, you would unques- 
tionably endorse—that there will never come a change 
in these suppressions while these conditions last. 
Never, never in a thousand years will the negro,
-P-A-G-E-17
14 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES, 
North or South, be allowed to govern in this republic, 
even where his majorities are plain. We might as well 
fix this fact in our minds to stay. No statute can 
eradicate, no public opinion can remove, no armed 
force can overthrow, the inherent, invincible, inde- 
structible, and, if you will, the unscrupulous capacity 
and determination of the Anglo-Saxon race to rule. 
It is only the knife of surgery that can cure this 
‘poison in the body and the bones of politics. Under 
the shadow of the problem our politics must, and will, 
be stained. 
Good government at this point, and wherever this 
black ballot is counted, is threatened, too, in its integ- 
rity by the growing numbers and the increasing ve- 
nality of this mercenary and irresponsible and ever- . 
purchasable vote, prolific of corruption, balancing be- 
tween factions, and holding the mighty power of de- 
cision in tremendous issues at the beck of a tribe or 
the swell of a savage prejudice. 
The problem also throttles political independence in 
the South. We have been ready there for years to 
divide on party lines. We do not dare to do it. ‘With 
the white race divided, the negro is held up once more 
to the ballot-box and becomes the balance of power in 
the policies of the time. We have our separate and 
divergent convictions on economic issues. We crush 
these under the iron heel of necessity. We have our 
‘varying interests that would naturally be expressed 
in opposing politics. We sacrifice these material is- 
:sues to the greater stake. And the great people of the 
South, dominated and solidified by the fear of this 
tunwholesome balance, are whipped, protesting, into 
line behind expediency, and forced to compulsory 
union in a single party. The education of the hustings, 
the friction of ideas, the vigilant watchfulness of jeal- 
ous ‘partisanship, and the political liberty of the
-P-A-G-E-18

thinker and of the voter, are all lost in the shadow of 
the somber apprehension. 
In a land of light and liberty, in an age of enlight- 
enment and law, the women of the South are prison- 
ers to danger and fear. While your women may walk 
from suburb to suburb, and from township to town- 
ship, without escort and without alarm, there is not a 
woman of the South, wife or daughter, who would be 
permitted, or who would dare to walk at twilight un- 
guarded through the residence streets of a populous 
town, or to ride tlre outside highways at midday. The 
terror of the twilight deepens with the darkness, and 
in the rural regions every farmer leaves his home with 
apprehension in the morning and thanks God when 
he comes from the fields at evening to find all well 
with the women of his home. For behind the preju- 
dice of race stalks the fiend of lust, and behind the 
rapist thunders the mob—engine of vengeance, mon- 
strous, lawless, deplorable, but, under the uncured de- 
fects of the law the fiery terror of the criminal and 
the chief defense of woman. 
This is also a problem of justice. Fair as our de- 
signs, and equitable as our verdicts, as tested by the 
highest courts, the prejudice of race inevitably poisons 
law and tempts justice, from the jury’s box to the 
judge’s bench. 
It is a problem of religious unity—separating breth- 
ren and dividing usefulness. For more than one great 
religious body in this country, cherishing a common 
creed, believing in one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
are sundered and set in separate and sectional camps 
by the clash of convictions here. 
It is a problem of numbers. Four million slaves 
were freed. There are nine million negroes now. 
The problem grows in difficulty with marvelously in- 
creasing numbers, and is magnified in vitality by de- 
Jay. If antagonisms, now so fundamental, are not

softened ; if prejudices, now so serious, are not healed, 
then the future darkens, and we shall enter with 
swollen numbers upon a period of strife and wrangle, 
in whose perils our present troubles will not be remem- 
bered. Optimism is easy. Optimism is popular. But 
the logic of conditions is ominous with warning, and 
it is braver to be honest and wiser to be prepared. 
Here, then, the issues: Unity of the republic, ma- 
terial development, purity of politics, political inde- 
pendence, respect for the ballot, reverence for the con- 
stitution, the safety of our homes, the sanctity of our 
women, the supremacy of law, the sacredness of jus- 
tice, the integrity of race, and the unity of the church. 
There is not a phase of our civilization, there is not 
a principle of our race, there is not a fundamental of 
society, that is not wrapped in the hopeless tangie 
which this problem weaves. 
These are difficulties which compass the white man 
of the South. Heaven knows they are serious enough. 
But what of the negro? It would be cruel and un- 
kind to cast up the balances of this great account with- 
out considering him. I speak the representative senti- 
ment of the South when I say that we would not come 
to the consideration of this tremendous issue without 
a high and humane consideration for the negro. How 
does the problem come to him, and what does the 
future hold? 
“Will the white man permit the negro to have an 
equal part in the industrial, political, social and civil 
advantages of the United States?” This, as I under- 
stand it, is the question which involves his life and 
destiny. : 
These words come from a negro—the wisest, the 
most thoughtful, and the most eloquent negro of his 
time—-as discreet as Washington, a deeper thinker, 
and a much more eloquent man. But for one hour of
-P-A-G-E-20

the Atlanta exposition, Council, of Huntsville, might 
stand to-day where Washington, of Tuskegee stands— 
as the recognized leader of his race. 
This question, asked by Council, as the deliberate 
representative of his people, is the core of the negro 
problem. 
The answer to it is in every white man’s heart, even 
if it does not lie openly on every white man’s lips. It 
may be expressed in diplomacy; it may be veiled in 
indirection ; it may be softened in philanthropy ; it may 
be guarded in politic utterance, and oftenest of all, it 
is restrained by ultra conservatism and personal tim- 
idity. But wherever the answer to this vital question 
comes, stripped of verbiage and indirection, it rings 
like a martial bugle in the single syllable—“No!” 
This may not be right, but it is honest. It may 
not be just, but it is evident. It may not be politic, 
but it is a great, glaring, indisputable, indestructible 
fact. North and South, the answer, wherever it is 
honest, is the same. I agree with Albion Tourgee 
that there are not ten thousand men in the republic 
who can answer that question in the affirmative. 
Council knows the answer and states it with the cour- 
age of aman. Bishop Turner knows it; Bishop Hol- 
sey knows it; Bryden and Bruce and Taylor knew it; 
the Chicago papers know it; I think that Booker T. 
Washington knows it sadly in his heart, and I believe 
that every thoughtful gentleman who strips theory 
from the bare form of fact knows it—here and every- 
where. 
This is from first to last a race problem. It is an 
isstie of race and not of politics. It is a thing of skin 
and type, and not of section or condition. It is a part 
of the universal problem. The history of man has 
been written in a race antagonism and in race separa- 
tion. The Hebrew and Egyptian, the Jew and the 
2ns
-P-A-G-E-21
18 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES, 
Gentile, the Turk and the Christian, Magyar and Hun- 
garian, Venetian and Moor, Mexican and Texan, ne- 
gro and Chinaman, white man and Indian—the repul- 
sion is the same. 
A thousand years have not removed the prejudice 
against the Jew, who is the aristocrat of history. How 
then shall the negro hope to conquer where the Jew 
has failed?" This race prejudice has no sectional lines. 
It is heid in no geographical boundaries. Every issue 
of the leading negro papers published in the North 
reeks with protest against the discriminations exer- 
cised throughout the North against the negro race. 
Boston, the metropolis of abolition, will not employ 
negroes in the department stores. Nor will Chicago. 
The Boston “Globe” received a formal social protest 
against the employment of a negro reporter on its 
local: staff. The sister’s son of Wendell Phillips, rich 
with the evangel blood of emancipation, refused to 
associate with a negro in Harvard University. Fred 
Douglas in his last speech declared that only one white 
man in all the ranks of the abolitionists had ever per- 
mitted him to forget in his presence that he was a 
negro. There are 40,000 negroes in Ohio, Pennsyl- 
vania and New York. Where is the office that they 
hold, or the station of trust and profit that they fill? 
In Mr. Crumpacker’s State of Indiana they lynch ne- 
groes almost as frequently and upon much less provo- 
cation than in Georgia. A riot raised on race preju- 
dice reddened the central avenues of New York. Chi- 
cago citizens chased a negro through the central 
streets, ready with a rope to visit capital punishment 
for theft. Boston elected a negro by accident to her 
common council, and then offered him $10,000 to re- 
move his offensive color from the chamber in which 
he served. 
Race prejudice is as old as the world, and as ever-
-P-A-G-E-22
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 19 
lasting as the hills, and this prejudice—deep, uncircum- 
scribed and uneradicable—sits like a shadow on the 
future of the weaker race. It makes the core of his 
problem, and it answers Council’s earnest question 
with an inexorable “No!” 
Under this prejudice the negro can never, North 
or South, be received in equal social and personal 
relations with the families of the white race, and can 
never, therefore, be a social equal with the white man. 
Under this prejudice he will never, North or South, 
be permitted to govern in any Staté or country, even 
where he has a majority, and he can never, therefore, 
be a political equal. 
If he can have, then, neither social nor political 
equality—-and every fact and all theory and all in- 
stinct and every unbroken precedent declare that he 
‘can not—then he can never under these conditions 
reach the full development of a citizen or the full 
stature of a man. If he remains in this country, he 
must remain as an inferior, and his suffrage becomes 
a mockery and_his liberty a farce. 
It is a problem for the negro, because he can never 
compete with Anglo-Saxon civilization. Once more 
I recall that his is the weakest and ours the strongest 
race on earth. Our majority is 60,000,000, and we 
have a thousand years the start of him. No race has 
ever competed successfully with the Saxon, and where 
is the hope of the negro? In politics, in society, in 
industry and in trade there is no well-founded hope 
for the inferior race. History without a break, and 
precedent without a variation, proclaim this to be true. 
‘There is not a line of light or promise of equality for 
him in any field. 
This is the core of my contention—the basis of my 
argument. All our splendid platitudes are wrecked on 
this stern fact. All our brave philanthropies beat out
-P-A-G-E-23
20 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES, 
their beautiful lives on this inexorable truth. The ne- 
gro fronts a hopeless and unequal competition! 
There he stands, that helpless and unfortunate in- 
ferior. For his sake the one difference has widened 
between the sections of our common country. Over 
his black body we have shed rivers of blood and treas- 
ure to emphasize our separate convictions of his des- 
tiny. And yet, as the crimson tide rolls away into the 
years, we realize that all this blood and treasure and 
travail was spent in vain, and that the negro, whom a 
million Americans died to free, is in present bond and 
future promise still a slave, whipped by circumstance,. 
trodden under foot by iron and ineradicable prejudice ; 
shut out forever from the opportunities which are the 
heritage of liberty, and holding in his black hand the 
hollow parchment of his franchise as a free man, looks 
through a slave’s eyes at the impassable barriers whic 
imprison him forever within the progress and achieve- 
ment of a dominant and all-conquering race. 
By the whole unbroken record of Anglo-Saxon his- 
tory, I swear that this is true. 
Two things seem clear, then, in relation to the race 
problem, In its present status it compasses the pro- 
gress of the white man with demoralization and diffi- 
culty that puts his very civilization in peril and dis- 
repute. 
In its present status it wraps the negro’s destiny in 
unequal competition and leaves him helpless under 
the weight of a prejudice universal, unlifting, un- 
changing, and overwhelming. 
Shall this experiment go on? 
Will education soften these conditions and bring 
the experiment to success? Serious thinkers deeply 
question this. By the record of the census, the negro’s. 
criminality has increased as his illiteracy has de- 
creased, and his race antagonism has grown with his
-P-A-G-E-24
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 21 
intelligence. Education brings light, and light per- 
ception, and with quickened faculties the negro sees 
the difference between his real and his constitutional 
status in the republic. He sees that neither worth nor 
merit nor attainment can overcome the world-wide 
repulsion of type and color; and, seeing this, he is 
moved to rebellious protest and sometimes to violent 
revenge. Education spoils the laborer and makes in- 
evitably, and logically, and laudably, the aspirant for 
social and political equalities which have been, and 
will be, forever denied him by the ruling race. Edu- 
cation develops wants which can not be supplied, and 
aspirations which never can be met. Industrial edu- 
cation will not win where mental education has failed 
The hand is not greater than the head. Industrial 
competition will make a sterner struggle with the su- 
perior people. The battle of the loaf will be the dead- 
Tiest and most destructive contest of the races. 
Will the formal repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment 
‘cut the core from the political problem, and develop 
peace? I do not think so. The elimination of the 
negro from politics would remove him from strife and 
wrangle, and destroy the sectional bitterness with 
which his history has divided the republic. But it 
would cut hope and motive and ambition from his 
horizon, and leave him sunken and degraded, with 
nothing to live for but his creature comfort and his 
lust. 
Will religion heal the problem and lose the preju- 
dice of race in the brotherhood of man? Not this 
side of the millennium—not before the coming of 
Christ—will human nature undergo the regeneration 
that will bring this result to pass. If the spirit of 
Christ could pervade the world—if the devil of preju- 
dice could be held in bondage for a thousand years— 
when the world is the new heaven; when man is every-
-P-A-G-E-25
22 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES, 
where the image of his Maker—these things may then 
be solved in the alembic of religion. But “ifs” are in- 
tangible, “whens” are immaterial, and both are millen- 
nial. For when these “ifs” are materialized into 
“is’es,” and the “whens” are crystallized into “nows,” 
then, indeed, this corruptible shall have put on incor- 
ruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality 
in the land where prejudice is ended and problems 
have no place. 
’ Can the strong race lift up the weaker to its level? 
Not in contact, not in proximity. Never. In the long, 
slow process the higher would inevitably sink nearer 
to the level of the lower race. Inferior races absorb 
the vices rather than the virtues of the superior race. 
The Hawaiian has degenerated in health and morals 
by contact with the English-speaking race. The 
‘Turanian and Tasmanian races perished by contact 
with higher civilization. The Maoris and New Zeal- 
anders suffered so, and the noble red man is to-day a 
besotted wretch perishing in the white heat of a civil- 
ization for which he was never designed. Not in 
equal relations, not side by side, can the higher race 
reform the lower. Apart and separate. by missionary 
and evangel, by example and by counsel, we may help 
an inferior race to be helpful, self-reliant, and free. 
But not under the shadow of our robust and stalwart 
sins, or under the iron weight of our all-conquering 
evils. History stamps discouragement on the theory 
everywhere, : 
May God keep this great Caucasian people from 
the poison of a “mongrel” blood! 
Is there any other remedy? Is there any other balm 
in Gilead? Is there any healing here? Not within 
my vision, and not within the records of experience. 
Try all these remedies, test them all as they have alt 
been tested and mocked in the trials of the years. Try
-P-A-G-E-26
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 23 
any new remedy that wisdom or quackery may pro- 
pose. And when we have tried them all, and have 
failed in all, as we are failing and will forever fail, it 
may be that Almighty God, the last imminent factor 
in the destiny of nations, will strike the scales from 
our blinded eyes and lead us by elimination and higher 
logic to see the remedy—the only remedy—His 
remedy. 
For on the single occasion when the skies were 
parted for light upon the problem of the wrangling 
races, Almighty God reached down to Egypt and by 
the definite way of separation, led by the Jews, His 
chosen people, over seas of difficulty and through 
wildernesses of doubt to their promised land. 
Separation of the races is the way—the only way. 
If God “hath made of one blood all the nations of the 
earth,” He hath also “established unto them the metes 
and bounds of their habitation!” He did not intend 
that opposite and antagonistic races should live to- 
gether. The prejudice of race is a pointing of provi- 
dence, and the antagonism of peoples is the fixed 
policy by which God peoples the different portions of 
the universe and establishes the individuality of the 
nations, The act that brought these people together 
on this continent was a sin of the fathers—a sin of 
greed, an iniquity of trade—and the sorrow and suffer- 
ing of the present is for the sin of the past, a sin 
against nature, and a sin against God. The curse can 
be lifted only when nature is vindicated and God is 
obeyed. The problem will he solved only when the 
negro is restored to the “bounds of his habitation.” 
The wisdom of our wise men has fallen in line with 
the wisdom of the Almighty. Some of the greatest 
names and greatest hearts in all our history have 
thought and said that separation was the logical, the 
inevitable, the only solution. Daniel Webster said so.
-P-A-G-E-27
24 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 
Thomas Jefferson said so, most definitely and elo- 
quently. Edward Everett said so. James Madison 
said so. Henry Clay believed and said it. Twice in 
his glorious and illustrious lifetime, Abraham Lin- 
coln, who did not believe in the negro as a citizen and 
a voter, moved in his public station toward a definite 
plan of separation. By the sending of Thomas For- 
tune to the Philippines, President Roosevelt is, infer- 
entially at least, in consideration of a similar plan. 
Henry Grady believed in it. Bishop Turner is its open 
advocate. Blyden and Council and Taylor, and the 
ablest leaders of the race, are said to favor it; and I 
think that Booker Washington in his heart knows thar 
neither worth nor merit nor achievement will ever 
bridge the impassable barrier of race prejudice, and 
that, when the last arrow of his noble but hopeless 
effort has been shot, it must come to this at last. 
We have temporized for forty years upon this prob- 
lem. In the exhaustion of all our expedients, in the 
failure of all our theories, and in the providence of 
God, we have come at last to the parting of the ways. 
There is not a hope in fact or reason for the negra 
outside of separation. 
There is no peace, no purity, no tranquil develop- 
ment, no durable prosperity, and no moral growth for 
the white race outside of separation. 
It is neither impossible nor impracticable. The ele- 
ments are willing and the way is in reach. This is not 
a day of impossibilities. To the genius, the energy, 
and the necessities of this age all things are possible. 
Every day sees the business world, the educationai 
world, the political world converting the impossible 
into the possible. The hand of the Almighty is stead- 
ily opening the way. 
It is a day of large things, a day of magnificent en- 
terprises, a day of colossal movements everywhere.

England has offered a kingdom tract in Africa to 
the Jews of the world. The Zionist congress in Switz- 
erland has met the offer, and the children of Israel— 
‘God’s chosen people—scattered for centuries through 
all the world, will come trooping back to re-establish 
Tsrael as a nation and to make a New Jerusalem upon 
the earth. Wonderful and inspiring spectacle! Is 
there anything so wonderiul, so marvelous, as this in 
the proposition to establish a compact, gregarious and 
comparatively docile race of negroes in a State or 
‘country of their own? 
Is the expense appalling? Is the cost prohibitive? 
England again offers an example. England, our 
mother-country—England, next to ourselves, the 
‘greatest and most enlightened government under the 
sun—England has just put its hand into its pocket 
to expend $500,000,000 in order to buy out the Irish 
landlords and to heal the otherwise incurable running 
sore of Irish discontent. Wonderful liberality! Won- 
derful statesmanship ! 
We are as rich as England—richer than England, 
and twice as rich as any other kingdom in the world. 
We have as great a stake, as tremendous a necessity 
in this negro problem as England had with Ireland. 
We have already expended $1,000,000,000 in the futile 
effort to make the negro free. If England, just out 
of the war in Africa, can expend $500,000,000 to solve 
its Irish problem, then surely, the greatest of republics, 
in this era of peace and unparalleled prosperity—at 
the acme of its wealth, at the zenith of its greatness 
and power—can well afford to put a few hundred mil- 
lions into the solution of the vital problem of its races 
—a problem demoralizing to one race and hopeless 
for another; a problem that menaces unity, purity and 
peace, Liberality in this emergency is superb econ- 
omy.
-P-A-G-E-29
26 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 
The argument of analogy would seem conclusive. 
Somewhere, and in some way, if the races are to 
separate, there must be found a place for the negro, 
plan of separation, an inducement, and the consent of 
the elements involved. Briefly and in fragmentary 
outline, let us consider these. 
In the matter of location. Follow first the inferen- 
tial line of the President of the United States—the 
Philippines. Thomas Fortune’s mission was said to 
be successful. His report was published that the Phil- 
ippine soil and climate was suited to the negro; that 
the territory was ample, and that on one of these 
islands he believed the fortunes of the negro and the 
native might be worked out side by side. It may be 
that the islands of the sea were placed by Providence 
in our keeping to furnish an answer to the problem 
of the times. The repatriation of Africa is the senti- 
mental ideal of the advocates of separation—to go 
back to the Dark Continent from which they came, 
carrying the light, the law and the gospel of the great 
republic, after two centuries of touch, and side by side 
with the children of Israel, to establish anew the 
merits and the mission of an unfortunate race. If 
there be those who would oppose on philanthropic 
grounds the sending of the negro so far out of reach 
of help and regulation, there is land to be had at home. 
Lower California might be secured. The lands west 
of Texas might be had. But the government does not 
need to purchase. Four hundred million acres of gov- 
ernment land is yet untaken and undeveloped in the 
West. Of these vast acres the expert hydrographer 
of the Interior Department has reported that it is 
easily possible to redeem by irrigation enough to sup- 
port in plenty a population of sixty million people. 
So that the question of location is secure. A grega- 
rious race might be settled anywhere within this scope
-P-A-G-E-30
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 27 
of suggestion with a population not so dense as that 
of Belgium and the Netherlands. The cost would 
vary with the location, but under any conservative 
plan it would not be greater than England will spend 
in Ireland, and not nearly so much as the Jews for 
their New Jerusalem. 
No reasonable or considerate plan would call for 
the wholesale or summary deportation of the negro. 
With his consent, and with governmental aid, the 
movement might proceed slowly and with consider- 
ation, The older negroes would scarcely care to go. 
They are passing rapidly to a land that our problems 
can not reath. Within conservative limits, the trans- 
portation even to Africa would be practicable and 
easy. If only the vessels that brought foreigners to our 
shores from 1880 to 1885 had carried back to Africa 
as many negroes as they brought immigrants to us, 
not a single black man, woman or child would have 
been left in the country in 1885! Carl McKinley, the 
ablest and clearest statistician who has ever figured on 
this line, has made it plain that to induce the annua! 
emigration of 12,500 child-bearing females of the aver- 
age age of twenty years, would remove the maternal 
element of the negro race in forty years) and leave it 
easy to carry the remaining part. ‘To remove in forty 
years all the negroes who are now under the age of 
forty years, and to remove the increase only—all the 
children who shall be born within these forty years— 
would be the remainder of the problem—an easy and 
practicable task. And the same cool statistician, figur- 
ing liberally and counting it as sure that the govern- 
ment would do what it unquestionably ought to do, 
and send these people with some moneyed provision 
for their earlier wants, estimates that at $200 a head it. 
would cost only $10,000,000 a year, which is less than 
one-twelfth of the nation’s revenue from its internal
-P-A-G-E-31
28 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 
taxes, or in forty years the total cost would be $400,- 
.000,000—~or $100,000,000 less than England has just 
paid for peace and tranquility in Ireland. If any of 
you who hear should care to investigate this phase of 
the question deeply, and to carry these calculations 
forward, you will find Mr. McKinley’s book, “An Ap- 
peal to Pharaoh,” one of the most instructive and con- 
vincing volumes you have ever read. 
Of course, in the event of locating the negro in this 
country, the cost would be largely but indefinitely re- 
duced. 
Whether a State or colony should be the form of 
government would be within the discretion of the 
statesmen who put this plan into action. If a State, 
it would have the model and example of our own 
States to shape its plan and government. It might be 
made a counterpart of our surrounding States; for the 
negro’s is an imitative mind, and he could not find a 
nobler model. If a State, it should be exclusively a 
negro State. Every office in it, from chief justice of 
the court to coroner of the county, should be held ex- 
clusive to the negro race. Every white man should 
be debarred from right of franchise or of holding 
property in that State. It should be—especially if 
in this country—from first to last a negro State hold- 
ing its rights under the Constitution—the right to rep- 
resentation in the Federal congress—paying its taxes 
to the government, but holding every right free and 
unchallenged, equal in every way to Illinois or Geor- 
gia. In the distribution of the army there might be 
placed a Federal garrison on its border for protection 
without and order within the State. 
The superb inducement to the negro would be 
found in the freedom, the individuality, and the oppor- 
tunity of an independent commonwealth, in which he 
would be freed from the unequal competition of a su-
-P-A-G-E-32
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES, 29 
perior people, and given a chance to develop a char- 
acter, and to demonstrate the merits of his leaders and 
the capacities of the race. 
The constraining inducement to go should most 
unquestionably be given in an amendment to the Con- 
stitution which restricted his ballot to the State set 
apart for him by the generosity of the government. 
This would be fair. It would be equitable. Let no 
white man vote in the negro State to harass the negro 
councils, and let no negro vote in any other State than 
his own. Yon cannot vote in Georgia; I cannot vote 
in Illinois. The hardship is not great in view of the 
tremendous reasons that require it, and in return for 
the magnificent advantages which compensate it. 
This provision would be necessary as a controlling 
inducement for the change. Every aspiration in the 
negro race should set toward the state of his oppor- 
tunity. And if, with this great goal before him, he 
hesitated to go, or failed in going, it would be the last 
crowning proof of the hopeless and remediless infe- 
riority of his people. Never was proposition fairer. 
Never was compensation nobler to a race. A flag for 
a fetich; a country for a prison; and a glorious and 
unhindered opportunity for the empty mockery of a 
ballot, which has been and will be strangled here for- 
ever in his grasp. 
Will the negro go? I think honestly and deliber- 
ately that he will. The protest of the very few weil- 
fed, well-kept, and well-conditioned negroes who sur- 
round us here must not blind us to the plea of the 
helpless and hopeless thousands who see no light in 
the present and no hope in their future environment. 
Many of the ablest and truest leaders of the race are 
ardent advocates of separation. Bishop Turner, the 
wisest and most conservative leader of his race, is the 
advocate and evangel of a negro republic in Africa.
-P-A-G-E-33
30 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 
Ten thousand negroes in Kansas petitioned congress 
to appropriate money for a plan of separation. As 
a recognized advocate of the plan, I have had thous- 
ands of letters from negroes thanking me and bidding 
me God-speed with their prayers. Societies have been 
formed all over the country, some of them doing me 
the honor to bear my name, to organize the coopera- 
tive movement for a separate state. A circular car- 
tying the plan was put ten years ago into the hands 
-of one of the ablest and most eloquent negroes of the 
South. He carried it, not to persuade, but to explain 
to leading negroes in every section of the country, 
cand out of 5,000 circulars 4,500 came back to us bear- 
ing the deliberate, grateful approval of the best repre- 
‘sentatives of the negro race. I believe that, fairly 
presented to his intelligence, fairly appealing to his 
love of change, and with a general understanding of 
its advantages and opportunities, the negro will thank 
God and bless America for a plan like this. 
Will the white South be willing for the negro to go? 
I frankly confess the promise of some opposition to 
the idea in the South. Paradoxical as it may seem, the 
South loves the negro—not the new negro, but the 
‘old. In his place and in the relations clearly under- 
stood, there is a feeling of affection between the south- 
ern white man and the better negroes which our 
friends to the north of us can never appreciate and 
never understand. But the relations of the races in 
the South are constantly growing more strained and 
unpleasant. The new negro is killing the relation 
-established by the old negro. Every year the reluc- 
tance of the South to part with the negro is lessened, 
and the multiplying crimes and increasing unthrift of 
the negro are changing this reluctance to a positive 
anxiety for his departure. 
The chief opposition in the South would rest upon
-P-A-G-E-34
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 31 
the misapprehension, which you doubtless share, that 
the negro is indispensable to the agriculture and labor 
conditions of that section. That was once true. It 
is no longer true. I state here for the first time a fact 
which will be as surprising to the South as it is to you: 
The negro no longer makes the staple or cereal crops 
of the South! The cotton of Texas, of Louisiana, and 
of Mississippi is made chiefly by the white man and 
not by the negro! The negro is no longer an indus- 
trial necessity. This fact is from the census. It is 
not as yet published, but it comes straight from an 
authority beyond question in the Labor Bureau at 
Washington. It is being verified and understood by 
the best observers and thinkers of the States; and 
when that fact—that tremendous fact, now so little 
understood—becomes generally known in the country 
and in the South, then the South will stand as solidly 
for separation as its humblest representative stands 
for it here to-day. 
And if this means the reduction of our representa- 
tion in Congress, let that come. It would be a tem- 
porary loss. The exodus of the negro will let in the 
tides of an improved and restricted immigration, and 
the working Swede, the thrifty German, and the gal- 
lant Irishman will come in to renew our political sta- 
tus and to fill the hiatus with a homogeneous people. 
Will the northern white man be willing for the ne- 
gro to go? 
The politician, unthinking, and the philanthropist, 
far-thinking and generally over-thinking, answers, 
“No!” ‘The masses—the real people—answer, “Yes!” 
Recent events have uncovered a revolution of senti- 
ment in the North toward the negro. The masses 
have been disillusioned. ‘The idleness, the ingrati- 
tude, the insolence, and the crime of the negro have 
alienated even his friends. Even the philanthropists
-P-A-G-E-35
32 THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 
must be hopeless at least over the unchanged and un- 
changing conditions which they protest. As for the 
politicians, they are parrots—echoes of opinions, 
which they follow, but never make. The masses, 
in some things at least, are the masters of the politi- 
cians—and the masses see the truth. 
Standing here to-day, and standing as I have so 
often stood before the real people of the North and 
West, understanding their spirit and their temper, I 
announce before you, without hesitation and without 
reserve, that upon this isstte and under the new light 
which the decade has brought it, I would be willing 
with absolute confidence to submit to the vote of the 
real people of the North and West the whole question 
of the South and the negro—whether that issue be 
disfranchisement or whether it be separation! 
Let the negro continue to settle in the North, as he 
has done. And if the problem continues, it will be 
our only recourse to persuade him to settle in these 
great centers where our brethren may share and un- 
derstand our perplexities. Let the tide continue to 
drift here—and the day will come when the laboring 
masses of the North will arise and demand a separa- 
tion just as sternly as they demanded and secured the 
exclusion of the Chinese. 
The philanthropist will grow weary, the theorist. 
will despair, and the politician in time will undergo a 
change of heart. And we all shall come in the fulness 
of real philanthropy, and in the soundness of real dis- 
cretion, to see the only solution—the one remedy— 
and to follow it in the fear of God and in the faith of 
the people, to prosperity and peace. 
Ladies and gentlemen, my message is given and 
my mission is done. The scope of the discussion is 
too vast for an hour and too deep for a morning’s 
thought. I have offered the bare elements which your
-P-A-G-E-36
THE PROBLEM OF THE RACES. 33 
brains and your scholarship must clothe with the form 
and substance of more elaborate truth. May the 
words which have been spoken in weakness be raised 
in strength, and may you see my people and their 
problem as you have not done before. 
Let my parting words plead for the harmony and 
sympathy which lie for us beyond this dividing issue. 
Abraham Lincoln told you in 1859 that the Union 
“could not survive half slave and half free.” I believe 
with all my mind that if he lived to-day his noble lips 
would frame again the truth that the Union cannot 
any longer live half black and half white—half slave 
and half free! This is an issue upon which it seems 
we can never agree. . 
For half a hundred years we have wrangled and 
fought and bled and died about this black man from 
Africa! Is the wrangle worth its fearful cost? Shall 
the great northern section of our common country 
always turn its hand against the great southern sec- 
tion of our country? Shall the young American of 
the North steel his heart against the young American 
of the South over an alien’s cause? Shall the children 
of one blood and of a common glorious heritage di- 
vide in bitterness over a stranger in our midst? Shall 
the memories of Eutaw and Yorktown be obliterated 
in the recollections of Wilmington and Newnan? 
Shall the peace and harmony of this great republic be 
forever imperiled for the sake of the negro, whose 
faults and whose weakness so wonderfully outweigh 
his virtues and his gratitude? Shall the black man 
from Africa hinder and delay the work and the des- 
tiny of our imperial race? 
Great God! The idea is monstrous and unthink- 
able! The South is neither cruel nor unpatriotic, and 
the North knows it. The North is neither immov- 
able nor vindictive, and the South knows it. If either

of us is mistaken, and if both of us are misunderstood, 
we are yet one people, and we must meet upon the 
plane of our brotherhood and our destiny. 
‘Men and women of the University, I appeal to you 
who make the future. I appeal for Caucasian unity. 
I appeal for the imperial destiny of our mighty race. 
This is our country. We made it. We molded it. 
We control it, and we always will’ We have done 
great things. We have mighty things yet to do. The 
negro is an accident—an unwilling, a blameless, but 
an unwholesome, unwelcome, helpless, unassimilable 
element in our civilization, He is not made for our 
times. He is not framed to share in the duty and the 
destiny which he perplexes and beclouds. Let us put 
him kindly and humanely out of the way. Let us give 
him a better chance than he has ever had in history, 
and let us have done with him. Let us solve his prob- 
lem—frankly, fearlessly, nobly, and speedily. Let us 
put it behind us. Let us purify our politics of the 
perplexity. Let us liberate the South to vote and to 
think like free-men upon the mighty issues of the 
times. , 
And in the name of history and destiny, in the name 
of the past and in the name of the future, in the name 
of God and of our mission, I appeal to this great, con- 
quering Caucasian race to lock arms and go forward 
and onward and upward to its essential work.

THE BOSTON BANQUET SPEECH. 
By HENRY W. GRADY. 
Mr. President: Bidden by your invitation to a dis- 
cussion of the race problem—forbidden by occasion 
to make a political speech—I appreciate in trying to 
reconcile orders with propriety the predicament of the 
little maid who, bidden to learn to swim, was yet ad- 
jured, “Now, go, my darling, hang your clothes on a 
hickory limb, and don’t go near the water.” 
The stoutest apostle of the church, they say, is the 
missionary, and the missionary, wherever he unfurls 
his flag, will never find himself in deeper need of unc- 
tion and address than I, bidden to-night to plant the 
standard of a Southern Democrat in Boston’s ban- 
quet-hall, and discuss the problem of the races in the 
home of Phillips and of Sumner. But, Mr. President, 
if a purpose to speak in perfect frankness and sin- 
cerity; if earnest understanding of the vast interests 
involved ; if a consecrating sense of what disaster may 
follow further misunderstanding and estrangement, if 
these may be counted to steady undisciplined speech 
and to strengthen an untried arm—then, sir, I find the 
courage to proceed. 
Happy am I that this mission has brought my feet 
at last to press New England’s historic soil, and my 
eyes to the knowledge of her beauty and her thrift. 
Here, within touch of Plymouth Rock and Bunker 
Hill—where Webster thundered and Longfellow sang, 
Emerson thought and Channing preached—here in 
the cradle of American letters, and almost of Ameri-

36 THE BOSTON BANQUET SPEECH, 
can liberty, I hasten to make the obeisance that every 
American owes New England when first he stands 
uncovered in her mighty presence. Strange appari- 
tion! This stern and unique figure—carved from the 
ocean and the wilderness—its majesty kindling and 
growing amid the storms of winters and of wars— 
until at last the gloom was broken, its beauty dis- 
closed in the sunshine, and the heroic workers rested 
at its base—while startled kings and emperors gazed 
and marveled that from the rude touch of this hand- 
ful, cast on a bleak and unknown shore, should have 
come the embodied genius of human government, and 
the perfected model of human liberty! God bless the 
memory of those immortal workers—and prosper the 
fortunes of their living sons—and perpetuate the in- 
spirations of their handiwork. 
Two years ago, sir, I spoke some words in New 
York that caught the attention of the North. As I 
stand here to reiterate, as I have done everywhere, 
every word I then uttered—to declare that the senti- 
ments I then avowed were universally approved in the 
South—lI realize that the confidence begotten by that 
speech is largely responsible for my presence here to- 
night. I should dishonor myself if I betrayed that 
confidence by uttering one insincere word, or by with- 
holding one essential element of the truth. Apropos 
of this last, let me confess, Mr. President—before the 
praise of New England has died on my lips—that I 
believe the best product of her present life is the pro- 
cession of 17,000 Vermont Democrats that for twenty- 
two years, undiminished by death, unrecruited by 
birth or conversion, have marched over their rugged 
hills, cast their democratic ballots, and gone back 
home to pray for their unregenerate neighbors, and 
awake to read the record of 25,000 Republican ma-

jority. May God of the helpless and the heroic help 
them—and may their sturdy tribe increase! 
Far to the south, Mr. President, separated from 
this section by a line, once defined in irrepressible dif- 
ference, once traced in fraticidal blood,and now, thank 
God, but a vanishing shadow, lies the fairest and rich- 
est domain of this earth. It is the home of a brave 
and hospitable people. There, is centered all that can 
please or prosper humankind. A perfect climate, 
above a fertile soil, yields to the husbandman every 
product of the temperate zone. There, by night the 
cotton whitens beneath the stars, and by day the 
wheat locks the sunshine in its bearded sheaf. In the 
same field the clover steals the fragrance of the wind, 
and the tobacco catches the quick aroma of the rains. 
There, are mountains stored with exhaustless treas- 
ures ; forests, vast and primeval, and rivers that, tum- 
bling or loitering, run wanton to the sea. Of the 
three essential items of all industries—cotton, iron and 
wood—that region has easy control. In cotton, a fixed 
monopoly—in iron, proven supremacy—in timber, the 
reserve supply of the Republic. From this assured 
and permanent advantage, against which artificial 
conditions can not much longer prevail, has grown 
an amazing’system of industries. Not maintained by 
human contrivance of tariff or capital, afar off from 
the fullest and cheapest source of supply, but resting 
in Divine assurance, within touch of field and mine 
and forest—not set amid costly farms from which 
competition has driven the farmer in despair, but amid 
cheap and sunny lands, rich with agriculture, to which 
neither season nor soil has set a limit—this system of 
industries is mounting to a splendor that shall dazzle 
and illumine the world. 
That, sir, is the picture and the promise of my home 
—a land better and fairer than I have told you, and
-P-A-G-E-41
38 THE BOSTON BANQUET SPEECH. ” 
yet but fit setting, in its material excellence, for the 
loyal and gentle quality of its citizenship. Against 
that, sir, we have New England, recruiting the Re- 
public from its sturdy loins, shaking from its over- 
crowded hives new swarms of workers and touching 
this land all over with its energy and its courage. And 
yet, while in the Eldorado of which I have told you, 
but 15 per cent. of lands are cultivated, its mines 
scarcely touched and its population so scant that, were 
it set equidistant, the sound of the human voice could 
not be heard from Virginia to T’exas—while on the 
threshold of nearly every house in New England 
stands a son, seeking with troubled eyes some new 
land in which to carry his modest patrimony, the 
strange fact remains that in 1880 the South had fewer 
Northern-born citizens than she had in 1870—fewer 
in ’7o than in ‘60. Why is this? Why is it, sir, 
though the sectional line be now but a mist that the 
breath may dispel, fewer men of the North have 
crossed it over to the South than when it was crimson 
with the best blood of the Republic, or even when the 
slaveholder stood guard every inch of its way? 
There can be but one answer. It is the very prob- 
lem we are now to consider. The key that opens that 
problem will unlock to the world the fairest half of 
this Republic, and free the halted feet of thousands 
whose eyes are already kindled with its beauty. Bet- 
ter than this, it will open the hearts of brothers for 
thirty years estranged, and clasp in lasting comrade- 
ship a million hands now withheld in doubt. Noth- 
ing, sir, but this problem, and the suspicions it breeds, 
hinders a clear understanding and a perfect union. 
Nothing else stands between us and such love as 
bound Georgia and Massachusetts at ValleyForge and 
Yorktown, chastened by the sacrifices at Manasses 
and Gettysburg, and illumined with the coming of
-P-A-G-E-42

better work and a nobler destiny than was ever 
wrought with the sword or sought at the cannon’s 
mouth. : 
If this does not invite your patient hearing to-night 
~—hear one thing more. My people, your brothers in 
the South—brothers in blood, in destiny, in all that 
is best in our past and future—are so beset with this 
problem that their very existence depends upon its 
right solution. Nor are they wholly to blame for its 
presence. The slave-ships of the Republic sailed from 
your ports—the slaves worked in our fields. You will 
not defend the traffic, nor I the institution. But I do 
hereby declare that in its wise and human administra- 
tion, in lifting the slave to heights of which he had 
not dreamed in his savage home, and giving him a 
happiness he has not yet found in freedom—our fath- 
ers left their sons a saving and excellent heritage. 
In the storm of war this institution was lost. I thank 
God as heartily as you do that human slavery is gone 
forever from the American soil. But the freedman re- 
mains. With him a problem without precedent or 
parallel. Note its appalling conditions. Two utterly 
dissimilar races on the same soil—with equal political 
and civil rights—almost equal in numbers, but terri- 
bly unequal in intelligence and responsibility—each 
pledged against fusion—one for a century in servi- 
tude to the other, and freed at last by a desolating war 
—the experiment sought by neither, but approached. 
by both with doubt—these are the conditions. Under. 
these, adverse at every point, we are required to carry 
these two races in peace and honor to the end. Never, 
sir, has such a task been given to mortal stewardship. 
Never before in this Republic has the white race di- 
vided on the rights of an alien race. The red man 
was cut down as a weed, because he hindered the way 
of the American citizen. The yellow man was shut
-P-A-G-E-43
40 — THE BOSTON BANQUET SPEECH. 
out of this Republic because he is an alien and in- 
ferior. ‘The red man was owner of the land—the yel- 
low man highly civilized and assimilable—but they 
hindered both sections and are gone! But the black 
man, affecting but one section, is clothed with every 
privilege of government and pinned to the soil, and 
my people commended to make good at any hazard, 
and at any cost, his full and equal heirship of Ameri- 
can privilege and prosperity. It matters not that 
wherever the whites and blacks have touched, in any 
era, or any clime, there has been irreconcilable vio- 
lence. It matters not that no two races, however simi- 
lar, have lived anywhere at any time on the same soil 
with equal rights in peace! In spite of these things, 
we are commanded to make good this change of 
American policy which has not perhaps changed 
American prejudice—to make certain here what has 
elsewhere been impossible between whites and blacks 
——and to reverse, under the very worst conditions, the 
universal verdict of racial history. And driven, sir, 
to this superhuman task with an impatience that 
brooks no delay—a rigor that accepts no excuse— 
and a suspicion that discourages frankness and sin- 
cerity. We do not shrink from this trial, It is so 
interwoven with our industrial fabric that we can not. 
disentangle it if we would—so bound up in our honor- 
able obligation to the world, that we would not, if we 
could. Can we solve it? The God who gave it into 
our hands, He alone can know. But this the weak- 
est and wisest of us do know: we can not solve it with 
less than your tolerant and patient sympathy—with 
Jess than the knowledge that the blood that runs in 
your veins is our blood—and that when we have done 
our best, whether the issue be lost or won, we shall 
feel your strong arms about us and hear the beating 
of your approving hearts.
-P-A-G-E-44
THE BOSTON BANQUET SPEECH. 41 
The resolute, clear-headed, broad-minded men of 
the South—the men whose genius made glorious 
every page of the first seventy years of American his- 
tory—whose courage and fortitude you tested in five 
years of the fiercest war—whose energy has made 
bricks without straw, and spread splendor amid the 
ashes of their war-wasted homes—these men wear this 
problem in their hearts and their brains, by day and 
by night. They realize, as you can not, what this 
problem means—what they owe to this kindly and de- 
pendent race—the measure of their debt to the world 
in whose despite they defended and maintained slav- 
ery. And though their feet are hindered in.its under- 
growth, and their march encumbered with its bur- 
dens, they have lost neither the patience from which 
comes clearness, nor the faith from which comes 
courage. Nor, sir, when in passionate moments is 
disclosed to them that vague and awful shadow, with 
its lurid abysses and its crimson stains, into which I 
pray God they may never go, are they struck with 
‘more of apprehension than is needed to complete their 
consecration ! 
Such is the temper of my people. But what of the 
problem itself? Mr. President, we need not go one 
step further unless you concede right here the people 
I speak for are as honest, as sensible, and as just as 
your people, seeking as earnestly as you would in their 
place, to rightly solve the problem that touches them 
at every vital point. If you insist that they are ruf- 
fians, blindly striving with bludgeon and shotgun to 
plunder and oppress a race, then I shall sacrifice my 
self-respect and tax your patience in vain. But admit 
that they are men of common sense and common hon- 
‘esty—wisely modifying an environment they can not 
wholly disregard—guiding and controlling as best 
they can the vicious and irresponsible of either race—
-P-A-G-E-45
42 THE BOSTON BANQUET SPEECH. 
compensating error with frankness, and retrieving in 
patience what they lose in passion—and conscious all 
the time that wrong means ruin—admit this, and we 
may reach an understanding to-night. 
The President of the United States, in his late mes- 
sage to Congress, discussing the plea that the South 
should be left to solve this problem, asks: “Are they 
at work upon it? What solution do they offer? When 
will the black man cast a free ballot? When will he 
have the civil rights that are his?” I shall not here 
protest against the partisanry that, for the first time 
in our history, in time of peace, has stamped with the 
great seal of our government a stigma upon the peo- 
ple of a great and loyal section, though I gratefully 
remember that the great dead soldier, who held the 
helm of state for the eight stormy years of reconstruc- 
tion, never found need for such a step; and though 
there is no personal sacrifice I would not make to 
remove this cruel and unjust imputation on my peo- 
ple from the archives of my country! But, sir, backed 
by a record, on every page of which is progress, I 
venture to make earnest and respectful answer to the 
questions that are asked, I bespeak your patience, 
while, with vigorous plainness of speech, seeking your 
judgment rather than your applause, I proceed, step 
by step. We give to the world this year a crop of 
7,500,000 bales of cotton, worth $45,000,000, and its 
cash equivalent in grain, grasses and fruit. This 
enorumous crop could not have come from the hands 
of sullen and discontented labor. It comes from 
peaceful fields, in which laughter and gossip rise 
above the hum of industry, and contentment runs 
with the singing plow. 
It is claimed that this ignorant labor is defrauded 
of its just hire. I present the tax books of Georgia, 
which show that the negro, twenty-five years ago a
-P-A-G-E-46
THE BOSTON BANQUET 8PEECH, 43 
slave, has in Georgia alone, $10,000,000 of assessed 
property, worth twice that much. Does not that rec- 
ord honor him, and vindicate his neighbors? What 
people, penniless, illiterate, has done so well? For 
every Afro-American agitator, stirring the strife in 
which alone he prospers, I can show you a thousand 
negroes, happy in their cabin homes, tilling their own 
land by day, and at night taking from the lips of their 
children the helpful message their State sends them 
from the schoolhouse door. And the schoolhouse 
itself bears testimony. In Georgia we added last year 
$250,000 to the school fund, making a total of more 
than $1,000,000—and this in the face of prejudice not 
yet conquered—of the fact that the whites are assessed’ 
for $368,000,000, the blacks for $10,000,000, and yet 
forty-nine per cent. of the beneficiaries are black chil- 
dren—and in the doubt of many wise men if education 
helps, or can help, our problem. Charleston, with her 
taxable values cut half in two since 1860, pays more 
in proportion for public schools than Boston. Al- 
though it is easier to give much out of much than 
little out of little, the South, with one-seventh of the 
taxable property of the country, with relatively larger 
debt, having received only one-twelfth as much public 
‘land, and having back of its tax-books none of the 
half billion of bonds that enrich the North—and 
though it pays annually $26,000,000 to your section 
as pensions, yet gives nearly one-sixth of the public 
school fund. The South, since 1865, has spent $122,- 
000,000 in education, and this year is pledged to $37,- 
000,000 for State and city schools, although the blacks, 
paying one-thirtieth of the taxes, get nearly one-half 
of the fund. 
Go into our fields and see whites and blacks work- 
ing side by side. On our buildings in the same 
squad. In our shops at the same forge. Often the
-P-A-G-E-47
44 THE BOSTON BANQUET SPEECH. 
blacks crowd the whites from work, or lower wages 
by the greater need or simpler habits, and yet are 
permitted because we want to bar them from no 
avenue in which their feet are fitted to tread. They 
could not there be elected orators of the white uni- 
versities, as they have been here, but they do enter 
there a hundred useful trades that are closed against 
them here. We hold it better and wiser to tend the 
weeds in the garden than to water the exotic in the 
window. In the South, there are negro lawyers, teach- 
ers, editors, dentists, doctors, preachers, multiplying 
with the increasing ability of their race to support 
them. In villages and towns they have their military 
‘companies equipped from the armories of the State, 
their churches and societies built and supported large- 
ly by their neighbors. What is the testimony of the 
‘courts In penal legislation we have steadily reduced 
felonies to misdemeanors, and have Jed the world in 
mitigating punishment for crime, that we might save, 
as far as possible, this dependent race from its own 
weakness. In our penitentiary record sixty per cent. 
of the prosecutors are negroes, and in every court the 
negro criminal strikes the colored juror, that white 
men may judge his case. In the North, one negro in 
every 1,865 is in jail—in the South only one in 446. In 
the North the percentage of negro prisoners is six 
times as great as native whites—in the South, only 
four times as great. If prejudice wrongs him in 
Southern courts, the record shows it to be deeper in 
Northern courts. 
I assert here, and a bar as intelligent and upright 
cas the bar of Massachusetts will solemnly indorse my 
assertion, that in the Southern courts, from highest to 
lowest, pleading for life, liberty or property, the ne- 
gto has distinct advantage because he is a negro, apt 
to be overreached, oppressed—-and that this advantage
-P-A-G-E-48

reaches from the juror in making his verdict to the 
judge in measuring his sentence. Now, Mr. Presi- 
dent, can it be seriously maintained that we are ter- 
rorizing the people from whose willing hands come 
every year $1,000,000,000 of farm crops? Or have 
robbed a people who, twenty-five years from unre- 
warded slavery have amassed in one State $20,000,- 
ooo of property? Or that we intend to oppress the 
people we are arming every day? Or deceive them 
when we are educating them to the utmost limit of 
our ability? Or outlaw them when we work side by 
side with them? Or re-enslave them under legal 
forms when for their benefit we have even imprudently 
narrowed the limit of felonies and mitigated the se- 
verity of law? My fellow countrymen, as you your- 
self may sometimes have to appeal to the bar of hu- 
man judgment for justice and for right, give to my 
people to-night the fair and unanswerable conclusion 
of these incontestible facts. 
But it is claimed that under this fair seeming there 
is disorder and violence. This I admit. And there 
will be until there is one ideal community on earth 
after which we may pattern. But how widely it is 
misjudged! It is hard to measure with exactness 
whatever touches the negro. His helplessness, his 
‘ isolation, his century of servitude, these dispose us to 
emphasize and magnify his wrongs. This disposition, 
inflamed by prejudice and partisanry, has led to in- 
justice and delusion. Lawless men may ravage a 
county in Iowa and it is accepted as an incident—in 
the South a drunken row is declared to be the fixed 
habit of the community. Regulators may whip vaga- 
bonds in Indiana by platoons, and it scarcely arrests 
attention—a chance collision in the South among 
relatively the same classes is gravely accepted as evi- 
dence that one race is destroying the other. We
-P-A-G-E-49

might as well claim that the Union was ungrateful 
to the colored soldiers who followed its flag, because 
a Grand Army post in Connecticut closed its doors 
to a negro veteran, as for you to give racial signifi- 
cance to every incident in the South, or to accept ex- 
ceptional grounds as the rule of our society. I am not 
one of those who becloud American honor with the 
parade of the outrages of either section, and belie 
American character by declaring them to be significant 
and representative. I prefer to maintain that they are 
neither, and stand for nothing but the passion and the 
sin of our poor fallen humanity. If society, like a 
machine, were no stronger than its weakest part, I 
should despair of both sections. But, knowing that 
society, sentient and responsible in every fibre, can 
mend and repair until the whole has the strength of 
the best, I despair of neither. These gentlemen who 
‘come with me here, knit into Georgia’s busy life as 
they are; never saw, I dare assert, an outrage commit- 
ted onanegro! And if they did, not one of you would 
be swifter to prevent or punish. It is through them, 
and the man who thinks with them—making nine- 
tenths of every Southern community—that these two 
taces have been carried thus far with less of violence 
than would have been possible anywhere else on earth. 
And in their fairness and courage and steadfastness— 
more than in all the laws that can be passed, or all 
the bayonets that can be mustered—is the hope of our 
future. 
When will the black cast a free ballot? When ig- 
norance anywhere is not dominated by the will of the 
intelligent; when the laborer anywhere casts a vote 
unhindered by his boss ; when the vote of the poor any- 
where is not influenced by the power of the rich; 
when the strong and the steadfast do not everywhere 
control the suffrage of the weak and shiftless—then,
-P-A-G-E-50
THE BOSTON BANQUET SPEECH. AT 
and not till then, will the ballot of the negro be free. 
The white people of the South are banded, Mr. Presi- 
dent, not in prejudice against the blacks—not in sec- 
tional estrangement, not in the hope of political do- 
minion, but in a deep and abiding necessity. Here 
is this vast ignorant and purchasable vote—clannish, 
credulous, impulsive and passionate—tempting every 
art of the demagogue, but insensible to the appeal of 
the statesman. Wrongly started, in that it was led into 
alienation from its neighbor and taught to rely on 
the protection of an outside force, it can not be merged 
and lost in the two great parties through logical cur- 
rents, for it lacks political conviction and even that 
information on which conviction must be based. It 
must remain a faction—strong enough in every com- 
munity to control on the slightest division of the 
whites. Under that division it becomes the prey of 
the cunning and unscrupulous of both parties. Its 
* credulity is imposed on, its patience inflamed, its cu- 
pidity tempted, its impulses misdirected—and even 
its superstition made to play its part in a campaign 
in which every interest of society is jeopardized and 
every approach to the ballot-box debauched. It is 
against such campaigns as this—the folly and the 
bitterness and the danger of which every Southern 
community has drunk deeply—that the white people 
of the South are banded together. Just as you in Mas- 
sachusetts would be banded if 300,000 black men—: 
not one in a hundred able to read his ballot—banded 
in a race instinct, holding against you the memory 
of a century of slavery, taught by your late conquer- 
ors to distrust and oppose you, had already travestied 
legislation from your statehouse, and in every species 
of folly or villainy has wasted your substance and ex- 
hausted your credit.

against this tremendous menace, we are challenged 
with the smallness of our vote. This has long been 
flippantly charged to the evidence, and has now been 
solemnly and officially declared to be proof of political 
turpitude and baseness on our part. Let us see. Vir- 
ginia—a State now under fierce assault for this al- 
leged crime—cast, in 1888, seventy-five per cent. of 
her vote. Was it suppression in Virginia and natural 
causes in Massachusetts? Last month Virginia cast 
sixty-nine per cent. of her vote, and Massachusetts, 
fighting in every district, cast only forty-six per cent. 
of hers. If Virginia is condemned because thirty-one 
per cent. of her vote was silent, how shall this State 
escape in which fifty-one per cent. was dumb? Let 
us enlarge this comparison, The sixteen Southern 
States in 1888 cast sixty-seven per cent. of their total 
vote—the six New England States but sixty-three per 
cent. of theirs, By what fair rule shall the stigma be 
put upon one section, while the other escapes? A 
congressional election in New York last week, with 
the polling-place within touch of every voter, brought 
out only 6,000 votes of 28,o00o—and the lack of oppo- 
sition is assigned as the natural cause. In a district in 
my State, in which an opposition speech has not been 
heard in ten years, and the polling-places are miles 
apart—under the unfair reasoning of which my sec- 
tion has been a constant victim—the small vote is 
charged to be proof of forcible suppression. In Vir- 
ginia an average majority of 10,000, under hopeless 
division of the minority, was raised to 42,000; in 
Jowa, in the same election, a majority of 32,000 was 
wiped out, and an opposition majority of 8,000 was 
established. The change of 42,000 votes in. Iowa is 
accepted as political revolution—in Virginia an in- 
crease of 30,000 on a safe majority is declared to be 
proof of political fraud. I charge these facts and fig-

ures home, sir, to the heart and conscience of the 
American people, who will not assuredly see one sec- 
tion condemned for what another section is excused! 
Tf I can drive them through the prejudice of the 
partisan, and have them read and pondered at the fire- 
side of the citizen, I will rest on the judgment there 
formed and the verdict there rendered! 
Tt is deplorable, sir, that in both sections a larger 
percentage of the vote is not regularly cast, but more 
inexplicable that this should be so in New England 
than in the South. What invites the negro to the 
ballot-box ? He knows that, of all men, it has promised 
him most and yielded him least. His first appeal to, 
suffrage was the promise of “forty acres and a mule.” 
His second, the threat that Democratic success meant 
his re-enslavement. Both have proved false in his 
experience. He looked for a home, and he got the 
Freedman’s Bank. He fought under the promise of the 
loaf, and in victory was denied the crumbs. Dis- 
couraged and deceived, he has realized at last that his 
best friends are his neighbors, with whom his lot is 
cast, and whose prosperity is bound up in his—and 
that he has gained nothing in politics to compensate 
the loss of their confidence and sympathy that is at 
last his best and his enduring hope. And so, without 
leaders or organization—and lacking the resolute 
heroism of my party friends in Vermont, that 
makes their hopeless march over the hills a high and 
inspiring pilgrimage—he shrewdly measures the oc- 
casional agitator, balances his little account with poli- 
tics, touches up his mule and jogs down the furrow, 
letting the mad world jog as it will! 
The negro vote can never control in the South, and 
it would be well if partisans in the North would un- 
derstand this. I have seen the white people of a Stat: 
set about by black hosts until their fate seemed sealed.

But, sir, some brave man, banding them together, 
would rise, as Elijah rose in beleagured Samaria, and, 
touching their eyes with faith, bid them look abroad 
to see the very air “filled with the chariots of Israel 
and the horsemen thereof.” If there is any human 
force that can not be withstood, it is the power of the 
banded intelligence and responsibitity of a free com- 
munity. Against it, numbers and corruption can not 
prevail. It can not be forbidden in the law or di- 
vorced in force. It is the inalienable right of every 
free community—and the just and righteous safe- 
guard against an ignorant or corrupt suffrage. It is 
on this, sir, that we rely in the South, Not the cow- 
ardly menace of mask or shotgun, but the peaceful 
majesty of intelligence and responsibility, massed and 
unified for the protection of its homes and the pre- 
servation of its homes and the preservation of its lib- 
erty. That, sir, is our reliance and our hope, and 
against it all the powers of the earth shall not prevail. 
It was just as certain that Virginia would come back 
to the unchallenged control of her white race—that 
before the moral and material power of her people 
once more unified, opposition would crumble until its 
last desperate leader was left alone vainly striving to 
rally his disordered hosts—as that night should fade 
in the kindling glory of the sun. You may pass force 
bills, but they will not avail. You may surrender your 
liberties to Federal election law, you may submit, in 
fear of a necessity that does not exist, that the very 
form of this government may be changed—this old 
State that holds in its charter the boast that “it is a 
free and independent commonwealth’—it may de- 
liver its election machinery into the hands of the gov- 
ernment it helped to create—but never, sir, will a sin- 
gle State in this Union, North or South, be delivered 
again to the control of an ignorant and inferior race..
-P-A-G-E-54
THE ROSTON BANQUET SPEECH. 51 
We wrested our State government from negro su- 
premacy when the Federal drumbeat rolled closer to 
the ballot-box and Federal bayonets hedged it deeper 
about than will ever again be permitted in this free 
government. But, sir, though the cannon of this Re- 
public thundered in every voting district of the South, 
we still should find in the mercy of God the means and 
‘the courage to prevent its re-establishment ! 
I regret, sir, that my section, hindered with this 
problem, stands in seeming estrangement to the 
North. If, sir, any man will point out to me a path 
down which the white people of the South divided 
may walk in peace and honor, I will take that path 
though I took it alone—for at the end, and nowhere 
else, I fear, is to be found the full prosperity of my 
section and the full restoration of this Union. But, 
sir, if the negro had not been enfranchised, the South 
would have been divided and the Republic holds the 
South united and compact. What solution, then, can 
we offer for this problem? ‘Time alone can disclose it 
to us. We simply report progress and ask your pa- 
' tience. If the problem be solved at all—and I firmly 
believe it will, though nowhere else has it been—it 
will be solved by the people most deeply bound in 
interest, most deeply pledged in honor to its solution. 
I had rather see my people render back this question 
rightly solved than to see them gather all the spoils 
over which faction has contended since Catiline con- 
spired and Caesar fought. Meantime we treat the ne- 
gro fairly, measuring to him justice in the fullness 
the strong should give to the weak, and leading him 
in the steadfast ways of citizenship that he may no 
longer be the prey of the unscrupulous and the sport 
of the thoughtless. We open to him every pursuit in 
which he can prosper, and seek to broaden his training 
and capacity. We seek to hold his confidence and

friendship, and to pin him to the soil with ownership, 
that he may catch in the fire of his own hearthstone 
that sense of responsibility the shiftless can never 
know. And we gather him into that alliance of in- 
telligence and responsibility that, though it now runs 
close‘to racial lines, welcomes the responsible and in- 
telligent of any race. By this course, confirmed in 
our judgment and justified in the progress already 
made, we hope to progress slowly but surely to the 
end. 
The love we feel for that race you can not measure: 
nor comprehend. As I attest it here, the spirit of my 
oid black mammy from her home up there looks down 
to bless, and through the tumult of this night steals 
the sweet music of her crooning as thirty years ago 
she held me in her black arms and led me smiling into. 
sleep. This scene vanishes as I speak, end I catch a 
vision of an old Southern home, with its lofty pillars, 
and its white pigeons fluttering down through the 
golden air. I see women with strained and anxious 
faces, and children alert, yet helpless. I see night 
come down with its dangers and its apprehensions, 
and in a big homely room I feel on my tired head the 
touch of loving hands—now worn and wrinkled, but 
fairer to me yet than the hands of mortal woman, and 
stronger yet to lead me than the hands of mortal man 
—as they lay a mother’s blessing there while at her 
knees—the truest altar I yet have found—I thank God 
that she is safe in her sanctuary, because her slaves, 
sentinel in the silent cabin or guard at her chamber 
door, puts a black man’s loyalty between her and dan- 
ger.

dier struck, staggering, fallen. I see a slave, scuffling” 
through the smoke, winding his black arms about the 
fallen form, reckless of the hurtling death—bending

this trusty face to catch the words that tremble on the _ 
stricken lips, so wrestling meantime with agony that 
he would lay down his life in his master’s stead. I 
see him by the weary bedside, ministering with un- 
complaining patience, praying with all his humble 
heart that God will lift his master up, until death 
‘come in mercy and in honor to still the soldier’s 
.agony and seal the soldier’s life. I see him by the 
open grave, mute, motionless, uncovered, suffering 
for the death of him who in life fought against his free- 
‘dom. I see him when the mound is heaped and the 
great drama of his life is closed, turn away, and with 
-downcast eyes and uncertain step start out into new 
and strange fields, faltering, struggling, but moving 
on, until his shambling figure is lost in the light of 
this better and brighter day. And from the grave 
‘comes a voice saying: “Follow him! Put your arms _ 
about him in his need, even as he put his about me. 
Be his friend as he was mine.” And out into this new 
world—strange to me as to him, dazzling, bewilder- 
‘ing both—I follow! And may God forget my people 
-—when they forget these. 
Whatever the future may hold for them—whether 
they plod along in the servitude from which they 
‘have never been lifted since the Cyrenian was laid 
hold upon by the Roman soldiers and made to bear 
the cross of the fainting Christ--whether they find 
homes again in Africa, and thus hasten the prophecy 
of the psalmist who said: “And suddenly Ethiopia 
shall hold out her hands unto God”—whether forever 
dislocated and separated, they remain a weak people 
beset by stronger, and exist as the Turk, who lives 
in the jealousy rather than in the conscience of Eu- 
rope—or whether in this miraculous Repubic they 
break through the caste of twenty centuries and, be- 
lying universal history, reach the full stature of citi-

zenship, and in peace maintain it—we shall give thenr 
uttermost justice and abiding friendship. And what- 
ever we do, into whatever seeming estrangement we 
may be driven, nothing shall disturb the love we bear 
this Republic, or mitigate our consecration to its serv- 
ice. I stand here, Mr. President, to profess no new 
loyalty. When General Lee, whose heart was the tem- 
ple of our hopes, and whose arm was clothed with our 
strength, renewed his allegiance to the government at. 
Appomattox, he spoke from a heart too great to be 
false, and he spoke for every honest man from Mary- 
land to Texas. From that day to this, Hamilcar 
has nowhere in the South sworn young Hannibal to 
hatred and vengeance—but everywhere to loyalty and. 
to love. Witness the soldier standing at the base of a 
Confederate monument above the graves of his com- 
rades, his empty sleeve tossing in the April wind, ad- 
juring the young men about him to serve as honest 
and loyal citizens the government against which their 
fathers fought. This message, delivered from that 
sacred presence, has gone home to the hearts of my 
fellows! And, sir, I declare here, if physical courage 
be always equal to human aspiration, that they would 
die, sir, if need be, to restore this Republic their fath- 
ers fought to dissolve! 
Such, Mr. President, is this problem, as we see it;: 
such is the temper in which we approach it; such the 
progress made. What do we ask of you? First, pa- 
tience; out of this alone can come perfect work. Sec- 
ond, confidence; in this alone can you judge fairly. 
Third, sympathy ; in this you can help us best. Fourth,. 
give us your sons as hostages. When you plant your 
capital in millions, send your sons that they may help- 
know how true are our hearts and may help to sweil 
the Anglo-Saxon current until it can carry without: 
danger this black infusion. Fifth, loyalty to the Re-

public—for there is sectionalism in loyalty as in es- 
trangement. This hour little needs the loyalty that is 
loyal to one section and yet holds the other in endur- 
ing suspicion and estrangement. Give us the broad 
and perfect loyalty that loves and trusts Georgia alike 
with Massachusetts—that knows no South, no North, 
no East, no West; but endears with equal and patri- 
otic love every foot of our soil, every State of our. 
Union. 
A mighty duty, sir, and a mighty inspiration impels 
every one of us to-night to lose in patriotic consecra- 
tion whatever estranges, whatever divides. We, sir, 
are Americans—and we fight for human liberty. The 
uplifting force of the American idea is under every 
throne on earth. France, Brazil—these are our victo- 
ries. To redeem the earth from kingcraft and oppres- 
sion—this is our mission. And we shall not fail. God 
has sown in our soil the seed of his millennial harvest, 
and he will not lay the sickle to the ripening crop until 
his full and perfect day has come. Our history, sir, 
has been a constant and expanding miracle from Ply- 
mouth Rock and Jamestown all the way—aye, even 
from the hour when, from the voiceless and tracklegs~- 
ocean, a new world rose to the sight of the inspired 
sailor. As we approach the fourth centennial of that 
stupendous day--when the old world will come to 
marvel and to learn, amid our gathered treasures—let 
us resolve to crown the miracles of our past with the 
spectacle of a republic compact, united, indissoluble in 
the bonds of love—loving from the Lakes to the Gulf 
—the wounds of war healed in every heart as on every 
hill—serene and resplendent at the summit of human 
achievement and earthly glory—blazing out the path, 
and making clear the way up which all the nations of 
the earth must come in God’s appointed time!

BUT WHAT OF THE NEGRO. 
Excerpts From THE NEw Sourn SPEECH DELIVERED BY 
Henry W. GRADY AT THE BANQUET OF THE NEW 
ENGLAND CLuB, NEw York. 
It is a rare privilege, sir, to have had part, however 
humble, in this work. Never was nobler duty con- 
fided to human hands than the uplifting and upbuild- 
ing of the prostrate and bleeding South—misguided, 
perhaps, but beautiful in her suffering, and honest, 
brave and generous always. In the record of her so- 
cial, industrial and political illustration we await witn 
confidence the verdict of the world. 
Have we solved the problem he presents or pro- 
gressed in honor and equity toward solution? Let 
the record speak to the point. No section shows a 
more prosperous laboring population than the ne- 
groes of the South, none in fuller sympathy with the 
employing and land-owning class. He shares our 
school fund, has the fullest protection of our laws and 
the friendship of our people. Self-interest, as well as 
honor, demand that he should have this. Our future 
our very existence depend upon our working out this 
problem in full and exact justice. We understand 
that when Lincoln signed the emancipation proclama- 
tion, your victory was assured, for he then committed 
you to the cause of human liberty, against which the 
arms of man can not prevail—while those of our 
statesmen who trusted to make slavery the corner- 
stone of the Confederacy doomed us to defeat as far 
as they could, committing us to a cause that reason

could not defend or the sword maintain in sight of 
advancing civilization. 
Had Mr. Toombs said, which he did not say, “that 
he would call the roll of his slaves at the foot of Bun- 
ker Hill,” he would have been foolish, for he might 
have known that whenever slavery became entangled 
in war it must perish, and that the chattel in human 
flesh ended forever in New England when your fathers 
—not to be blamed for parting with what didn’t pay— 
sold their slaves to our fathers—not to be praised for 
knowing a paying thing when they saw it. The rela- 
tions of the Southern people with the negro are close 
and cordial. We remember with what fidelity for four 
years he guarded our defenseless women and children, 
whose husbands and fathers were fighting against his 
freedom. To his eternal credit be it said that when- 
ever he struck a blow for his own liberty he fought in 
open battle, and when at last he raised his black and 
humble hands that the shackles might be struck off, 
those hands were innocent of wrong against his help- 
less charges, and worthy to be taken in loving grasp 
‘by every man who honors loyalty and devotion. Ruf- 
fians have maltreated him, rascals have misled him, 
philanthropists established a bank for him, but the 
South, with the North, protests against injustice to 
this simple and sincere people. To liberty and en- 
franchisement is as far as law can carry the negro. 
‘The rest must be left to the conscience and common 
‘sense. It must be left to those among whom his lot 
is cast, with whom he is indissolubly connected, and 
whose prosperity depends upon their possessing his 
intelligent sympathy and confidence. Faith has been 
kept with him, in spite of calumnious assertions to the 
contrary by those who assume to speak for us or by 
frank opponents. Faith will be kept with him in the 
future, if the South hold her reason and integrity.
-P-A-G-E-61
58 BUT WHAT OF THE NEGRO. 
But have we kept our faith with you? In the fullest 
sense, yes. When Lee surrendered—I don’t say when 
Johnson surrendered, because I understand he still 
alludes to the time when he met General Sherman last 
as the time when he determined to abandon any fur- 
ther prosecution of the struggle—when Lee surren- 
dered, I say, and Johnson quit, the South became, 
and has since been, loyal to this Union. We fought 
hard enough to know that we were whipped, and in 
perfect frankness accept as final the arbitrament of 
the sword to which we had appealed. The South 
found her jewel in the toad’s head of defeat. The 
shackles that had held her in narrow limitations fell 
forever when the shackles of the negro slave were 
broken. Under the old regime the negroes were 
slaves to the South; the South was a slave to the sys- 
tem. The old plantation, with its simple police regu- 
lations and feudal habit, was the only type possible 
under slavery. Thus was gathered in the hands of a 
splendid and chivalric oligarchy the substance that 
should have been diffused among the people, as the 
rich blood, under certain artificial conditions, is gath- 
ered at the heart, filling that with affluent rapture but 
leaving the body chill and colorless.

This of him. I want no better friend than the black 
boy who was raised by my side, and who is now 
trudging patiently with downcast eyes and shambling 
figure through his lowly way in life. I want no 
sweeter music than the crooning of my old “mammy,” 
now dead and gone to rest, as I heard it when she 
held me in her loving arms, and bending her old black 
face above me stole the cares from my brain, and led 
me smiling into sleep. I want no truer soul than that 
which moved the trusty slave, who for four years 
while my father fought with the armies that barred 
his freedom, slept every night at my mother’s cham- 
ber door, holding her and her children as safe as if 
her husband stood guard, and ready to lay down his. 
humble life on her threshold. History has no parallel 
to the faith kept by the negro in the South 
during the war. Often five hundred negroes to , 
a single white man, and yet through these dusky 
throngs the women and children walked in safety, and’ 
the unprotected homes rested in peace. Unmar- 
shaled the black battalions moved patiently to the 
fields in the morning to feed the armies their idleness. 
would have starved, and at night gathered anxiously 
at the big house to “hear the news from marster,’ 
though conscious that his victory made their chains

guard of the helpless; the rough companion of the 
little ones; the observant friend; the silent sentry in 
his lowly cabin; the shrewd counsellor. And when 
the dead came home, a mourner at the open grave. 
A thousand torches. would have disbanded every 
Southern army, but not one was lighted. When the 
master going to a war in which slavery was involved 
said to his slave, “I leave my home and loved ones in 
your charge,” the tenderness between man and mas- 
ter stood disclosed. And when the slave held that 
charge sacred through storm and temptation, he gave 
new meaning to faith and loyalty. I rejoice that when 
freedom came to him after years of waiting, it was all 
the sweeter because the black hands from which the 
shackles fell were stainless of a single crime against 
the helpless ones confided to his care. 
From this root, imbedded in a century of kind and 
‘constant companionship, has sprung some foliage. 
As no race had ever lived in such unresisting bond- 
age, none was ever heard with such swiftness 
through freedom into power. Into hands still trem- 
bling from the blow that broke the shackles, was 
thrust the ballot. In less than twelve months from 
the day he walked down the furrow a slave, the negro 
dictated in legislative halls from which Davis and 
Calhoun had gone forth, the policy of twelve com- 
monwealths. When his late master protested against 
his misrule, the federal drum-beat rolled around his 
strongholds, and from a hedge of federal bayonets he 
grinned in good-natured insolence. From the proven 
incapacity of that day has he far advanced? Simple, 
credulous, impulsive—easily led and too often easily 
bought, is he a safer, more intelligent citizen now than 
then? Is this mass of votes, loosed from old restraints, 
inviting alliance or awaiting opportunity, less menac-
-P-A-G-E-64
WHAT OF THE NEGRO. 61 
ing than when its purpose was plain and its way di- 
rect? 
My countrymen, right here the South must make 
a decision on which very much depends. Many wise 
men hold that the white vote of the South should di- 
vide, the color line be beaten down, and the Southern 
States ranged on economic or moral questions as in- 
terest or belief demands. I am compelled to dissent 
from this view. The worst thing, in my, opinion, that 
could happen is that the white people of the South 
should stand in opposing factions, with the vast mass 
of ignorant or purchasable negro votes between. 
Consider such a status. If the negroes were skillfully 
led—and leaders would not be lacking—it would 
give them the balance of power—a thing not to be 
considered. If their vote was not compacted, it would 
invite the debauching bid of factions, and drift surely 
to that which was the most corrupt and cunning. 
With the shiftless habit and irresolution of slavery 
days still possessing him, the negro voter will not in 
this generation, adrift from war issues, become a 
steadfast partisan through conscience or conviction. 
In every community there are colored men who re- 
deem their race from this reproach, and who vote un- 
der reason. Perhaps in time the bulk of this race 
may thus adjust itself. But, through what long and 
monstrous periods of political debauchery this status 
would be reached, no tongue can tell. 
The clear and unmistakable domination of the white 
race, dominating not through violence, not through 
party alliance, but through the integrity of its own 
vote and the largeness of its sympathy and justice 
through which it shall compel the support of the 
better classes of the colored race—that is the hope 
and assurance of the South. Otherwise, the negro 
would be bandied from one faction to another. His
-P-A-G-E-65
62 WHAT OF THE NEGRO. 
credulity would be played upon, his cupidity tempted, 
his impulses misdirected, his passions inflamed. He 
would be forever in alliance with that faction which 
‘was most desperate and unscrupulous. Such a state 
would be worse than reconstruction, for then intelli- 
gence was banded, and its speedy triumph assured. 
But with intelligence and property divided—bidding 
and overbidding for place and patronage—irritation 
increasing with each conflict—the bitterness and des- 
peration seizing every heart—political debauchery 
deepening, as each faction staked its all in the miser- 
able game—thére would be no end in this, until our 
suffrage was hopelessly sullied, our people forever di- 
vided, and our most sacred rights surrendered. 
One thing further should be said in perfect frank- 
ness. Up to this point we have dealt with ignorance 
_and corruption—but beyond this point a deeper issue 
confronts us. Ignorance may struggle to enlighten- 
ment, out of corruption may come the incorruptible. 
God speed the day when—every true man will work 
and pray for its coming—the negro must be led to 
know and through sympathy to confess that his in. 
terests and the interests of the people of the South 
are identical. The men who, from afar off, view this 
subject through the cold eye of speculation or see it 
distorted through partisan control of the affairs of the 
South. We have no fears of this; already we are at~ 
taching to us the best elements of the race, and as we 
proceed our alliance will broaden; eternal pressure 
but irritates and impedes. Those who would put the 
negro race in supremacy would work against infalli- 
ble decree, for the white race can never submit to its 
domination, because the white race is the superior 
race, But the supremacy of the white race of the 
South must be maintained forever, and the domina- 
stion of the negro race resisted at all points and at all
-P-A-G-E-66
VHAT OF THE NEGRO. 63 
hazards—because the white race is the superior race. 
This is the declaration of no new truth. It has abided 
forever in the marrow of our bones, and shall run for- 
ever with the blood that feeds Anglo-Saxon hearts. 
In political compliance the South has evaded the 
truth, and men have drifted from their convictions. 
But we can not escape this issue. It faces us wherever 
we turn. It is an issue that has been, and will be. 
The races and tribes of earth are of divine origin. 
Behind the laws of man and the decrees of war, stands 
the law of God. What God hath separated let no man 
join together. The Indian, the Malay, the Negro, the 
Caucasian, these types stand as markers of God’s will. 
Let no man tinker with the work of the Almighty. 
Unity of civilization, no more than unity of faith, will 
never be witnessed on earth. No race has risen, or 
will rise, above the ordinary place. Here is the piv- 
otal fact of this great matter—two races are made - 
equal in law, and in political rights, between whom 
the caste of race has set an impassable gulf. This 
gulf is bridged by a statute, and the races are urged 
to cross thereon. This can not be. The fiat of the Al- 
mighty has gone forth, and in eighteen centuries of 
history, it is written. We would escape this issue if 
we could, From the depths of its soul the South in- 
vokes from heaven “peace on earth, and good will to 
man.” She would not, if she could, cast this race 
back into the condition from which it was righteously 
raised. She would not deny its smallest or abridge its 
fullest privilege. Not to lift this burden forever from 
her people would she do the least of these things. 
She must walk through the valley of the shadow, for 
God has so ordained. But He has ordained that she 
shall walk in that integrity of race that was created 
in His wisdom and has been perpetuated in His 
strength. Standing in the presence of this multitude,
-P-A-G-E-67
64 WHAT OF THE NEGRO. ,; 
sobered with the responsibility of the message I de- 
liver to the young men of the South, I declare that 
the truth above all others to be worn unsullied and 
sacred in your hearts, to be surrendered to no force, 
sold for no price, compromised in no necessity, but 
cherished and defended as the covenant of your pros- 
perity, and the pledge of peace to your children, is 
that the white race must dominate forever in the 
South, because it is the white race, and superior to 
that race by which its supremacy is threatened. 
It is a race issue. Let us come to this point, and 
stand here. Here the air is pure and the light is clear, 
and here honor and peace abide. Juggling and eva- 
sion deceives not a man. Compromise and subservi- 
ence has carried not a point. There is not a white 
man North or South who does not feel it stir in the 
gray matter of his brain and throb in his heart. Not 
a negro who does not feel its power. It is not a sec- 
tional issue. It speaks in Ohio and in Georgia. It 
speaks wherever the Anglo-Saxon touches an alien 
race. It has just spoken in universally approved leg- 
islation in excluding the Chinaman from our gates, 
not for his ignorance, vice or corruption, but because 
he sought to establish an inferior race in a republic 
fashioned in the wisdom and defended by the blood 
of a homogeneous people. 
The Anglo-Saxon blood has dominated always and 
everywhere. It fed Alfred when he wrote the charter 
of English liberty; it gathered about Hampden as he 
stood beneath the oak; it thundered in Cromwell’s 
veins as he fought his king; it humbled Napoleon at 
Waterloo; it has touched the desert and jungle with 
undying glory; it carried the drum-beat of England 
around the world and spread on every continent the 
gospel of liberty and of God; it established this repub- 
lic, carved it from the wilderness, conquered it from

WHAT OF THE NEGRO. 65 
the Indians, wrested it from England, and at last, 
stilling its own tumult, consecrated it forever as the 
home of the Anglo-Saxon, and the theater of his 
transcending achievement. Never one foot of it can 
be surrendered while that blood lives in American 
veins, and feeds American hearts, to the domination 
of an alien and inferior race. 
And yet that is just what is proposed. Not in 
twenty years have we seen a day so pregnant with 
fate to this section as the sixth of next November. 
If President ‘Cleveland is then defeated, which God 
forbid, I believe these States will be led through sor- 
rows compared to which the woes of reconstruction 
will be as the fading dews of morning to the roaring 
flood. To dominate these States through the colored 
vote, with such aid as Federal patronage may de- 
bauch or Federal power determine, and thus through 
its chosen instruments perpetuate its rule, is in my 
opinion the settled purpose of the Republican party. 
I am appalled when I measure the passion in which 
this negro problem is judged by the leaders of the 
party. Fifteen years ago Vice-President Wilson said 
—and I honor his memory as that of a courageous 
man: “We shall not have finished with the South un- 
til we force its people to change their thought, and 
think as we think.” I repeat these words, for I 
heard them when a boy, and they fell on my ears as 
the knell of my people’s rights—‘“to change their 
thought, and make them think as we think.” Not 
enough to have conquered our armies—to have deci- 
mated our ranks, to have desolated our fields and re- 
duced us to poverty, to have struck the ballot from 
our hands and enfranchised our slaves—to have held 
us prostrate under bayonets while the insolent 
mocked and thieves plundered—but their very souls 
must be rifled of their faiths, their sacred traditions 
Gns

cudgeled from memory, and their immortal minds 
beaten into subjection until thought had lost its in- 
tegrity, and we were forced “to think as they think.” 
And just now General Sherman has said, and I honor 
him as a soldier: 
“The negro must be allowed to vote, and his vote 
must be counted ; otherwise, so stire as there is a God 
in heaven, you will have another war, more cruel than 
the last, when the torch and dagger will take the place 
of the muskets of well-ordered battalions. Should the 
negro strike that blow, in seeming justice, there will 
be millions to assist them.” 
And this general took Johnson’s sword in surren- 
der! He looked upon the thin and ragged battalions 
in gray, that for four years had held his teeming and 
heroic legions at bay. Facing them, he read their 
courage in their depleted ranks, and gave them a sol- 
dier’s parole. When he found it in his heart to taunt 
these heroes with this threat, why—careless as he was 
twenty years ago with fire, he is even more careless 
now with his words. If we could hope that this prob- 
lem would be settled within our lives I would appeal 
from neither madness nor unmanliness. But when I 
know that, strive as I may, I must at last render this 
awful heritage into the untried hands of my son, al- 
ready dearer to me than my life, and that he must in 
turn bequeath it unsolved to his children, I cry out 
against the inhumanity that deepens its difficulties 
with this incendiary threat, and beclouds its real issue 
with inflaming passion. 
This problem is not only enduring, but it is widen- 
ing. The exclusion of the Chinese is the first step in 
the revolution that shall save liberty and law and re- 
ligion to this land, and in peace and order, not en- 
forced on the gallows, or at the bayonet’s end, but 
proceeding from the heart of an harmonious peo-

ple, shail secure in the enjoyment of the rights, and 
the control of this republic, the homogeneous people 
that established and has maintained it. The next 
step will be taken when some brave statesman, look- 
ing Demagogy in the face, shall move to call to the 
stranger at our gates, “Who comes there?” admit- 
ting every man who seeks a home, or honors our in- 
stitutions, and whose habit and blood will run with 
the native current; but excluding all who seek to 
plant anarchy or to establish alien men or measures 
on our soil; and will then demand that the standard 
of our citizenship be lifted and the right of acquiring 
our suffrage be abridged. When that day comes, and 
God speed its coming, the position of the South will 
be fully understood, and everywhere approved. Until 
then, let us—giving the negro every right, civil and 
political, measured in that fullness the strong should 
always accord the weak—holdng him in closer friend- 
ship and sympathy than he is held by those who would 
crucify us for his sake—realizing that on his prosper- 
ity ours depends—let us resolve that never by exter- 
nal pressure, or internal division, shall he establish 
domination, directly or indirectly, over that race that 
everywhere has maintained its supremacy. Let this 
resolution be cast on the lines of equity and justice. 
Let it be the pledge of honest, safe and impartial ad- 
ministration, and we shall command the support of 
the colored race itself, more dependent than any other 
on the bounty and protection of government. Let us 
be wise and patient, and we shall secure through its 
acquiescence what otherwise we should win through 
conflict, and hold in insecurity. 
All this is no unkindness to the negro—but rather 
that he may be led in equal rights and in peace to his 
uttermost good. Not in sectionalism—for my heart 
beats true to the Union, to the glory of which your

life and heart is pledged. Not in disregard of the 
world’s opinion—for to render back this problem in the 
world’s approval is the sum of my ambition, and the 
height of human achievement. Not in reactionary 
spirit—but rather to make clear that new and grander 
way up which the South is marching to higher des- 
tiny, and on which I would not halt her for all the 
spoils that have been gathered unto parties since Cati- 
line conspired, and Caesar fought. Not in passion, 
my countrymen, but in reason—not in narrowness, 
but in breadth—that we may solve this problem in 
calmness and in truth, and lifting its shadows let per- 
petual sunshine pour down on two races, walking to- 
gether in peace and contentment. Then shall this 
problem have proved our blessing, and the race that 
threatened our ruin work our salvation as it fills our 
fields with the best peasantry the world has ever seen. 
Then the South—putting behind her all the achieve- 
ments of her past—and in war and in peace they beg- 
gar eulogy—may stand upright among the nations 
and challenge the judgment of man and the approval 
of God, in having worked out in their sympathy, and 
in His guidance, this last and surpassing miracle of 
human government.

AGED EX-SLAVES GATHER AT HOME OF OLD 
MASTER. 
By ROBERT TIMMONS. 
Palmetto, Ga., September 26.—(Special.)—In sharp 
contrast to the bloody scene which was enacted in 
this town in April, 1899, when the riot occurred in 
which three negroes were shot down by a mob after 
they had been placed under arrest for attempting to 
burn the town, was the peaceful and altogether 
unique scene which was witnessed at the old Menefee 
homestead when fifteen negroes, all ex-slaves, gath- 
ered in a reunion at the home of their former master 
here to-day. 
Never before in the history of Georgia, and prob- 
ably never before in the history of the South, was 
there just such a gathering as that at this old South- 
ern plantation. 
The idea of holding this reunion at the home of 
their former master, who has been dead for a number 
of years, was conceived by one of the negroes pres- 
ent, and when it was suggested to the other ex-slaves 
it was received with their heartiest approval. Omy 
‘one of the negroes who was present at the retinion is 
a resident of Palmetto, all the others coming from a 
distance and from different points in the State. The 
oldest member of the party, “Uncle” Edmund Mene- 
fee, who is 80 years old, came from near Hiram, Ga., 
in Cobb county, and walked the entire distance, about 
fifty miles, in order that he might see once more the

old homestead and the other slaves with whom he was. 
associated when a young man. 
Several of the negroes who attended the reunion 
are residents of Atlanta and came down on the morn- 
ing train, returning to the city in the evening. 
The negroes who were present and who came from 
different parts of the State to attend the reunion were 
“Uncle” Edmund Menefee, of Cobb county; “Uncle” 
Lev Menefee, of 19 Wilson street, Atlanta; Willis 
Menefee Randall, of 156 Magnolia street, Atlanta; 
Fielding Menefee, of Cobb county; Wilson Menefee 
and Stewart Menefee, of Atlanta; Clarke Menefee and 
Taylor Slaughter, of Campbell county; Easter Men- 
efee, Amanda Menefee and Gabriel Menefee, of Cobb 
county, and his mother, “Aunt” Hennie Menefee, the 
old family cook, who estimates her age at 90 years; 
Jennie Menefee, John Menefee and Harvie Menefee. 
These are the only living ex-slaves of about 125 
who belonged to the estate of Major Menefee, and 
who were given their freedom by him after the war 
had closed. As was customary after being given their 
freedom, the negroes took the name of their former 
master. 
Each of these negroes is well-to-do, many of them 
are property owners. Most of them followed the bus- 
iness which was taught them as slaves, that of tilling 
the soil. They say they are in the South to stay. It 
was estimated that the value of the property owned 
by them is about $10,000. 
The white persons who were present and witnessed 
the celebration of these ex-slaves were: Mrs, M. A. 
Wiley, of Palmetto; Mrs. S. M. Dean, of Atlanta; 
Mrs. John H. Covin, of Hogansville, all daughters of 
Major Willis Menefee; Dr. W. S, Zellars, one of the 
oldest inhabitants of Palmetto, who was the physician 
employed by Major Menefee to attend the slaves be-

fore the war; Mrs. Maggie Dean Morris, of Atlanta; 
Willis Menefee Timmons, of Atlanta; Mrs. E. K. 
Farmer, of Fitzgerald, Ga.; Miss Stevie Timmons, of 
Atlanta; Mrs. Howard Wooding, of Hogansviile; 
B. E. L. Timmons, Jr., of Inman; Thomas Covin, of 
Hogansville, and B. H. Timmons, of Atlanta, all 
grandchildren of Major Menefee, and Miss Mabel 
Brown and Mrs. T. P. Zellars, together with several 
other friends of the family. 
The old Menefee home is located about half a mile 
from the center of town, and is a typical ante-bellum 
residence. It is situated some distance back from the 
road and is reached by a broad gravel walk leading 
up to the large stone steps between an avenue of 
cedar trees. As it was before the war the large yard 
immediately in front of the house is filled with all 
kinds of beautiful and sweet smelling flowers, vines 
and shrubbery indigenous to Southern soil, among 
which the humming birds flit on their honey-gather- 
ing expeditions all during the summer days. 
In front of the house, across the Atlantic & West 
Point railroad, and to the rear, after passing a pine 
and oak grove, stretch acres and acres of rich corn 
and cotton fields which compose the plantation. The 
home and plantation is now owned by Mrs. M. A. 
Wiley, the oldest living daughter of Major Menefee. 
When the old ex-slaves began to arrive in the 
morning it was an interesting sight to a member of a 
younger generation of whites to watch them as they 
wandered about over the place, viewing the scenes so 
familiar to them in the days before the war when they 
were a part of the property which made up this South- 
ern plantation. Many of them had never visited the 
plantation since several years after the war, when 
they left to provide for themselves. 
The intensely religious nature, so characteristic of

the negro, was clearly shown as they walked about 
the yard and through the house with uncovered heads 
to show their reverence for the place where they had 
spent what each said was the happiest period of their 
lives. A touching scene was witnessed when they 
were carried into the spacious parlor of the home and 
shown the portrait of their former master. They 
stood with bowed heads, many of them weeping, and 
each speaking with praise unrestrained of the master 
who had treated them so kindly when they were 
slaves. 
They visited the dairy, the stables, the apple or- 
chard and the hill in the rear of the “big” house, 
where was situated the “quarters” during the time 
they lived on the plantation as slaves. Many interest- 
ing incidents of the former days were remembered 
and recited in their quaint negro dialect by the older 
members of the party. 
At the noon hour, as was her edetom before the 
war, old “Aunt” Hennie, the cook, blew the conch 
shell which had so often called them to their meals, 
and they gathered under the wide-spreading oaks in 
the rear of the house, where a table loaded down with 
good things to eat had been prepared for them. ‘ 
After the meal was finished the children and grand- 
children of their former master gathered in the yard 
under the tree and listened to the negroes as they re- 
lated incidents of the days of Say before and dur- 
ing the war. 
They never tired of singing the praise of their mas- 
r, “Marse Willis,” and their mistress, “Miss Jan- 
nette.” They told of how well they had been treated 
as slaves and of how, though they wanted freedom, 
yet when freedom came they wanted to remain on the 
same plantation and continue to work for their mis- 
tress, after the death of their master. They told of

how their master had taught them to be religious, te 
be neat and clean, to be always honest and give the 
proper respect to the whites. These lessons, they said, 
had remained with them and they were teaching them 
to their children, 
“Uncle” Edmund, the oldest member of the party, 
and the one who had walked fifty miles to attend the 
reunion, told of how he had remained with his mis- 
tress during the war and had gladly protected her, 
the children and the house while Sherman and his 
yankees were marching through Palmetto. 
Many old plantation melodies were sung and each 
one of the fifteen present joined in. The music was 
of that quaint, perfectly harmonious kind such as only 
negroes can make. 
The songs and stories continued till late in the 
afternoon, and before the gathering broke up it was 
agreed that each year the reunion would be held on 
the old plantation.

CouLD NoT DEPORT NEGRO IF SUCH WAS DESIRED~-THE 
RACES ARE MORE IN HARMONY THAN THEY HAVE 
BEEN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE CIVIL WAR. 
Ex-GOVERNOR W. J. NORTHEN, OF GEORGIA. 
In connection with the wide discussion concerning 
the subject of lynching, violence and mob jaw that has 
followed the publication of the communication of 
Bishop Candler on the matter in the Constitution, 
the following interview with former Governor W. J- 
Northen is sure to prove both interesting and profit- 
able. : 
It will be remembered in this connection that Mr. 
Northen has not only been a close and careful student 
of the entire subject, but was pertinently, if not per- 
sonally, responsible for the introduction of the anti- 
lynching legislation during his term of office whick 
still presents the legal side of the matter in the State 
statutes of Georgia. 
Former Governor Northen also furnishes in the 
interview certain statistics and chapters of history re- 
garding the anti-lynching movement that are abso- 
lutely essential in the discussion of the subject. Per- 
haps the greatest and most prominent feature brought 
out by this student is his cheerful, optimistic view of 
the situation and facts which prove that Georgia, at 
least, has traveled far on the road of solving this 
much mooted question. 
(7)
-P-A-G-E-79
RACES IN HARMONY. 15 
Where some men have painted the South as a dan- 
gerous and unsafe place to live in, he points with facts: 
rather than arguments to prove that home, sweet 
home, is never sweeter and safer than right among 
the green fields of Georgia. Where some point to the 
exile or ostracism of the negro as the only solution, 
ex-Governor Northen shows that the problem is al- 
ready well advanced toward a peaceful and satisfac- 
tory settlement in a better understanding between the 
two races. 
While he opposes lynching and mob violence from 
any standpoint, he seems to almost deplore the fact 
that there is not some greater punishment for the 
crime of rape than the sentence of death, which the 
law provides. He criticises, too, the unscrupulous 
press in painting a reign of lawlessness and carnage 
regardless of facts that furnishes erroneous impres- 
sions that are quickly grasped by the newspapers of 
the North and reprinted to show that the South is still 
grappling with a problem that makes a visit to Dixie 
land a trip attended with jeopardy while the erection 
of a home in the Southland demands little less than 
military protection. 
‘When approacheed on the subject, ex-Governor 
Northen said that he had kept up with the discussions. 
of the matter as they have appeared in the newspa- 
pers. He was strongly of the opinion that no consid- 
erable portion of the people of the South were in fa- 
vor of mob violence or lynch law, while so far as: 
Georgia is concerned, he said that he could state au- 
thoritatively that the sentiment was in favor of allow- 
ing the law to take its course in the settlement of jus- 
tice. 
“Tf you will pardon the personal reference, let me 
say, during my administration I had occasion to make 
a very thorough official investigation, that fully satis-
-P-A-G-E-80
76 RACES IN HARMONY, 
fied me that the people of this State, as a body, were 
in the fullest sympathy with the administration of the 
law and that they were ready to uphold it at any and 
all hazard, whatever the nature of the crime demand- 
ing punishment.” 
In further proof of his confidence in the people he 
said: 
“When I left the capitol I left on file a mass of cor- 
respondence covering, to my satisfaction, the position 
of the people of this State on mob violence and lynch- 
ing. Taking as the starting point, I filed the admira- 
ble essay by the then distinguished Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court, as read before the State Bar Associa- 
tion, pleading for the maintenance of the law and the 
authority of the courts in the prosecution of criminals 
and the punishments for crime, whatever the viola- 
tion and however damnable the outrage. The courts, 
he proclaimed, are sufficient and he inveighed strong- 
ly against the fury and the wreck of a maddened mob. 
“Apprehending that I might have occasion to en- 
force the observance of the law in the suppression of 
a mob, I addressed letters to the daily newspapers in 
the State to know whether I would be supported in 
the policy. From every daily paper I received not 
only favorable replies, but in each case the statements 
were very strongly put. 
“T then addressed letters to each one of the supe- 
rior court judges and the solicitors general of the sev- 
eral courts, to know whether or not they were in sym- 
pathy with the sentiments of the distinguished Chief 
Justice as expressed in the essay to which I have al- 
luded. To aman I found them to be just as strong. 
“Following the matter further, I wrote to the sher- 
iffs over the State and I found them ready to support 
the law to the fullest extent of their authority. 
“All this correspondence I left on file at the capitol,
-P-A-G-E-81
RACES IN HARMONY. 7 
attesting the loyalty of the officers of the State to the 
majesty of the law. 
“When the General Assembly met I had a conference 
with prominent members of the judiciary committee 
as to the sufficiency of law for the punishment of mob 
violence and kindred lawlessness, and it was agreed 
that absolute security would be effected by some addi- 
tional legislation. Hon. Warner Hill, chairman of 
this committee, was selected to frame such statute, 
and it passed both houses without a dissenting vote.- 
This statute authorizes the sheriff or other officer in 
charge to suppress mob violence by arresting the par- 
ties so engaged and placing them in the common jail 
to be dealt with as the law directs; it declares that 
any citizen engaged in mobbing or lynching is guilty 
of felony and on conviction to be punished by impris- 
onment in the penitentiary; and should death result 
from such mob violence the person causing said death 
shall be subject to indictment and trial for murder. 
The statute further provides that the sheriff shall be 
punished for failure to do his duty. The law gives the 
sheriff authority to summon to his aid, with arms, any 
number of citizens he may need to suppress the mob, 
and to take human life, if it be necessary, to enforce 
the law. 
“When this bill became law I sent a copy to each 
sheriff in the State, accompanied by the following let- 
er: 
“ ‘State of Georgia, Executive Department, Atlan- 
ta, Ga., December 19, 1893.—My ,Dear Sir: I enclose 
you herewith copy of bill introduced by Hon. Warner 
Hill, passed unanimously by the recent General As- 
sembly, and approved this day. 
“*T send you the bill thus early that you may at 
once know its provisions and that I may apprise you 
of the authority given you in the Act, as well as the
-P-A-G-E-82
78 RACES IN HARMONY. 
responsibility now put upon you to preserve the peace 
cand honor of the State. 
“The General Assembly, by unanimous action, has 
pronounced death by mob violence murder, and de- 
‘clared that all citizens who become parties thereto 
are subject to indictment and trial under such charge. 
You will observe, further, that the Act not only au- 
thorizes you to summon to your aid any and all the 
‘citizens of your county, in your efforts to suppress 
mob violence and lawlessness, but it very properly 
pronounces failure to respond on the part of such cit- 
izens so summoned a misdemeanor, and upon convic- 
tion they will be duly punished under the law. 
“T can hardly believe that any officer of the law in 
this State will so far fail in duty as to deserve the pun- 
‘ishment prescribed in section 2 of this Act, yet I am 
candid to say that I suggested and I am, therefore, 
responsible for this enactment, as I desired to make it 
absolutely certain that another case of mob violence 
should never be possible in this State. 
“The Act, therefore, compels both the citizen and 
‘the officer to discharge their duties under penalty of 
the law. 
“The honor of the State, as far as your jurisdic- 
tion extends, is now in your hands, and I shall watch 
with great interest the outcome of this new legisla- 
tion. 
“Your strong letter, received some months ago, 
-assuring me of your determined purpose to aid in sup- 
pressing lawlessness, has had much to do with the 
passage of this bill, and I am constrained to believe 
you will do your whole duty and that mob law in 
Georgia is now at an end. 
“AW. J. NORTHEN, Governor.’ 
“I have given you these facts to demonstrate three 
things:
-P-A-G-E-83
RACES IN HARMONY. 79 
“t, That every court officer is fully ready to do his 
full duty in the enforcement of the law. 
“2. That the machinery of the courts is sufficient 
to punish adequately and fully, as provided by law, 
every crime possible to human villainy. 
“3. That the sentiment of the people in this State 
is strongly against mob violence, especially as ex- 
pressed in lynching. If this were not true, the news- 
papers in the State would not have given to me the 
expressions stated to you a moment ago. If it were 
not true, the bill that became law would not have 
passed the General Assembly of the State without 2 
dissenting vote. The lawmakers represented the peo- 
ple, and they put the views of the people into State 
enactment. The sentiment of the people of this State 
is unquestionably against mob violence and lynching.” 
In answer to the question as to whether or not 
there had been lynchings since the enactment of that 
law, he replied: 
“Yes, and there have been in this State and every 
other State violations of every criminal law in the 
Code, but that does not indicate that the people are 
not pronounced against such iniquities. The question 
to which I am making reply is: Does any considera- 
ble portion of the people at the South favor mob vio- 
lence or lynch law?” 
When asked to suggest some remedy, the ex-Goy- 
ernor continued : 
“T believe the people in the rural districts are as 
much entitled to police protection as the people in 
the cities. I do not make the suggestion because of 
the presence of the negroes any more than I would 
make the suggestion to the cities because of their 
absence, but on general conditions that demand pro- 
tection. Every county in this State and in every other 
State, North or South, should have a police force

efficient and active. The sheriff should be chief of 
such county police, and see that they are vigilant. 
This will not only largely eliminate the little remain- 
ing spirit there is still among our people to deal sum- 
mary vengeance upon outlaws, but it would furnish 
such protection as to prevent crimes of all kinds in 
the rural sections. It is well to say, as you have, 
doubtless, oberved, that there has been not only less 
occasion for mob violence because of assaults, but 
that the people have more generally refrained from 
violence and awaited action by the courts. The rela- 
tions between the races are not so antagonistic as for- 
merly, but far more cooperative. To believe this, 
you have only to recall the conditions that existed 
soon after the war when the ku-klux were believed 
to be necessary to the safety of the people. After 
these, came the vigilance committees, and now, if we 
had the county police, regulated by law, the situation 
would be largely, if not completely, met. 
“Next, I would be glad to see the sheriffs devote 
one entire session of their State convention to the 
discussion of matters pertaining to their duties in sub- 
duing mobs and enforcing the law. Such discussion 
will not only bring helpful suggestions to officers of 
the law, but it will tend to create most healthful pub- 
lic opinion and establish authority. 
“The great objection, as stated oftentimes, is the 
necessity for the presence of the outraged victim be- 
fore the court during the trial of the alleged outlaw. 
To remedy this, I call your attention to a provision of 
the Code of 1882, section 4663, as follows: 
. “It shall be the duty of the judges of the superior 
courts to make a special report annually to the Gov- 
ernor of this State previous to the meeting of the 
General Assembly, and by him to be submitted to the 
Legislature, of all such defects, omissions or imper-
-P-A-G-E-85
RACES IN HARMONY. 81 
fections in this Code, as experience on their several 
circuits may suggest.’ Surely, the judiciary of the 
State can suggest some enactment that will meet the 
demands of the case and prevent the humiliation com- 
plained of in case of court trial. ; 
“After having expressed myself thus far at your re- 
quest, may I now be allowed to say there has been a 
good deal of morbid and extravagant statements 
about conditions at the South upon the subject of out- 
rages and lynchings. There is not a better civilization 
in any State or section in this Union than in Georgia, 
and at the South. I have lived here all my life, and I 
have been all over the United States, and I have yet 
to find a place for which I would exchange a home 
in Georgia or at the South. I have lived among ne- 
groes all my life, and, like the distinguished bishop, 
I do not want to live where there are none. I will’ 
trust them in every relation far more confidently than 
I would the mongrel population of self-announced 
socialists, anarchists and outlaws, who do the menial 
service of other sections. We do not want to deport 
the negroes. We could not if we so desired. How 
can you force 10,000,000 of people to leave the coun- 
try, when they exercise the same civil rights as are 
accorded to you? If they consented to go, where is 
the country accessible in which they would be more 
acceptable than to you? Who would receive them, 
if you cast them off? They now have to their credic 
upon the tax books more than a half billion dollars 
worth of property. Who would buy at the prices they 
would, later, demand for their holdings? Uf these 
conditions were all met, the expense of transportation 
would burden the government beyond recovery in 
its most prosperous days. Who would buy for them 
their furnishings and the lands upon which they n must 
settle?

“The negro furnishes almost exclusively the farm 
labor at the South. If all other possible conditions 
could be met satisfactorily their leaving in a body or 
gradually would paralyze the agricultural conditions 
at the South beyond recovery for three generations. 
Let it be understood that the negroes are here to stay, 
and we are going to see that they behave themselves 
or punish them with the extreme penalty of the law 
when they deserve and give them fullest credit when 
their conduct so demands. 
“The better classes of thé negroes have shown them- 
selves quite as much in favor of the death penalty 
for the outlaws of their race who commit assaults as 
are the white people themselves. There is no longer 
that disposition to conceal and protect these crimi- 
nals against full and proper punishment. When this 
punishment is administered uniformly by due process 
of law and not by the barbarous burnings by the mob, 
you will find the most active co-operation on their part 
in bringing the criminal to the tribunal designated to 
punish crime. 
“For all these years I have had occasion to watch 
closely the relations between the races in this State, 
and I say to you, most positively, there has not been 
a time since the war when we were more in harmony 
than we are to-day. 
“Have you not observed that a great deal of mis- 
information is given to the press and scattered over 
the country to the great damage of our honor as a 
State and our best material interests? A case in point 
occurred only a short time since when we were told 
that a white man and a negro had committed an out- 
rage on an old white woman in one of our lower coun- 
ties and that both these outlaws had been promptly 
lynched. The next day we were told the outrages had 
not been committed, and, of course, the lynching had

not taken place. Again, we constantly see something 
like this : ‘A villanious negro committed a fearful crime 
in this community yesterday and he is being pursued 
by an infuriated crowd of men. He will be lynched 
as soon as captured.” Why not wait until the lynch- 
ing occurs? There seems to be a morbid appetite on 
the part of some correspondents and some newspa- 
pers that are afraid of being ‘scooped’ and it is grati- 
fied to the great damage of our civilization and the 
honor of the State. 
“There is no crime known to me more villainous 
and damning than the one unnamed. If there were 
‘punishment greater than death I would be glad to see 
it administered to the guilty outlaw, under due pro- 
cess of law before the courts, but I protest now, as I 
have for all these years, against mob Jaw and lynch- 
ing. Our law properly pronounces such brutality 
murder, and no crime, however heinous, can justify 
it. I have shown you that our people do not counte- 
nance it, and any statement to the contrary is untrue. 
We are now putting all the idle negroes to work and 
the better negroes are helping to this end. Vice and 
crime have greatly decreased among them and we are 
practically free from trouble. Let us stop the contin- 
ued abuse of the negro and rather help him to be use- 
ful to himself and the community. Commend him 
freely and generously and publicly, if you will, when 
he does well, and punish him severely in the courts 
when he is vicious, and let that be the end of it. We | 
have no occasion for a constant crying out. We have 
peace and abundant prosperity. Just let us say so, 
publish the crimes of the people if it is best, but let us 
be sure they have been committed before we say so.”

MUST PUT DOWN THE MOB OR BE PUT 
DOWN BY IT. 
By BISHOP WARREN A. CANDLER, D.D., 
Of the Methodist Church. 
The lynching mania can no longer be considered a 
local, or sectional evil. It has spread to every part of 
our country and shows itself as the manifestation of 
a spirit that deserves the reprobation of the good. 
everywhere without regard to party or place. 
It is something worse than unfair for the people of 
the North to treat the subject as if it were a peculiar 
sin of the South, and it is something worse than a 
mistake for the people of the South to defend it as if 
it were their especial besetment about which they felt 
a self-convicting sensitiveness. It is the duty of all 
good people in every part of our country to unite in 
putting down the mob. For let us be well assured . 
that the good people will put down the mob, or the 
mob will put down the good people. 
When a lynching occurs, the law is more truly 
lynched than is the victim of the mob’s fury. It is an 
outburst of anarchy, and not an eruption of righteous. 
indignation against an atrocious crime. 
In defense of lynching, it is sometimes said: “Stoo 
the outrages that provoke lynching and the lynching 
will cease.” But pray tell which outrage is meant? 
If reference to the horrible crime of rape is intended, 
it is enough to say in reply that it is not the cause of 
one-fourth the lynchings which occur in the United 
States. Two years since, for example, the figures for 
(84)

MUST PUT DOWN THE MOB. 85 
a year showed only sixteen cases of ravishing against 
128 lynchings. In the case at Evansville, Ind., the 
original sin which gave rise to the lynching was the 
shooting of a policeman. But the mob sent a load of 
buckshot into the breast of a young girl of 15 years of 
age, who was in no wise involved. How can such 
reckless fury ever cure crime, or arrest disorder? Is 
there one home more secure or one life more safe by 
reason of such horrible outbursts? 
Who composed this Indiana mob? Were its lead- 
‘ers men who were incontrollably jealous for morality 
and justice? On the contrary, the arrests made sub- 
sequent to the lynching showed among the leaders 
three professional gamblers, three men known to the 
‘police as desperate characters, and one man who had 
been guilty of killing another some years ago. Is t 
not clear that this lynching was fomented and carried 
out by a lot of blood-thirsty scapegraces, who had not 
the slightest interest in anything good? ‘They are 
the sort who find pleasure in the bloody brutalities of 
the prize fight. And yet men of respectability were 
found foolish enough to apologize for the atrocities. 
And such are the men, generally, who organize 
mob violence. How delighted they must be when 
decent people rush into print to defend, if not to eulo- 
gize, their diabolical deeds! Is it not time decent 
people put their pens to better use? The mob which 
they eulogize to-day will turn upon its defenders to- 
morrow. The taste for blood grows with indulgence. 
Lynch law, I repeat, is anarchy, and anarchy is al- 
ways the forerunner of destruction in republics. This 
evil strikes at the very heart of our civil institutions. 
Tf unchecked it will increase, and eventually become 
unendurable by the vicious even. Men will grow so 
weary of it that they will welcome any sort of strong 
hand which will undertake to put it down, even the
-P-A-G-E-90
86 MUST PUT DOWN THE MOB. 
hand of tyranny. They will argue that the tyranny 
of one strong, wise man is preferable to the many- 
headed tyranny of a brainless mob, as, indeed, it is. 
Then the hour for the “man on horseback” will have 
struck and he will appear. The anarchy of Sulla and 
Marius produced Caesarism, with all the dreadful con- 
sequences it drew after it. The spirit of mobocracy 
in the Grecian republics made Philip of Macedon pos- 
sible and opened the way for Alexander. Robespierre 
and his rioters gave Napoleon his chance. They slew 
the liberty which they professed to love. 
And let no man suppose that such an outcome is 
impossible in our land and time. The American peo- 
ple are as quick as any to adore a military hero, and 
they can make one out of as small amount of the raw 
material as any nation that ever kissed 4 sword or 
bowed to a plume. Witness the election of Jackson 
and the “rough rider” to the highest office. More- 
over, it should be remembered that we turn out of 
the military academy of the nation annually more 
‘than a hundred young men, whose future turns on 
the use of the sword. They are generally men of 
worldly honor and ambition. Many of them come 
from influential families, and have the influence of 
such connections back of them. Would it be a 
strange thing if in all their number there should be 
found one capable of seizing power in the name of 
order? Or, would it be a matter of wonder if the 
people, having grown weary of disorder, should glad- 
ly welcome a strong, educated man of honor, who 
should appear and promise them peace and security” 
Stranger things have happened. 
Depend upon it, no nation ever retains liberty after 
it ceases to maintain law. Lynch law protects no 
home, but does rather pull down the strongest de- 
fense of all the homes in the commonwealth. Our
-P-A-G-E-91
MUST PUT DOWN THE MOB. 87 
homes are sheltered by law, and they are not shielded 
by lawlessness. 
We have problems enough to solve in this country, 
to be sure. But we have no problem which cannot 
be solved by the practice of personal and civic right- 
eousness every day. The man who will not try that 
remedy has no right to propose any other. In the 
end, all other solutions will be found worse than vain. 
With reference to the various picturesque propos- 
als which are periodically made to cure all our ills, it 
is, perhaps, not unkind to say that the silence of their 
authors would be more valuable than their speech. 
It seems that there is a certain amount of periodical 
space to be filled and a certain number of men who 
live by filling it with their pieces. When the weather 
gets warm and they find it hard to write anything 
that will be read what else can these men do but 
fall to solving all the problems of the nation-——the 
South in particular—in order to settle their own 
pressing question, “How shall I manage to say some- 
thing that will sell and provide for my board bill?” 
And then, too, the “chautauqua season” is a very dan- 
gerous period of the year, especially during those 
years when the Congress of the United States is not 
in session and the thrifty statesman who is deficient 
in a sense of responsibility for his words, is “out for 
the stuff,” and when platform managers, who have an 
eye for gate receipts only, are out hunting for “draw- 
ing” sensationalists, without regard for the kind of 
things that the sensation-mongers may pour out of 
their easy-acting mouths. 
What a pity these men undertake to handle mat- 
ters so serious and so complex! Yea, what a peril! 
Adventurous sportsmen discharging firearms in a 
powder-house would not be a greater menace to good 
order and security.
-P-A-G-E-92

Good men, helped of God, can solve all our ques- 
tions if they can only find a way to muzzle the agita- 
tors, or if they can find a way to switch the agitators 
off on subjects that they can talk about without en- 
dangering the peace of society. I think, for example, 
that the race question could be settled if we can find 
out how to silence men who make merchandise out 
of its discussion. For one, I am not nearly so afraid 
of the race question as I am of the race of “chautau- 
‘qua platformers and performers!” The apprehension 
of the mischief they may do to all the races in our 
country haunts me all through the dog-days. I know 
how to get on with the negroes, for I was brought up 
with them. But one of these problem-solving talkers 
scares me. I am not afraid of him fot what he really 
is, but for what some well-meaning people may take 
him to be. A bleating calf jumping suddenly from 
undet a chinquapin bush may make a really gentle 
horse run away; or a moon-eyed horse hitched along- 
side a reliable nag may shy at what he thinks is a 
bogie and frighten his mate into the most dangerous 
misbehavior. It is thus some good men have been 
led to apologize for lynching. They have seen night- 
mares until they are prepared to conjure with a real 
horror in order to down a ghost. 
‘The situation in the South is one of difficulty, of 
course. So is the situation in Chicago, or that of 
Paris, or that of London, or that of New York. Our 
homes in the South are safer than the homes of Chi- 
cago. Give me the negro any time, in preference to 
the anarchists and free lovers. In fact, I do not wish 
to live in any country where there are no negroes. 
But if our difficulties were a thousand-fold greater 
than they are, lynchings would not remove them. 
Such deeds of lawlessness multiply all our troubles. 
If these things must be anywhere in our country, let

them be confined to the North, where a denser popu- 
lation, composed of all sorts of heterogeneous ele- 
ments, furnish greater provocations to them, and, per- 
force, more excuse for them. 
We do not want any such barbarities to defend our 
Southern civilization.

RACES MUST SEPARATE, ASSERTS BISHOP 
TURNER. 
One of the features of the mass meeting yesterday 
afternoon at the People’s tabernacle was the address 
of Bishop Henry M. Turner on the subject, “Is the 
Pulpit Equal to the Times? If so, Why this Quibble 
that Frightens the Common People and Seeming!y 
Paralyzes Labor in the Farming Sections?” 
Bishop Turner devoted a considerable portion of 
his time in replying to Dr. H. S. Bradley, who in an 
address last Monday declared that the separation of 
the races was a chimerical proposition. Bishop Tur- 
ner declared that separation of the races was the 
only solution of the race problem, though he did not 
expect all the negroes to rush out of the country. 
What he wishes is for the negro to be given an oppor- 
tunity to go to Africa if he so desires. : 
He spoke as follows: 
“Mr. Chairman—Among the remarks that I shall. 
make on this occasion will be a few in reply to Rev. 
Dr. H. S. Bradley, who fills one of the first pulpits of 
Atlanta, and is the pastor of a congregation cultured 
and refined. 
“T venerate the distinguished divine, Rev. Dr. H. 
S. Bradley, scholarly, eloquent, humane, as he is, and. 
I believe he is a Christian gem of the first water. In- 
deed, I have received a personal recognition from: 
him that I have been accorded by no other white min- 
ister in the city of Atlanta, while all have treated me 
with respect. But it so happens that God made me 
out of that kind of material which enables me to rise

above personal considerations sufficiently to agree 
with my enemies and differ with my friends when the: 
question at issue requires it. Personal likes and dis- 
likes have nothing to do with my honest opinions. 
“The learned doctor last Monday night, the 21st: 
instant, delivered an elegant and rhetorical speech be- 
fore a mass meeting of my race (and I was present) 
against the separation of the races—I mean the white 
and black races, or, as the Africans say, the Buchra 
man and the Otutu man. He hurled his florid re- 
marks against negro emigration, segregation, any 
form of separation or any movement that would con- 
template negro concretion, civilly or politically, and. 
as I saw it presented one of the most eloquent and il- 
logical addresses I have heard for a great while—not 
because he is wanting in logical ability and attain- 
ments, for I have heard him both in the pulpit, on the 
platform, and have read after him, but because he 
was handling a subject which he had never studied: 
with a view of its practical results, as the early his- 
tory of Rome, of North America, of South America 
and of Australia, and indeed the history of all peoples. 
and nations would have shown the folly of his posi- 
tion, For emigration is the philosophy of ancient 
and modern history. 
“The bulk of white men know but little about the 
inner feelings and idiosyncrasies of the negro, and 
when they speak about black men emigrating to bet- 
ter their conditions they signally fail by reason of the 
fact that it is not a question that concerns them 
enough to give it deep and protracted thought. I 
know there are many white men who ride into popu- 
larity by pretending to know all about the negro, but 
they only know the ignorant, and scullion side of him.. 
“In this country, where white represents God, and 
black the devil, but little thought is given to the black

man’s future. Everything that concerns the negro 
is whittled down to the present contingencies, and 
the eternal future which involves and comprehends 
change, revolution, mutation and the mighty destiny 
of races, is but little thought of, and if the negro does 
not think about it himself, it will receive but little at- 
tention and our status as a race, to use the language 
of the elder Judge Lumpkin, is so ignoble, and the 
foolish scarecrow of social equality has become such 
a hobgoblin with the ignorant masses, that we ate 
further apart in spirit and sympathy than heaven and 
hell. We are as ignorant of each other as races as if 
we did not live in the same world. The very condi- 
tions that surround and confront us forbid a white 
man from having any real knowledge of the negro, 
and I could bring a hundred illustrations to establish 
this fact. It was verified the other night in Dr. Brad- 
ley’s address when he said the negroes were Ameri- 
can citizens, and do not wish to be segregated. I 
grant that the doctor represented a large portion, for 
as the Savannah News says, “The negro is not yet a 
nation building race,’ but if he will put a steamer’ be- 
tween here and Africa and make the rates of travel as 
cheap as white emigrants get from Europe to Amer- 
ica 4,000,000 will leave as soon as they can adjust their 
little affairs. While I am not burdened to death with 
intelligence, I have too much sense to say that ail 
would go. I do not know as half would go. Jahn in 
his Biblical archaeology says that not half of the chil- 
dren of Israel ever left Egypt for the promised land, 
but the vast multitude which remained has never been 
heard of from that day till this. No people in the 
world’s history, who were not self-reliant and who are 
not prompted by their inner nature to sue for better 
conditions, have ever reached the plane of respecta- 
bility. Indeed, they are invariably crushed out of ex-

istence and exterminated. I have been reading his- 
tory fifty years and over and if there is any exception 
to this rule, outside possibly of the Saxons who were 
absorbed, and also did much of the absorbing by vir- 
tue of being of the same color and having the most 
beautiful women on earth at that time, I would be 
pleased to have them pointed out. 
“The doctor says the negro is an American citizen. 
I wish he was correct. Twelve millions of colored 
people of the United States would throw their hats, 
parasols and umbrellas heaven high, if possible, if his 
declaration about the citizenship of the negro was a 
reality, or could be established. Surely the doctor has 
not been apprised of the fact that the conclave in 
Washington, D. C., called the United States Supreme 
Court, has issued a legislative decision taking away 
every vestige of his civil rights, and in the recent Ala- 
bama case has declared his political rights a nullity, 
and outside of the right to pay taxes and work on the 
roads he has not a single right that would, prompt 
him to be a man. I would mention the degradation 
this decision, or these decisions (for there are three 
of them), have inflicted upon the negro, in detail, but 
it would be too voluminous and do no good; but I 
will give $500 if any man will show me such a decis- 
ion from any court of last resort in the history of the 
world. Its uniqueness stands in the fact that they 
legislated and decided at the same time. No instance 
of the kind is found in the chronicles of the nation. 
“But just at this point I beg to ask the doctor if 
he could have any respect for a man, or any set of 
men, who would sit quietly under the condition of 
things that confront the negro in this country? If 
he wants to know what I mean, just let him color his 
face (for white is not a color) and..attempt to be a 
man and a gentleman for one day, and he will under-

stand the meaning thoroughly. We are daily the sub- 
jects of comment and misrepresentation. God :s 
charged with folly for attempting to make a man and 
failing to complete His job, and he is assigned to the 
realm of inferiority, and yet more laws have been en- 
‘acted by the different legislatures of the country, and 
more judicial decisions have been delivered and pro- 
claimed against this piece of inferiority called negro 
than have been issued against any people since time 
‘began. It would appear that the negro is the greatest 
man on earth if we are to judge from the judicial de- 
cisions in the code books of the country to keep him 
down. 
“The Pilgrim fathers did not have to contend with 
one-half of the legal fetters, but they left the old coun- 
try and sought a land where they could develop the 
mighty forces that heaven had implanted in their na- 
tures, and the result is a great and powerful people 
‘thave been developed. Which does the doctor have 
the highest respect for—the early settlers of Plymouth 
in Massachusetts and Jamestown, Va., or the docile 
negro who will not try to help himself? ‘ 
“T have been singled out in this country as the 
chief factor in the African emigration movement, and 
as such I believe that I have received all of a hundred 
thousand letters, some of them containing dozens and 
dozens of names, who are clamoring for transporta- 
tion conveniences and cheap rates from this to the 
land of our ancestors, so they can return to Africa 
without having to pay their way to New York City, 
then to Liverpool, England, and then to Africa, which 
they have to do at present, costing them more on the 
‘cars to New York than white people have to pay from 
‘Queenstown, Liverpool, Hamburg and other points 
to come to New York, Philadelphia, Boston, New 
Orleans and Savarinah.

“Think of it, 557 steamers, besides sailing ships, are 
hugging the shores of Africa the year round from 
Europe, and not one from the United States. These 
European steamers, carrying to her ports hundreds of 
millions, if not a billion dollars of commerce annu- 
ally, and not the worth of a nickel of commerce from 
the United States. Some of us have been trying for 
years to get this government to subsidize a ship for 
mail purposes, and let it serve as a transport for emi- 
gration and commerce, as a start to the movemen*, 
but up to the present our efforts have been fruitless. 
President Harrison would have done something, but 
he was afraid of public sentiment. President Cleve- 
land saw the philosophy of it, but was contending with 
the Hawaiian question and disposed of it by saying 
time would make it all right; and time will do it. 
This nation, or its aggregated people, will either have 
to open up a highway to Africa for the discontented 
black man or the negro question will flinder this gov- 
ernment. . 
“There will be no peace to the United States as 
long as the negro question is an issue. Might may 
hold the scepter and sway legislative and judicial pow-

but right will step to the front in its own good time 
and twist the scepter from the hands of might, for 
the reason that God is right. A United States Sena- 
tor from a Southern State said to me some time ago: 
‘I am opposed to your emigration agitation, espe- 
cially about returning to Africa in any numbers. You 
are keeping up an unnecessary excitement,’ but finally 
said: ‘Remember, Turner, that I am opposed to it as

“I do not regard Hon. John Temple Graves as the 
quintessence of infallibility, especially when he is dis- 
cussing and commenting upon the intellectual and 
moral status of my race, as he represented them in 
some respects, in Chautauqua and Chicago, while he 
only expressed the current opinion of the white people 
generally; but the remedy that he pointed out to the 
American people, in regard to the existing condition | 
of things, in my opinion, and in the opinion of sober 
thinking people generally, raises him to a national 
majesty, and makes him the greatest statesman and 
philosopher in the land. Among the notable and il- 
lustrious men of the country Mr. Graves towers above 
them all. Bismarck never offered to Germany, nor 
Gladstone to England, a wiser measure and a more 
philosophical proposition, than Mr. Graves has of- 
fered to the American people. He is evidently a wide- 
ly read scholar, a master logician, and has the courage 
of his convictions, and defies public criticism, when 
he tells the white and black man in this country they 
must separate, for separation is the ultimatum, and 
that alone will bring peace to this nation. 
“T will tell the black man what Mr. Graves thought, 
but was reluctant to express. Your. very existence 
depends upon separation. At present there is no 
Christian unity, much less civil and political unity. 
A shameful division prevails. 
“When I speak of separation I do not say that ev- 
erybody will go or must go. I am only contending 
that there should be a highway made across the At- 
Jantic (only 3,350 miles from the city hall of New 
York) for such black men and women as are self-re- 
liant and have those manhood aspirations that God 
planted in them and degrading laws will intensify. We

are not clamoring for rich men, or men of respectable 
means. We want smart, energetic and _ self-reliant 
men. If Australia could be made one of the greatest 
countries on earth by penal convicts, who would dare 
say that respectable colored men could not also 
build up a nation? 
“It was also proclaimed the other night that Libe- 
ria was a failure and had played out. I know Liberia. 
I know Muhlenburg Station. I presided over an an- 
nual conference there of ordained ministers, and I 
am prepared to say that a finer republic is not found 
on earth than Liberia, consisting of 35,000 civilized 
and a million and a half of heathen people. Monro- 
via, the capital, with a population of 6,000, is one of 
the most beautiful cities, as seen from the ocean, that 
either England or America can present. 
“The state house, presidential mansion, cabinet de- 
partments, and a score of cities in the republic, and 
the ships that stand in her various harbors, tell their 
own story, and there is not a bar-room in the republic 
to curse and ultimately damn her young men. If 
Georgia has played out, then Liberia has played out, 
but I grant that Liberia needs immigrants, and a 
number of business men to help develop and bring in- 
to utilization her resources. I mean her gold, silver, 
diamonds, coal and to till the richest soil om earth. 
“T must not make my remarks too long. Let me 
say, however, that the negro is the richest man in the 
world, if he had intelligence enough to know it. We 
will get that intelligence, however, in God’s own good 
time. The American negro, with a few exceptions, is 
the lowest specimen of the African tribes. The supe- 
rior African sold us inferior Africans to the white 
men. We were slaves hundreds and thousands of 
years to our African masters before we were sold to 
this country to become the slaves of our white mas-

ters; but this lower type has to return in numbers, to 
civilize and Christianize the higher type, and the white 
man has to help us to do it, and God will see he does 
it, or the nation that owes us $40,000,000,000 for two 
hundred years’ work performed and services rendered 
will commence to wane and end in broken fragments, 
like the Roman empire. I grant that the outlook for 
the future between the two races looks far more pa- 
cific than what it did. 
“The assistance rendered by our white friends to 
Morris Brown college, especially, where we hope to 
train African missionaries, and elevate that portion of 
our race, who will live and die here, seems to tinge the 
future with brighter prospects. But, God sent the ne- 
gro here through his negative providence, to imbibe 
civilization and Christianity from this giant white race, 
and then redeem the land of his ancestors, and he 
must do it and will, ultimately, do it.”

RACE SEGREGATION. 
An Address by BisHop Lucius H. Housey, D.D., of the C. 
M. E. Church, before the National Sociological Society, 
at the Lincoln Temple Congregational Church, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, and Fellow Citizens: Per- 
‘haps there is no question or problem that confronts 
the wisdom, the patriotism, and philanthropy of Amer- 
ican citizenship, greater and farther reaching in effect 
cand results than the perplexing and momentous ques- 
tion of the racial problem. 
According to public sentiment and private judg- 
ment, according to the construction of the fabric of 
society, the enactment of its laws and their execution, 
there is a serious racial question; a question that 
strikes deep into the recesses of American life, taking 
hold of the basis of government and its advancing 
and expanding civilization; a profound question, upon 
which hinges the peace, happiness, and prosperity of 
all the people, and the possibilities and destiny of a 
great African race. 
From any view-point we may take, it is silly, if not 
madness, to ignore or set at naught this great prob- 
lem of the races. That there is a problem, no one, 
who has surveyed the field and weighed and meas- 
ured the active and operative factors therein contain- 
ed, can deny. Seeking for the permanent adjustment 
of this question, and its satisfactory solution, a multi- 
plicity of theories, of many degrees and forms, have 
been presented for consideration. It also appeals to 
the candid thought of the North and of the South,

and to the patience of the black race, who, by no de- 
sign of their own, are yet the cause of conflicting 
forces. It may be presumed as axiomatic that to ev- 
ery problem that arises out of the government of a. 
nation ‘there may be found a method of adjustment 
and solution. Just as sure as all the parties concerned 
seek the solition with patriotism and philanthropic 
impulse, any question thus arising may be settled in 
a way to preserve the peace, protect the civil order,. 
and advance the interest of all. . 
As our subject is ‘‘race segregation,” or the separa- 
tion of the races, we shall state what is meant. Segre- 
gation does not mean colonization, exportation or 
emigration. It does not mean the banishment of Afro- 
Americans to any foreign country or realm, within 
the limits or beyond the limits of our flag. Neither 
does it mean for Afro-Americans to be sent to the 
Pacific islands, acquired and held by our Federal gov- 
ernment, but it means that the government set apart 
some territory, or parts of some of the public domain, 
for the specific purpose of forming a State or States 
for qualified Afro-American citizens. This is what we 
understand and advocate as segregation, and this is 
what we shall proceed to elaborate and set forth as: 
clearly and briefly as we can.’ 
The first reason for segregation lies in the domi- 
nant fact that the infinite volume of racial prejudice 
makes it impossible for the two separate and distinct 
races to live together in the same territory in harmo- 
nious relations, each demanding equal political rights: 
and equal citizenship. Whether prejudice is an at- 
tribute of human nature or the cultivated and cher- 
ished adjunct of circumstances is a subtle question 
which we do not now attempt to discuss. But we 
know from history and by experience that it does ex- 
ist, and it is as old as those racial traits of physicak
-P-A-G-E-105
RACE SEGREGATION. 101 
character by which one race is distinguished from an- 
other. Whether fundamental or cultivated, it has 
played a great part in the world’s civilization and the 
‘history of the nations, often affecting the interests of 
universal humanity. It is deepest and bitterest and 
has its most prolonged conflict when it hinges upon 
opposite racial peculiarities and characteristics. In 
‘other words, prejudice is the strongest and the most 
enduring where extremes in natural racial physical 
‘distinctions meet, and where it is assumed that one is 
inferior to the other, because of color, previous condi- 
tion or of tribal or natural origin and relation. Al- 
though it is difficult to assimilate very distinct and 
dissimilar races and peoples, yet it is the clearest thing 
to impartial decision that the Afro-American people 
‘accept and absorb very readily the pith and germs of 
civic life or take on the present civilization. It also 
seems that, so far as the Southern portion of our 
country is concerned, this prejudice is not only des- 
tined to continue indefinitely, but is on the increase 
-and growing in volume, force and depth. The ruling 
people of the South not only make it a special end to 
‘be obtained and to dominate the South with it, but 
efforts are made to spread it in the North and circulate 
it through all parts of the nation, so as to make the 
‘down-trodden African people to be despised by those 
who have shown their friendship for them in the past. 
‘The bitterness, the antagonisms, the racial feuds and 
‘bloody riots in which the black man is the extreme 
‘sufferer, grow out of this fearfyl element in human 
nature. As the races now stand, and as they must 
stand in the South, there is no power inherent in gov- 
ernment to remove it or destroy it, or even to ameli- 
‘orate or soften its force or ferocity. Those elements 
-and factors by which the phases of social and political 
ife have been changed and made to fit and harmonize
-P-A-G-E-106
102 RACE SEGREGATION. 
with new relations and conditions have no perceptible 
effect or bearing in the present case. Time measured 
by decades and years, the recognized agency and the: 
ancient power that revolutionize thought, opinions, 
judgment and actions, cannot change or destroy this. 
old gory monster of the centuries. It is deaf to rea- 
son and to all appeals upon grounds of justice, equity 
and the high principles of righteousness and mercy,. 
which are the only true bases of a just government. 
Christianity, like other religions, stands appalled in 
its massive shadow and quails before its grim visage. 
It denies and despises “the brotherhood of man and 
the fatherhood of God,” even while it professes. the 
. religion of the lowly Nazarene. The force of arms, 
the triumph of conquering armies, the commands ant 
edicts of governments neither destroy nor control its. 
savage nature nor reduce the plenitude of its power. 
Not only does prejudice lead to oppression, the 
subversion of justice and right, but there is nothing 
more serious and more in evidence than the fact that 
there is a vast legalized scheme throughout the South 
to set the iron heel more permanently and desperately 
upon the head of the black man as a race, and as in- 
dividual characters, There would be hope to the re~ 
jected and aspiring Afro-American if good character 
and becoming behavior would or could count for any- 
thing in the civic arena. But we are now confronted. 
by conditions where merit in the black man does not 
weigh one iota in human rights, and very little in hu- 
man life, if that life and character is under a black or 
brown skin. Learning, personal accomplishments, 
the achievement of wealth, the reign of morality, and: 
skilled handicraft amount to nothing whatever in the 
black man. Merit and fitness for citizenship and ad- 
vanced qualifications for the high and holy functions. 
of civil life cannot win for him the rights and safety 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
RACE SEGREGATION, 103 
that is the natural and God-given inheritance of all. 
Nowhere in the South is the black man as safe in his 
person and property as is the white man. No negro 
can feel the same assurance of protection and safety, 
even in the absence of the mob, as those of the oppo- 
site or ruling race. The laws and police regulations 
are one thing to the white people, but quite another 
thing to the black people. 
Black men and black women, though cultured and 
refined, are treated as serfs and subjected to everv 
imaginable insult and degradation that can be inveni- 
ed or discovered by an ill-plighted and perverse in- 
genuity. 
But especially do we see and feel the power of op- 
pression in the construction and operation of the laws 
and that sentiment that gave them birth and execu- 
tion, and which is stronger, more exacting than the 
written laws themselves. Ever since President Hayes 
had his seat in the White House, when the State gov- 
ernments reverted to the control of the original South, 
step by step, the legislative enactments have drawn 
the cords of discrimination and oppression with in- 
creasing stringency and an intensifying vindictiveness 
that seem phenomenal and inhuman. If by these 
methods of oppression and hardship entailed on black 
citizens anything could be gained or added to the 
happiness and prosperity of the dominant people, 
there might be some reason or cause for its existence. 
No morals are to be improved by it, no greater degree 
of polished manners is to be achieved, and nothing 
but self-debauchment to the oppressor and .degrada- 
tion to the oppfessed are to be gained. And since 
there is nothing to be gained, it is evident that the 
only object in view is to oppress and destroy the prog- 
tess and development of the Afro-American people, 
a people who have never sought to do them a wrong
-P-A-G-E-108
104 RACE SEGREGATION. 
or an injury. The desire on their part is to make ne- 
gro freedom and possibilities a total and signal fail- 
ure, and defeat the ends of a better negro manhood, 
and prove as true the oft-repeated assertion that “the 
black race is incapable of rising to the dignity of a 
full-fledged common citizenship.” They believe that 
it is wrong to educate the negroes beyond a small 
degree of handicraft, suitable only for the most me- 
nial service and the smallest wages. 
It is a fact, now universally known and acknow!- 
edged, that the political rights and privileges con- 
ferred on the black race by the general government 
have been totally and irretrievably annihilated in al- 
most every part of the South. Where they have failed 
in total destruction of these rights by direct legisla 
tion, they have annulled them by a system of eva- 
sions and subterfuges. The votes of black citizens 
are no longer factors of consideration in the political 
equation, and they are shorn of all those sacred func- 
tions and agencies by which the highest and best citi- 
zenship is attained. This not only helps to degrade 
and destroy legitimate aspiration and subverts the 
operating faculties of respectable and decent man- 
hood, but reduces the millions of the black race to a 
growing and enlarging system of serfdom and politi- 
cal peonage that is but a little short of abject slavery. 
Neither does it appear that there is any remedy or ap- 
peal by which these flagrant wrongs and perversions 
of civil rights can be adjusted and made to compiy 
with the demands of true American citizenship. It 
may be stated as axiomatic, that no people can advance 
in true American citizenship and reach high moral and 
political ideals in the functions and practices of the fran- 
ehise, when they are excluded from it and from those re- 
sponsibilities that must follow its exercise. The destruc- 
tion of a “free ballot and a fair count” not only de-
-P-A-G-E-109
RACE SEGREGATION 105 
Stroys the national guarantee of protection, of liberty, 
person and property, but must prove in the end a 
threatening calamity to the Federal compact of States 
and dangerous to the freedom of its citizens. In the 
South the millions of black people are denied this 
guarantee of protection to life, liberty and property, 
with no hope or chance of redress. There is no ap- 
peal, unless from Caesar to Caesar, which is equiva- 
lent to no appeal at all. At the same time the general 
government does nothing to defend and preserve its 
great and majestic acts of sovereign right embodied 
in the Constitution of the United States, but allows 
the evil to fasten its grip upon all the States of the 
South. 
This puts the negro race not only in a state of semi- 
serfdom, but the methods employed and the efforts to 
further submerge the natural and political rights of 
negro manhood grow apace as the days go by. How, 
then, can the Afro-American rise to the dignity of 
good citizenship and aspire to its possibilities, when 
political rights, privileges and agencies are taken from 
him? Can he make bricks without straw, or do the 
impossible? Indeed, he is in a deplorable condition, 
from whatever standpoint we view the situation. 
It has been supposed by most of the leading negro 
amen, as well as many philanthropic friends in the 
North, that whenever the negro is prepared for the 
duties and responsibilities of citizenship, by culture, 
wealth and moral standing, and that whenever he be- 
comes a skilled artisan and scientific farmer, then as 
a race the white people of the South will bestow upou 
him equal political privileges with themselves. And 
thus it is claimed that a certain sort of education and 
training is calculated to settle the problem of the 
races. At first glimpse this seems a fair presumptior, 
and maybe it ought to be so, and we heartily wish
-P-A-G-E-110
106 RACE SEGREGATION. 
that it might so result. But experience contradicts ir. 
and leaves us hopeless of obtaining the rights and 
privileges of suffrage and cognate rights of citizen- 
ship. 
To make this clearer, no man of color, no matter 
how cultured and worthy, or however accomplished, 
refined and fitted, has ever been allowed to occupy the 
same civic plane with the white man of the South for 
a single hour. In this respect Bishop Turner, Frederick 
Douglass, or Dr. Booker T. Washington has no more 
chance than the most degraded of our race. It would 
approximate a small riot should such negro celebri- 
ties attempt to enter a hotel or public resort, assuming 
the airs of equality on the civic plane. Hence all ne- 
groes are excluded from positions and places of lucra- 
tive employment, with the irrevocable negation, “No 
negroes are wanted.” He may be better prepared 
than the white applicant, but prejudice forbids the 
black race to enter. As the black man of the South 
approximates the standard of Anglo-Saxon civic life 
in its best phases and highest standard of excellence, 
trace feelings, antagonisms, and antipathies will in- 
crease in bitterness, extent and intensity. And this 
will be so as long as one race is white and the other 
black, both occupying the same physical territory. 
There is no force or power, apparently, at command 
to regulate and harmonize diverse elements and sociaf 
agencies so dissimilar as are seen in the racial phase 
of the body politic. As long as the negro is a black 
man, and as long as the opposite individual is a white 
man, so long must the social factors and political en- 
tities war against each other. 
Race traits and race peculiarities are the natural 
and enduring faculties that prolong the war and the 
bitter strife of inharmonious relations. 
It is true, legally allowed amalgamation would set-
-P-A-G-E-111
RACE SEGREGATION. 107 
tle all racial difficulties by the natural process of ab- 
sorption and disintegration of racial characteristics, 
but that is a thing unthinkable, unlegalizable and be- 
yond the realms of debate. It is undeniable that amal- 
gamation is going on in the South, and legal mar- 
tiages to some extent in the North; but in both sec- 
tions of the country it is slow, while the products 
of the same are rejected by the ruling race to the 
same extent as the typical negro. Where it is illegal 
it is a crime, and conflicts with the code of decency 
and morality. It debauches the moral sense and de- 
stroys the purity and dignity of young negro mother- 
hood, and debases both sexes in their moral natures. 
Legal intermarriage in the South, although not wrong 
in its consummation, is a matter as yet undebatable, 
and belongs only to the future. 
But comparing the present situation with the his- 
tory of Anglo-Saxon life, we see no chance for the 
negro race to hold its identity of racial traits and char- 
acteristics, while the percentage of Negro blood in- 
fused into Anglo-Saxon veins is too small to change, 
to any perceptible degree, the distinctive features of 
visible or physical character. 
As long as the two races live in the same territory in 
immediate contact, their relations will be such as to inter- 
mingle to that degree where “half-bloods,” quarter-bloods, 
and a mongrel progeny will result. This is not only go- 
ing on now, but is destined to annihilate the 
true typical antebellum negro type, and put in his 
place a stronger, a longer lived, and a more Anglo- 
Saxon-like, homogeneous race. In other words, the 
negro to come will not be the negro of the emancipa- 
tion proclamation, but he will be the Anglo-Saxon- 
ized Afro-American. It seems true, as has been said, 
“No race can look the Anglo-Saxon in the face and 
live.” Certainly no other race can hold its own in
-P-A-G-E-112
108 RACE SEGREGATION. 
his immediate presence. Being in immediate contact, 
and underrating the mental and moral virtues of oth- 
ers and exercising a sovereignty over them, his oppor- 
tunities are enlarged to make other races his own in 
consanguinity. This he never fails to do. 
It is often said the difficulties, growing out of the 
race problem, would be greatly reduced in enormity 
if the negro would remain in the rural districts and on 
the farms. At first view this assertion seems to accord 
with reason, common sense and the best interest of 
the race. Certainly it appears that such conditions 
are the best for the negro masses, and most promotive 
of moral and physical health, as well as advancement 
in social and material economics. Indeed, it is to be 
regretted, if not lamented, that great masses of ne- 
groes leave the country districts and farms and herd 
and cluster in the towns and cities. But since this is 
done; there must be some real cause for it, a cause 
that enters deeply into the interest and material wel- 
fare. Neither is it strange when we consider the fact 
that in the country or rural districts of the South, no 
negro, or at best few negroes, feel safe in their person 
and property. Often they are ruthlessly and unnec- 
essarily insulted, abused, lynched, killed, or driven 
from their homes without the slightest hope of protec- 
tion or redress. Often their mothers, sisters and 
daughters are corrupted and debauched almost before 
their eyes, yet nothing is done to stop the wicked and 
nefarious practice or bring to punishment the evil 
‘doer. Besides wages are small, and in many instances 
are a mere pittance to keep soul and body together. 
Of course, there are some honorable exceptions, but 
they are few and far between. 
The school system in the country is a mere shadove 
and a real farce. The very fact that negroes in great 
masses leave the country and resort to towns and
-P-A-G-E-113
RACE SEGREGATION. 109 
cities shows an unrest and a fervid disquietude that 
rest upon apprehension and real cause. Even those 
who have been able to procure homes of their own, 
along with other substantial belongings, are in a state 
of uneasiness and mental perturbation. They do not 
know how soon they may be falsely accused by some 
trifling and envious white man and lynched by the 
cruel and bloody mob. For as soon as the black man 
in the rural districts gets a home with a farm attached 
and reaches a state of prosperity, then the jealousies 
of the white people are aroused and excited, and the 
prosperous negro is watched and criticised. Here the 
conflict of opposite races begins and ends in total de- 
feat for the black man. Indeed, there is little or no 
chance for the black man in the country if he grows 
rich, polished, and puts on style, or tries to be equal 
to the white neighbor in civic attainments. Good 
breeding, politeness, kindness, self-respect and all the 
virtues may be added and retained by a black man, as 
have been attained by many, but these, instead of help- 
ing him to live in the esteem of his white neighbor, 
actually put him in a precarious condition, and endan- 
gers his life and property. Thus we see, from this 
view, there is absolutely no chance for the negro race 
in the country districts to live and prosper without a 
state of incertitude and unrest. 
It approximates the largest truth as well as covers 
the most dogmatic and momentous phase of this great 
question that now confronts and perplexes us, when 
we say that two distinct peoples can never live together in 
the South in peace, when the one is Anglo-Saxon and the 
other negro, unless the negro, as a race or en masse, lives 
in the submerged realm of serfdom and slavery. 
It is true, there is room enough in territorial ex- 
tent; there is abundance of water, sky and land, but on 
the social and political plane there is not room enough
-P-A-G-E-114
110 RACE SEGREGATION, 
for both races as civil equals. The white peopie of the 
South have not been willing in the past; they are less 
willing now, and reason and experience teach us that 
they will not be willing at any time in the endless fut- 
ure for the race of black men to become their polit- 
ical equals, or occupy the same plane of freedom and 
citizenship, with themselves, no matter how well qual- 
ified they may be for it. It is folly, if not idiotic, un- 
less the supernatural intervenes, of which we have 
promise, to expect it at all. 
One of the most far-reaching and fatal attributes ot 
the great problem, now considered, is the constant and 
wide-spread practice of debauching the young mother- 
hood of the negro race by the ruling people. Perhaps 
there is nothing connected with a life of a race so dam- 
aging and destructive to its morals, mental expansion 
and physical development as to have its mothers cor- 
rupted and despoiled of their procreative sanctity. It 
can but beget a race of weaklings and effeminates in 
moral, mental and physical health. How a people are 
to become wise, upright and healthy in body and mind 
while their mothers, daughters and sisters are pol- 
luted in their genital powers is hard to see. As like 
begets like, and as criminals beget criminals, and as’ 
the parent is reflected and duplicated in the natural 
offsprings, so the race, thus corrupted by miscegena- 
tion and clandestine production, must ride to its down- 
fall and racial dissolution. It does not help the case 
to argue that the black women ought to resist, or 
that their virtue ought to be a guarantee of successful 
resistance against attack. True, it ought to be so, 
and yet it was never so. But environments and condi- 
tions have much to do with it. Wisdom and philan- 
thropy would suggest that the best situation be as- 
sumed and the best conditions arranged so as to make
-P-A-G-E-115
RACE SEGREGATION, 111 
the resisting power stronger by diminishing the op- 
portunities of the advancing foe. 
But a serious phase and a damaging factor of this 
question are the constant and universal tendency in 
the South to gradually reduce the great bulk of the 
negro race to a state of serfdom and peonage. So 
usual and constant is the progressive work of this form 
of degradation and oppression that even negroes them- 
selves seem to accept it as a matter of course, or as 
what is expected, while philanthropic people have no 
knowledge of it, or in some way pass it by unheeded. 
None but those who have lived and traveled through 
the rural districts of the South and made it a study 
can enter its many-threaded details, and comprehend 
the subtle and evasive methods by which the negroes 
are kept at the lowest ebb of civil life. It is in the 
small details of every-day life, with the customs, sen- 
timent and fendencies, by which the true state of the 
race is seen in connection with the ruling people. 
Prejudice, discrimination and double dealing crop out 
in almost every business transaction. White men ex- 
pect to be treated differently from black men, while 
black men never expect to be treated with the same 
degree of civility as white people receive. There is 
one code of morals and civil ethics for the white- 
skinned. man and another for the black-skinned man, 
with the heaviest of its iron hand resting upon the 
head of the black man, on his children and his civiliza- 
tion, if civilization it be. It is both terrible and mon- 
strous, and perhaps the greatest phenomenon of the 
whole racial problem, that black men, or any other 
race of men, would or could stand quietly by and neg- 
lect the opportunities of the golden hour to throw off 
the yoke and repel the smiting hand that enwreathes 
and rivets the heavy steel upon their necks. Even 
evasions and the signalizing and the ponderous stroke
-P-A-G-E-116
112 RACE SEGREGATION. 
of universal aversion are neglected, and the slow death 
is left in the coils of the always forging links and 
lengthening chains of a second form of old slavery. 
There are those who believe that the South can and 
ought to be allowed to settle the race problem in her 
own way. For this she clamors and pleads to be “let 
alone.” The white people of the South vehemently 
declare that they can settle it, and we do not doubt 
their willingness and ability to do so. But how? 
Where will the black man stand if he stands at all? 
Let the history of the great past and the transactions 
of the present answer. 
To allow the South to settle this great question in 
its own way simply means to degrade the black race 
and remand and doom the black people to an inexor- 
able peonage and eternal seridom. The proposition is 
utterly incompatible with reason and what should be 
expected. Colleges and schools of high grade, and 
such enabling facilities of human development would 
become obsolete, and a liberal and substantial cultural 
process, that alone can develop a people, will become 
things of the past, known only as facts of an historic 
age. 
The great majority of the Southern white people 
hold that education ruins the negro, and especially the 
higher education or collegiate training, and more es- 
pecially under Northern white teachers. They make 
the claim that it unfits him for usefulness and that 
kind of citizenship that belongs to him as an inferior. 
Anything that takes the black man from the ditch, the 
cane farm or the cotton field as a mere menial laborer, 
as a “hewer of wood and drawer of water,” is adverse 
to his best estate, God-given and ordained, and who- 
ever, therefore, attempts to do it, or whoever succeeds 
or partially succeeds in doing so, is the negro’s great- 
est enemy and a giant foe to the South; that the friend
-P-A-G-E-117
RACE SEGREGATION. . 118 
of the negro is absolutely and necessarily an enemy of 
the South. This is so absurd, and contrary to fact, 
reason and history that it requires no serious attempt 
for signal and complete contradiction. Education and 
training help every creature to fulfill better the ends 
of being and the onerous duties of life. The trained 
horse, the cultured dog, the domiciled and domesti- 
cated animals are all made better and more useful in 
their operating sphere by the cultural process. Whv 
not the negro? Is he any less than the beast of the 
field? 
But the South cannot setile this problem any more than 
it could settle the long and bloody problem of slavery. In 
the very nature of the case it is a@ national question, a 
question too big for the South. It belongs before the 
bar of the whole nation. Even if it were not national 
in its scope and depth, the South would be an incom- 
petent juror, because she is not willing for all of her 
people, black and white, to enjoy equal privileges and 
rights, even when given by the central government. 
Such a juror could not render an impartial verdict. 
Again, it is national because none but the nation has 
the strong hand and fullness of power competent to 
meet the issue and adjust relations. Then, again, it 
involves national honor and national law. Neither can 
it rest where it is. It is an historic as well as a philo- 
sophical truism that no question in government can 
be settled until it is settled right. It must be settled 
right in the native fundamentals and cohesive ele- 
ments and faculties. All of the people must be free 
and allowed to enjoy their natural and lawful rights, 
or else the conflict must and will continue. So long 
as there is a part of the people oppressed and denied 
the rights and privileges of citizenship that is designed 
to be universal and applicable to all, the problem can- 
8 ns
-P-A-G-E-118
114 RACE SEGREGATION. 
not be settled. It cannot be settled any more than the 
question of slavery could have been settled, leaving 
the slaves in slavery. Slavery, which stood and tow- 
ered and lifted its hideous form, dripping with the in- 
nocent blood of the slave, stood for awhile in the em- 
blazoned arena of American liberty, but it fell and sent 
the tremor of its fall through the approaching decades, 
with whose blighting shadow we are fighting to-day! 
And until right triumphs and oppression and wrong 
cease, the unity of truth and the reign of God forbid 
a cessation of hostilities. 
But, as we see no chance for the black man to ar- 
rive at his best and highest possibilities and the noble 
ends of the best citizenship in the same territory with 
the white people of the South, segregation is proposed 
as the best, the most practicable and desirable meth- 
od in the solution of the racial problem. Black men 
are as much citizens of the American federation of 
States as white men. They should never rest or cease 
legitimate efforts until full and plenipotent citizenship 
is given to them, the same as white men. They should 
contend for it,as the dearest, as the highest privilege, 
and the most sacred part of their national inheritance! 
If the white people of the South would accord to the 
African people the full measure of citizenship with 
themselves, allowing them to live upon the same plane 
of civil life, we could ask no more, and the racial prob- 
lem would cease to be a problem. But since this is 
not done, and since it seems to be clear that it will not 
be done, then we ask for a settlement of our racial 
troubles by separation and segregation of the races in 
the South, at least. 
We ask for a State or States, or a Territory, or a 
part or parts of Territories within the limits of the 
United States, our great country. To reach these
-P-A-G-E-119
RACE SEGREGATION. 115 
ends, the following propositions may be considered 
within the limits of possibilities : 
I. There is a great problem growing cut of the fact 
that two distinct races or peoples are occupying the 
same territory under the same government and laws; 
that they are so distinct and dissimilar in racial traits, 
instincts and character, that it is impossible for them 
to live together on equal terms of social and political 
relation, or on terms of equal citizenship. 
II. The problem of the races is inter-racial and na- 
tional, affecting the entire country in its vast interests, 
‘prosperity and progress. And, therefore, it is the duty 
of the general government to settle it, as that is the 
‘only power that can do it. 
IU. The segregation of the races is the most practi- 
cable, logical, and equitable solution of the problem. 
IV. Segregation and separation should be gradual 
and classified by a qualified citizenship, and non-com- 
pulsory, so as not to injure or retard labor, capital, 
and commerce in those States where the negro is an 
important factor of production and consumption. 
V. To make the movement operative and effective, 
the negro population of the Southern States should 
send petitions to the President and the Congress of the 
United States of America asking for segregation. 
‘They should ask for suitable territory in the great re- 
public, as legal and equal citizens of the Union, and 
not go out of their country to be exposed to doubtful 
experiment and foreign complications. Afro-Ameri- 
cans should remain in their own country, and in the 
zone of greatness, and in the latitude of progress. 
VI. The government would, providing segregation 
niaterializes, establish and maintain suitable laws, reg- 
ulations, and safe grounds for the maintenance of the 
civil order, peace, progress, and prosperity. 
VII. The place or places, or the territory may be
-P-A-G-E-120
116 RACE SEGREGATION. 
selected by competent authority from the western part 
of the public domain, such as a part of the Indian Ter- 
ritory, New Mexico, or other parts of the great West. 
VIII. No white person or persons should be al- 
lowed to obtain citizenship in such a State or Terri- 
tory, unless identified with the negro race by marriage, 
and those who may be appointed by the government. 
to expedite and control the Federal interests, provid- 
ed also that the general public have the same privi- 
leges, rights, protection and safety in the segregated 
Territory as in the other States of the Union. 
IX. There should be some easy and practical qual- 
ifications required of those who are to become citizens 
of the segregated Territory. They should have, at 
least, a reputable character, some degree of education, 
and perhaps a competency for one year’s support. 
Criminals and undesirable persons should be kept out, 
as far as possible, until they are properly qualified to: 
meet the requirements. 
It may be said and will be said that it will be impos- 
sible to keep the white man.out and the black man in. 
But let it be remembered that the object is not to keep. 
the white man out or the black man in, but to estab- 
lish a State or Stafes in which alone the Afro-Ameri- 
can people may dominate by eligibility to political oi- 
fice, the public trust and control; thus conferring upon 
them all the rights of full and free citizenship enjoyed 
by others, and which is denied them in the Southern 
States. 
Of course, citizens of ali States would be free to 
come and go, but none to acquire citizenship unless 
identified with the negro race. Afro-Americans have 
no desire, as a race, to create friction, antagonisms and 
strife, but ask and demand at this time the rights and 
privileges. authorized by the government. 
It is to be admitted that the plan of segregation here
-P-A-G-E-121
RACE SEGREGATION, W7 
presented is environed and beset with many difficul- 
ties. We realize the stern fact that any plan to settle 
the racial problem, which may be presented, will have 
not only its difficulties, but its objectors. But any 
plan which may be proposed for the solution of the 
question cannot be surrounded nor carry more difficul- 
ties and perplexities than the present state and condi- 
tion of the races. No plan or method of solution can 
produce more bitterness, alienation, degradation, 
bloodshed and death than the present state of affairs. 
But especially will it be urged by friends as well as 
by the enemies of the Afro-American people that the 
negro is incapable of self-government and control. 
But how do they know? Where has it ever been tried 
under conditions that may be obtained within the Fed- 
eral Union? Besides, if the government of the United 
States cannot control and direct a few millions of its 
citizens who may be segregated for the peaceful solu- 
tion of a great national problem, it would be too weak . 
and ephemeral to hold its parts together. The idea is 
preposterous and fallacious in the extreme. 
Not only has the negro some degree of American 
civilization engrafted upon his progressive and devel- 
oping manhood, but he has a large and increasing per- 
centage of Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins, and conse- 
quently Anglo-Saxon life. He is not only patriotic 
and devoted to his country, but the trend of events and © 
the stern logic of fact and principle show him to be ca- 
pable of civilization and susceptible of being wrought 
into the social and political compact. What is most 
needed for his development is a chance to be a man, 
an open door for his possibilities. 
It is often affirmed in the South that “this is a white 
man’s country.” This is freely admitted, but it is equal- 
ly true that it is also the black man’s country. The 
country belongs to every man born on its soil, black
-P-A-G-E-122
118 RACE SEGREGATION. 
or white. If it is the white man’s country in any su- 
preme or particular sense, it furnishes an important 
reason why he should be just and humane to all, most 
especially to under-graduates in civil life. 
It may be argued that many Southern people will 
oppose the separation of the races upon the ground 
that such would destroy the labor element of the South 
and thus retard expansion and progress. This may be 
or will be found to be true in some degree, but it is 
becoming more and more evident that negro labor is 
growing less important as a factor of production in 
the South. It is not now more than one-half of the 
labor employed in field and shop. A large proportion 
of it has gone North, East and West, and is still going, 
until ere long the great black belts of the South must 
be numbered with the things of the past. 
As a laborer in the South, the negro has been the 
dearest and most expensive that a country has ever 
had in the history of nations. The Southern people 
have already paid an enormous price for the negro as 
a slave, and still the astounding debt bears interest, 
compounding itself as the years go by. Heaps of 
gold and almost endless treasure have been paid for 
his blood and bones as a labor element. Brave sons, 
noble sires, and intrepid chieftains, queenly women, 
with the flower of the land have been slain upon its 
thigh places. Millions of drops of blood have been 
poured out as a bloody libation at the shrine of the 
swarthy Moloch. And it seems apparent that the un- 
ion of States that has cost so much will never be one 
with a tenacious integrity until black Ham and white 
Japheth shall dwell in separate tents. 
In a State to themselves, within the Federal Union, 
the negro would become a free and full-fledged citizen, 
with all the immunities, privileges and political rights 
that belong to American citizens without friction, envy
-P-A-G-E-123
RACE SEGREGATION. 119 
and jealousies. Then the negro, as a man and a race, 
would ‘have a chance to develop his mental powers, 
his physical character, and his essential responsibilities 
as an American citizen. The responsibilities that 
would come with a degree of self-government would 
inspire, qualify and stimulate to supreme effort in life, 
and thus help the Anglo-Saxon man and brother to 
carry his great civilization to a higher plane and a 
loftier altitude of ideal perfection. 
Indeed, the Union of the States will never be fully 
and perfectly recemented with tenacious integrity until 
black Ham and white Japheth dwell together in sepa- 
rate tents.

BURDEN OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
By RICHARD H. EDMONDS, 
Editor “ Manufacturers’ Record.” 
  
Chief of the burdens of the negro problem is the 
heed given to words of exploiters of the negro. 
As long as the intelligence of the country fails to 
dicountenance the discussion of the negro by profes- 
sional orators, Chautauqua or lyceum lecturers, edu- 
cationalists, confirmed philanthropists and designing 
politicians who find therein more or less personal prof- 
it, so long will the difficulties of the problem persist. 
Could it be left to men of the character, the stand- 
ing, the experience, the mental calibre and the com- 
mon sense of Stuyvesant Fish, of New York; T. G. 
Bush, of Alabama; William A. Courtenay, of South 
Carolina ; John L. Williams, of Virginia; D. A. Tomp- 
kins, of North Carolina; J. B. Killebrew, of Tennes- 
see; W. J. Northen, of Georgia, and John H. Kirby, 
of Texas, the happy solution of the problem could be 
- offered in a trice. 
Fundamentally it is, as it has always been, an eco- 
nomic problem to be dealt with, not in ignorance, 
prejudice or passion, but in knowledge, wisdom and 
judgment, and in sober conviction of responsibility to 
the white race and to the black. Essentially there 
should be an attitude toward the negro no whit dif- 
ferent from that toward the hordes of aliens that are 
crowding into the country through its eastern ports. 
The latter are really the more difficult to be handled, 
in that they have never had the negro’s advantage of 
(120)

BURDEN OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 121 
contact with American whites of pure stock. Their 
future as affecting for good or ill the history of this 
land is inextricably involved with the future of the 
negro as he shall be hampered or helped. 
As the negro is mistreated or is unimpeded in work- 
ing out his own career, the menace in foreign fugi- 
tives from oppression or poverty will wax or wane. To 
the extent that the South shall be relieved from the 
unnecessary embarrassments in negro development, 
to that extent will the South be free to aid more un- 
fortunate parts of the country solving their more pon- 
derous problems. 
Alternatives proposed as solutions of the negro 
problem are amalgamation, annihilation, deportation, 
Each means mistreatment of the negro; each is im- 
practicable. 
Deportation was tried forty years ago under condi- 
tions where alone it could approach possibility. At 
the instigation of Abraham Lincoln attempt was made 
to supplement emancipation with exodus, under gov- 
ernment auspices. It failed signally in an odor of 
graft. Of the hundred thousand dollars available for 
the experiment, the account rendered of two or three 
years’ expenditures was for about thirty-three thou- 
sand dollars, the bulk of which had gone to agents, 
with a government vessel sent to bring back a hand- 
ful of colonists who had been induced to go to another 
land. If the plan could not but fail for four million 
negroes with Lincoln as a leading promoter, at a time 
when the Constitution of the country was in abeyance, 
why should sanity consider it to-day when more than 
eight million negroes are to be taken into account, in 
addition to the whites or the whole country? 
The negro is doing too much for the prosperity of - 
the country for him to desire to leave it or for the

whites to give encouragement to anybody who would 
force or persuade him to leave. 
Amalgamation has within itself the elements of its 
own destruction. Miscegenation carries with it its 
own punishment. Its effects are reducing to the min- 
imum the number of whites and blacks who will sub- 
mit to it. 
Some of the members of that race, seething with the 
passions in which they were begotten, are openly or 
covertly leading a few negroes to inevitable ruin with 
themselves. Extremists among the amalgamates may 
in the course of time subject themselves to deportation 
to penal settlements or to more speedy ends at the 
hands of the law or outside the law, while a rapidly 
growing sentiment in favor of a humane surgical op- 
eration, to be added to the punishment of the peni- 
tentiary, will, to a certain degree, annihilate a part of 
. the negro stock by making it incapable of propagation. 
This, enforced as to criminal whites as well as to crim— 
inal negroes, would not only have a deterrent influ- 
ence to prevent crime, but it would gradually lessen 
the reproduction of criminals. But it is puerile and 
cowardly to talk of annihilating a people who, inter- 
rupted by force, and practically without action on their 
own part, in their reasonable, healthy development 
forty years ago, and since then the victims of experi- 
ments that would have crippled forever almost any 
race, have more than doubled in number and still dis- 
play traces of the excellent education of their race 
made possible in the change from slavery in Africa to 
bondage in America. 
A suggestion of comparatively recent publicity is 
that negro vexations be overcome by opening the 
gates to Mongolian labor. There is a charm about 
that for the economic politician, in that the element 
in American politics that is largely responsible for the

ills of the negro, created in the use of him as a polit- 
ical issue to crystalize the low order intellect of voters 
in close elections, is most strenuous for Chinese ex- 
clusion. That element may be gagged against negru 
agitation by the threat of Chinese agitation. But that 
would be politics; and there has been already too 
much politics about the negro. Statesmanship is de- 
manded, and statesmanship will not jump. from the 
frying pan into the fire. 
Statesmanship sees a solution of the negro problem. 
in removing the obstacles from the way of the devel- 
opment of the negro’s aptitude, and in encouraging 
him in cultivation of those habits which have become 
second nature with the white race for its advancement. 
Such a policy recognizes these facts emphasized by 
the experience of the past forty years. 
The negro race is not the Caucasian race merely 
colored black. 
The negro race, mentally and morally, is centuries 
behind the Caucasian and has never given evidence 
of ability to advance in that respect of its own initia- 
tive. 
Crossed upon white stock the negro is given great- 
er mental strength, but a strength likely to be exerted 
in manifestation of the vices rather than of the virtues 
of the original stocks. 
The negro race, physically, is a powerful race, and 
fit to work under proper guidance. 
To seek to give the negro child, but three centuries 
removed from the jungle, the start in schooling similar 
to that given the white child, with a thousand years of 
the education of individual effort behind it, was worse 
than foolhardy. It was not unlike placing a loaded 
magazine rifle in the arms of a chimpanzee. 
To give the negro male the ballot, a privilege won 
by the white man in centuries of struggle and, after

124 BURDEN OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
all, not always exercised in a manner justifying his vic- 
tory, was worse than criminal. It was not unlike pois- 
oning a stream at its very source. 
Like education for whites and blacks, education 
without distinction of race, are the baneful theories 
which, applied for nearly two generations, have not 
only injured the negro in weaning him from incentives 
to productive and beneficial exertions into sloth, vice 
and crime, but have even twisted the training of whites 
upon right lines. In forcing the suffrage upon the ne- 
gto there was injected into the whole body politic a 
virus of corruption in party practices and in municipal, 
State and national administrations flatly disproving 
much of the theory of public education. 
It is but a step from mendicant methods in negro 
education to mendicant methods in white education. 
Such pauperization is but the fertilization of the soil 
of graft in quarters high and low. So, the negro prob- 
lem belongs to us all. The intelligence and patriotism 
of the whole country must combine for its solution, 
in permitting the South, most affected by it at present, 
to determine the way and supply the means. Broad, 
well-defined principles must guide us. 
Efforts to educate the rising generation of negroes 
must recognize, for avoidance, the mistakes of the 
past manifested by negro youth of to-day. Expendi- 
tures of time, energy and money must be per capacity 
of the negro instead of per capita. 
Negroes who have been miseducated must be 
brought back to the proper starting point before it is 
too late. They must not only be allowed in other parts 
of the country the opportunities to work enjoyed by 
them in the South, but they must be sharply taught 
that unless. they work they will starve. The machin- 
ery for such instruction is to be had in a stringent va- 
grancy law, enforced completely by an effective rural

BURDEN OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 125. 
police or patrol, with provision that individuals who 
will not work for themselves and for others shall be 
forced to work for the State in fields not conflicting 
with honest labor. 
The way must be kept open for the natural diffu- 
sion of the negroes among the white population until 
they become an element inconsequential from the so- 
cial, political or any other standpoint. At present 
there is one negro for every 8.6 of the total population 
of the country. That ratio would be a safe one if it 
was common to all parts of the country. But it is 
not. In the South there is one negro for every 
three of the population, the ratio ranging from one 
in twenty-two in West Virginia to 1 in 1.7 in Missis- 
sippi and South Carolina. At the same time in the 
fifteen States east of the Mississippi and north of the 
Ohio and Mason and Dixon line, the proportion is 1 
negro for every 55.2 of the population, the range 
being from 1 in 6 in Deleware to 1 in 621 in New 
Hampshire. In the eleven mountain and Pacific 
states the proportion is 1 in 163, and in 9 other States 
and territories it is 1 in 36. 
As long as any distinct race is massed in one sec- 
tion of the country, so long will that race be hampered 
and so long will it be a drag upon the whole country. 
The politician, the sensation monger or any other 
individual in any part of the country who, in using 
the negro for every other purpose but the negro’s 
good, retards the natural diffusion of the negro re- 
vealed in the fact that near 1,000,000 negroes are now 
living outside the South in a total of 8,834,000, is an 
enémy to his country and must be suppressed. Those 
who would suppress him have only to bear in mind 
the significant fact that the race question is invariably 
brought to the front when the leading political parties 
of the country lack the courage to formulate and sup-,
-P-A-G-E-130
126 BURDEN OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
port policies appealing to the intelligence of the peo- 
ple, or when the movement carrying more negroes te 
other parts of the country and more whites to the 
South is most pronounced. 
Of all persons, Southern men should have no part 
in giving life to negro agitation. The negro is in 
this country for good. We must meet this situation 
not with impracticable theories, supported by over- 
drawn pictures of danger from his presence. No 
reasonable man could, with prophetic sight, have 
viewed the influences-exerted upon negrocs for forty 
years without expecting even more trouble than we 
have had. Suddenly freed from the restraining power 
which had controlled and civilized them, taught by 
the most unscrupulous white scoundrels that ever 
cursed a land, as well as by misguided philanthropists 
from other sections, that they must demand social 
equality, who could expect aught but a generation of 
criminal instincts. But this criminality is less than 
might have been anticipated. Upon the white people 
of the South rests the responsibility of being permit- 
ted to deal with infinite patience with a race, millions 
of which have proved that they could be honest, vir- 
tuous, hard working and faithful to every trust. The 
‘demons in human shape whose horrible acts are fol- 
lowed by swift punishment, which, however severe, 
can never be severe enough to atone for the crime, 
should not arouse resentment against the whole race. 
The mad dog is a terror, but the fact that some dogs 
go mad is never taken as a sufficient reason for driv-. 
ing every dog out of the country. 
The negro is with us, and he is going to stay with us. How shall we get the best for him and for our- 
selves out of the situation? Not by deportation, not 
by amalgamation, but by the same tireless work which 
the South has for forty years given to this question,

freed, however, from the visionary theories of outsid- 
ers, who know nothing about the conditions in the 
South, and the equally visionary theories of imprac- 
ticable Southern men. With the marked increase of 
white immigration to the South now under way, the 
tendency of the negroes to dispersion throughout the 
country, the enactment and enforcement of vagrancy 
laws, the establishment of country patrol systems, and 
the gradual elimination of the criminal classes in re- 
production, the negro question will no longer afford 
profitable employment for public speakers and maga- 
zine writers.

A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM PSY- 
CHOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED. — 
By WILLIS B, PARKS, M.D. 
In this treatise it is proposed to present the negro 
problem in its various aspects, on a different basis and 
from a different standpoint from that which it has 
hitherto been treated. It will be shown that the ex- 
isting conditions are the logical and unfailing conse- 
quence of cause and effect. This question is by no 
means local or sectional, but is universal in its scope 
and application. It is, therefore, not a Southern prob: ; 
lem that we are dealing with, but a national one, far- * 
reaching and vast. , 
The most important part of man is mind, and, there- 
fore, any treatment of the negro problem that ignores 
that faculty, is lacking from a philosophical viewpoint. 
Hudson truly says, “The laws of suggestion are the 
most important factor of man’s make-up.” Hence it 
is to that faculty that a scientific inquiry must address 
itself. In using the expression “suggestion,” it is not 
the intention to mystify, but rather to simplify. It is 
obvious that there are several kinds of suggestions, 
and that they are different in their manifestations, but 
from whatever source they emanate, they are subject 
to the same fixed laws. We recognize direct as well 
as indirect suggestions, and suggestions may be con- 
scious and unconscious. 
To illustrate: When the negro was freed and given 
the right of suffrage, he was given the indirect sug- 
(128)
-P-A-G-E-133
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 129 
gestion of social equality ; to receive him into the fam- 
ilv and give him the best room in the house, would be 
a direct suggestion of social equality. To give the 
negro advantages of education and then not to find a 
niche to fit him in after life, is also to give him the 
suggestion of equality, but, at the same time, to pre- 
pare him for ultimate and grievous disappointment. 
In the light of the above illustrations, the term 
Auto-Suggestion might also be understood. The old 
slave negro had the idea of slavery so indelibly im- 
pressed upon him, that nothing else suggested itself, 
from this view-point, to him, and so, even after he 
had been freed, the before-the-war negro acts now and 
talks like a slave, and is most comfortable in that con- 
dition. 
Another very important point, with reference to 
suggestion, is to be observed, namely, that it can be 
both given and received unconsciously. Moreover, it 
may be given consciously and received unconsciously. 
Finally, it should be understood that suggestion, 
when directly received or when suddenly aroused to 
new life and called into activity after existing long in 
a dormant state, is not a weakling attribute of man’s 
nature. It becomes a power, moving with resistless 
force and dominating the will with such energy as to 
sometimes override every opposing influence, trans- 
form the being and strike down all opposition to his 
sway. 
What better illustration than the mob? Here we 
see suggestion playing upon the passions of men, un- 
til reason. becomes dethroned, for the once peaceable, 
quiet and law-respecting citizens become a maddenet 
mass of death-dealing animals. Men who would not 
only scorn to strike a foe when he is down, but who 
would succor the imperiled even at the risk of life it- 
self, become forgetful of every rational influence, and

And this is a fair illustration. The thought of sum- 
mary punishment may have originated in a single 
mind—auto-suggestive—but how quickly suggestion, 
conscious, direct, is imparted from the lips or by a 
flash of the eyes, or by a gesture from one to another, 
until, in a trice, the first mutterings of the storm hav: 
gathered such force that it has become a whirling, 
seething cyclone of wrath, and impaled within the 
vortex of its fury, writhes the doomed victim. 
Let it be at Jast remembered, that the negro was 
brought here in a state of savagery and ignorance and 
subjected to the suggestions, conscious and uncon- 
scious, of a highly organized civilization. It is with 
these things in view that we propose to treat this sub- 
ject, under the following heads: The Semi-Savage 
Negro; The Slave Negro; The ‘Ex-Slave Negro; 
The New Negro. 
THE SEMI-SAVAGE NEGRO. 
Historically, about 290 years ago the negro was 
brought from Africa in a semi-savage condition to the 
United States. The object being not to civilize him, 
but to enslave him. It was purely from mercenary 
motives, and not on account of a desire to elevate him 
from a barbaric state and civilize and enlighten and 
Christianize him. 
At first, the negro did not prove profitable in the 
hands of his masters. The cold climate of the North- 
ern States of the Union, where he was first domiciled, 
was too rigorous for the thin-skinned Africans, and 
the great majority of them were later transferred to 
Southern territory, where not only the climate suited 
them the best, but they were best adapted to the fieid 
culture of the section.
-P-A-G-E-135
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 131 
Thus the new importation proved valueless to the 
original importers, except as a speculative commodity. 
But in his new home he rapidly became domesticated, 
and the imitative being a strong faculty of his nature, 
the was enabled soon to adapt himself to his surround- 
ings, and he proved a ready learner to do work of a 
more or less simple character. Indeed, his progress 
was more rapid along this line than was his mental 
development; hence, the negro was a first-rate field 
hand before his jargon became barely intelligible. 
And, as an illustration of the tardiness of the negro as 
a linguist, it is only necessary to refer to the low- 
country negro (as the Southern people term him) on 
the rice plantations of the South, and along the whole 
south coasts. Their feeble vocabulary of English is 
so interspersed with their own peculiar jargon, half 
. English and half barbaric, as to render it unintelligi- 
ble, except to one long used to hearing it. 
It is this creature, in his new surroundings ; simple, 
pliable and peculiarly susceptible to whatever influ- 
fluences that are brought to bear upon his untutored 
mind, that we shall undertake to deal with, from a 
psychological view-point. 
According to Hudson, a recognized authority upon 
psychology, every human being is endowed with a 
dual mind; the objective, or the reasoning mind is 
“controlled by the five senses (seeing, hearing, feel- 
ing, etc.); it is the outgrowth of man’s physical ne- 
cessities. It is his guide in his struggles with mate- 
tial environment. Its highest function is that of rea- 
soning.” 
“The Subjective takes cognizance,” says the same 
authority, “of its environments by means independent 
of the five physical senses. It perceives by intuition. 
It is the seat of the emotions, and the storehouse of 
memory, etc.” This duality of the mind renders man
-P-A-G-E-136
132 A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
susceptible to all kinds of suggestions known to the 
realms of psychology. Boris Sidis says, “The soit 
favorable for the seeds of suggestion exists in all indi- 
viduals. The suggestible element is a constituent of 
our nature—it never leaves us.” 
The following will illustrate the manner in which 
suggestion is received by the subjective mind in a 
normal, or waking, state. Before, or when such sug- 
gestion finds lodgment, the ideas and beliefs existing, 
that have come through the objective mind, and that: 
are antagonistic to such suggestion, must be over- 
come. If the subject be in a hypnotic state the objec- 
tive mind is passive, and the suggestion is imparted, 
direct, to the subjective, without having to overcome 
the objective mind, i. e., the auto-suggestion that al- 
ready exists. And as it is while in the normal or wak- 
ing state of the negro, only, that we propose to deal 
with the subject, the sleeping or hypnotic side of psy- 
chology or suggestion will receive no further consid- 
eration. 
THE SLAVE NEGRO. 
With the advancement of the slavery period the 
negro progressed even more rapidly than might have 
been expected along many lines. He became more 
and more desirable as a servant, and, correspondingly, 
his money value was enhanced. He was, as a rule, 
the recipient of humane treatment; his food was plen- 
tiful and wholesome, his clothing comfortable, and 
when sick he was provided with the best medical 
treatment. His money value demanded all this, even 
if the demand came from no higher or more humane 
motives. But soon there did arise a bond of sympa- 
thy between master and slave—call it affection if you 
please— that widened and deepened as the years 
passed ; and this bond, so subtle as to elude the grasp 
of poet and philosopher alike, who would portray its
-P-A-G-E-137
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM, 133 
character, survived, even after the slave became a 
freedman, and although suggestion, of a baleful and 
poisonous character, promptly followed the emanci- 
pation of the slaves, uprooting and destroying much 
of that feeling existing between the races, yet it still 
lingers in the breasts of many of the ex-slaves of to- 
day, and, certainly, there is a feeling of tender regard 
in the hearts of their former masters for those who 
were once théir slaves. 
During the existence of slavery the surroundings, 
the occupation, the every environment of the negro 
strengthened, each day, the first and only conscious 
suggestion of the relation of the races, the one 
toward the other, in the mind of the negro— 
that of master and slave. There was a gulf, deep and 
impassable, fixed by the laws of nature, and illustrated 
in the color of the skin of each race, that separated 
them as completely and effectually, socially, as if the 
breadth of a continent lay between. 
The slave negro realized this, accepted it, and lived 
up to the conditions. And, even after the President of 
the United States in 1863 had issued his emancipation 
proclamation, and all the world waited in breathless 
expectancy for the blow, so strongly suggested in that 
document, to fall, that would inaugurate a reign of 
bloodshed, butchery and rapine all over the South, the 
terrors of which men could not conceive of, this prin- 
ciple, so well grounded by suggestion in the con- 
science of these slaves, stayed the hand, and palsied 
the arm of any that might have contemplated the 
‘dreadful uprising, and, in the hands of the black man, 
the lives and homes of the women and children, whose 
slave he was, were a sacred charge, and not an act of 
lawlessness mars the black man’s history during that 
dark period. What an illustration of right sugges- 
tion! .
-P-A-G-E-138
1384 A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
And who shall say that, left to themselves, unin- 
fluenced by conscious counter suggestions coming 
from designing and insincere persons, whose sole ob- 
ject was personal gain and political preference, the 
conditions of to-day would have been the same? But - 
the fire once ignited, conditions were such as to faw 
the flame into intense heat at once, and suggestions, 
oftentime unconsciously received, perhaps, which, like 
the deadly microbe that lays dormant in the humaz 
system until aroused to action by influences favorable 
to its ravages, became dominating influences in the 
mind of the negro, transforming him into a being full 
of suspicion, mistrust and, sometimes, hatred against 
the former trusted and respected master. 
As before stated, the negro during his slave period 
was trustworthy and loyal to his master and his mas- 
ter’s interests, and while it is claimed that he had 
great thieving proclivities, yet they usually pertained 
to something trivial; he would naturally say to him- 
self: “Master’s nigger and master’s taters.” Such 
privileges of taking something to eat could hardly be 
regarded in a strict sense as theft. This hereditary 
trait, born so innocently in slavery, might account for 
his great tendency to steal after slavery. For, how 
often the claim: “We worked and made it; it’s as. 
much ours as anybody’s else!” A kind of community 
of interests feeling. 
It is well known that the crime of rape was not 
heard of during slave-days, and many reasons have 
been offered to explain why this was, especially during 
and about the close of the Civil War when most of the 
white men were away, and the white women and chil- 
dren were left to the mercy of the negro. And even 
after he well knew that he would soon be set free, he 
still remained true to his trust, and was ready to de-
-P-A-G-E-139
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 135 
fend, even at the cost of his life, the women and chil- 
dren left to his care. 
It would not be amiss to say that the South should, 
as a fitting mark of gratitude and respect, erect a 
monument to the memory of the slave who was true 
and loyal to his invaluable trust. 
THE EX-SLAVE NEGRO. 
The influences must, indeed, have been strong that 
could transform the faithful and loyal slave of yester- 
day into the unfriendly, sullen and vindictive freed- 
man of to-day. But such was the transformation. 
But while he hailed the announcement of liberation 
from bondage with outward demonstrations of joy, it 
is an undisputed fact that many of the race accepted 
the change of condition with some misgivings and 
fear, lest after all, the blessings of freedom might prove 
a curse in disguise. And it is well known that many 
did linger upon the old plantation, accepting such 
terms and upon such conditions as their former own- 
ers, in their impoverished state, could offer them; 
some of them never leaving, but being borne from 
their old cabin homes to the grave-yard on the hill 
hard by, where their ashes rest under the sod their feet 
in life had pressed. 
Whether the negro, left free from extraneous influ- 
ences, could have realized the truth so forcibly ut- 
tered recently by a negro orator from Yale, that “free- 
dom is a process, and no man can be free until he has 
established for himself a character,” is a question; but 
certain it is, that, without character or preparation 
this race was called upon to assume the role of a free 
man not only unprepared, but hedged about with ev- 
ery hindrance that could arise from innumerable ad- 
verse suggestions.
-P-A-G-E-140
186 A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
It is a well established scientific fact that those used 
to rendering obedience are the most susceptible to 
suggestion, both conscious and unconscious; hence, 
we have in the freedman a shining mark for a design- 
ing, mischief-making element, and how thoroughly 
and effectively the work was done, the conditions of 
to-day attest. And it may be as well understood now 
that we claim that to these agencies of discord, more 
than to all else, is due the deplorable position which 
this race occupies before the world to-day. Left to 
himself, the freedman was not a vicious person. There 
was nothing of malice in his nature toward the white 
race. But he was a creature easily duped, and his 
simple, untutored mind was a fertile soil for the re- 
ception of the seeds of wrong suggestion, and the 
ground was well sown. And how subtly were they 
sown! And how promptly did the tillers of this soil 
begin their work! Simultaneous with the home-com- 
ing of the remnants of Lee’s and Johnson’s armies 
was the arrival of these alien agitators. It is a matter 
of history, and, therefore, it is not necessary to quib- 
ble at this point, lest we display a sectional feeling, 
the South was absolutely overrun by designing poli- 
ticians, over zealous and misguided philanthropists, 
and a horde of fortune hunters. And as we shall in- 
sist that, to the baleful suggestions received by the 
freedman, direct and indirect, intentionally given 
sometimes, and unintentionally at others, but always 
hurtful, is traceable, to a very large extent, the pres- 
ent unhappy state of the negro race, it is well to make 
our position plain. 
The first suggestions the ex-slave received were of 
a material character. They were told that their labors 
had accumulated the wealth of the South prior to the 
war. What was left after the war was theirs, by right 
of conquest of the Union arms, and that the govern-
-P-A-G-E-141
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 137 
ment would apportion it to them under a rule some- 
thing like this: As one is to forty acres and a mule, 
so is the whole number to everything ieft. It was an 
adroit piece of calculation, and if the entire wealth of 
the country had been summed up at that time and ap- 
portioned according to the above calculation, the title 
to the bulk of the assets of the South would have been 
vested in the negro, however surprising this may have 
been to the inventor of the 4o-acres-and-a-mule prop- 
osition. And this feeling of ownership was never 
eradicated; and if the negro has gained an unenvia- 
ble reputation as a purloiner and a thief, it is but fair 
to say that, paradoxical as it may sound, he was and 
is, toa great extent, honestly so. It is well known 
that the Southern penitentiaries and chaingangs rap- 
idly filled up just after the war between the States, 
and the inmates were largely negroes ; and the records 
show that-a large percentage of these were sent up for 
horse-stealing. Indeed, it became almost a mania 
among the race. Had the 4o-acre-and-a-mule fallacy 
proven an indirect suggestion? 
Along political lines was another avenue through 
which suggestion found easy access to the ex-slave's 
subjective mind. He was recognized as a full-fledged 
American citizen. He voted, held office, and was priv- 
ileged to have a white man “’rested” if he, the said 
white man, dared to molest him in the exercise of any 
of these political rights. And this state of being sug- 
gested to him the displacement of white rule entirely, 
and the usurpation of all authority of government— 
indeed, to the mind of the average negro, the South 
was soon to become the promised Canaan of the race, 
owned and dominated by the African contingent of 
American citizenship. 
But the most baleful and fallacious of all direct sug- 
gestions that the ex-slave received about the time of
-P-A-G-E-142
138 A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
his emancipation was that of social equality. We are 
not prepared to claim that, left to himself, the negro 
would never have entertained the thought, auto-sug- 
gestively. That faculty of imitation before referred 
to had enabled him to ape, in a crude way, as a rule, 
many of the manners and customs of the white folk. 
And many of his race had become men and women of 
intelligence; some had received more or less of an 
elementary education, and there were among them 
skilled workmen in all lines of mechanics. So, that 
the recently liberated slave was far removed, in every 
respect, from his semi-savage forefathers. 
Hence, what might have developed can only be sur- 
mised. But the correction of such suggestions, if they 
had arisen, would have been an easy matter, with the 
negro free from the false, devilish and, to his own bet- 
ter judgment, untenable suggestions. 
The suggestion of social equality was received first 
from that same alien element who went among the 
freedmen immediately after the close of the Civil War, 
and, professing solicitude for their welfare, undertook 
to direct’ the recently liberated slaves in the setting in 
order of their social house. They discovered to the 
negro the fact that he was “Mister” So-and-so, not 
plain “Dick” or “Tom” of yesterday. They gave 
practical suggestive illustration then and there, bv 
addressing him so, and sometimes the poor darkey 
was taken off his feet by being asked what his name 
was, that they might address him properly. He would 
blurt out some name hurriedly in his embarrassment, 
for he rarely ever assumed his late owner’s name, to 
find later that, upon reflection, the name did not suit 
the cut of his jib and changed it, sometimes more 
than once. They further gave practical suggestion of 
equality by visiting the negroes in their cabins (gen- 
erally under cover of darkness for obvious reasons),
-P-A-G-E-143
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 139 
eating at table with them, and otherwise recognizing” 
these relations. They were blarnied and cajoled by 
politicians and railroaded into office and given con- 
stant assurance of their superiority of caste. 
All of these had a damaging effect, and while ‘n: 
thousands of instances the agitator failed to create a 
very high regard for himself in the estimation of the 
negro, yet, the feeling of disgust, often engendered, 
did not always afford counter suggestion sufficient to 
overcome the direct; for the reason, perhaps mainly, 
that the latter were in comport with the desires of the 
freedman. 
Then there were other conditions that proved 
strong suggestions to the negro’s mind, of the equality 
of the races socially. The mulatto was a living evi- 
dence of the maintenance of relations between the 
races in the past that should never exist between a 
superior and-an inferior, between master and slave. 
And the sadness of the picture is intensified in the fact 
that the white man knew not how disastrously he was. 
sowing the seeds of depravity, discord and disgrace. 
Sadly enough, they have had their reflex influence 
upon the white man. On account of these degrading 
and unhallowed relations the negro race came out 
of bondage, their women under clouds of unchastity,. 
and both sexes alike holding the marriage relation 'n 
light esteem. This was the rule; of course, there were’ 
exceptions. Had the negro slaves been trained along 
lines of morality, chastity and right regard for these 
things, and had the whites maintained a proper moral 
relation to the blacks, the state of affairs above re- 
ferred to would not have existed. To have encour- 
aged the propagation of the species through promis-- 
cuous relations of the sexes was reprehensible, al- 
though justified on the ground of self-interest—every 
piccaninny represented so much assets of an estate.
-P-A-G-E-144
140 =A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
And it is well known that healthy negro women were 
in demand for child-bearing. 
And, while the ex-slave was slow in overt action 
upon these poisonous suggestions, they served to ren- 
der him morose and sullen. He became restless, as 
if under a great restraint. He was suspicious of the. 
white man, and incapacitated to enter into any busi- 
ness relations with his former master, with that feel- 
ing of confidence and desire for mutual good that is 
‘so essential to successful business intercourse. The 
suggestions he had received, both consciously and un- 
consciously, were to the effect that whatever of profit 
he proved to the white man thereafter, even in mat- 
ters upon which his own subsistence depended, was 
undeserved; hence, there was, generally speaking, 
only a perfunctory rendering of service. 
But time has righted many wrong suggestions in 
the case of the ex-slaves, at least. Unfortunately, 
their descendants lave profited little by it. The 
years of constant association and business contact with 
Southern white men have brought about more amica- 
‘ble relations. Confidence has been restored in the 
mind of the ex-slave, and there exists a better under- 
standing. And few of this class of negroes ever think 
of, of care for, closer social relations. And it is not 
_ ‘this element that is responsible for the deplorable state 
of affairs existing ; with the ex-slave only to deal with, 
the nation would have no “problem” for solution. 
THE NEW NEGRO. 
We have shown in preceding chapters some of the 
influences that surrounded the negro in slavery, and 
others that quickly followed emancipation; and, as 
we come to consider the “New Negro” of to-day, the 
question arises, has the progress of the race been 
‘commensurate with the opportunities? Has the ad-
-P-A-G-E-145
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 143 
vancement made during the first forty years of his. 
freedom kept pace with his development during the 
slave period? 
In order to arrive at a fair conclusion, let us see 
what progress had been made during the slave pe- 
tiod. We have men of the race skilled in all lines of 
mechanics—every ‘“‘quarter” had its carpenters, black- 
smiths, tanners, harness and shoemakers, coopers, 
wagon-makers, etc.—and a majority of these had ac- 
quired more or less elementary learning. There were 
preachers, many of whom could read their texts and 
“ine” the hymns, and, around every “big house” were 
butlers, coachmen, housekeepers, chambermaids and. 
nurses who had, by close contact with their “white 
folks,” learned much of the ways of the world outside 
of the slave domain. Few, comparatively, of the 
slave owners proscribed education among their slaves, 
and the children of these families were often the 
teachers from which their domestics and others often 
learned much that was of incalculable value in the 
years that followed. The youngsters or Miss of tender 
years seated at the nursery fireside, or in the play- 
yard shade, teaching a favorite servant, sometimes 
more than one, was a familiar picture in slavery days, 
and the heart of many an old ex-slave of to-day warms. 
up, and there is seen a tender, far-away !ook of yearn- 
ing, as if he would fain glance backward through the 
intervening years of the past half century or more, 
and once more contemplate the scene, long ago en- 
acted, of young Marster or young Missus with dili- 
gence and patience unfolding to eager minds the mys- 
teries of Webster’s “blue back.” How vividly is re- 
called the look of severity that for an instant beclouds 
the face of the young teacher, but is soon chased 
away by the sunshine of genuine interest—aye, affec- 
tion—for the pupil who has failed to recite satisfac-

torily, or did not comprehend readily enough, the 
elucidation of some important lesson help! Perhaps 
it was that “K” might easily be recognized at any 
time, if the fact that its back was broken was kept in 
‘mind by the student. 
Young master’s body-servant was another favored 
sslave, who profited much in many ways by his posi- 
tion. Sometimes he followed his master into profes- 
sional life, and the opportunities for learning were ex- 
ceptional. Indeed, it is safe to claim that hundreds of 
the race enjoyed these and like advantages. One 
thing we know: They were not all illiterate when they 
became freedmen. This is attested in the fact that all 
‘over the South, when martial law and bayonet rule 
-essayed to fill many offices with negroes, there was an 
. overflow of applicants for the “jobs” to let. Within 
:a few months, Southern legislatures were overrun and 
‘dominated by negro politicians, courts were officered, 
and in all lines of public service the negro was in 
evidence. 
From the semi-savage to the freedman, then, we 
find the negro well on the way to civilization, and 
‘somewhat enlightened, though ‘he had been centuries 
learning the lesson. 
Now the question recurs, what of the progress since 
emancipation ? 
In many respects the record is disappointing. In 
morals and in physical vigor the New Negro is far 
‘below the average of the ex-slave. And his intellect 
‘does not tower above that of his progenitors. True, 
‘he has enjoyed educational advantages—opportuni- 
‘ties is, perhaps, a better word, for the greater body 
of the negro race is, comparatively, illiterate, and the 
census showing along this line is misleading. ‘The 
“book-learning” of the freedman and his descendants 
ds of a very shallow character, as applied to the masses.
-P-A-G-E-147
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 143 
There are a number of reasons for this. Short school 
terms in rural districts, the indisposition of the pa- 
rents to take the children from the fields during the 
“cropping season,” and too many colleges, are some 
of the potent reasons. The expenditure of vast sums 
in educational channels, upon comparatively few, 
whereas, if differently employed, the many would have | 
received substantial profit, and all would have been 
benefited some, was a grave error. And the sugges- 
tion to the race thereby was unfortunate and dam- 
aging. 
There have been established throughout the Sout 
too many colleges, universities and other institutions 
for the higher education of the negro. There is too 
much of display and glamor for the real article in 
learning. There are too many negroes who have been 
“thro’ college,” know much that is in books, and have 
imbibed a smattering of polish that are absolutely 
handicapped on account of the possession of a diplo- 
ma. Why? The answer is simple: Auto-suggestion 
stands as a barrier between them and the only pur- 
suits open to them. To these, “out in service” is not 
the thing. “Tt is too menial,” says their auto-sugges- 
tion. And this applies, in large part, to those par- 
tially educated in the higher branches of learning, as 
well as to the graduate. 
Writers and orators of the race, as well as others, 
lay great stress upon what education has done and is 
doing for the negro, but statistics, gathered and com- 
piled from all the colleges, show that at the end of a 
generation of freedom only about’ 2,300 graduates 
have gone out from all the institutions of learning 
open to the race, including those graduated before 
the Civil War, and the tab kept upon the movements 
of these showed that little more than half of them 
were reported to be engaged in profitable pursuits.
-P-A-G-E-148
144. A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
Fifty-three per cent. of these were engaged in teach- 
ing, and sixteen per cent. were preachers. And this 
is the showing of a generation! This the returns of 
the millions that have been given with a free hand by 
~ benevolent and philanthropic people, individually and 
organic, for the sole purpose of education. Add to 
this the national schools and the school frnd expended 
annually by every Southern State upon negro educa- 
tion, and the returns upon this fabulous expenditure 
are meagre indeed. The beginnings of the second 
generation found the race in about this condition: 
Two and seven-ninths per cent. graduates of colleges, | 
and less than 50 per cent. with any education at ail, 
while of this number a small percentage only were 
turning their education to account in their daily avo- 
cations. And many, as above shown, find their learn- 
ing a drawback oftener than a help. 
This, we admit, is an unfortunate state of affairs 
and to be deplored, but by it, the unwisdom of the 
plan of negro education adopted and pursued for forty 
years seems to be most clearly demonstrated. To at~- 
tempt to charge the mind of the negro child, less than 
three centuries removed from the savage state, with 
schooling such as the white child is given, with twenty 
centuries of Christian civilization and enlightenment 
behind it, supplemented by constant intelligent indi- 
vidual effort, was, palpably, an impossibility, and a 
cruel exaction made upon a weakling intellect; and 
like many other conditions existing in our race rela- 
tions, it is without a parallel in the history of nations. 
Now, from these same institutions of learning have 
gone out some of the most hurtful and deplorable 
suggestions, as poisonous as they were fallacious, that 
have been imparted to the negro race through anv 
medium, and by any agency. And they have been 
doubly damaging, in that they have begotten in a
-P-A-G-E-149
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 145 
certain element of the white race counter suggestions, 
combative in their nature. When a negro boy or girl 
is taught to regard himself or herself as the social 
equal of white children, when his inner consciousness 
voices a counter suggestion, based upon his common 
sense, a state of feeling is engendered in the breast of 
that pupil that is to curse his or her life for all time, 
and that will work serious damage both to the indi- 
vidual and to the body politic of the race. Yet these 
suggestions, direct and indirect, are a part and parcel 
of the curriculum, if not laid down in the catalogue, 
well understood, of many such institutions; more 
prominent perhaps in some than in others. And, it 
seems that intelligent people—white teachers, many 
of them—even if no other motive than a desire for the 
welfare of the pupil prompted them, would modify 
that curriculum, at least. They are too intelligent to 
charge with ignorance in the matter. They are not 
blind, to the results. It is one of the causes of the 
unfitness of the negro with an education, partial or 
finished, for the avocations open to his race. No self- 
respecting Southern white man will take a negro wo- 
man into his home, give her sleeping quarters upon 
the same floor with his family and conform to many 
other conditions precedent, as prescribed by some of 
these colleges which have an employment bureau at- 
tachment, and which furnish educated and trained 
domestics, because, forsooth, these conditions are de- 
signed as a moral safeguard for the servant. North- 
ern sojourners in the South refuse to subscribe .o 
such terms, and certainly Southern homes are not, as 
a rule, so constructed. Servants’ quarters are so ar- 
ranged as to prevent social contact. There must be 
no intercourse except as between employer and em- 
ployee—-a superior and an inferior. Other women cf 
their race fill such positions without such “safeguards” 10 n3

and maintain their respectability, and are the equals 
of the college-bred domestics, barring education. But 
the educated or partially educated negro is but a slight 
percentage and not, by any means, the most danger- 
ous element of the race. He has not heretofore fig- 
ured much as a law-breaker, and, to be frank, he 
stands in more amicable relations to his white fellow- 
citizens than he has aforetime. There is more evi- 
dence of a desire on his part to co-operate in the ef- 
forts to suppress crime and bring criminals to ac- 
count. And the time is short before the country will 
realize marked results from that co-operation. The ex- 
ample of a leading colored man, editor of a paper 
published in the interests of his race, prosecuting a 
colored woman before the courts in a Southern city 
for an alleged infraction of law, after repeated efforts 
to restrain her had been made, is an inspiring one. 
And he is on record as intending to keep it up. li 
is, he claims, in the interest of good morals among 
the race. 
But it is more far-reaching than mere individual 
effort. Let the race—the vicious element, of course~- 
learn that a few such men of their race in every com- 
munity are on their tracks, and one of the most pow- 
erful counter suggestions to lawlessness and crime 
would take hold of the minds of the lawless and the 
restraining influences would be incalculably strong. 
Three determined and fearless leaders like this editoz 
would do more toward putting a police recorder out 
of business than any city’s “picked squad” of patroi- 
men. 
So far, the influences of suggestion upon the coi- 
ored race has been considered in a general way, with- 
out regard to any specific conditions or set of circum- 
stances. There is a phase of the subject to which we 
now advert with the hope and belief that, though an
-P-A-G-E-151
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 147 
oft threshed question, we shall be able to present some 
views upon a line hitherto disregarded, that may prove 
helpful in future discussions. It is that of 
ASSAULT UPON WHITE WOMEN BY NEGRO MEN}; 
ITS CAUSES AND PROPOSED RATIONAL REMEDIES. 
The fact was mentiond, incidentally, in a former 
connection, that the crime of rape was seldom heard 
of during the slave period, and we will here add that 
this is accounted for most satisfactorily upon psycho- 
logical grounds. 
First, the “crime ef rape,” as used above, may be 
taken in a broader sense than the subject under dis- 
‘cussion ernbraces. Let it apply to colored as well as 
white women, to facilitate the elucidation of the mat- 
ter, and we shall see that there was an utter lack of 
suggestion in, or to, the negro man regarding the 
crime against either race of women, but upon entirely 
different hypotheses. 
In the case of negro women there was absolutely 
no grounds for the basis of wrong suggestion, be- 
‘cause none of the avenues of intercourse between the 
sexes were closed. While the marriage relations were 
entered into and maintained between negro men and 
negro women, these relations, on account of prevail- 
ing sentiment based upon customs, already referred 
to as wrong and degrading, were not essential to sex- 
ual intercourse. Hence, the conditions that might 
suggest rape were too remote to consider. The mind 
of the negro man was, therefore, free from impropet 
stiggestions as regards the women of his race. The 
other feature of the question, however, is as fraught 
with suggestion as this is devoid of it. 
The first impression that found lodgment in the 
mind of the semi-savage when his foot pressed Amer- 
ican soil was a conscious suggestion of inferiority. ,

148 =A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM, 
(This is a conclusion fully justified upon several 
grounds. The fact that he was a slave, descended 
from the slave of black masters is sufficient to cite 
here.) And, above all else, the white Mistress of his 
new world was more an ideal object of worship than 
one to desecrate. And, as his sojourn lengthened int> 
years, the queenly relations his white Mistress bore to 
the home, as well as to the whole social fabric, so faz 
as his observation extended, fixed and strengthened 
this suggestion in his sub-conscious mind; so that 
the suggestion became a principle to be transmitted. 
in a genealogical sequence, and, as the centuries 
passed, it became a bulwark of safety behind which 
was sheltered, unharmed, white women and children 
during the fateful sixties, when true and loyal black 
men all over the South not only worked faithfully for 
their subsistence, but bared their own brawny arms. 
in defense of any of their “white folk” when danger 
was nigh. 
Fortunate it is-for the black man: of the slave period 
that conditions were such as to preclude the idea or 
assumption that through fear a brutish nature was 
curbed and not because of his devotion to right and 
duty that the white Mistress passed through the slave 
period unassailed. During the Civil War the slaves 
at home, as a rule, were at all times fully apprised of 
the situation. There was (as a negro writer recently 
expressed it) a “free masonry” means of communica- 
tion that kept them always informed. 
Furthermore, in view of subsequent history, are we 
not justified in claiming that the war-time darkey— 
the ex-slave-—has maintained a fair respectability since 
his emancipation? Some of their number have gone 
in forbidden ways, and penitentiaries Lave gathered 
many within their walls or on chaingangs, but the 
great body of the ex-slave element presents a fair
-P-A-G-E-153
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 149 
record upon this question. In support of this claim, 
we cite the fact, which seems to have escaped obser- 
vation, that the crime of rape does not belong to the 
slave period, neither is it a fruit of the ex-slave period 
proper. While there had been a few offenses of this 
character before, the crime was not so frequent as to 
arouse comment or create widespread alarm and con- 
sternation until many years after the emancipation of 
slavery. Therefore, it is fair and just to claim that the 
crime of assault is the crime of the “New Negro”’— 
not of the slave nor of the ex-slave. 
The grounds upon which we base the claim that 
“assault upon white women by negro men” is the 
crime of the “New Negro’ we shall endeavor to make 
plain first; then we shall offer the proposed “Rational 
Remedies.” 
Suggestion, that subtlest of all agencies influencing, 
if not wholly dominating the human mind—dual in 
its nature—when rightly employed, is a great and 
moving power for good to the subject receiving it; 
and, through the subject, to everything with which it 
comes in touch, as illustrated in the career of the col- 
ored race, from the first importation of a slave to the 
emancipation of the race. 
In striking, and sometimes alarming, contrast are 
the results of misdirected suggestion, or wrong sug- 
gestion of any form, whether direct of indirect; con- 
scious or unconscious; intentional or unintentional. 
And to this influence of wrong suggestion we shall 
attempt to trace the source of the problem, at first 
sectional in its nature, but now involving the whole 
nation. 
And it may be well to reiterate the claim before 
made, that to the alien element that overran the South 
immediately after the Civil War, and the influences 
that element set agoing in the minds of the negroes,
-P-A-G-E-154
150 =A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM, 
more than to all else is traceable the trouble with the 
negro of to-day. 
During the reconstruction period in the South, 
when the Federal authorities at Washington were en- 
gaged in amending the Constitution, passing civil 
rights bills, and otherwise working assiduously to 
bring about the fullest equality of races (some of these 
same leaders illustrating it in their private life) and 
their “officers of the line” were on the ground preach- 
ing this doctrine to the negroes, the very atmosphere 
in which the recently liberated slaves moved and 
which they breathed, was surcharged with the theme 
of race equality, and suggestions of future elevation 
ranging from “eating at the white folk’s table” to 
amalgamation of the races, and even to a supremacy 
of the negro, were inhaled with every breath by the 
negro youth of the day, as well as the elders of his 
people. While the fathers among them were less sus- 
ceptible to the infection, by virtue of a lifetime of 
positive direct counter suggestion, minds of the youth 
of the day were free and open to take in and assimi- 
late the poison of the suggestions so assiduously sown 
by alien political emissaries of the powers at Wash- 
ington, and so faithfully taught in the schools by white 
men and women from the North, who, also, main- 
tained these social relations toward the negro in their 
private lives, so far as the laws of the land would per- 
mit and publicly, so far as Southern sentiment would 
tolerate. 
Subsidiary to the work of the agitator, was the 
mother’s influence in implanting these seeds of social 
equality suggestions in the minds of her children. But 
a great degree of tolerance should be employed in 
considering this phase of the subject. The mother- 
heart of the slave woman must have thrilled with un- 
- wonted emotions of joy at the thought ‘that the dawn
-P-A-G-E-155
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 151 
of liberty had opened upon her race while her off- 
spring were just entering upon life, and even if she 
had passed by youth and middle life in slavery, she 
had the happy consciousness that, in her declining 
years, the home of a freeman would be to her a shel- 
ter, and out of it she would be borne to her grave. 
This, she knew, was a reality; and with the reality 
had come the promise of higher ascension in the scale 
of social life for her children; they were “good as any 
white children”—better than “po’ white trash.” That 
she should strengthen these suggestions by every 
means possible, in the minds of her children, was 
natural, and she did more, the infant of the day drew 
the inspiration from the mother’s breast with every 
drop of its milk food. And, while there were doubis 
and misgivings in the mind of the intelligent colored 
man, he hesitated to discountenance these sugges- 
tions. His intelligence suggested strongly to his mind 
that the only logical outcome of the policy of recon- 
structionists at Washington was social equality, mis- 
cegenation and amalgamation. Of course, this car- 
ried with it a terrible conviction; it meant. bloodshed’ 
as well; but were not the Federal armies behind the 
movement? thought he. 
Amid these surroundings the young negro begaa 
life. Schools all over the South were established and 
with their establishment every influence that could be 
conceived was brought to play upon the mind of ne- 
gro children to create the impression that they, as 
beneficiaries of the school privileges, were indebted 
solely to their Northern white friends for them; that 
the Southern whites were’ not only antagonistic to ne- 
gro éducation, but were hostile to everything that 
tended to the betterment of the race. And, in many 
instances, the jealousy of the white people of the ne- 
gro’s advancement was charged on the ground that
-P-A-G-E-156
152 A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM, 
they feared the negro’s development would result 
finally in the superiority of the negro race; thus, the 
suggestion of negro supremacy obtained a strong po- 
sition in the minds of many negroes. How familiar 
became the claim that “the bottom rail” would soon 
be “on top.” 
In all of these things the negro felt that the peopie 
at the North were in full sympathy and accord with all 
that was being done. That the policy pursued by the 
Johnson administration, for the establishment of a 
social scale in the South that recognized and tolerated _ 
no distinction on account of race, color, etc., met the 
unqualified approval of every Northern citizen. But, 
if such was the case, then (and we are not disposed to 
believe it) there came in due time a revulsion of feel- 
ing. There came a time when the mismanagement of 
the misguided extremists at the North, and the false 
and (sometimes) incendiary suggestions of their emis- 
saries at the South, became apparent. It was when 
the habitation of the black race was no longer circum~ 
scribed to the country south of the Ohio river. When 
he had gained a footing more or less well established 
in almost all of the States in the Union. Then it was 
that the people of the whole country began to under- 
stand the situation, and sentiment became changed. 
Growing up in this atmosphere of training the New 
Negro was wholly unprepared to meet the actual real- 
ities that the future developed. Social elevation did 
not come to him, along with the education he had re- 
ceived. His black skin was, as much as ever, the 
mark of inferiority of race. Years passed, he became 
aman physically. Instead of an open field in the so- 
cial realm, he was as much circumscribed as ever; the 
white man had maintained that superiority which, by 
every right vested in a superior race, he claimed was 
his. Public sentiment at the same time at the North

was overwhelmingly with the Southern white men. 
(although it was some years later before it became ac- 
tive), and the negro realized in the situation as it was 
that the foolish fallacies implanted in his young mind 
were but bubbles that burst before the blasts of reason 
in later years. And, with this revelation, came a most 
dangerous suggestion. It was, that the negro was 
being robbed of a right that, according to suggestions 
in a thousand ways imparted, he had come to regard 
as his; that, on account of the duplicity of the white 
_race, he still occupied an inferior position, and never 
once admitting to himself that former suggestions 
were perhaps erroneous. And, brooding over these 
imaginary wrongs (being unable rather than unwil- 
ling to apply the light of reason), the deadly and 
damning suggestion of the employment of force to 
accomplish a right of which sentiment robs him and 
not law forbids him, was implanted in his mind. We 
say “his mind” advisedly, for the outcropping does 
not by any means discover to view the extent of the 
existence of these dark suggestions. They are mani- 
fested upon the streets, along the highways, around 
the homes—everywhere—throughout the South, daily, 
and in an unmistakable manner. These manifesta- 
tions are not unnoticed by the whites, and doubtless 
many a tragedy is averted, and many a dark crime is 
forestalled because they are noted. Lack of oppor- 
tunity often, and lack of brute courage sometimes, 
and an increasing watchfulness all the time, has pre- 
served the honor of far more white women of the 
country than have suffered the loss of it at the hands 
of the rapist. 
SUGGESTION AS A SOLUTION. 
We come now to consider a solution for this most 
absorbing problem with a degree of satisfaction on
-P-A-G-E-158
154 A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
account of the fact that the change of sentiment re- 
garding the race question, which has been very 
marked, even radical, during the past few years in cer- 
tain sections, will contribute much towards that solu- 
tion. During recent years the people of the other sec- 
tions of the Union have had a meed of the experience 
in dealing with the rapist negro, that the South has so 
long contended with. The country at large has come 
to a knowledge of the situation in a sense most cal- 
culated to carry conviction. The sojourn of the ne- 
groes at the North (and by this term is meant all sec- 
tions before unused to the negro as he is known at 
the South), has proven a revelation to the masses. 
Seeing him as he is has been a convincing proof of 
his unfitness for social equality. The horror at the 
thought of miscegenation and amalgamation experi- 
enced only at the South at first, is shared now through- 
out the country. The expediency of it is not only de- 
nied at the North, but the proposition is revolting - 
alike to the respectable white element everywhere. 
‘The formula of the remedy for the malady once 
agreed upon, its faithful application and patience will 
bring the desired results. For, it may be well borne 
in mind, that the disease not being at an acute stage, | 
but of a chronic type, it can not be overcome in a day, 
but will require time for its eradication. 
First, as an all-important basis: If, as we have 
shown, suggestion has played so important a part in 
shaping the destiny of the negro race, figuring in 
every phase of his career, from the semi-savage state 
until this day, then, through the same medium, much 
toward the solution of the problem may be accom- 
plished. 
While the problem has become a national one, in a 
strict sense, it must be admitted that upon the South 
mainly, devolves the responsibility of a solution. This
-P-A-G-E-159

may appear paradoxical, taken in connection with the 
claim, heretofore made, that to northern sentiment 
and northern interference with local affairs was 
chargeable the present status of the race. But in ou: 
support of that claim, the distinction between the 
two was made clear, and the change of sentiment at 
the North has not only removed all support of the 
claim to social equality for the negro, but has gone a 
long way toward creating a strong counter suggestion 
in the mind of the New Negro upon that subject. In 
fact, there is less of a desire upon the part of the re- 
spectable element of the race for social equality than 
ever before. The conviction, once so thoroughly en- 
trenched in the mind of the negro, that such relations 
should not exist, and never eradicated, but rather 
overshadowed, for the time being, is rapidly reassert- 
ing itself and claiming recognition—how? Auto-sug- 
gestively. 
One of the first steps employed in furtherance of the 
radical plans adopted for the reconstruction of the 
Southern States, was the wholesale enfranchisement 
of the negro, without regard to his fitness for the ex- 
ercise of suffrage. Subsequent history has demon- . 
strated that this was a grievous error, and his right 
of suffrage should have been admitted only after he 
had demonstrated such qualifications, moral and men-- 
tal, as would enable him to exercise it intelligently. 
This would have been fair to all classes of the race. 
The negro who possessed such qualifications at the 
outset would have been enfranchised, while the igno- 
rant and incompetent element so largely in the ma- 
jority, would have been barred until such time as he 
was enabled to subscribe to the conditions of quali- 
fication. Had this been done, the suggestions of right 
deportment, and high moral and mental attainment, 
in other words, the suggestion of good citizenshin
-P-A-G-E-160
156 A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
would have been paramount in the mind of the negro, 
instead of the seriously erroneous suggestions he did 
receive in this connection, to which we have referred. 
But the proposition to repeal the voting clause of the 
_ Constitution of the United States relative to the ne- 
gro, at this late day, is as manifestly wrong as the act 
was erroneous at first. 
First, it would work a hardship upon a strong ele- 
ment of the race who, by thrift and enterprise, have 
property rights at stake, and until more of the race 
not so fortunate, perhaps, but whose intelligence and 
learning, as well as their moral status, entitle them 
' to recognition as good citizens; and, second, because 
every State in the Union enjoys the rights necessary 
_ to regulate suffrage by legislation, and all of them af- 
_ fected do enact such laws as are necessary to regulate 
the franchise of its citizens, “without regard to race, 
color,” etc., it is true, but quite effective in eliminat- 
ing the incompetent voters, both white and colored, 
Disfranchisement, therefore, is not expedient. 
It is unfortunate that intelligent negro writers and 
_ speakers keep up such a fusilade of attack upon white 
people for alleged suppression of the negro ballot, 
- when their common sense teaches them that such is 
not the case. There is no effort on the part of the 
whites to suppress a single legal vote of the race in 
any regular election. Democratic primary, or nomi- 
nating elections in practice in the South, are not 
“regular” legal elections, and if the negro is excluded 
in these, so is his white brother of the Republican 
party. And these always have the right to bring out 
a Republican ticket and contest in the election proper, 
the election of the ticket endorsed by the opposition. 
These are political party questions and not race ques- 
tions. The negro is simply afflicted with the weaker 
party in politics. And this, from a choice made years
-P-A-G-E-161
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 157 
ago, and it is unfair to the weaker element of his race 
that these practices are resorted to by his intellectually 
stronger brother ; for they are taken seriously by these 
auditors, and if the applause they receive is gratify- 
ine, they should understand it is at great cost to the . 
cause they represent. Suggestion of a damaging 
character is begotten—half suppressed truth, becomes 
blatant falsehood. Open, fair dealing with all ques- 
tions by negro leaders is demanded by every sense of 
right. 
The negro’s status before the law is wrongly dealt 
with by this same element. Every intelligent being 
shows that the courts of the country, from the desk- 
room notary publics, to the Supreme Court of the 
United States, are open to him, and legal counsel is 
his, upon demand, before any one of these tribunals. 
The preaching of negro oppression by the courts 
should be restrained, if necessary, by the broadening 
of jurisdiction in contempt proceedings, so as to take 
in the agitator, and thus suppress a very strong and 
hurtful suggestion. 
A. recent enactment of a very stringent vagrancy 
law by the Georgia Legislature was vigorously at- 
tacked by a leading Atlanta negro preacher, on the . 
ground that it was “aimed at” the colored race; whea 
he well knew that not a syllable of the act applied to 
the negro that did not mean as much to the white 
race. ‘That, if it affected the negro more seriously 
than it did the whites, it was because there were more 
negro vagrants than white vagrants. Therefore, the 
course of the preacher was attacked in the columns of 
a newspaper and his utterances were given wide pub- 
licity among the negroes. The more strongly to be 
condemed are these utterances, because they were so 
widely at variance with the spirit of the occasion, 
which was a gathering of leading white and colored
-P-A-G-E-162
158 A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
men engaged in the discussion of ways and means 
for the elevation and betterment of his race; a notable 
and leading spirit present being his own church 
bishop. The closing of dance-halls, where vice and 
immorality prevailed among his race, was as strongly 
protested against on this same occasion by the 
preacher, because, he claimed, it was the oppression 
of the negro, and it abridged his rights. This in the 
face of the fact that reputable people of his own race 
joined in invoking the law's action on the grounds of 
it being a nuisance and a menace to the peace’ and 
good order of the city. 
While it is not probable that there were. present. 
many of the class that could be seriously affected by 
the preacher’s inopportune and foolish remarks, it is 
true that a newspaper comment was a vehicle that 
carried them broadcast, and the damage done was 
serious and far-reaching, counteracting much of the 
teal good accomplished at the series of meetings, of 
which this was one. 
What a revolution of sentiment the cessation of 
these and like practices would work! What a strong 
current of counter-suggestion would be set in motion 
if these same gifted writers and eloquent speakers 
turned their efforts into more rational and conserva- 
tive channels! 
In the South, at least, the rapist in almost all in- 
stances of outbreak, comes from the ranks of the 
vagrant—the lowest element of the negro race. The 
rural districts are his field of operations, and he wan- 
ders through the country, ostensibly in search of em- 
‘ployment, but in reality bent only upon mischief. He 
does not hesitate at theft, burglary, arson, or criminal 
-outrage—whatever seems to promise success, even 
‘murder, if necessary to accomplish any of these de- 
signs, or to cover up a crime. This is the rule’; oc-
-P-A-G-E-163

casionally he is one well known in the community, and 
often he is one of the migratory class, whose stay on 
some man’s plantation has been of a sufficient dura- 
tion to localize him enough to be regarded as a mem- 
ber of the community, but which stay was only long 
enough to enable him to accomplish some deep and 
devilish purpose. 
The remedy for this class is: First, clean towns and 
cities where such low resorts as afford them shelter, 
can not exist; strict laws against idleness, and a no- 
madic life, and fearless execution of those laws. Sec- 
ond, the respectable working colored man and woman 
_ should discountenance these people in their worthless 
manner of living. Let these understand that they can 
no longer expect shield or support from this better 
class, and the effect would be marvelous. It is inex- 
plicable, but true, that it is the disposition of negroes 
generally, to aid the criminal of the race to escape, 
rather than to hand him over to justice. It is a well- 
known fact that it is almost impossible for a white 
man to go into any quarter of a city where negroes 
live, and ascertain the whereabouts of a negro, though 
he may inquire of those living in the immediate vicin- 
ity, even of next-door neighbors. Negroes will shield 
the worst criminal of their race from detection and 
arrest, though a stranger, while the white man wiil 
hand his next-door neighbor over to justice whea 
implicated in crime. 
We have in the foregoing an illustration of a sug- 
gestion implanted during the slave period, and doubt- 
less at an early date. But the negroes should put away 
those old slave-time customs of shielding the “run- 
away nigger.” How tenacious the hold of a sugges- 
tion when once rooted in the human mind! 
The law to put down and drive out the loafer, and 
suppress his rendezvous, and the respectable negroes

160 A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 
upholding that law, by every suggestion to the va- 
grant, that he may no longer look for or expect recog- 
nition and aid in his manner of living, are the coun- 
try’s strongest levers for uprooting this incubus on 
society. 
Then there is that other element of the rapist negro, 
Jess numerous, but dangerous, because, under the 
guise of respectability, the negro servant who, by vir- 
tue of his domestic employment, is constantly in con- 
tact with the women of the home. Unfortunately, 
these are often less careful of his presence than they 
should be. The old slavery-day customs of careless 
indifference to the presence of the morning fire-build- 
er in female apartments, and like opportunities for ob- 
servation of the persons of the white Mistress and the 
young Misses of the home, may have been responsibie 
in a far greater measure for the latter day crime than 
it would be pleasant to admit. The suggestion of 
safety then implanted in the white Mistress’ mind has 
been handed down even to the present day, and it is a 
fact that there is too much indifference yet existing 
along this line, in the face of the dangers that menace 
the safety of white women. It is unfortunate, and the 
source of much harm, that the Southern Mistress 
failed to recognize that the freedman was not her slave, 
but her former slave, and to treat him as such. But 
instead, old customs prevailed, and while the freed- 
man maintained his integrity as a rule (many did not), 
the new negro received and cherished strong sug- 
gestions from this source. 
Remove the contact, often too close, in the home; 
in business relations; in close-seated vehicles “bui!t 
for two”; on the farm, where too often girls and 
young women “hoe their rows,” or pick cotton along- 
side the negro man—sometimes wholly at his mercy, 
(and often becoming his victim)—and separate the
-P-A-G-E-165
A SOLUTION OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM. 161 
races in factories and workshops; let the negro jani- 
tor go from schools and colleges where girls are in 
attendance, and female teachers are employed; in a 
word, let Southern people recognize in the “New Ne- 
gro” a person far removed from the darkey of other 
days, and a suggestion that breeds deadliest poison 
in the mind of this new creature will be removed. 
It is this class of negroes most subject to the sug- 
gestion begotten by disapppointment in the develop- 
ment of race conditions, that the race has been robbed 
of rights by unfair methods, and he is impelled by a 
desire to possess and drag down the object of his lust 
to his own low level, not only by lutsful desires, but by 
a spirit of revengeful hatred. 
Race separation upon any conceivable plan, al- 
though strongly advocated by a few, among whom is 
a leading negro bishop of the African Methodist Epis- 
copal Church, and a Southern newspaper editor of 
note as a platform speaker, seems too chimerical to 
consider as a remedy in this connection. The negro 
does not wish to leave the country—not many of his 
race—and there are no legal avenues open to deporta- 
tion; and unless he could be legally deported, or could 
be induced to voluntarily clear our shores, in a body, 
the proposition fails of materialization. 
From the first proposition there is little to expect. 
And as regards the latter, an incident illustrative of 
the negro’s resourcefulness in expediencies, aptly sets 
forth his position in the premises: An old negro who 
was serving a term in prison for the offense of horse- 
stealing, was constantly upbraiding his fellow-prison- 
ers for their deeds, which had brought them into pris- 
on. He was particularly abusive of a certain one who 
happened to be serving a term for perhaps the same 
offense as his own. After submitting to a round of 
abuse, one day, more severe than usual, the fellow-

prisoner stopped the old man and said: “Now, look 
here, I admit you are right; my crime was a bad one, 
but what did you come here for?” This was sudden 
and unexpected, but the old fellow was equal to the 
demands upon him, and he replied: “Didn’t come 
here; white folks fotch me here.” 
With the negro here to stay, whatever is accom- 
plished in the way of a solution of this vexed problem 
must, to prove successful, have his co-operation. In 
the pulpit, in the public prints, in politics and at home, 
a demand is upon him to bend his intelligent efforts 
in the direction of bringing the weaker element of 
his race up to his own level of moral and intellectual 
standing. The hurtful and vicious suggestions that 
have so strongly figured in the past, must be met and 
overcome by counter-suggestions. 
The intensely religious nature of the negro is an 
excellent avenue through which to inculcate the re- 
ligious principle that demands good citizenship. The 
Divine command: “Let every soul be subject unto the 
Higher Powers,” carries with it no qualification. We 
should not “despise those in authority.” To cease from 
abuse of governmental institutions and men in au- 
thority would convey strong suggestion. In a word, 
counter-suggestion that will stop decline, arrest and 
restrain the vicious before actual outbreak, is the hope. 
Neither social nor political relations of a close na- 
ture are desirable to the intellectual colored man. 
The stamp that differentiates the races is as apparent 
to the negro as to the white man. There is a rela- 
tion, however, that is most desirable to both the fair- 
minded negro and the honest white man. It is a cor- 
dial, neighborly relation, that admits of free, open 
business intercourse, without any apprehension on the 
part of either of unfair methods being employed. 
Upon the white man more than upon the black, rests
-P-A-G-E-167

the responsibility. He is in position to invite this, by 
indirect suggestion, which must, and surely will, flow 
out of earnest effort upon his part. Let the negro un- 
derstand that he will receive honest compensation for 
services rendered, and how readily he will respond! 
He is so constituted; his confidence once won, his 
faithfulness is as strong as his emotional nature can 
make it. Let the negro understand that the white 
man is not jealous of his attainments. The fact that 
he does favor education among the race is strongly 
suggested by his willingness to pay taxes for that pur- 
pose. 
There is an element that has received no notice dur- 
ing this discussion, because his influence is of no ef- 
fect, pro or con, upon the race problem; it is the low 
white class. His vacillating and unstable character 
robs him of any influence among the intelligent, up- 
right citizens of either race, and the law that restrains 
and punishes the vicious blacks, operates with equal 
force in this case. 
The intelligent and upright people of the two races 
must meet this question, each in his particular sphere, 
and honest effort and patient waiting upon right sug- 
gestion will bring about a happy solution. 
THE NEGRO NOT A BEAST. 
‘A solution of the negro problem psychologically con- 
sidered has, without any special effort, proved that the 
negro is not “a beast,” notwithstanding an effort has 
been made to prove otherwise by distorting the Bible 
with disconnected sentences and phrases which are 
used for Biblical proof. The whole religious world 
may hide its face in shame and disgust at the thought 
that any one should be so sacrilegious as to try to use 
the Bible for such an unhallowed purpose. 
As we have pointed out in the first part of this psy-

chological treatise, “every human being is endowed 
with a dual mind, namely, objective and subjective. 
The objective, or reasoning mind, is controlled by the 
five senses (seeing, hearing, feeling, etc.), and is the 
outgrowth of man’s physical necessities. It is his 
guide in his struggles with material environments. 
The objective mind has for its highest function, rea- 
soning. The subjective mind takes cognizance of its 
environment by means independent of the five phys- 
ical senses. It perceives by intuition. It is the seat 
of emotions; it is the storehouse of memory. ‘This 
duality of the mind renders man susceptible to all 
kinds of suggestions known to the realm of psychol- 
ogy.” 
If we wish to draw an analogy from the Bible, it 
would be more in keeping with the eternal fitness of 
things to show that the internal evidences of the Bible 
are a greater and more conclusive argument of its own 
authenticity than the evidences deduced by natural 
theology ,or by prophecy, or by reasoning, so with the 
negro it did not seem necessary to prove that he was 
a man, or of the genus homo, because this is not only 
an admitted fact, but it is a self-evident fact. 
In the chapter on his semi-savage state, where he 
is viewed in his lowest mental development, it is 
clearly shown that he is highly susceptible to sugges- 
tion, under the same psychological laws as all other 
human beings, and by the immutable laws of sug- 
gestion, he has made progress along the lines of men- 
tal development. His objective mind has increased 
in proportion that his physical necessities have dic- 
tated. His subjective mind seems to predominate in 
his semi-savage state, owing to the fact that his rea- 
soning faculties were weak for want of cultivation and 
a chance to develop. Hence, the proverbial intuition

of the old darkey, which is often imitated by writers, 
and quoted as “Uncle Dick’s Philosophy.” 
Since the negro has had an opportunity to cultivate 
his objective or reasoning mind, like all other human 
beings, he does not depend so much on his intuition 
or subjective mind, but is able to employ his reason- 
ing faculties according to the same laws that govern 
his Caucasian friend. It is under this law that the 
negro is capable, if not hindered by wrong suggestion, 
to attain to still higher development, mentally, morally 
and religiously. If too much is expected of him, the 
responsibilities will have a tendency to dethrone his 
reason from the fact that he is only in the primary or 
undeveloped mental stage. 
It is hoped that all good people, both white and 
black, will realize that a great problem confronts 
them, and in proportion with the right suggestion, as 
given to the weaker race, only a few years removed 
from savagery, in that proportion will the problem be 
solved. .

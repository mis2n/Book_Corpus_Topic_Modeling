PREFACE 
Tue art of teaching is based upon a knowledge of chil- 
dren, of society, and of how one is to be adjusted to the other. 
For a knowledge of children we have the sciences of educa- 
tional psychology and educational hygiene. For a knowledge 
of society we have sociology, or the social sciences in general, 
and educational sociology in particular. Direct experience 
with children and in society and first-hand study of and par- 
ticipation in life are indispensable to those who would guide 
life effectively as teachers. For helping the immature adjust 
themselves happily to our complex social life, we use among 
other instruments the subjects of study. We call the methods 
of teaching each of the various subjects of the school special 
methods as distinguished from the general methods of teach- 
ing all subjects. 
When this book was planned and put into its first form 
it was expected to cover the field of general methods very 
briefly and the field of special methods in detail. Chapters 
on ‘‘The Educative Process,” “The Learning Process,” and 
“The Teaching Process” were prepared by the editor as an 
introduction to the chapters on special methods. It was later 
decided to change this plan, and the second two chapters were 
removed and printed in American Education (Albany, N. Y., 
Feb. to June, 1917).* The volume on “How to Teach,” by 
Strayer and Norsworthy (Macmillan), and other texts treat 
of general methods in elementary schools and may well be 
used along with or preceding this volume. The chapter on 
“The Educative Process” herein will, we hope, adequately 
introduce the problems of aims of education, minimal essen- 
tials of subject-matter, special methods, measuring results,

dated Rural School.”

the junior high school, and the correlation of subjects. The 
chapters on the kindergarten, measuring results, and the ’ 
final chapter by Professor Dewey giving a theory of ele- 
mentary education from the standpoint of pragmatism also 
contribute directly to teaching the elementary-school sub- 
jects in a modern way. 
Our chapter contributors have been chosen from among 
the leading specialists in all the “common branches,” most of 
them having written considerably elsewhere on their respec- 
tive subjects. It has been the aim to give briefly such a 
statement of minimal essentials of matter and method as 
will not only be of assistance to many actual and prospec- 
tive teachers and to parents in homes who attempt to teach 
their children, but will lead on to the monographic litera- 
ture on each subject. With the very rapid changes being 
made in the elementary-school subjects by the modern scien- 
tific methods of educational research and with a teaching pop- 
ulation of more than a half million, one-fourth of whom are 
new to the profession each year and four-fifths of whom have 
not had normal-school or college training, such a volume, 
we feel, may be of great service. Professional progress and 
the wide-spread application of recent scientific discoveries 
will be facilitated. Teacher-training departments in high 
schools, normal schools, colleges, summer schools, reading 
circles, and the teachers in the classroom before their pupils 
have been in the minds of the contributors while writing. 
To help to bring to bear apperceptively the worth while 
past experience and the best learning attitude of our readers, 
we have initiated the feature of the “preliminary problems,” 
hoping that previous discussion and meditation will pre- 
serve individuality and promote the self-active use of the 
chapters as instruments and suggestions by which to solve 
actual classroom problems when they arise. Such problems 
are a part of good pedagogical methods in the best class in- 
struction. Why should they not find their place in books? 
No teacher of teachers need use them if he prefers others

PREFACE Vv 
   They are here for those to whom they may be of 
The projects at the end of each chapter will also 
, we hope, a means to thorough discussion and ap- 
ition of principles advanced. A little theory with much 
cing and application is far better than its too common 
opposite. Further, the general division of each chapter is 
indicated by Roman numerals and subheadings, and the 
main points are brought together as theses at the end of each 
chapter. The bibliographies offer a brief but rich list of 
noteworthy and generally available literature not obtainable 
by teachers until within the last few years. The many photo- 
graphs are included at considerable expense because of their 
distinct additional service as experienced with our recent 
co-operative volume on “Educational Hygiene.” 
If the teacher will but take one or two of the best magazines 
of her profession, such, for a good example, as the Elementary 
School Journal, published by the University of Chicago Press, 
she will have little difficulty in learning of the latest and 
best publications for her service as they appear. The recent 
publication by the National Society for the Study of Educa- 
tion of Yearbooks (14th and 16th) dealing with the minimal 
essentials of the elementary-school subjects, and the splen- 
did scientific achievements now available in the form of scales 
for measuring accurately and objectively the progress of 
pupils in school subjects, cannot be too highly commended 
for use and have been of much value in preparing this hand- 
book. 
To the several contributors for their patient and skilful 
co-operation, to those who have furnished photographs from 
all parts of this country and elsewhere, to the publishers 
for their care suitably to embody and illustrate the volume, 
and to Frances Chandler Rapeer, my helpmate, the editor 
here publicly expresses his deep appreciation.

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
CHAPTER I 
THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS FOR INDEPENDENT StupDy! 
1. What do people usually mean by being educated or “getting an 
education” ? 
2. Can a person become fairly well educated without attending 
school? 
3. What man and woman in your community are most like your 
ideals of what boys and girls should become in adult life? 
4. What educative forces in school and out tended to make them 
admirable? 
5. What admirable qualities and abilities do they possess? 
6. How can we judge whether a person is educated or not? 
7. What phases of education, if any, cannot be carried on by the 
school ? 
8. How can we determine what subjects or phases of subjects are 
of most value to elementary school pupils? 
9. What is the average length of preparation and of service of ele- 
mentary school teachers in this country, and what effect has 
this on the development of a science of education similar to 
the science of medicine? 
to. What do you consider the chief points of difference between a 
trade and a profession ?? 
1 We have tried to preserve the individuality and to stimulate the self- 
activity of our readers by providing preliminary problems for independent 
study before the respective chapters are read. If these or others are worked 
out first, the reader will find that he not only understands the chapter better 
when he reads it, but he can utilize better his own experiences in thinking out 
the solutions to his own problems. The chapters are to be read for the sug- 
gestions and data they contribute to the individual solution of practical school 
difficulties.

2 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
I. Tue Epucationat SITUATION 
How to teach successfully in the elementary schools of 
our country is an annual and persistent problem to about 
a half million teachers. Of these approximately one-fourth 
are new to the profession each year, taking the places of 
those who have “kept school” for a shorter period on the 
average than it takes to learn to do well this delicate and 
important work. The situation is in marked contrast with 
the practice in certain foreign countries, such as France 
and Germany, where teaching is entered only after keen 
competitive preparation lasting a number of years, and the 
average term of service is near that of physicians, lawyers, 
bankers, and others—a life-work [29].! Lack of preliminary 
professional preparation and of teaching experience, for a 
large percentage of our teachers, combined with rising stand- 
ards of preparation, daily efficiency, and “keeping up” with 
rapid changes and developments in social conditions and in 
the science and practice of their profession, tend to make 
this problem of teachers more general and acute. Adding 
to their difficulties we find also (1) frequent lack of op- 
portunity before they enter the profession to study under 
permanent and highly-skilled teachers who may serve as 
examples, and (2) a wide-spread lack of skilled supervision 
and instruction after they enter, especially in rural and 
village schools. Many teach poorly because they have never 
seen good teaching done, nor learned before or during service 
the principles and skill necessary to effective teaching. 
Recent investigations by the United States Bureau of 
Education and other agencies show that on the whole the 
average professional efficiency of the entire group of persons 
who teach school each year is far below what it must be, 
and probably very much lower than that of some of the other 
professions in which long technical preparation, lasting one

to four years beyond a college course of four years, a life 
spent in the work frequently in one community, higher an- 
nual salaries, and more stimulating working conditions are 
the rule [r7]. We as teachers may well consider, for ex- 
ample, the skill, the knowledge, the methods of prepara- 
tion, the cumulative and recorded experience, the standards 
of self-sacrificing devotion to community welfare, the con- 
stant study and “keeping up to date” necessary, and the 
general ethics of the medical profession. The professional 
standards which we find being attained among the best 
physicians here and abroad, and the high standard now 
reached by the teaching profession in France and Germany 
are goals toward which teachers in America are slowly ap- 
proaching. Certainly the standards which now prevail will 
soon be rendered obsolete in the inevitable advance toward 
the higher-efficiency demands of both the public and the pro- 
fession. It is for that large proportion of prospective and ac- 
tual elementary school teachers who are attempting to live up 
to high professional ideals as public, official teachers in Am- 
erica’s democratic schools that this volume has been prepared 
by specialists in the methods of teaching the various elemen- 
tary school subjects. 
The free, public, elementary schools, compulsory for all 
children from five to seven up to twelve to sixteen years 
of age, have been slowly and resolutely established at con- 
siderable sacrifice by the American people. ‘The little red 
schoolhouse” now dots the land from sea to sea, and, until 
quite recently, the confidence of the great majority of our 
people in its far-reaching value and influence has been almost 
unlimited. However, the recent and increasing number. of 
local and state-wide surveys and investigations of school 
systems are both symptoms and causes of a desirably more 
critical and helpful attitude on the part of the public. The 
vigorous and scientific reorganization now going on in both 
tural and city elementary schools, and a greater tendency to 
make educational experiments, such as the Gary system,

the six-six (or six-five) plan of reorganization, rural school 
consolidation, elimination of useless subject-matter, measure- 
ment of results, and so on, bid fair to give in the next 
decade or two many decided improvements in methods of 
teaching, administration, courses of study, qualifications and 
requirements for teachers with accompanying financial and 
social recognition, and in generally improved social service 
to the supporting communities [16]. All teachers should be 
abreast of and participate in these movements. Many of 
them will be leaders. 
Methods of teaching school are determined by the nature 
and needs of society on the one hand and by the nature 
and needs of the children on the other. The fact that the 
human race has a pronounced tendency for its members to 
live little longer than seven or eight decades as a maxi- 
mum makes contingent an immature proportion of the popu- 
lation quite large in extent which, in the highest civiliza- 
tions, has to be raised, by passing on the social heredity, 
through many higher levels than those which separate the 
children of primitive peoples from their parents. Analysis 
of recent national-census statistics shows that approximately 
the following proportions of the population are of these im- 
mature-age groups:

4 This is ‘‘the white man’s burden,” cheerfully carried by a 
mature group which, after eliminating the superannuated and 
non-productive members, is of almost the same size as the 
immature group—an average of about one child or youth to 
each person of productive maturity [15, Chap. I, and 14].

THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 5 
If people lived to be a thousand years old on the average 
instead of about forty as at present and the number of births 
were proportionately decreased, the problem of elementary 
and secondary education would not be one of such magnitude. 
As Spencer quotes from an old song, in his ‘What Knowledge 
is of Most Worth”: 
“ Could a man be secure 
That his days would endure 
As of old, for a thousand long years, 
What things might he know! 
What deeds might he do! 
And all without hurry or care.” 
With all of our increasingly successful efforts to raise the 
average term, of human life, we shall probably not suffer 
much nationally from injurious and non-productive old-age 
conservatism and aversion to progress. Almost a fifth to a 
sixth of the population will continue to be of the present ele- 
mentary school ages, and society will constantly have the 
contingent problem of helping at great cost the immature 
members to become desirable mature members.! It is in 
this sense that teachers are makers of society. 
II. Tse Arms or Epucation 
Education and the Goal of Life.—The most fundamental 
answer we can give to the problem of the function of educa- 
tion is that it, like all other social processes and institutions, 
must help people to realize or attain the goal of life. Many 
answers have been given to the questions, “What is the aim 
or goal of life?” ‘“‘What are we to attempt to help children 
and adults to attain?” and “For what are we living?” The 
answer has always been difficult to discover and to state in 
any single term or terms, largely, as Professor Dewey points 
out, because life itself is the final goal: 
1If the six-year elementary school becomes the typical one ‘in place of the 
eight-year course, as seems now probable, the percentages will be, of course, 
slightly different. z

  6 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The ultimate end is simply life itself, an increase of its own vitality, 
and an enriching of its meaning. This is ivvaluable, and so unde- 
fined except with respect to the need which shows itself in life at a 
given time. Discipline becomes a value from the need of methodic 
power in the guidance of life; knowledge, because of the need of in- 
sight and. judgment; utility, because of the need of control of the 
conditions of the environment, and so on. ... Recognize that the 
educative process is in the last analysis identical with the process of 
life, and that life is not life save in growth, and education itself be- 
comes an invaluable or ultimate [14—Values]. 
Happiness (both individual and social), self-realization, 
duty, achievement, adjustment, normal functioning, growth, 
and other single aims have been set up as the goals. “Social 
efficiency” is a valuable term to use as a goal when it is 
carefully defined to include all that we have found best for 
“vitalizing and enriching” life. Christ’s statement, ‘I came 
that ye might have life and that more abundantly,” is of 
great value as an aim of education when we learn the factors 
which make for “‘life and that more abundantly.” This 
answer to the enigma is very close also to that given by 
Spencer of “living in the widest sense,” or “complete living.” 
As a general ethical statement of the goal, ‘“‘self-realization” 
comes near to being a satisfactory term—the rational control 
of life in such a way as to attain not only pleasure and hap- 
piness for all but other important and desirable ends held up 
by reason, as the highest phase of the self to be realized, and 
which may perchance be in conflict with happiness and plea- 
sure on the more instinctive plane. 
The constituents of the aim of education include the lower utilities 
of mere self-preservation—health, mastery of a vocation, and ability 
to get on well in society. The standard in reference to each of these 
varies. The health requirements of one age are not so exacting as 
they may be in the next, and the same is true of vocational skill or 
social adaptability. Education is bound to consult the existing stand- 
ards and to strive to better them where this seems desirable in view of 
the other aims of life. The aim of the school includes [also] the higher 
utilities, the ideal values of life, knowledge, beauty, and morality.
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 7 
These values are, as we have seen, grounded in instinct. Curiosity 
_leads on to the ideal of the intellect; the parental and social instincts 
lead, when rationalized, toward the ideal of duty, and there are doubt- 
less instinctive preferences of taste which are the foundation of intelli- 
gent esthetic appreciation. Since the ideal is in each case the instinct 
rationalized, we may speak of it as the ideal of the reason [18 : 528]. 
The constituents of the educational ideal include such fundamental 
conditions of self-preservation as health, vocational efficiency, and 
conformity to the social order. These are factors of the simplest 
phase of utility. The educational aim concerns [also] the service of 
the ideals of the reason, knowledge, artistic taste, virtue. These are 
the higher utilities, because in man’s scale of valuation they are held 
as of greater worth. The highest utility is the service of self-realiza- 
tion, and in the control of this the school may be assigned a voice. 
But everywhere it must keep close to practice, to relative values, to 
the gospel of achievement. It must be on the alert to the verdict of 
practice on its work. It must combine a wise conservatism with 
willingness ruthlessly to cut loose any form of culture, the service of 
which has fallen below that which its presence excludes from the cur- 
ticulum. Especially should the school cultivate the spirit of critical 
valuation or of utilitarianism among its pupils, for only through this 
can they achieve the highest service both for themselves and for the 
society in which they live [18 : 533-4]. 
While self-realization is a valuable philosophical term to 
hold up as the end or goal of life it has the disadvantage of 
being misunderstood as emphasizing the selfish, while terms 
like social efficiency, achievement, social happiness, and 
social progress are usually more meaningful and exact, and 
so probably more: serviceable. Any term like happiness, 
duty, culture, growth, or self-realization can be so defined 
and its elements so selected as to cover the meaning of other 
similar terms. The teacher should know her social and 
ethical philosophy well enough to get value from all and to 
see the underlying unity in them. She will usually find it 
difficult to state the ultimate goal of life and education by 
any satisfactory single term, but the proximate factors or 
goals are more easily named, and these she will find of the 
greatest value for every-day guidance. Our Declaration of 
Independence speaks of “‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of  
-P-A-G-E-26
  
8 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
happiness,” the first two contributory to the last, as being the 
object of our separation from the mother country. In some- 
what different words, the utilitarians have used well the 
same goal of “‘the greatest good to the greatest number.” 
In these times of great continental wars we see that na- 
tional or race perpetuation is no small part of the aim for all 
peoples and institutions. Its importance is realized when 
we learn that China has used her school system to promote 
national peace and perpetuation, and has actually succeeded 
in self-perpetuation, from the days of early Rome, which has 
long since gone down in dust, ashes, and disgrace, though at 
one time a democracy like our own. If a too intense and 
narrow nationalism has separated nations and destroyed 
peace to-day, a greater world patriotism and citizenship must 
be cultivated. Aristotle said that in a democracy the schools 
should be devoted to promoting the principal aims of a de- 
mocracy in order to insure the success of this type of life; 
and Lycurgus in practice and Plato in theory established 
public schooling systems that were dedicated and thoroughly 
organized to promote the welfare of the nation. In general, 
the principal aims and problems of a nation or people set the 
principal problems and aims of its state-supported and state- 
controlled schools. 
Need of Social Insight on Part of Teachers.—These prin- 
ciples which identify the general goal of education with the 
goal of life and of national and world progress involve the re- 
quirement that teachers know excellently well, first of all, 
our present-day complex (industrial) civilization, and the prin- 
cipal aims and problems which we here in America face. The 
principal moulders of the life of the nation must be persons 
with a thorough appreciation of the nature and meaning of 
our national life. To change the figure, the blind cannot 
well be leaders of the blind. Social science, beginning with 
acquaintance with the life of the people of the community, 
is thus of as much importance to the teacher and educator as 
a knowledge of child psychology and hygiene, indispensable
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS © 9 
as the latter are for skilfully guiding the growth of children 
toward the best type of social life to-day. Community and 
general social needs and aims stand first. The hand at the 
helm must see the guiding star. 
The nation as a'whole and each community are still carry- 
ing en, in an industrial and scientific era, our great experi- 
ment in democracy. No one yet foresees the outcome. Par- 
~ tial failure and manifold unsolved problems confront us on 
every hand. We have yet to live up to the expectations of 
our nation’s founders. Poverty, crime, political injustice, 
an enormous preventable death-and-illness rate, industrial 
oppression and lack of vocational preparation, immorality, 
selfishness, greed, graft, political indifference, lack of citizen- 
ship, inability of citizens to co-operate, to take the initiative, 
or to lead in public causes, insufficient and poorly used leisure, 
. indifference to the higher esthetic and intellectual activities 
which made Greece the pride of the ages—all these forms of 
serious maladjustment, which mean wide-spread failure to 
realize any reasonable goal of life, are still with us, contrary 
to the sanguine expectations of our forefathers for this glori- 
ous new country. It is significant that the United States 
Bureau of Education is at this late day asking for large ap- 
propriations to use in attacking the problem of bare illiteracy, 
greater here than in many modern foreign countries, and far 
below the necessary and minimum foundations of education 
for present-day democracy. These problems are especially the 
problems of all such government officials as teachers in public 
schools dedicated to social stability and amelioration [9, 10, 11]. 
Proximate Ends of Education.—Professor Bagley has ably 
argued for “ social efficiency” as the final goal of education. 
As he defines it, and since both happiness and self-realization 
are apt to be misunderstood and misused, thus “leading from 
the path direct,” the term has many practical advantages. 
Social efficiency, of course, is ultimately a means to the vitali- 
zation, growth, and enrichment of life; self-realization and 
rational character are reached thereby; and individual and so- 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  Io TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  cial happiness, or enriched and vitalized experience, char- 
acterizes such living. The goal of living is superior living [13]. 
A chart may easily be made showing the factors of the 
ultimate aim of life and education according to several dif- 
ferent educational philosophers. Constructed from several 
different points of view, they are all helpful. Most persons 
will, for example, readily agree with the analysis given by 
Professor Yocum below, especially since his term ‘‘ vocational 
efficiency ”’ includes both domestic and economic efficiency. 
These are easily understood problems of both the community 
and individual, and ends for the promotion of which, as will 
appear later, the schools are especially responsible. 
A modification of Gidding’s list of the aims, or “goods,” 
of life and of education as given in his “Elements of Soci- 
ology,” and based on the list given by Herbert Spencer, has 
been used by the writer in another place,! namely: 
1. Self-preservation, including the attainment of such min- 
imum goods essential to happiness or complete living, as 
health, food, clothing, shelter, and general protection. 
2. Race-preservation, including all that is necessary to 
make home life better, the relations of the sexes less a cause 
of serious maladjustment, and national or racial life more 
permanent and meaningful. 
3. Association, including all that makes social organiza- 
tion, social co-operation, and social happiness through group 
activities advance to a higher plane. 
4. Emancipation from fear, including all that substitutes 
science, confidence, and trust for superstition, excessive com- 
petition, warfare, and ignorant prejudices and attitudes. 
5. Individual growth and self-realization, including all that 
promotes the most complete social development of the indi- 
vidual through rational self-activity, life-education [13]. 
These factors found by analysis have proved of value in 
setting up standards for judging the worth of the content of 
1In American Education for June, 1913, article entitled “ Educational So- 
ciology.”” Published at Albany, N. Y.
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS it 
courses of study, and for holding up guiding points for methods 
of teaching. Teachers very much need such standards and 
such an analysis of the problems of life, since one of their 
great temptations is to teach subject-matter from text-books 
with too little regard to the relative worth of the matter for 
achieving any of the goals of education. Superintendents, 
supervisors, and principals need them, for they have the ten- 
dency also to take subject-matter by the “scissors-and- 
paste” method in making their courses of study, simply 
copying imitatively what other schools have done instead of 
discovering, surveying, and facing the problems which indi- 
viduals, community, and nation have to meet, and then help- 
ing them to attack these problems by such subject-matter 
and activities as will actually and most effectively solve them. 
An examination of the common and traditional high school 
curriculum will show that it quite largely omits preparation 
along many or most of the lines laid down as fundamental 
minimum essentials above, e. g., health, vocational efficiency, 
citizenship, avocation, and morality. The elementary school 
will find also that it has overlooked essentials for non-essen- 
tials because of a lack of such guides. Fortunately, in both 
elementary and secondary education there is to-day a general 
awakening to a sense of relative values, based on scientific 
analysis which is to take the place of our former naive tradi- 
tional imitation of “sanctified” subject-matter and methods.! 
Many of the recent educational surveys and other inves- 
tigations previously mentioned have asked of entire cities 
and states how well they were contributing to human wel- 
fare along one or more of these lines. The city of Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, for example, recently made a thorough study of 
the needs of its citizens industrially, and of how well it was

Publishing Co., Bloomington, Ill.

  12 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
contributing through the public schools to desirable kinds of 
industrial efficiency [35]. The cities of Springfield, Illinois; 
Cleveland, Ohio; Ipswich, Massachusetts, and many others, 
have made studies of their provisions for leisure and suitable 
educational recreation for young and old.t' The writer has 
made studies of how an entire state through its rural schools 
and twenty-five cities in several states were contributing 
through the public schools to ameliorate disgraceful health 
conditions [24 : chap. V]._ The needs for education along the 
lines of citizenship, and the part the schools can play in this 
prime factor of democracy and freedom have also been given 
considerable attention in the last few years. 
An analysis of social efficiency as the proximate aim of 
education gives us five phases or specific aims, namely, vital 
efficiency, vocational efficiency, avocational efficiency, civic 
efficiency, and moral efficiency. The chief changes which 
can be made in pupils to help them and their nation or civiliza- 
tion to achieve genuine social efficiency and universal happi- 
ness of the highest types are, according to Professor Yocum, 
also five in number. Children may, of course, be changed, 
or modified, in their development both physically and men- 
tally. The removal of adenoids and enlarged tonsils and the 
correction of physical deformities or faulty development may 
stand as examples of physical changes (not given space in the 
accompanying charts). ‘The five mental changes or forms of 
control, according to Professor Yocum, are: (1) vocabulary, 
or knowledge that is barely retained, (2) varying interconnec- 
tion, or knowledge that has taken on many-sided associations 
varying with individuals, (3) impression, or forgotten “knowl- 
edge” leaving its impress, including ideals, and appreciations, 
etc., (4) specific discipline (“knowledge”) or habits of a spe- 
cific character usable in particular situations, and (5) general 
discipline (‘‘knowledge”’) or more general habits due to trans- 
fer, such as the ability of a person to drive almost any auto-

-tion, Division of Recreation.

THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 13 
mobile after learning to drive a few typical ones. This analy- 
sis makes each element of social efficiency manifest itself as 
impression, vocabulary, variation, habit and system, and 
transfer. ‘‘Transfer” will be discussed later under the head- 
ing of formal discipline. 
A more common and easily understood classification, 
possibly, is the usual one into knowledge, habits, ideals, and 
appreciations, using the last term to cover several emotional 
factors. In these four ways we can change a child’s mental 
growth in the direction of the five phases of the aim of educa- 
tion. For example, mere knowledge about health is not 
sufficient for making healthy citizens. Pupils must be trained 
also in definite habits, ideals, and appreciations (including 
interests, tastes, attitudes, etc.). We use both classifica- 
tions in the accompanying charts, Doctor Yocum accepting 
the writer’s list of five types of changes instead of seven.   
Breaking down the old antithesis between knowledge and power, 
Doctor Yocum insists that nothing is educational which is not retained 
as knowledge in the mind of the learner, and that does not result in 
power—that is, in some form of control over the learner’s future ex- 
perience. The fundamental educational problem, therefore, becomes 
the determination of the stages or forms in which knowledge is retained, 
and the corresponding or resulting forms of control. He distinguishes 
between vocabulary and interconnection or variation control, because 
they correspond to distinct stages of retention—the bare retention 
which through a word holds an idea in mind with the least possible 
association with other ideas, and the growing many-sidedness of asso- 
ciation, which, varying with individuals, makes possible a varying inter- 
connection which he contrasts with definite and invariable habit and 
system. He fails to include appreciation and ideals as separate con- 
trols, on the ground that they are but two among many forms of im- 
pression. Forgotten knowledge, if it is educational, results in impres- 
sion control through feelings, prejudices, appreciations, realizations, 
interests, opinions, attitudes of mind, tastes, ideals, and incentives; 
partial knowledge is exercised as vocabulary control through the number 
and kind of words barely retained; many-sided and varying knowledge 
makes possible control through the varying interconnection of ideas basal 
for originality and initiative; definite and certain knowledge functions 
as habit and system control; all general knowledge may under favorable 
conditions become still further educational through transfer control.

Each form of control may be generally or specifically useful both in 
the field of general education and specialization. 
As Doctor Yocum’s controls result from actual stages of retention 
rather than philosophical or logical classifications, so his five social 
aims represent a specific educational demand for organized social 
movements. Religious education associations, denominational bodies, 
Young Men’s Christian Associations, Women’s Christian Temperance 
Unions, and similar organizations demand religious and moral train- 
ing. Hygiene associations, medical societies, physical-education and 
school-playground organizations insist upon training for health. The 
vocational education movement is rapidly becoming dominant through 
legislation. Education for citizenship is a constitutional justification 
for a system of public and compulsory education and taxation. Prep- 
aration for morality and social service is being popularized and com- 
pelled through sociological research and propaganda. A culture that 
prepares for social intercourse and an avocation that trains for indi- 
vidual leisure are already the aims of the traditional education. 
The interrelations of this analysis are expressed by the diagram 
on page 14. 
How Much the Schools Can Attempt.—What physical and 
health development, and what knowledge, habits, ideals, atti- 
tudes, and tastes are of most value to all and to varying 
groups of children, the limits of close adaptation to com- 
munity needs, and many similar problems are now being ex- 
perimentally worked out. Fundamentally, the determinants 
of the public school are as follows: 
I. The nature of American society and its aims: indus- 
trial, democratic, heterogeneous, and changing (not static). 
(Not forgetting, of course, world needs and conditions.) 
Il. The nature of American children: their heredity, 
their instincts, their habitual and conscious modes of mental 
development, their physical natures and modes of growth, 
and their varying individualities, 
Ill. The nature of the American public school then be- 
comes that of the adjuster—free, compulsory, and universal, 
and supplemental to other institutions and influences. 
What the school will or can do is thus seen to be almost 
boundless in scope. Its eyes are on the perfect or perfecting
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 17 
citizen and the evolving state, and upon the children who are 
to make these possible. As the educative influences of other 
institutions, like the home, church, and business, change, 
so the school, as a supplemental and state institution dedi- 
cated to the common good, must change. No traditional and 
hard-and-fast preconceptions of its mission, organization, and 
subject-matter will keep up with its experimental, supple- 
mental, and growing character. The teacher is not a mere 
drill-master of sacred subject-matter, but a builder of civiliza- 
tion, a maker of citizens who will promote a progressive 
democracy. The educator is in the first ranks of statesmen, 
as Plato so long ago foresaw, not a statesman in the sense 
of leaving the schools for a governorship, presidency, or other 
public office, as many to-day are doing, but as a creator of the 
national life through public education. No less a vision of 
the mission of teaching will long prove satisfactory in America. 
Happiness and Democratic Self-Activity.—Taking happi- 
ness and natural growth as at least an important element in 
our view of life, we come to a further principle, emphasizing 
the worth of the individual, namely, that his happiness and 
freedom must be provided for in childhood as well as in 
maturity, so far as is consistent with public welfare, the hap- 
piness of the group. The greatest amount and finest kind 
of happiness, growth, individual culture, and well-being pos- 
sible within social limitations must be provided for during 
the entire lifetime of the individual. Happiness for a life- 
time requires under present conditions certain necessary limi- 
tations on individual happiness, while making preparation, 
perhaps, and requires also that we teach the young how to 
find their happiness as much as possible along lines that will 
contribute most to social well-being and permanent happiness. 
We need not make school all play and a mere following of 
instincts which have originated in another more primitive 
type of life, for the reason that these need guidance and re- 
direction, and that much which is learned as a hardship be- 
comes pleasant with habituation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  18 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
But the ideal is, of course, to harmonize natural tendencies 
and individual and social needs in the most effective, pleasant, 
and economical way. The best preparation for living hap- 
pily and promoting general happiness in the future is to live 
happily and to help promote general happiness in the present. 
“Education is not merely a preparation for life; it is life.” 
The present satisfying life of children is as desirable to the 
state as the present satisfying life of adults. The best prepa- 
ration for any future life is to live well this life. ‘Life more 
abundantly all along the way ” is a necessary first principle of 
schools. The goal and the process of education are one. 
III.. THe PRocram oF STUDIES 
Teaching Texts vs. Moulding Community Life-—We are 
easily appalled by the tremendous social inheritance of knowl- 
edge, habits, and aspirations garnered up in books, customs, 
inventions, and institutions, which it would seem that all 
children of to-day must gain regardless of individual present 
happiness. Even as long ago as 1644 John Milton made out 
a course of study and exercise for the young so extensive that 
only a prodigy could learn it in a score of years. Since then 
the curve illustrating the increase of possible and valuable 
subject-matter has taken an almost vertical direction until 
to-day one would have to live to the age of a million to en- 
compass a great share of our present stored-up learning. 
Fortunately, it is not necessary for any one to make this 
attempt, even though Lord Bacon could in the time of Eliza- 
beth take all knowledge for his province. We must keep our 
attention focussed on the pressing needs of society and the 
attainment of health, vocational efficiency, morality, citizen- 
ship, the right use of leisure, and on the normal growth of 
the children rather than upon all the tools which may be 
brought to bear to accomplish our educative ends. We must 
be filled with a sense of the relative values of life and of 
minimum essentials rather than be obsessed with the teach- 
ing of all details of texts and of “covering the ground.”

  THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 1g 
Teachers who have looked upon the garnered wealth of 
the ages as stored up in text-books, as an end in itself, have 
constantly helped to defeat the aim of the educative process. 
As in any other constructive work in the world, we should 
use only those tools which are needed for the greatest effi- 
ciency in achieving our purposes—not every tool in the world, 
but just those of most worth, all things considered. Teachers 
and superintendents must be pickers and choosers. Just be- 
cause we possess excellent books on the abstract science of 
English grammar, for example, we have no reason for using 
them on American children. Just because “of the making 
of books there is no end,” we have no reason for attempting 
the impossible task of educating by books alone. Like an 
artist who with delicate touch selects just those materials 
which are needed in the creation of his individual art product, 
so the teacher, principal, and superintendent must select from 
the storehouse of the world those subtle materials, activities, 
and experiences which will establish in the children most 
efficiently the particular “conduct controls” promoting the 
definite ends of American life. 
_ Minimum Essentials of the Course of Study. —The various 
conduct controls which we may, through guiding the self- 
activity of children, help them to build up in such a manner 
as to insure with considerable probability the attainment of 
the various social ends such as vital, vocational, avocational, 
moral, and civic efficiency, will be discussed in the following 
chapters. According to Bagley’s classification, these controls 
are instincts, habits, knowledge, ideals, prejudices, and atti- 
tudes. Professor Yocum makes instincts merely one means 
to impression, under which he includes ideals, prejudices, 
and attitudes. He also separates knowledge, as suggested 
above, into vocabulary and interconnection, and adds trans- 
fer to habit. All the activities necessary to the establishment 
or modification of these various conduct controls in children 
may well be called the course of study, or the subject-matter, 
although the latter term usually implies mere book knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-40
  
20 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The great number of children who drop out of the ele- 
mentary schools with barely the elements of the tools of read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic, and the fact that a sound sense 
of relative values has not always been operative in selecting 
the subject-matter of the elementary courses of study, have 
led to investigations and experiments dealing with the elimi- 
nation of the useless or even de-educative material and with 
the selection of “the minimum essentials.” Between these 
two extremes of essential and non-essential values lies a third 
type of activity which is not important enough for drill and 
general requirement, but valuable in giving general acquain- 
tance with the world in which the students live, and in meet- 
ing individual needs. According to Professor Yocum, the 
main object of the determination of relative worth is the 
designation for each school subject and educational aim: 
First, of the details so obviously essential in some definite relation- 
ships that their permanent memorizing must be compelled by drill; 
Second, of those so low in their relative worth that they can be 
excluded altogether; or designated as not to be memorized at all, and 
Third, of those lying between these two extremes which exist in 
such variety for each degree of relative worth that it does not matter 
which are chosen, except in so far as they differ in relative likelihood 
of survival [36 and 37]. 
Professor McMurry’s Standards.—Professor Frank Mc- 
Murry also suggests standards of elimination that have had 
considerable influence. He recommends the elimination of 
details of subject-matter that are not useful in the broad sense, 
that are not within the comprehension of the pupils, that are 
not interesting, and that are not capable of being related to 
other details. He says we should eliminate: 
1. Whatever cannot be shown to have a lain relation to some 
real need of life, whether it be esthetic, ethical, or utilitarian in the 
narrower sense. 
2. Whatever is not reasonably within the child’s comprehension. 
3. Whatever is unlikely to appeal to his interest ; unless it is posi- 
tively demanded for the first very weighty reason.
-P-A-G-E-41
  
THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 2I 
4. Whatever topics and details are so isolated or irrelevant that they 
fail to be a part of any series or chain of ideas, and therefore fail to be 
necessary for the appreciation of any large point; this standard, 
however, not to apply to the three R’s and spelling. 
In his volume on “Elementary School Standards” [19] 
he gives the following suggestive bases for judging the relative 
value of subject-matter to be used in teaching: 
1. Bases for relation of subject-matter to children’s interests. In 
harmony with the previous discussion of standards for judging the 
quality of instruction as a whole, the quality of the curriculum in par- 
ticular is to be determined partly by its tendency to influence the 
tastes, purposes, and hopes of children. Any curriculum for the ele- 
mentary school should have its content selected from among those 
experiences of mankind that have seemed most valuable. This is to 
be presupposed. But this selection can be indifferent to the tendencies, 
interests, and capacities of children in general and of certain ages in 
particular, and aim at only present storage of facts and ideas that 
may count in a dim future, 7. e., adult life. Or it may be made with 
constant references to the abilities, tastes, and needs of children at 
the present time. In the former case, motive on the part of children 
is overlooked; in the latter case, the extent of provision for it is ac- 
cepted as one of the standards by which the curriculum is to be judged. 
We hold the latter view. 
2. Initiative evoked in teachers and children. A further basis for 
estimating the merits of the curriculum and syllabi is found in their 
attitude toward the exercise of initiative on the part of teachers and 
pupils. The syllabi in particular—being an interpretation of the 
curriculum and in addition containing suggestions on method—may 
show the subjects to be so attractive as directly to invite attack by 
children. They may suggest also so many different sequences of topics, 
and other procedures requiring choice, that they surround both teacher 
and pupil with an atmosphere of freedom and thus directly favor the 
exercise of initiative on the part of both. Or they can offer a skeleton 
so bare that it repels all who behold it; and they can, by offering no 
options and by repetition, so insist on certain suggestions of sequence 
and other procedures as to surround the teacher and finally, through 
her, the pupil with an atmosphere of restraint that tends to suppress 
all originality. 
3. Organization of subject-matter. ‘The first great condition of the 
proper organization of ideas in the pupil’s mind is that they be well 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
22 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
organized in the curriculum itself. If they be scattered there, it is 
too great a task to expect the classroom teacher to establish order 
among them before putting them before children. One of the first 
characteristics of a good curriculum, therefore, is avoidance of iso- 
lated facts. In general, whatever items of a study cannot form a 
necessary part of some valuable whole must be omitted; and those 
that are accepted should have a recognizable place in a series of ideas, 
with cross relations or correlation with other studies. 
4. Attention to relative values. Finally, the value of both cur- 
riculum and syllabi is to be judged by the emphasis they succeed in 
placing upon the more vital and real parts of each branch of knowledge 
in comparison with that placed upon the less important and more 
formal portions. Every study contains a multitude of minor facts 
that any one is expected to know, such, for instance, as dates in his- 
tory, situations of places in geography, and pronunciation and mean- 
ing of individual words in literature. These can stand out so promi- 
nently as to seem to constitute the body of the study; or they can 
be so subordinated to what is fundamental that the latter is made to 
carry the former and constitute the bulk of the subject. To the ex- 
tent that this latter object is effected the curriculum and syllabi satisfy 
one important test of excellence. 
In a more recent statement Professor McMurry gives more 
elaborately his statement of the “Principles Underlying the 
Making of School Curricula.” ! A summary of these prin- 
ciples which have been subscribed to by several prominent 
educators, appears in the following five points (summary and 
italics by the editor): 
1. “The subject-matter for a curriculum should be selected from 
among those experiences that are related to life and are likely, owing 
to their intrinsic nature, to appeal to the pupils directly as worth 
while.”” Thus many phases of subjects have been eliminated because 
less closely related to the needs of life than others available, and 
others have been selected or modified to conform more closely to the 
growing interests, purposes, and motives of pupils. The school must 
develop in students worthy interests and purposes, and must also 
give ability in testing relative values from the standpoint of such 
purposes. Appreciation of such values may be expected to develop 
as children grow older and are better trained in such discrimination 
and judgment.

THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 23 
2. “The best form of organizing the work or activities of a curriculum 
is in the form of a series of problems, especially for the more intellectual 
phases which make up the bulk of curricula.” Definite needs and 
wants form the best basis for the organization of the emotional and 
motor elements of each course. With these problems for each sub- 
ject there should appear in the course of study definite data; sugges- 
tions, sources, etc., should be provided the teacher. Such organiza- 
tion might be called the problem-method, but its use would not elim- 
inate entirely the use of either the topical or the old-type logical 
organization or use of subject-matter. One problem for a recitation 
or one problem with its several subproblems for several recitations 
could thus be arranged. 
3. “The relative importance of subject-matter, determining its final 
admission into the curriculum and its relative prominence there, must 
depend ‘mainly upon its relative importance in social life, and the 
pertinency of its relations to the purposes of the school.” This prin- 
ciple emphasizes the subjects most closely related to the principal 
needs of the children and people and, thus, the aims of education. 
For avocational and other aims, for example, games, social activities, 
fine arts, handicrafts, and music would be emphasized. For voca- 
tional and other aims, such problems as good roads, prevention of 
several diseases, investments, life insurance, care of the soil, knowl- 
edge of the various occupations and the opportunities and requirements 
therein would need to be emphasized. Some of the so-called fads 
would rise to the dignity of fundamental minimal essentials by the 
use of such a principle. Whole subjects and parts of subjects now 
required would be eliminated by the same principle. 
4. “The curriculum should make important provision for easy con- 
trol over knowledge on the part of pupils.” This would require much 
overlapping of problems for purposes of review, some use of logical 
organization, and correlation of studies. These cross relations should 
be mentioned in the curriculum. 
5. “Since every child differs more or less from every other in native 
endowment, past experience, and present environment, the curric- 
ulum should be so arranged as to be in the highest degree adaptable to 
each pupil.’ We are now familiar with different subject-matter for 
city and country children, fortunately, for pupils of different ‘ages, 
for the sexes somewhat, and slightly for different schools in the same 
town or rural region. Doctor McMurry thinks that the smallest unit 
for which subject-matter may be planned is the class. 
This is one of the few attempts so far made to express ex- 
plicitly the grounds on which teachers and supervisors may 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
24 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
select and organize the experiences of children for purposes 
of education.!. The writer is in general accord with the prin- 
ciples as stated, although he thinks that the social aims of 
education should be made more prominent, as given on a 
previous page. In the absence of more definite and objective 
standards or tests such statements of the principles involved 
in the selection of the materials the teacher is to use in help- 
ing pupils to achieve worthy ends are of much value. They 
point toward greater definiteness and scientific precision in 
teaching. They stimulate careful and painstaking examina- 
tion of the activities in which children engage in school, and 
will lead to avoidance of much of the “puttering around” 
and sentimental time-wasting which is so common in many 
classrooms and schools. 
Professor Yocum’s Standards.—Professor Yocum criti- 
cises Professor McMurry’s four standards for elimination, 
and sets up some of his own. His “more adequate test for 
total rejection or exclusion of particular relationships from 
both optional and essential content” is given in the following 
principles: 
Reject from the general course of study all relationships or phases 
of the course: 
1. Which are antagonistic to any phase of the educational aim; 
2. Which are not useful to a majority of individuals who are not 
specialists, or in a specialized phase of education, to the majority of 
those who are; 
3. Which are either being effectively taught outside the institu- 
tion for which the course is intended, or which cannot be effectively 
taught within it. 
Combined with principles of inclusion as well as exclu- 
sion from the school’s activities, we should have the following 
eight principles, as I gather them from his book on “Culture, 
Discipline, and Democracy”: 
1. The aim of education is fivefold, viz., health, citizen- 
ship, vocational (including domestic) efficiency, morality and 
1See also Thorndike’s chapter on this subject in Education, pp. 121-134.
-P-A-G-E-45
THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 25 
religion (including social service), and the right enjoyment of 
leisure. 
2. Discard everything which does not plainly and directly 
further this fivefold aim. 
3. Test all that remains of the present course of study or 
activities of the school, and also all not yet included in the 
‘ course as to its: 
(1) Many-sided applications and usefulness in furthering 
all phases of the educational aim; 
(2) Frequency of occurrence or frequency of need for such 
training in life; 
(3) Emotional appeal, including interest and accord with 
instinctive and acquired tendencies. 
4. Reject all that is adequately taught in other institu- 
tions, ¢. g., the home, industry, or the church. 
5. Reject also whatever cannot adequately be taught in 
a school. 
6. Test by number three above all that is thus obtained 
and collected to ascertain the essential relationships, or knowl- 
edge, habits, ideals, and appreciations, that must be certainly 
established in every individual, the minimal essentials for 
the majority of pupils, considering well the time which they 
have for the learning process. 
7. Select the less valuable relationships (knowledge, 
habits, etc.) that may be mastered by pupils in the time at 
their disposal and organize this optional content so as to: 
(t) Meet the needs of the individual, 
(2) Permit of specialization, 
(3) Meet the needs of the particular locality, 
(4) Permit of experimentation and self-discovery along 
various lines by the pupils. 
8. Arrange these two classes of subject-matter, the min- 
imal essentials and the optional or alternative content, so 
that all will be adapted to the needs and methods of growth 
of the pupils, to the length of the school year, etc.
-P-A-G-E-46
  26 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Formal-Discipline Theory Absent.—We do not find in 
these or other modern statements of the principles for judging 
the quality of teaching or of subject-matter the idea that a 
certain subject or phase of a subject may be justified because 
it ‘disciplines the mind,” ‘develops the power of reason,” 
“trains the memory,” ‘‘develops the faculty of observation,” 
“concentration,” ‘habit of work,” or any other claim of the 
kind, although Professor Yocum provides for such ‘general 
discipline” as is possible. In this they are different from 
past standards less consciously and carefully derived and ap- 
plied. We know that training in memorizing the spelling of 
words, regardless more or less of the necessity of their use in 
writing, does not develop to any significant extent our mem- 
ory for other types of mental content. We have pretty well 
proved that formal grammar as a separate “discipline” and 
study does not give much mental discipline or ability to reason 
well in general outside of the science of grammar. Tested by 
its relative usefulness in developing the specific conduct con- 
trols that make for any of the essential values of life, includ- 
ing the use of reasonably good English in speech and writing, 
formal grammar in the elementary school, in competition for 
the limited time of the pupils, fails to hold its traditional place. 
To a prospective specialist in English or the languages, 
such as a teacher of the subject or a writer, Professor Yocum’s 
second standard would probably work to keep in the subject 
of grammar if it could be provided for the one or more special- 
izing without requiring those who are not specializing to take 
it. The teaching of formal grammar as a special subject 
would be also somewhat contrary to the first standard men- 
tioned in that it tends to drive pupils from school and uses up 
the time for others that must be utilized in other ways in 
order to accomplish in the time available the essential edu- 
cational aims. A subject may be intellectually interesting to 
many pupils; it may be of some value; it might be a desira- 
ble subject for all persons to know; but if the time which it 
takes up can be spent to better educational advantage, then 
it must give way to more effective tools.
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 27. 
High school teachers should try such standards on the 
secondary school subjects, including the non-English languages 
and the non-arithmetical mathematics,! on the recondite and 
formal-science courses and the more modern general-science 
courses, as well as on other subjects not yet well established 
in secondary school curricula such as those relating to health 
and physical development, to industrial and domestic effi- 
ciency, to citizenship and morality, and to the right use of 
leisure. The elementary teacher should apply them to all 
her topics and subjects, and to the school activities not usually 
considered a part of the course of study. They are of value 
in selecting as well as rejecting topics and activities within 
almost any general course of study. 
Application of the Various Standards of Selection and Re- 
jection of Subject-Matter.—We may now, for further illustra- 
tion, sketch briefly the application of these standards to one 
or more other phases of elementary school activity. Let us 
take spelling. Doctor L. P. Ayres of the Russell Sage Founda- 
tion has recently made a study of the words most commonly 
used by people of all ranks in their correspondence, or letters, 
about the only place they need to know how to spell. Five 
hundred forty-two words made up seven-eighths of all the 
words used in all of the two thousand letters analyzed! Later 
he has prepared a spelling scale of a thousand words most 
commonly used and which probably make up ninety-five 
per cent of all words used by the majority of plain American 
people in their writing. (See page 67.) The words are ar- 
ranged by grades and according to difficulty as found by 
testing thousands of school children. This set of a thousand 
words, with a few modifications, will probably become the 
first minimal essentials of a course in spelling for thousands 
of school systems in this country. Now what right have we 
to place these words as required minimal essentials in the 
common schools of this country? Let us examine them in 
the light of the eight standards previously given. 
1See articles along these lines in School and Society for January 8 and May 
15, 1916, and in The English Journal for June, 1916, by the editor. 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  28 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The average spelling-book now used in schools has up- 
ward of eight to ten thousand words which pupils are re- 
quired to learn. Doctor Ayres found in his survey of the 
Springfield, Illinois, public schools, that children were being 
required, as in most school systems, to spell many words 
which they and the most advanced citizens of their community 
never used nor needed to use in writing. Eleven prominent 
citizens were given a test in the spelling of ten words taken 
from the required spelling lists of the seventh grade. All 
failed to make a passing grade.1 The average mark was 
twenty-six per cent. The words were abutilon, bergamot, 
dentzia, daguerreotype, paradigm, reconnaissance, erysipelas, 
mnemonics, trichine, and weigelia. If rare occasion had 
ever necessitated the writing of one of these words, these men 
had probably used a dictionary. They had no need for bur- 
dening their minds with the learning of such spelling. Yet 
the same school children who were spending much valuable 
time on such words failed to spell correctly many common 
words which they needed to know how to spell in their writing, 
such as which and receive. The dictionary habit can be de- 
veloped for the spelling of unusual words. A large propor- 
tion of children drop out of school before completing the first 
seven or eight grades. These thousand words, although omit- 
ting some that are necessary, are more carefully and scientifi- 
cally selected from the vocabularies of children and adults as 
used in common writing, however poorly, than perhaps any 
other group yet selected.2 With these preliminary facts we 
may proceed to the application of our tentative standards. 
From the standpoint of the first two standards we should 
probably include ability to spell these words correctly in 
letters, and perhaps another thousand most commonly em- 
ployed by the majority of individuals, as having a plain and 
direct relation to the attainment of all or several phases of 
the educational aim: Communication and recording in writ- 
ing is an almost universal necessity to-day. The time taken 
‘to learn these few hundred words with good methods is not

excessive, and will probably not exclude more valuable ac- 
quisitions which could be made in the time required. Most 
of them can be learned incidentally by the end of the fifth 
grade. Drill would lower the age. 
From the standpoint of its ‘‘many-sidedness of useful re- 
lationships, its frequency of recurrence of useful relationships, 
and its inherent sensational or emotional appeal,” this group 
of words ranks fairly high. Writing, and consequent spelling, 
is required in numerous life situations frequently recurring, 
and the emotional appeal of the needed subject-matter can 
be strengthened by providing motivation for spelling in con- 
nection with writing which pupils desire to do in communica- 
tion. For purposes of socialization, democracy and the 
times demand a maximum of communication to knit people 
together into a universal brotherhood; consequently we may 
well encourage more extensive communication by making 
written communications in letters very easy and habitual for 
all, letter-writing being a minimal essential of composition. 
This list of words also meets the demands of principles 
four and five, since the words are not being effectively taught 
outside of the schools except to certain business-college stu- 
dents, proof-readers, printers, and other specialized groups, 
and they can be taught by the schools, largely incidentally, 
in connection with composition and other work. This group of 
words may then well be required as minimal essentials in spell- 
ing for the elementary school, or the first six grades, while an 
optional list made up of other words needed in particular 
localities, and for specialization by various individuals may 
also be utilized. The group of words thus meets fairly well 
all the demands of the standards.

University of Missouri made studies to determine what errors 
connected with grammatical rules were made by children 
in the grades three to eight in the schools of a large western 
city, to determine what phases of grammar, if any, should be 
taught in the elementary schools. The following eliminations 
from the subject-matter found in the language books then 
in use were suggested, and the suggestions given on the right

the fundamental aims of the school, such as health, citizen- 
ship, industrial and domestic efficiency, etc. 
For Arithmetic.—Superintendent Thompson has worked 
out certain ‘‘minimum essentials” in arithmetic, such as the 
forty-five addition and forty-five multiplication facts which 
children should be able to use habitually without hesitation 
in all common life situations requiring such automatic con- 
trols. He says that the number of such facts in arithmetic 
is, when analyzed out, astonishingly small. For example, 
there would be little more than: ‘The sum of any two figures 
when the sum is not more than twenty, the difference of any 
two figures when the larger is twenty or less, multiplication 
through the table of twelve, and the reversal of the same in 
terms of division, denominate numbers, and aliquot parts of 
one hundred.” These facts he has placed on sheets and used 
for drill, and pupils make a hundred per cent achievement [30]. 
Principal Maxon of Yonkers, New York, has an ingeni- 
ous kind of drill device for isolating certain essential habit 
facts of arithmetic, and for getting remarkable results in 
rapidity and accuracy in them, entitled, “Self-Keyed Num- 
ber Cards” [23]. 
Doctor S. A. Courtis and Superintendent Studebaker have 
also very helpful practical tests for producing similar results. 
The 1915 and 1917 Year-Books of the National Society for 
the Study of Education are devoted to this important topic, 
most of the elementary school subjects being treated. Much 
of the material in these reports is of direct classroom value, 
and teachers should not wait to have it faintly filter down to 
them from superintendents. For example, an authoritative 
table of twenty of the most important dates in American 
history, worked out by Professor Bagley, for memorization 
in the seventh and eighth grades, strikes the eye in leafing 
through the 1915 volume:!

A “Committee on the Elementary Course of Study” has 
published a Bulletin through the Minnesota State Depart- 
ment of Education (Saint Paul) in which it has also attempted 
to state minimal essentials in elementary school subjects. 
The Iowa State Teachers’ Association published exten- 
sive reports on “Elimination of Subject-Matter,” in 1915 and 
1916.1 This committee recommends from arithmetic the elim- 
ination of: formal number work in the first year, the greatest 
common divisor, complex fractions, fractions with large de- 
nominators, puzzle problems, long process of division of frac- 
tions, decimals beyond three places, Troy weight, apothecaries’ 
weight, surveyor’s measure, table for folding paper, tables of 
foreign money, reduction of compound numbers beyond two 
or three places, complicated and imaginary problems involv- 
ing percentage, more than one method of finding interest, 
annual interest, true discount,? partial payments,! partnership 
with time, foreign exchange, compound proportion, cube root, 
metric system, and a number of other topics. Topics to be 
emphasized are also given. 
Other reports are to be found in these volumes on: lan- 
guage and grammar, writing, geography, hygiene, history, 
and spelling. These are of the greatest value to teachers 
and superintendents.

  THE EDUCATIVE PROCESS 33 
In general, there are certain fundamentals in education 
for a democracy like ours which we should be determining. 
The teacher will profit in many ways by such selection. 
Since she is now overburdened with a jumble of subject- 
matter, her burden would be lightened; wise selection and 
organization on scientific and social grounds would help her 
teaching; tests of her work would be much fairer, since they 
would test for essentials which she would know in advance, 
whereas at present she too frequently has little chance of 
learning the requirements except by studying the personali- 
ties of the supervisors and examiners; she herself would also 
use at all times the same standards as her superiors in judg- 
ing relative values. The school need not thus become more 
mechanical, since more time will be available for other types 
of teaching exercises than drill, and drill would become more 
meaningful. The values of life are the final standards, and 
these each teacher must, in her own community and in her 
own country at large, assiduously study. Personal, first-hand 
acquaintance with the problems which the plain people of 
her community meet day by day, and acquaintance with the 
types of life toward which they are more or less blindly striv- 
ing, are necessary for her own more ultimate standards. All 
three methods of determining the essential school activities 
should be utilized: (x) by applying the five great aims of 
education, (2) by studying the needs and problems of the 
people, and (3) by using objective scales and. standards, as 
in writing and reading. 
Later chapters will emphasize this social relationship of 
the teacher in connection with the suggestions for selecting 
and teaching the elementary school subjects.

I. TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
SUMMARY 
. We as teachers need to view ourselves professionally and take 
steps which will make our profession more than a mere trade. 
. A more critical and scientific spirit is leading education to firmer 
ground on which definite aims can be ascertained. 
. The problem of education is to promote growth and social happi- 
ness through social efficiency—to help people solve the problems 
of life. 
‘These problems may be classified into five main groups and stated 
as phases of social efficiency to be developed, namely, vital 
efficiency, vocational efficiency, civic efficiency, moral efficiency, 
and avocational efficiency. 
The changes which can be made in individuals to help them meet 
these ends are both physical and mental. On the mental side 
the chief changes are those in knowledge, habits, ideals, and ap- 
preciations. These aims and changes give us certain standards 
for guiding education. Doctor Yocum. classifies the changes 
differently. 
The determinants of educational policy are fixed also by the na- 
ture of American society, of American children, and of the 
American school itself. 
We need ability in selecting those activities and those phases of 
subject-matter which are most educative. 
Professor Frank McMurry and Professor Yocum have both at- 
tempted to give us standards by which to select and reject sub- 
ject-matter. 
Professor McMurry’s standards state that those phases of sub- 
ject-matter are most valuable which best meet the aims of edu- 
cation, i.e., are most clearly related to the needs of life and 
which appeal most to the pupils as worth while. Professor 
Yocum would add to these two principles a few others. 
The theory of formal discipline should not be used as a standard 
for judging the value of subject-matter. 
The standards when applied seem of value in the selection and 
rejection of subject-matter. The five aims, the common needs 
of people, and objective standards of achievement should all be 
used in determining the essentials.

discipline from the study of subjects or parts of subjects which 
we do not need in life? (6) What are the leading articles and

. What would you have to put into your school activities to de-

your community? 
. Do the people of your community regard well-used leisure as an 
end for which education is desirable? Do they have sufficient 
leisure, and do they use it well? How can your school best 
help to meet this problem for old and young? 
. How much time can be saved pupils in arithmetic by excusing 
from drill on essentials those who have attained a reasonable 
standard and by giving other work or recreation to them? 
. If you were in a rural community how could you learn what types 
of arithmetic problems the people most needed preliminary 
school help in solving? (See Thomas’ “Rural Arithmetic.”) 
. Send to the U. S. Bureau of Education, Washington, D. C., fora 
list of its bulletins. On this list check those which you consider 
most valuable. Send for some or all of them. 
. What are the leading educational magazines? Which two or 
three would be most helpful to you as a teacher, and how much 
do they cost a year? Send for sample copies. 
. Make a list of the schools or systems which seem to-day to be 
best adjusting the schools to the needs of children and their 
communities. 
Make a list of principles or standards of your own for judging the 
relative value of different subjects and topics. How do you 
differ from Professors McMurry and Yocum?

THE KINDERGARTEN AND THE ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
. To what extent is the education of a child to be based upon the 
instincts, native tendencies, and impulses developing at his 
particular age? 
. What are some of the most fundamental interests and significant 
native tendencies, or instinctive activities, characteristic of 
children from three or four to six or seven years of age? 
. What use has been made of these natural resources in the aver- 
age kindergarten or first grade of the elementary school? 
. Should the kindergarten emphasize very much the preparation of 
the children for success in the primary department of the ele- 
mentary school? 
. Froebel said that the child should live to the fullest the stage of 
development he wasin. Does this modify your answer? Why? 
. Are all the children of the average kindergarten in the same stage 
of development? In what ways are they alike and different ? 
. To what extent does the first-grade teacher consciously build her 
work on what has been done in the kindergarten? 
. Is the child put through a prearranged scheme of activities in 
kindergarten and first grade or are the activities and the nat- 
ural growth of instinctive tendencies directed toward social 
aims? Which school seems more natural and educative as 
tested by the five previously-mentioned factors of social effi- 
ciency ? 
. Should the kindergarten curriculum of activities be modified to 
meet the needs of the particular children, the particular com- 
munity, and the general social environment of the children? 
Or should the kindergarten be the same everywhere? 
What data can you find which prove whether children who have 
had the kindergarten training succeed better in the elementary 
school than children who have not? How can the percentage 
of successes be raised?

KINDERGARTEN AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 39 
I. Tse Evorurion oF THE MODERN KINDERGARTEN 
The Froebelian Kindergarten.—The kindergarten in its 
first days was not a system. The experimental child study 
carried on by Friedrich Froebel between 1805, the year of his 
first teaching experience, and 1852, the year of his death, was 
constantly directed toward the formulation of principles, not 
of practice. In this “pre-formal” period the greatest em- 
phasis was laid upon the necessity for constant companion- 
ship with children, in order that the first dawnings of power 
and interest might be noted by the teacher and used as the 
foundation of all instruction and training toward the social 
aims of education. In Froebel’s writings we are brought ° 
face to face, again and again, with concrete situations in which 
some child is meeting with an experience, slight in physical 
character, but deep in its significance for educational growth 
and social progress. 
A child has found a pebble. In order to determine by experi- 
ment its properties, he has rubbed it on a board near by—it is a frag- 
ment of red stone or chalk, and he has discovered its property of im- 
parting color. See how he. delights in his newly discovered property 
and how busily he makes use of it. A new world opens within and 
without, for what man tries to use he begins to understand. 
“Let it lie,” the vigorous youngster exclaims to his father, who is 
about to roll a piece of wood out of his way. “Let it lie, I can get over 
it.” The healthy boy, brought up simply and naturally, never evades 
a self-found obstacle, a difficulty; nay, he seeks it and overcomes it. 
Would you, O parents and educators, see in a picture what I have 
here indicated (the value of self-activity), look into this education 
room of eight boys, seven to eight years old. On a large table of this 
much-used room stands a chest of building-blocks—the finest and most 
variable material that can be offered a boy for purposes of repre- 
sentation. Sand or sawdust, too, have found their way into the room, 
and fine green moss from the last walk in the beautiful pine forest. 
Each has begun his own work. Now, each has finished his work, each 
one examines it and that of the other boys. Who can point out the 
varied significance of these plays of boys? !

  40 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The school at Keilhau was noted for all the characteristics 
one would expect, as the result of such sincere and earnest 
child study. A strong family spirit prevailed, bringing to the 
intercourse of the teacher and pupil the informality of com- 
radeship and mutual confidence. 
The key-note of the daily program seems to have been 
spontaneity and flexibility, rather than guidance and formality, 
and was designed primarily to lead children to the self-dis- 
covery of their own powers, through giving them experi- 
ences which would stimulate self-employment along educa- 
tional lines. The child’s fundamental instincts were made 
the starting-point of all adult plans. The play spirit was 
given opportunity for suitable expression, and thus aroused 
the creative spirit; the instinct of curiosity was used as the 
stepping-stone to useful knowledge, not formal instruction 
by adults; the social instinct was deepened into rational 
ethics. Instruction was, first of all, made vital, whether it 
were in tilling the ground, learning a song, building a struc- 
ture, or the assimilation of facts of physical science. In this 
experimental school Froebel proved his ability to master 
elementary school problems, even before he had fully grasped 
the possibilities of the kindergarten. 
Period of Emphasis on Formality or Type Experiences.— 
In what way extreme formality and the overemphasis of 
symbolic rather than concrete experiences crept into kinder- 
garten methods is one of the complexities of history which it 
is almost impossible to unravel. Suffice it to say, that fifty 
years after Froebel’s death, we find a system grown up, rigid 
in its adherence to line and form, inflexible in method, and 
exclusive and autocratic in its philosophy of education. The 
chief characteristic of this type of kindergarten was that of 
all formal schools—too literal a belief in the “universal” or 
“type” child, to whom “universal” or “type” experiences 
can be given in a prearranged series of exercises. Froebel 
did recommend certain types of experience as being funda- 
mentally stimulating to a child’s mental growth, viz.: nature

study, block-building, paper construction, stringing, weaving, 
language lessons, etc., and immediately after his death, the 
systematization of the kindergarten “program” or “cur- 
riculum”’ began. As years went on and the system of work 
became more and more perfected, the social, psychological, 
and physical needs of individual children dropped from 
prominence, and we have, instead of the provision for free, 
spontaneous, personal reaction which characterized Froebel’s 
school, a set form of procedure which was insisted upon in all 
kindergartens regardless of environment or individual stages 
of development. 
Along with and closely related to the formality of this 
period grew an increasing emphasis on the symbolic, rather 
than the scientific, approach to truth. Froebel based his edu- 
cational principles on the deep and solemn philosophy of the 
essential unity of all things and sought to discover and dis- 
close mystic laws, which might resolve all variation and 
manifoldness into final union. That part of his writings 
which most concerned itself with this search was made the 
groundwork of all kindergarten training and led, like the 
fanatical use of all fine-edged tools, to the destruction of 
much of the real truth underlying the sometimes excessive 
symbolism of Froebel’s philosophy. It is easy to understand 
how, given a belief in the ‘‘universal” child as the being to 
be educated, and a belief that all human experiences can best 
be understood by isolating them from their concrete sur- 
roundings and presenting their inner meaning through the 
abstraction of symbolism, the kindergarten grew further and 
further removed from real child life and social needs and failed 
generally to correlate its work with that of the school system 
in general. Dewey’s criticism in “Democracy and Educa- 
tion” is in point. 
Return to ‘‘ Pre-formal ” Period.—A return to the “pre- 
formal’ period is the intense desire of those kindergartners 
to-day who wish to see in the kindergarten a kinship with 
modern aims and principles of education. This desire has 
   
-P-A-G-E-64
  42 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
come about (x) through the stimulus of the child-study move- 
ment and (2) through the growing emphasis among educa- 
tional thinkers on the need of preserving in the coming gen- 
eration individuality and responsibility of thought as the 
most efficient guide to social action. The kindergarten in its 
original state was in advance of the elementary school in its 
emphasis on child study rather than on the subject matter 
of the curriculum. However, when the child-study move- 
ment swept over America, fifteen years ago, the elementary 
school accepted the new point of view more readily than the 
kindergarten, which was then in its most formal period. In 
the last few years an effort has been made by many kinder- 
gartners to drop the old forms and put the individual child’s 
need in its rightful place—at the centre of educational effort. 
This has resulted in the establishment of two schools of kin- 
dergarten practice, the “new school” in the kindergarten 
corresponding to the “new school” in elementary education. 
The cardinal doctrine of this new school is the thesis that 
children do not all develop at the same rate or in the same 
way.! While certain characteristics are common to the 
majority of children at a given age, certain other individual 
characteristics show themselves according to environment 
and must be reckoned with if a child is to be developed up 
to his native possibilities. For this reason the kindergartner 
of the new school would base her program on problems 
rather than prescribed subject matter—such problems as will 
allow for individual reaction on the part of the children, thus 
giving her a clew to their individual powers and interests. 
Returning then to Froebel for her educational philosophy, 
she will found her scheme of work on the child’s desire (1) to 
create self-actively new forms, (2) to gain self-actively new 
knowledge, (3) to communicate and share in a social world. 
The approach to poetic and symbolic meanings in experience 
is made through the concrete rather than the abstract, 
though the new kindergartner does not minimize the lasting

effect of beauty and poetry of feeling in the life of a little 
child. She maintains, however, that the poetry of life can 
only be felt through living, not through seeing. 
II. Wuat is A KINDERGARTEN? 
A Place for the Study and Utilization of Native Ten- 
dencies.—The child brings to the kindergarten a store of 
native tendencies to action, some racial, some individual. 
The teacher should bring an intense interest in these dawn- 
ing manifestations of power, some scientific knowledge of 
the psychology of childhood, a scientific attitude of watchful- 
ness rather than of acting on preconceived judgments, and a 
skill in the choice and use of all materials which will provide 
stimuli for growth along right social lines.1 The educator 
and the “‘being to be educated ” have, from time immemorial, 
brought these contributions to the teaching and learning 
process, and it is their vital interaction which makes a true 
kindergarten or any other department of school life. 
General Native Tendencies Present at Kindergarten Age. 
—Among the general native tendencies which one may look 
for in kindergarten children, placing first and foremost those 
most significant for early education, are these: 
Play.—The spontaneous, exuberant, unreflective response 
of children to their environment; the self-active representa- 
tion of the inner child through inner necessity and impulse 
(Froebel); the means whereby the young of a species indulge 
joyously in those activities which prepare them physically 
and mentally for future life (Groos); activities which may 
readily be guided toward the great aims of education, in 
general, social efficiency. 
Constructiveness—The impulse to transform physical 
material in such a way that the new form represents ade- 
quately to the little creator the embodiment of a mental im- 
1 Emphasized also by Montessori. See Kilpatrick, ‘The Montessori Sys- 
tem Examined.”
-P-A-G-E-66
  
44 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
age best expressed in that form. The desire thus to trans- 
form material is strong in little children, and is obviously a 
great educational force. 
Imitation —The impulse to learn from others’ successes 
than from personal experiment. This is of educational 
value, of course, in all modes of learning in which the prime 
object is standardization rather than individuality of reaction. 
Added to these are the following: fear, anger, curiosity, 
affection, sociability, shyness. 
These general native tendencies, though they appear in 
all normal children, are not always prominent at the same 
age. The distinction between “chronological age’ and 
“mental age,” which is so marked in modern discussions of 
retardation, refers purely to this point: development in the 
human race along common lines is uniform in character, but 
not in rate of speed. The vital point at issue, therefore, is 
not the recognition that strong racial characteristics do appear 
and are potent forces in education, but that the greatest care 
must be taken to ascertain their period of greatest strength in 
an individual, and at that time provide stimuli which will turn 
these forces of nature to the furtherance of useful learning, 
instead of letting them lie fallow and die away from inanition. 
To counterbalance the impulse of fear by the impulse to 
investigate; the impulse to withdraw shyly from strangers 
by the impulse to share experience with companions; and to 
deepen the impulsive affection into real “social service””— 
these are the problems for the study and solution of which 
the kindergarten finds its excuse for being. 
Laws of Growth.—Whatever promotes the right develop- 
ment of children, whatever makes them grow, whatever 
makes them more fit to go on to the next step in the educa- 
tive process, this the modern kindergarten stands for, accept- 
ing as its basic rule of procedure the following summary of 
Froebel’s laws of development:

tions, and Dewey’s “School and Society,”’ University of Chicago Press.

1. Every organism develops in accordance with the high- 
est and simplest laws of life. 
2. Every organism develops in accordance with its own 
individual nature, and in conformity with the specific laws 
of that nature. 
3. Every organism develops under the collective influence 
of all surrounding organisms. 
4. Each successive stage of development does not exclude 
its predecessor but transforms and ennobles it. 
TI]. Wsat THe Kinpercarten Is Tryinc to Do 
Its Connection with the Primary Grades.—There was a 
day when the one test of the kindergarten was whether kin- 
dergarten children fitted into the primary grades, without 
undue readjustment to school values and methods. The 
criticism of the poorest grade teacher was sometimes ac- 
cepted as condemnatory of the entire system, and the kin- 
dergarten was hated or loved according to its relation to the 
primary grades. Though we have outgrown this position, 
it is becoming more and more the wish of all concerned that 
the kindergarten and first primary grades might be so estab- 
lished on the common basis of the psychology of the ages 
from five to eight that the step from kindergarten to the first 
grade need not be a pedagogical break. The integrity of the 
entire school system demands that “each successive stage of 
development shall not exclude its predecessor, but shall trans- 
form and ennoble it.”” To know truly any stage of develop- 
ment demands a knowledge of that which came before and 
that which will come after. The student in the kindergarten 
training-school makes a study of the nursery period; she 
should just as exhaustively make a study of at least the first 
grade, and preferably the first three grades. The primary 
teacher is keenly alive to the problems of the grades im- 
mediately about her; she should study just as carefully 
the pedagogy of the kindergarten. The child who presents 
himself to her for instruction has probably been under its 
   
-P-A-G-E-70
  46 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
influence for at least a year, and to break away completely 
from a previous line of training always involves a great waste 
of energy and a suppression of many budding powers. The 
kindergarten does not represent a complete cycle of training 
from which a child can be graduated into the primary grades 
a finished product, but tries to provide an environment which 
will arouse and start into the right path all activities which 
ought to prove valuable to later education. The kindergart- 
ner, herself, has often chosen her environment with too much 
regard to ‘“‘universal’”’ values, but with too little regard to 
particular needs of individual children. On the other hand, 
the primary teacher has often planned her school environment 
with complete indifference to, or ignorance of, what has been 
begun in the kindergarten. Both have frequently failed to 
keep in mind the great fivefold aim of all teaching. If we 
must, for administrative reasons, have cycles of training in 
our educational system, let us, for pedagogical reasons, divide 
these periods according to psychological development and 
community needs, instead of according to subject matter, 
thus making the ages from five to eight or twelve a unit instead 
of those from six to fourteen, as is now the custom. This 
would tend to make continuous and natural the educational 
development of the child from the pre-school period on 
through the elementary and high school. 
IV. Tue PREPARATORY VALUE OF THE KINDERGARTEN 
The Kindergarten as a Preparation for Life.—It is un- 
doubtedly true that the kindergartner has some justification 
for claiming that she “prepares for life and not for the next 
grade.” The naiveté of this claim lies of course in her arro- 
gating to herself the exclusive right to this great preparatory 
function. Nevertheless, she is right when she claims early 
education as the foundation of the physical, mental, and 
moral character of the youth and the man. The man needs 
a healthy body, a clear mind, and a right spirit. The prep-
-P-A-G-E-71
    KINDERGARTEN AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 47 
aration for these cannot be begun too early in the life of 
any individual. 
Hygiene.— The physical finding of self is as significant 
for the first stage of development as the moral and religious 
equipoise is for the highest stage—as much as possible the 
child’s strength must be drawn into play, so that his limbs 
may be trained into use, his strength exercised and increased 
—he should learn to use his bodily strength and the activity 
of his limbs for definite purposes” (Froebel). 
The hygiene of physical growth is a matter of the proper 
exercise of the limbs, lungs, senses, and digestion. It should 
be the kindergartner’s first concern to provide proper hy- 
gienic conditions, to establish adequate health and medical 
supervision, and then to insure that there is constant exer- 
cise of hygienic action. If she will lay in the kindergarten 
a foundation of ‘“‘hygiene consciousness” (ideals and apprecia- 
tions), “hygiene habit,” and knowledge of hygiene, she will 
lay the foundations of healthy manhood and womanhood. 
Habits.—The place of formal, drilled-in habit in the kin- 
dergarten is small in comparison with other activities, but the 
value of automatizing certain forms of reaction is of course 
apparent. Such are those routine acts of our lives which are 
to be uniform day by day, and in which individual reaction 
is not especially desirable. Personal habits of posture, of 
cleanliness, of correct speech, etc., “professional” habits 
which contribute to the daily economy of life in a big group 
(following the leader, keeping relative place constant, mechani- 
cal handling of materials, passing to and fro, etc.), these all 
help to lay a basis for future efficiency in school and probably 
in life. The habits formed in the kindergarten should be 
largely the beginnings of those to be continued in the best 
elementary schools. 
Learning to Think.—‘ Conscious inquiry is the key-note of 
reflective thought. To lead the thoughts of children growing 
up unconsciously and without reference to the attainment of 
correct belief into conscious inquiry into the nature, condi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  48 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tions, and bearings of the belief,”’! this is one of the devel- 
oping functions of the kindergarten. By his struggles with 
problems involved in the use of material, by the solution of 
the many little social problems, by the logical connection of 
imaginative stories leading to a climax, children gradually 
learn to suspend their impulsive immediate reaction to stimuli 
until a mental balance has been struck between two possi- 
bilities, and thought is begun. To give children definite 
problems to work out largely by themselves, testing their 
own tentative solutions, and coming to their own conclusions, 
is to promote the development of ability to think along many 
specific lines and, somewhat, in general. 
Right Emotional Attitude Toward Learning.—To open a 
child’s eyes to the attractiveness of “knowledge” is to bring 
into his life an everlasting joy. The sluggish acceptance of 
new facts is the greatest hindrance to their use in life, and 
sad is the day when “children creep unwillingly to school,” 
but “go storming owt to play.” Is learning a depressing 
thing in itself, or is the child a being constitutionally opposed 
to the reception of new ideas? The kindergartner says 
“neither!” and in the strength of that denial weaves around 
all learning processes an atmosphere of eagerness to receive, 
to understand, and to do. ‘This attitude of happy interest 
toward learning should deepen later into the absorption of 
the worker who is an artist in whatever he does because he 
loves his task. 
Kindergarten as a Preparation for School Life-—The 
kindergarten prepares, of course, most directly for the next 
step in the educational system—the primary grades of the 
elementary school. Its connection with the primary, as sug- 
gested, can only be vital when both kindergartner and grade 
teacher look at the education of a little child from the same 
point of view. The “new” kindergarten does not prepare 
a child for the “old” primary curriculum and the “old” 
kindergarten does not prepare for the “new” primary cur-

riculum. We must ask ourselves, then, when correlation be- 
tween the two seems a failure, ‘“‘Is the fault in the kindergarten 
of that particular school, or in the grades, or both?” Wher- 
ever a primary teacher has not heard the great child-study 
call the best kind of kindergarten preparation will not fit 
into her system of teaching. The great problem for both is 
to reach a place where they are not system-ridden. Both 
must regard education as a process of “‘ providing experiences 
which will render future action more socially efficient and fine.” 
All experiences and methods which do not contribute to this 
end must be dropped from school life. All experiences which 
do so function must be correlated both as to matter and 
method, so that there will be no waste of readjustment in 
passing from one grade to another. 
V. Tue SpEcIFIC PREPARATORY VALUE OF TYPICAL 
KINDERGARTEN ACTIVITIES 
In citing the specific preparatory function of kindergarten 
activities, one can here only briefly summarize their value as 
experiences, while emphasizing strongly that the most dis- 
tinct contribution which the kindergarten makes to educa- 
tion is in method, not in subject matter. 
Constructive Occupations.—The constructive occupations 
provide for socially directed growth in many ways. To the 
expressive, exuberant child bubbling over with spontaneous 
activity, they bring about a narrowing and steadying of his 
purposes in harmony with the limits of his material; in the 
inexpressive child they stimulate an impulse to produce new 
forms, to.create. They are valuable as a disciplinary agency, 
t.e., the child learns to adapt and regulate his own thinking 
to the limits of his material and problem; he learns to follow 
others’ plans, to take directions and suggestions both from his 
teacher and fellow pupils; he learns to persist in finishing a 
task, to hold the image of the completed project steadfast 
until it assumes the appropriate form. He gains ideals of 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
    5° TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
form, both specific and relative; he gains an elementary 
knowledge of such fundamental mathematical concepts as 
magnitude, proportion, number, etc. He gains, above all, an 
independence and originality in making his own plans and 
carrying them through. 
English.—The child comes to the kindergarten not as a 
“tabula rasa’? upon which the moving finger of the teacher 
can write what she will, but as a being who has already 
gained more kinds of experience fundamental to his future 
in a civilized society than he will ever again acquire in any 
other four to six year period in his whole development. He 
is full of the “beginnings of things.” One of these funda- 
mental beginnings is language. He already knows the force 
of language as a medium of communication with his world, 
and he also knows how wofully it sometimes fails him, when 
he most needs it as a clarifying medium. The conversation 
period of the kindergarten usually carries a child through 
three distinct stages of growth in language ability. First 
he learns to listen, then to respond, then to contribute. The 
whole process makes a co-operative cycle on which the en- 
tire problem of intercommunication rests. To follow another’s 
language expression intelligently, to respond in a way which 
will further the train of discussion, and finally to make one’s 
own language power a distinct contribution to the subject 
—this is the acme of linguistic ability. The kindergarten 
can do much toward furthering this line of growth. Where 
the language habits of the home are incorrect the problem 
is a double one. 
Receiving the thoughts of others through the printed page 
is almost as much of a problem as the first tottering efforts 
of.spoken language. New symbols of communication in new 
relations must be mastered. The kindergarten could do much 
more toward preparing for this than it at present attempts. 
The steps toward reading might tend something as follows: 
(x) A story told, dramatized, and “lived”; (2) the same story 
told in picture form, the recognition that a flat piece of paper
-P-A-G-E-77
  KINDERGARTEN AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 51 
can communicate experience; (3) the same story read aloud, 
the teacher casually pointing to prominent portions of the 
text and saying, for example, “this tells me just what Harry 
said,” or “this tells what Mary found in the forest”; (4) a 
new set of pictures which can best be interpreted by a printed 
sentence below each. 
We have gone far enough to show the progression from 
purely auditory language to the recognition of the possibilities 
of printed language. During the latter half of the kinder- 
garten year, the teacher should draw the children more and 
more to feel the importance and attraction of printed words, 
and thus make them fully alive to the function of reading 
before the formal steps of the first grade are taken. The 
formal teaching of reading in the kindergarten is probably 
not to be emphasized; but the placing of rhymes, short stories, 
etc., about the room, accompanied by pictures, will result in 
the children gaining a respectable reading vocabulary, as the 
incidental outcome of their story work. Simply as an out- 
come of the play and curiosity impulses, many children learn 
reading in good homes at kindergarten age. 
Games.—The function of the game in the kindergarten 
is identical with the purpose of all games, whether of the 
Greek, medieval, or modern period, namely, to provide for 
growth in bodily control, in mental self-control, and in the 
subordination of individual desires to group success. The 
organized game aims to carry the child from the period of 
impulsive physical expression in random, excess movements 
to the period when, so perfect is the co-ordination of mind and 
body, the boy or man can use his physical power unerringly 
in a given direction. The kindergarten game begins this or- 
ganization of impulses. In order to lay the proper founda- 
tion for this process of development it should have (and does 
have, theoretically at least, in one game or another) the fol- 
lowing characteristics: 
1. It should provide for rhythmic expression. The deep- 
seated pleasure in rhythm brings about the repetition neces-
-P-A-G-E-78
  52 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
sary for growth in power and provides one of the “ pleasure 
values” so stimulative and desirable for the growing child. 
2. It should provide for physical growth and control through 
graded exercises demanding increasing skill. An instance is 
in the ball plays of the kindergarten. A little five-year-old 
child often cannot catch a ball when thrown tohim. He learns 
through the happy game period to toss it himself and catch 
it, to throw it against the wall and catch it, to throw it at a 
mark, etc. The growth in skill should be a steady progres- 
sion in skill of arm, skill of hand, skill of limbs and body. A 
fault of the kindergarten games in the past has been, perhaps, 
too much complexity of ‘illustrative material, and not enough 
difficulty in the physical exercise accompanying them. 
3. It should provide means for spiritual self-expression. 
The little child is not a physical being only. A great part 
of his play is representative of his mental and emotional life. 
He delights in expressing in pantomime imaginary episodes, 
not for the.sake of the activity but for their representative 
value to him. This expression will later in his life take the 
form of a picture, a poem, or an oration. Now it is often a 
movement play, which communicates to others his inner life 
of thought and feeling. The game period of the kindergarten 
gives opportunity for the free ‘‘trying-out” of these expres- 
sions, under the stimulus of understanding, but critical, com- 
panions and thus helps to regulate and organize into a co- 
herent whole what often begins as an incoherent jumble of 
expression. 
4. It should provide opportunity for growth in the two great 
civilized virtues—social co-operation and social competition. 
The organized game in which individual power is matched 
against individual power promotes a healthful desire to im- 
prove one’s own ability, and the game in which one’s power 
is of use only in the interests of a whole group is one of the 
stepping-stones to social co-operation. 
It is obvious that what is here required of the kinder- 
garten game, is equally necessary in the games of later school
-P-A-G-E-79
  
KINDERGARTEN AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 53 
life. The activities of the kindergarten are merely the first 
steps in the process of school development. 
Art.—How insignificant seem the little child’s artistic 
powers, yet how big in promise; for he has in himself the 
groundwork of all true art, the desire to express his personal 
convictions in outward form. His failings are many—not 
only does he lack hand power, but he has not the artist’s eye, 
nor even the photographer’s. He chooses badly from an adult 
point of view. His medium and his thought bear no artistic 
relation; he selects parts of an experience which are least 
capable of artistic expression. And yet, in the midst of all his 
crudity he has the true spark of the creator, which we must 
do all in our power to preserve and develop. Not to make 
him think his worst effort expresses nothing to us, but to make 
him conscious of the fact when his best effort does really 
convey the thought or emotion he meant. He must learn 
that some kinds of experience are best expressed by color, 
some by formal line, some by dashing suggestions, some in 
paper, some in clay or sand. All of these types of artistic 
work he will bring spontaneously to the teacher. Her prob- 
lem is to see with his eyes before she tries to lead him from 
his chosen medium to one more in accord with the conven- 
tional canons of art. If the kindergarten teacher can make 
a child go a little beyond surface perceptions and can show 
him something of the relative possibilities of clay, water- 
color, crayon, paper, etc., as mediums of expression, she will 
lay a good foundation for the training in technic which later 
school life will give. The primary teacher must remem- 
ber, however, that the kindergartner has laid most emphasis 
on the expressional side of art, and the kindergarten child 
comes to the grades with a firm conviction that he can ex- 
press a meaning even with his crude handling of art materials. 
She must beware lest she take away that conviction. This 
gone, interest in technic wanes also; this preserved, she has 
on the side of art expression all the force which pleasurable 
interest and initiative can give.

Science.— 
“There was a child went forth every day; 
And the first object he looked upon, that object he became; 
And that object became part of him for the day—or for many years, 
or stretching cycles of years. 
The early lilacs became part of this child 
And grass, and white and red morning-glories, and white and red 
clover, and the song of the phcebe-bird. 
And the noisy brood of the barnyard, or by the mire of the pond-side, 
And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there—and the 
beautiful curious liquid, 
And the water-plants with the graceful heads—all became part of 
him. 
And the apple-trees covered with blossoms, and the fruit afterward, 
and wood berries, and the commonest weeds by the road: 
The hurrying, tumbling waves’ quick-broken crests slapping, 
The strata of colored clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint away soli- 
tary, by itself—the spread of purity it lies motionless in, 
The horizon’s edge, the flying sea crow, the fragrance of salt marsh. .. . 
These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who 
now goes, and will always go forth every day.” 
The school can have no higher function than to bring to 
a little child’s consciousness the wonder and beauty of all 
that goes on about him in the physical world, brought out so 
suggestively in the above lines from Whitman. 
VI. ConcLusIon 
Conclusion.—The following quotation expresses well, in 
conclusion, the function of education as a process of dealing 
with various levels in growth. 
At whatever level the pupil may arrive, everywhere he finds a 
world of things around him, which means nature to him; a world of 
men, which means society, and, third, he finds himself. Each of
-P-A-G-E-81
  KINDERGARTEN AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 55 
these three worlds of experience will become richer and richer.. The 
things with which the infant deals are near his hands, and they grow 
and grow until, in the experience of the adult, they have been enlarged 
into the world of the astronomical universe. The fellow-beings whom 
the child meets become embedded into a larger and larger society 
until, in the experience of the adult, they have grown into the whole 
of mankind. Finally, the experiences which refer to the self are, in 
the infant mind, vague sensations, and they develop until they repre- 
sent the whole richness of a moral personality.—(Clodd.) 
What we wish is a knowledge of the best means for pro- 
moting growth, whether that knowledge comes from Froebel, 
Montessori, McMurry, or Dewey. To adequately fulfil the 
conditions of progressive development, the kindergarten and 
primary department must be reorganized, not merely for the 
establishment of more cordial supplementary relations, but for 
forming a real unit of education upon the basis of the child’s 
nature at the stage of growth between five and eight years. 
The following statement of aim, taken from the catalogue 
of a kindergarten training-school, is significant of the general 
trend of feeling which it is hoped will culminate in more de- 
cisive action than has yet been taken. 
The kindergarten and primary school, springing from different 
roots, have long been separated in spirit and purpose. This fact is 
now widely recognized as a misfortune to the child, inasmuch as he 
undergoes no radical change at the age of six years corresponding to 
the pedagogical differentiation between kindergarten and primary 
school. Indeed the age of infancy, considered to be a unit for educa- 
tional purposes, embraces both the kindergarten and the primary 
grades. Hence the crying need for the re-establishment of both kin- 
dergarten and primary education upon the common basis of the child’s 
nature, not without reference to historical development, but untram- 
melled by tradition. 
The same five aims of education, and the same four or 
five types of mental changes which we can make in pupils, 
and the laws of producing these changes, stated in former 
chapters, must be followed in the good kindergarten as in 
all other phases of the educative process.

SUMMARY 
5. The original kindergarten and the spirit of Froebel were experi- 
mental, investigative, flexible, and dominated by the desire to 
direct the instinctive, ‘“‘natural” tendencies toward social aims. 
2. The kindergarten after Froebel’s death, however, degenerated into 
a very formal institution imitatively enacting something of the 
letter of Froebel’s method but not its spirit. 
3. The modern kindergarten would make the school a growing in- 
stitution, progressively adjusting itself to the nature of the chil- 
dren and the nature of society. 
4. The kindergartem is a process of guiding the natural child during 
certain years in‘the direction of the great social aims. 
5. It is trying to help make the life and growth of the child before, 
during, and after the kindergarten period a natural, effective, 
and unbroken unity. 
6. The kindergarten is to-prepare for social efficiency in the later 
schooling and the life without the school. 
7. This preparation can be made natural and effective through the 
right use of constructive occupations, English, games, art, science, 
attention to hygiene, and other activities. 
8, The kindergarten, the elementary school, and the home can pro- 
vide happy, growing, efficient lives for children when they be- 
come dominated by the same purposes and methods and vigor- 
ously try to co-ordinate their efforts. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
. Make a list of the native tendencies or instincts developing most 
rapidly at the kindergarten primary period. 
Select from this list the ones which seem to you to have the great- 
est educational value, as natural resources, and cross out those 
which should be starved or eliminated by substitution. 
. Make an attempt to use these best instincts for one day, and see 
how far your day goes more happily for both teachers and 
children. 
At the end of a day try to look back over your teaching to see 
how many times children were punished and corrected for giving 
expression to instinctive activities which the teacher did not 
know how to use or guide. 
Make a list of those decisions, those plans, and projects which the 
teacher made for the children, which a better teacher would 
have stimulated the children to make for themselves.

  CHAPTER III 
SPELLING— 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
1. How many words should elementary school children be taught to 
spell? : 
2. How should these words be graded? 
3. How many words should be taught in one lesson? 
4. What proportion of the time of each lesson period should be de- 
voted to review work? 
5. How frequently should the entire period be devoted to review 
work ? 
6. How far are we justified in teaching new words for the purpose 
of enriching the pupils’ vocabularies? 
7. What relation may exist between the number and length of the 
learning periods on the one hand, and the grade of the pupil 
on the other hand? 
8. What bearing upon the content of spelling have the reading, 
speaking, and writing vocabularies of pupils? 
9. What habits in relation to spelling is it desirable for pupils to 
develop? 
to. What is it to “know how to spell”? When does a pupil need to 
know how to spell? 
Two Lines of Development.—The pedagogy of spelling 
has taken, of recent years, two definite lines of development. 
The first concerns itself with the content or material taught; 
the second concerns itself with the learning process. In both 
instances, what writers have to say is being based on actual 
experimental investigation, rather than upon statements of 
opinion derived from philosophical postulates. 
I. Tse ConrenT oF SPELLING. SELECTION OF WorDS 
The content of spelling is the words to be studied. We 
are here concerned, primarily, with the selection of a fitting

material for teaching. We no longer hope, on the one hand, 
to teach children many thousands of words, including a great 
proportion of unusual ones, as has been in vogue where co- 
pious spelling-books have been in use, nor, on the other hand, 
are we any longer under the delusion that children’s vocab- 
ularies are exceedingly meagre. Such statements, for in- 
stance, as that five or six hundred words are all that are 
necessary for carrying on the ordinary communications of 
life are now known to be grossly in error. Several experi- 
ments have been carried out, tending to establish the number 
of words in the vocabulary of children as being much higher 
than had been supposed. 
Material of Spelling—Jones.—One of the earliest of these 
is by Doctor Jones, of the department of education, Uni- 
versity of South Dakota [7]. The problem was to determine 
“what words, grade for grade, do children use in their own, 
free, written speech, and what words, therefore, do they need 
to know how to spell?” In making up his lists of words, 
Doctor Jones assigned the words to the lowest grade in which 
three per cent or more of the pupils used them in spontane- 
ously written work. He gives his lists for each grade, find- 
ing the following as a summary of the number of words 
used:

Doctor Jones also finds that the number of words, per 
pupil, is, on the average, unusually high. He gives the fol- 
fowing table:

  These figures represent words used by children “in their own 
free, written speech.” They are, “therefore,” the words 
that they “need to know how to spell.’”” Undoubtedly this 
is true. There is danger, however, that in emphasizing the 
writing vocabularies of children as indicating what words 
they need to know how to spell, we lose sight of the fact that 
we should strive, also, to enrich their vocabularies—writing, 
speaking, and reading. The spelling lesson is certainly one 
of the agencies whereby useful words not yet known may be 
taught. Words not yet in the writing vocabulary, but in the 
larger speaking vocabulary or the still larger reading vocab- 
ulary, may be worked over into the writing vocabulary; and 
in this work the spelling lesson should play a part. If, there- 
fore, the effect of the recent vocabulary studies is to limit 
teaching merely to those words which children already know 
well enough to use them in written discourse, the studies will 
have overshot their mark. Their legitimate effect should 
be to point out first essentials, but not to-limit spelling mate- 
rial to them. 
Vocabularies of Letters—Ayres.—The study of Doctor 
Ayres on the vocabularies of personal and business letters [1] 
throws further light on the proper materials for spelling. 
This vocabulary is made from letters written by adults. A 
comparison of it with a few pages from the ordinary spelling- 
book suggests a part of the reason why instruction in spelling 
is not more effective. Doctor Ayres found, for instance, that 
of the 414 words in the National Education Association 
lists, only 125 were found in the two thousand letters which 
he analyzed, no one of the remaining 289 appearing even once.
-P-A-G-E-87
  SPELLING 61 
“This seems,”’ he says, ‘‘to be good evidence that useful spell- 
ing lists cannot be compiled by sitting at the desk and decid- 
ing which words people ought to know how to spell. What 
we must know is, rather, which are the words that ordinary 
people need to know how to spell.” ‘Doctor Ayres publishes 
a list of 542 words which, with their repetitions, constitute 
seven-eighths of the 23,629 words tabulated. He gives the 
number of times each word appeared in the personal and 
business letters. He gives no words which occurred fewer 
than six times. I cannot help thinking that he would have 
added a very useful list of words if he had given us those that 
were used, say, from two to five times. Of course, some of 
these last would have been of relatively little use, but the 
greater part of them, if we may judge from the character of 
those that were used six times, would have been a valuable 
addition to his list. Doctor Ayres has also published a thou- 
sand-word list which we give on another page. 
Other Vocabulary Studies.—Another vocabulary study 
was made by R. C. Eldridge, who examined two pages each 
of four different newspapers [6]. From this examination he 
found that 6,002 different words were used in an aggregate 
of 43,989 words. He publishes this list of different words, 
arranging them in the order of their frequency of occurrence. 
The method is similar to that of Doctor Ayres. It is, how- 
ever, carried out upon different material, and affords a more 
extensive list, largely because every word is included, no 
matter how many times it occurred. Eldridge also gives a list 
of words compiled in 1904 by the Reverend J. Knowles of 
London [8]. This list appeared in a pamphlet entitled ‘The 
London Point System of Reading for the Blind.” It con- 
sisted of 353 words, with the number of times each word oc- 
curred in ‘‘passages from the English Bible and from various 
authors containing 100,000 words.” 
Probably the most interesting study of the subject of 
spelling, both from the point of view of the lists of words 
proposed, and also from the point of view of the many ques-
-P-A-G-E-88
  62 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tions upon which it throws light, is Cook & O’Shea’s “The 
Child and His Spelling”’ [5]. The word lists are derived from 
the social and family correspondence of thirteen persons, dif- 
fering in sex, age, education, and experience. There are four 
lists, the first consisting of 186 words, used by all the corre- 
spondents; the second consisting of 577 words, used by a 
majority of the correspondents; the third consisting of 2,207 
words, used by more than one but less than a majority of 
the correspondents, and the fourth consisting of 2,230 words, 
used by but one of the correspondents. The first three of 
these lists are published. Data are given in connection with 
all these words, tending to show to what extent they are used 
in modern spelling-books, to what extent the words are peculiar 
to the vocabulary of men or of women, and whether they 
appeared in the lists of Ayres or of Chancellor [4]. 
In the three published lists of Cook & O’Shea there are 
2,970 different words—a number which would be consider- 
ably increased if, as in the case of Eldridge’s list, all inflec- 
tions of forms were counted as separate words. Including 
the words used by but one of the correspondents, there were 
5,200 different words that appeared at least once. This is 
exclusive of all proper names, foreign phrases, and inflected 
forms. 
A number of other studies which have appeared upon the 
content of spelling might be mentioned. A pamphlet pre- 
pared by E. E: Lewis [9], for use in high schools, contains 
material derived from the lists of Jones, Eldridge, Ayres, and 
Cook & O’Shea, together with a selection from words com- 
monly misspelled by high-school students. Another pam- 
phlet, published as Bulletin No. 1 of the Boston Department 
of Educational Investigation and Measurement (Doctor 
Frank W. Ballou, director) contains “Provisional Minimum 
and Supplementary Lists of Spelling Words for Pupils in 
Grades I to VIIL”’ [2]. A report by Nicholas Bauer, entitled 
“The Writing Vocabulary of Pupils of the New Orleans 
Public Schools” [3], is a compilation in graded lists of the

words found to have been used in the themes of approxi- 
mately 18,000 children in the third to the eighth grades in- 
clusive. Attempts to bring the modern idea as to the con- 
tent of spelling into the covers of text-books have likewise 
been made by Studley & Ware, who have prepared a graded 
word list and teachers’ manual for elementary schools, the 
list of words being selected from nine thousand compositions 
written by elementary school pupils [13]; and by Miss Anne 
Nicholson in ‘‘A Speller for the Use of the Teachers of Cali- 
fornia” [ro]. Pryor’s list is also very suggestive [x1]. 
The Number of Words We Use.—These vocabulary 
studies show that wé use a very few words a great many 
times. The word the is by far the most frequently used word 
in the language. On the ayerage it occurs once in every six- 
teen words of written discourse. And, of, and to each occur 
about once in every thirty words, and I about once in every 
forty. These five words taken together constitute, on the 
average, from one-sixth to one-fifth of the number of running 
words in written discourse. Adding to them the next four 
words in the order of frequency, namely a, in, that, and you, 
we have g words which, with their repetitions, constitute 
one-quarter of all the words we write. The 50 commonest 
words constitute one-half, and the 278 commonest three- 
quarters of our written words. 
It will be seen that the number of words included increases 
very rapidly for equal added proportions of total words 
written. The accompanying figure’ will make this still more 
evident. The data for this figure are taken from Ayres’s 
“Measurement of Ability in Spelling” [14 : 12-20]. It was 
compiled from the original material of Knowles [8], Eldridge 
[6], Ayres [1], and Cook & O’Shea [5]. The horizontal scale 
is for numbers of words in the order of their frequency. The 
vertical scale is for the percentage of running words in written 
material represented by the number of words shown on the 
horizontal scale. From this figure it is seen that the 100 most 
frequently used words comprise 60 per cent of the words used

in writing; that the 200 commonest words comprise 70 per 
cent; the 400, 80 per cent; the 850, 90 per cent; while the 
1,000 commonest words comprise 92 per cent of written dis- 
course. 
We thus have in Doctor Ayres’s compilation an important 
contribution to the content of our teaching of spelling. It is, 
as he calls it, “‘a foundation vocabulary,” and no list of words 
for the use of elementary schools should fail to include it. 
This does not mean, however, that there are not a great 
many frequently used words other than those in Doctor 
Ayres’s list. The least common words in his list are, never- 
theless, so necessary in the expression of our ideas that they 
suggest the existence of numerous other words only a little 
less useful than themselves, and quite indispensable in the 
written vocabulary of the majority of people. Instances of 
words not found in the list are: ankle, apple, ate, banana, 
base, basket, bath, battle, beans, beautiful, because, bird, bite, 
bottle, bread, breath, breathe, bright, broad, brown, bundle. 
These words are taken from a list prepared for elementary 
school use, and from which words presenting no important 
spelling difficulty had been excluded. Only words beginning 
with a or b were consulted. These words, any one will agree, 
stand for ideas which are common to every age and to every 
walk in life. I cite them, not as a criticism of Doctor Ayres’s 
list, but as a caution against supposing that because his words 
constitute more than go per cent of the written words exam- 
ined in a rather large amount of material, they are anything 
more than they pretend to be, namely “a foundation vocab- 
ulary.” 
Nor does this vocabulary mean that all the words .in it 
should be presented as spelling material. There are many 
which offer no spelling difficulty. The few mistakes that 
children make in writing them are due to motor inco-ordina- 
tions, to “slips of the pen.” The eradication of such errors 
is not specifically a spelling problem. The habit of looking 
at a word after it has been written is worth inculcating, al-  
-P-A-G-E-94
  66 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
though it is possible that such a habit may interfere at times 
with free and vigorous composition. Doubtless it is true in 
spelling, as in every human endeavor, that a certain amount 
of imperfection must be expected. It is certain that to labor 
for higher results on words which children already habitually 
spell, say 97 to 100 per cent correct, is a waste of time and 
energy. 
Il. Tue Content or SPELLING. THE DIFFICULTY 
or Worps 
The Analysis of Spelling Material—Another way of ap- 
proaching the matter of the content of spelling is to analyze 
the spelling papers which children write. It is probably true 
that not only in spelling, but also in all subjects of the ele- 
mentary school curriculum, the constant pressure for higher 
efficiency and greater economy of time will make it necessary 
to analyze, critically, the material which we teach. I have 
attempted to do something in this way in a former study of 
spelling [15]. I have shown that the words of a given list 
tend to maintain the same order of difficulty in each grade, 
and that this tendency is also strongly in evidence as between 
schools in different localities. Consequently, it may be main- 
_ tained that the difficulties which words have are more or less 
to be found in all grades and localities. I have shown, also, 
how words may be combined into groups of equal difficulty, 
and into groups differing in point of difficulty, by equal 
amounts. Not the least significant portion of this study is 
that in which the arrangement of fifty words, according to 
teachers’ judgments of their spelling difficulty, is compared 
with the arrangement of the same words on the basis of 
actual testing. If it is found that the trustworthiness of 
the judgment of a single teacher is of almost no value at all; 
if it is found, for instance, that the one word which was in- 
contestably the hardest of the list was, by more than one- 
fourth of the teachers, judged to be actually the easiest’ or 
next to the easiest; if the relation of individual judgments,
-P-A-G-E-95
  SPELLING 67 
to the result of testing, show practically a zero correlation, 
then an important commentary is made upon why children 
spell so poorly. It may, for instance, be suggested that 
children do not spell certain words because their teachers do 
not know that they are hard to spell. It may be inferred 
that a more accurate knowledge of the difficulty of words 
and of the usefulness of words would enable the emphasis to 
be put in the right place. The studies which have to do with 
the difficulty and the usefulness of words are only a begin- 
ning and a prophecy of what may and should be done to make 
the content of spelling conform to the requirements of written 
discourse and to the economy of classroom instruction. 
Even now there is no good reason why a teacher should not 
be acquainted with the difficulty of a large number of words. 
In addition to the study which I made in 1913, a somewhat 
similar study was made by Doctor Ayres of the difficulty of 
each of the words comprising his “foundation vocabulary,” 
to which I referred above. No adequate description or 
criticism of this admirable piece of work can be attempted 
within the limits of this chapter. The book and the spelling 
scale which accompanies it should be in the hands of every 
teacher of spelling. The list is presented herewith. The 
scale shows the marks by grades which children made who 
never had drilled on this particular list. 
Need of a Uniform Material for Test Purposes.—The 
bearing which a study of the difficulty of words has upon the 
experimental investigation of problems in spelling ought to 
be indicated. The field of inquiry in this subject, as well as 
in other school subjects, has been restricted by the fact that 
we possess no material of equal difficulty by which the ability 
resultant from given methods or processes may be deter- 
mined. Attempts have been made to decide between a drill 
method and an incidental method of teaching spelling. The 
results are conflicting and are likely to remain so as long as 
the material which forms the basis of testing the results of 
the rival methods continues to be of varying difficulty. It is
-P-A-G-E-96
  68 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
true that investigators have chosen groups of words which 
they judged to be of equal difficulty, but we have already 
seen how astonishingly unreliable their judgments are likely 
tobe. Doctor Judd’s survey of spelling in Cleveland schools 
has left the problem open. 
Conflicting Evidence in Experimental Inquiry.—Experi- 
mental inquiry in regard to spelling is in somewhat the same 
condition that it was in regard to memory before Ebbinghaus 
invented his system of nonsense syllables and thereby gave 
the science of experimental psychology a material of sub- 
stantially uniform difficulty. We may speculate as to a 
“best” method of teaching spelling, as to the proper length 
and number of periods of work, or as to the effect of training 
with specific lists on the general power to spell. We may 
even seek to decide these questions experimentally; and it is 
quite conceivable that by these processes of speculation and 
experimentation some knowledge will be gained. But a great 
deal of conflicting evidence will be obtained; and it is to be 
feared that, as in the past, our knowledge will be too often 
indefinite and inconclusive, unless we have at hand a suffi- 
cient body of material of known difficulty. The construc- 
tion of such a body of material is at present the most im- 
portant experimental work to be done in the field of spelling, 
as perhaps it is in other fields. Doubtless it is more attrac- 
‘ tive to attack problems of method, or of fatigue, or of the 
influence of ideational types; but the humbler task is the one 
that is immediately necessary. 
III. Tse Mertuop or TEACHING SPELLING. PRESENTATION 
Method and the Learning Process.—Meanwhile, however, 
we may properly turn our attention to what has been done 
toward establishing a method of teaching spelling. As stated 
at the beginning of this chapter, the tendency at present is 
to develop our methods of presentation with reference to the 
learning process itself. Our inquiry now is centering in the 
learner rather than in the teacher. In conformity with this
-P-A-G-E-97
SPELLING 69 
tendency we are seeking, in the first place, to know how a 
given material may best be observed, imprinted, and re- 
tained; and in the second place, what the réle of the teacher 
should be with reference to these processes. 
I do not propose to enter at any length into the details of 
teaching devices. Many of these have often been formulated. 
Sometimes they appeal to our judgment as worth while, and 
sometimes they do not. For most of them there has been 
no evidence presented which commands our respect. 
Pronunciation, Meaning, and Spelling.—Obviously, how- 
ever, the factors of pronunciation and of meaning are insepara- 
bly bound with the factor of spelling, and no correct method 
will neglect any one of the three.[25 : 29 f.|.1_ Methods will 
differ, and doubtless should differ, in the way these factors are 
presented and the emphasis that is placed on each, according 
to the nature of the words to be taught, the character of the 
class, the time at the teacher’s disposal, etc. Among good 
teachers, probably the most usual niethod of teaching meaning 
is by discussion and use of the word in natural contexts before 
the spelling is taught, supplemented later by a frequent use of 
the word and an encouragement of pupils to do the same. 
Measures of Prevention.—The conscious attempt to pre- 
vent the first appearance of any misspellings is worth men- 
tioning as a principle which is in full accordance with the 
psychology of habit [38:13]. It is hard to form correct re- 
actions after wrong ones have been set up. 
Initial Focalization.—Another principle which is derived 
from the law of habit formation is that the words should be 
strongly focalized when first presented. As to the manner 
of this focalization, the most frequent method is an appeal 
to as many senses as possible. ‘Combine the sight of the 
new word with the analytical copying of it, plus at least a 
whispered pronunciation of its constituent elements.”— 
(Meumann.) The literature on this subject is rather co- 
pious, and especially so if we include certain memory studies 
1 Reference 25, page 29, at end of chapter.
-P-A-G-E-98
  
7o TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
which have been drawn upon to help decide the question. 
The entire subject is complicated by the learner’s imagery 
type. If he is dominantly visual-minded, a visual presenta- 
tion will facilitate the use of his preferred mode of learning. 
If his imagery is preferably of the auditory type, an oral pres- 
entation may prove to be the most effective single method. 
It is probably true, however, that, as Lay pointed out, vocali- 
zation and hand-motor processes are important aids for all 
types in learning the spelling of words [22 : 84]. For further 
evidence on this matter, the reader is referred to the sum- 
mary and references given by Miss Abbott in her admirable 
study [16 : 128-134]. It is apparent that no one method of 
presentation is always best. The age of the pupil and the 
character of the words have much to do with this. For 
irregular and difficult words visual presentation is better 
than auditory presentation, irrespective of age. For familiar 
words, auditory presentation is the better for young children, 
while visual presentation is superior in the case of older chil- 
dren and adults. Accordingly, since the determination of 
types of imagery is difficult and impracticable in schools, a 
combination method, such as Meumann’s, quoted above, is 
more reliable; although the emphasis upon one or the other 
elements may be shifted according to the age of the pupils 
and the difficulty of the words. 
Importance of the Process of Recall.—There is an element 
in the learning process which it will be worth while con- 
sciously to develop. We have all noticed how general is the 
tendency in learning stanzas of poetry, to look away from the 
material, after a few readings, and to attempt to recall the 
material, referring to the printed words to correct errors or 
verify a tentative reproduction. This tendency of the 
learner is so strong that it must be an important part of the 
process. Witasek, experimenting with adults, found that 
six readings, combined with five attempted recitations, were 
more economical for learning than as many as twenty-one 
readings without any recitations; and his conclusions were
-P-A-G-E-99
SPELLING 71 
verified by Katzaroff. Miss Abbott, in her experiments on 
methods of presentation in spelling, reached similar conclu- 
sions. She presented one series by exposing each word for 
three seconds, allowing five seconds for recall before the next 
word was shown; in another series each word was shown for 
five seconds with three seconds for recall; and in a third series, 
seven seconds were allowed for exposure, and one second for 
recall. It was found that the method which allowed five 
seconds of the entire eight seconds for recall was the superior 
method, both as regarded immediate spelling and spelling 
after an interval of four days. ‘‘We may conclude,” she says, 
“that it is of especial value to convert the perceptive process 
into terms of imagery, . . . of more value than if the time 
had been spent on repeating the perceptive process” [16 : 153]. 
Time Allowance for Perception and Recall.—In practice 
it will be found that the time to be devoted to perception will 
vary with the difficulty of the word, being longer for the more 
difficult words. A uniform time is ‘not desirable. It is best 
that the perception of a word and: its recall should each be 
just long enough for the learner to complete the required 
process. A longer time in either case results in a decrease in 
attention and a deterioration in the result. In this connec- 
tion, the use of perception cards, each containing a single word, 
will be found more effective than the writing of the words on 
the blackboard. The cards may be inserted in a frame after 
the first presentation of the word [20]. 
1See also a study by the same author, “On the Analysis of the Factor of 
Recall in the Learning Process,” Psych. Rev. Mon. No. 44, pp. 159-177. In 
this study the conclusion is reached that, supposing the time devoted to learn- 
ing a given material to be constant, the recall process is always an aid, that 
if it comes after the Einprdgung (perceptive process) its value decreases as 
delay increases, and that it is of most value when interspersed with the Ein- 
prégung. It would seem, therefore, that the best method in spelling would 
not only include a presentation, calculated to induce a strong perception, but 
also one or more provisions for recall followed by a direct reference to the words 
for correction, verification, and strengthening of the impression.

IV. Tue Metnop or TEACHING SPELLING. MANAGEMENT 
More important than the presentation is the management 
of the spelling material. By management I mean (a) the 
regulating of the periods of work, according to the time as- 
signed to the subject, and (6) the arrangement for relearning 
or reviewing the material. 
The Superiority of Short and Frequent Periods.—What 
evidence we possess tends strongly to show the superiority of 
short and frequent periods in the learning process. This is 
so generally true that it may be accepted as a rule for our 
guidance, although it is clear that the shortening of the period 
may be carried to the point of diminishing returns. A cer- 
tain adjustment to the task in hand is necessary, both physi- 
cally and mentally. Some time is lost in getting ready. 
Accordingly, if periods are made too short, a large percentage 
of. time is lost. But, having decided how much time per 
week may be used for spelling work, it is well to make the 
learning periods short enough so that the attention of the 
pupils may be concentrated throughout. In ten of the lead- 
ing American cities an average of 7.22 per cent of the time is 
spent on spelling as a subject [38]. If the week has 5 school 
days of 5 hours each, this would give 108 minutes a week. 
Probably six or seven 15-minute periods (that is, two periods 
on 1 or 2 days of the week) will prove more effective than 
the more conventional arrangement of 20 minutes daily. 
Drill periods may well be shorter than teaching (presentation) 
periods. A daily 5-minute period for rapid drill, in addition 
to a 15-minute period for general instruction, has been found 
to work well. Ten-minute recitation periods have also proved 
successful. It is a matter to be decided by the capacity of 
the pupils for sustained and intensive effort. With young 
children two 10-minute periods, or one 10-minute period and 
two 5-minute periods will give good results. Indeed, both with 
young and older children it is highly advantageous to take 
two or three minutes several times a day for rapid oral drill.

Setting a Time Limit.—It is frequently good practice to 
set a time limit within which the pupils are to see how much 
they can accomplish. For any kind of school work it makes a 
great deal of difference in securing the maximum of atten- 
tion whether a teacher says “work on this for the rest of the 
period,” or “see how much you can get done in five minutes.” 
The Need and the Effect of Relearning—Jost’s Law.— 
The second factor in what I have called management con- 
cerns itself with the relearning or review of the words already 
learned. When material has once been learned only up to 
the point of a first errorless reproduction, there is no guar- 
antee that permanent retention has been secured. In fact, 
in all but the most meaningful material, where the associative 
connections are very strong, it is generally true that the 
learner is quite unable to reproduce after an interval of a 
few days or weeks what he was easily able to reproduce im- 
mediately after presentation., But the first learning has left 
its trace. The material may be relearned in much less time 
and with more permanent effect than was true in the first 
instance. The law formulated by Jost! is operative in this 
connection, namely, that (1) “If two associations are of the 
same strength but of different age, a new repetition will have 
the greater value for the older one,” and that (2) ‘If two 
associations are of equal strength but of different age, the 
older one will decrease the less with time.’ Translated into 
a concrete situation, this means that if the learner, or a class 
of learners, is equally capable of! spelling two words, one of 
which was learned yesterday and the other to-day, equal 
effort spent in relearning each will tend more to the permanent 
acquisition of yesterday’s word than to that of to-day’s word. 
The correct procedure, therefore, seems to be to make the 
initial presentation of the new words of a lesson strong and to 
secure focal attention upon them up to the point of errorless 
spelling; but to go no further at that time. The additional 
minutes thus spent will not be so well employed as they

  74 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
would be, let us say, an hour later. This has bearing, from 
another point of view, upon what I have said about the value 
of short and frequent periods. 
Systematic Reviews. The Cleveland Plan.—In a more 
formal way than by these brief ‘‘relearning” periods, pro- 
vision should be made for systematic reviews. This is the 
chief reason for the success of the plan which has been car- 
ried out at Cleveland. The words taught yesterday are re- 
viewed with those taught to-day. Those taken up as new 
words last week are reviewed in connection with those taken 
up this week. After eighty new words have been taught, 
they are reviewed a third time for a test to which added in- 
terest is given by the fact that all classes of the same grade 
are simultaneously tested throughout the school system on 
the same words and the results published. At the end of the 
year and prior to a final examination, the words, then amount- 
ing to 320, are for a fourth time reviewed; and they are used 
a fifth time the following year, being taken up as subsidiary 
words in connection with a new list. I have myself used this 
plan for four years, with such modifications as the New York 
City course of study makes necessary (it required 600 words a 
year above the third grade), and I can vouch for its efficacy. 
Spelling in Context.—But all these reviews, while effec- 
tive for the limited series in question, will be essentially arti- 
ficial and unconnected with the real purpose of spelling in- 
struction unless they are supplemented and supported by a 
material and a method of a more vital character. We may 
drill children in oral spelling; and we certainly deny our- 
selves a very valuable instrument if we do not. But in life 
outside of the schoolroom, our pupils will never have occa- 
sion, except as a our de force, to spell orally. We may require 
our pupils to write words in columns; and we may sometimes 
be justified in doing so in order to save time. But again they 
will not use their spelling ability in such a fashion. We may, 
ourselves, select the words which our pupils are to learn, and 
our greater experience ought to enable us to do so with good
-P-A-G-E-103
SPELLING 15 
effect. But in the situations in which they will have to spell, 
it is the pupils themselves who will choose the words. No 
proper method, therefore, will neglect the spelling of words 
in context; and no test of our pupils’ ability will fail to mea- 
sure it in situations which approximate those of normal use. 
Moreover, we should get an important supplement to our 
standard list from the errors in spelling which they make in 
their own written work. 
Individual Spelling Lists.—In doing this, I have found it 
to be an invaluable aid in the teaching of spelling to have 
each pupil keep an individual spelling-book. He may be 
given a small blank book, and be required to alphabetize it 
and to enter in its proper alphabetical place any words which 
he finds he has used but has not spelled correctly. The alpha- 
betical arrangement facilitates reference and checks repeti- 
tion. The individual spelling-books will need to be super- 
vised carefully, and the pupil occasionally called upon to 
tell how many words he has gathered and to spell at least a 
random selection of them. By this means provision is made 
for his initiative; and, at least for these words, a real motive 
is supplied for learning to spell. There is an evident adjust- 
ment to individual needs—an adjustment more exact than 
is possible with any fixed list, however excellent.! 
V. Tue Doctrine oF PuRPOSE 
The significance of the learner’s purpose or intention in 
the learning process has lately received attention from many 
quarters. For a long timé we have been familiar with the 
doctrine of purpose. We have read many discussions re- 
garding the aim of education; and it is conventional in books 
on special method to have much to say in the beginning about 
the purpose of the subject in question. It is expected also 
that each lesson plan prepared by teachers shall have its 
statement of aim. These formulations, when they are well 
1The editor also tried this “little-dictionary” plan and found it good 
while a principal in Minneapolis. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  76 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
made, have no small value; and it is by no means my inten- 
tion to deprecate them. But they are too often centered in 
the teacher, and too seldom concern the pupil. The real value 
of a purpose is first evident when it becomes the purpose of the 
child himself. It is not necessary, and it would not often be 
wise, to try to induce him to realize a philosophical conception 
of the aim of education, but it is quite possible and highly de- 
sirable that in all the learning he does he should be actuated 
by purposes that are true and valid for the work in hand. 
Evidence of the Effect of Purpose.—It has been conclu- 
sively shown by actual experiment that when the learner has 
a definite purpose in mind, the result is materially affected 
in the direction of the purpose. Meumann observes in this 
connection: ‘One of the most important results of our re- 
cent investigation of the process of learning is the discovery 
of the extraordinary influence which the different intentions 
or attitudes of the learner exert upon his whole memorial 
process and upon his memorial results” [28 : 303, English 
edition]. It is found that when the purpose of the learner is 
to secure a permanent retention of the material which he is 
learning, he adopts an attitude different from that which he 
assumes when his purpose is merely to acquire the material 
temporarily. There is a different distribution of the activities 
of imprinting and recall, and a different adjustment of at- 
tention. In consequence of this, his permanent retention, 
as tested after a long interval, is markedly better than is 
that of a person who merely learns the same material for 
immediate reproduction or for temporary retention. 
What the Purpose Should Be in Learning to Spell.— 
There are many occasions when an immediate recall or a 
temporary retention is all that is desirable. But such is not 
the case in learning to spell. In this part of his school work, 
therefore, the first and most general condition is that the 
pupil shall have a definite purpose to learn the material 
permanently. In that event, the resulting influence of will 
and of attitude will, to a large degree, determine the nature
-P-A-G-E-105
SPELLING aaa 
of the memory effect. Quite apart, therefore, from a tech- 
nic of method ‘or of drill, a great deal may be gained by 
setting up in the mind of 'the pupil the purpose and the will 
to retain permanently. It is proper to observe also that such 
retention is not conclusively shown by ability to spell a given 
series of words in a formal test, at however remote a period 
such a test may be given... The real test, and the one which 
the pupil will himself realize to be true and worthy, is the 
ability to spell the words in spontaneously written discourse. 
The Importance of the Learner’s Consciousness of His 
Own Improvement.—A part of the purpose in learning must 
concern itself not only with the end of the process, but also 
with its progress. The intention to improve and the will to 
do so condition the success of the learner. It has been found 
in the numerous attempts which have been made, under ex- 
perimental conditions, to educate individuals in various acts 
of learning, that the greatest improvement resulted not from 
general guidance nor from admonition, nor from mere repeti- 
tion, but from an attempt to influence the will. An appeal 
to the feelings, the arousal of a desire to improve, and the 
heightening of the feeling of responsibility were found to be 
productive of the greatest practice effect. This truth has 
been emphasized by Meumann, who particularly notes the 
-investigations of Borst [28 : 128, English edition]. Improve- 
ment in skill (e. g., in typewriting) has been shown to depend 
mainly upon the energy and intensity with which the idea of 
improvement is fixated, and with which practice is repeated 
under its influence.! The most important factor in develop- 
ing this attitude has been found to be the learner’s conscious- 
ness of his own improvement. On the other hand, practice with- 
out knowledge of results has been shown to be of no effect? 
The controlling influence si a consciousness of improvement 
was lacking.

  78 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
VI. Tse NEED FoR STANDARDS 
The will to improve, however, cannot be a mere empty 
volition. It must be gauged by fixed standards—standards 
which have a definite objective meaning, and by reference 
to which the learner may note his own progress and compare 
his achievement with the achievement of others. _ Herein lies 
the chief value in the keeping and publishing of records. In 
spelling, the knowledge of what other children have done, 
i.e., the standards that they have reached, will have the 
same effect that such knowledge has had in athletics. Not 
long ago the world’s record in the too-yard dash was ten and 
one-fifth seconds. Only a few men could equal this time, 
and none could surpass it. Now there are hundreds of men 
who do so. The effect of the setting up of such standards is 
to furnish a continuous and strong incentive to greater ex- 
pertness; and such incentives, as have been pointed out, 
determine improvement. 
The Application of Standards in Spelling.—It is, therefore, 
greatly to be desired that standards in spelling may be set 
up; and it may not be too much to hope that by means of 
them a general improvement in spelling ability may be 
brought about. We should know, and our pupils should 
know, how hard words and groups of words are in terms of 
the percentage of children who spell them correctly. We 
should know by how much, with any given material, one grade 
surpasses another lower grade. We should have an abun- 
dance of words of known difficulty, by means of which we 
may register progress in ability, so that any one may know 
what we mean. It is much more satisfactory to be able to 
say to a child or to a class: ‘‘You spelled as well as most boys 
in the sixth grade,” or, “You did better than eight out of ten 
children of the fifth grade can do,” or, “You spelled ten per 
cent better than you did three months ago,” than it is to say 
“You did very well,” or “‘pretty well,” or “‘a little better than 
last month.”
-P-A-G-E-107
  SPELLING 79 
We have all observed how decisively superior is the work 
of an excellent teacher with a poor method“to that of a poor 
teacher with a good method. Indeed, it is often quite dis- 
concerting to find how unprofitable a much-lauded method 
may be in the hands of certain teachers. They may carry 
out to the minutest detail all the steps of the approved plan; 
and yet they may make dismal failures. It is probable, how- 
ever, that a truer insight wotild in any given instance reveal 
the fact that the method called “poor” was, after all, the 
better one, because it satisfied the fundamentally necessary 
condition of supplying the learner with standards, purposes, 
and ideals that find bearing through the will to improve. 
But only a few of our teachers are gifted,enough to supply 
these conditions from their own resources. For the rank 
and file of teachers we shall have to provide not only a tech- 
nic for presentation and for drill, but also standards by 
which they and their pupils may gauge their work. A pur- 
pose to learn, and a consciousness of progress may ensue for 
both teacher and pupil; and since it is precisely in these re- 
spects that the gifted teacher most conspicuously takes rank 
above the mediocre teacher, it is possible that the provision 
of definite, objective standards of work may do more than 
any other one thing to raise the general level of teaching 
ability. 
While, therefore, it seems to be true, as stated in the be- 
ginning, that the development of a method of procedure in 
spelling has lately gathered about two principal ideas (the 
content of the material to be learned, and the learning process 
itself), it is also true that neither idea can have its full effect 
except as it is supported by the other. The process of learn- 
ing is of no avail unless carried out upon a material that is 
rationally selected on the basis of its usefulness and its diffi- 
culty; while the best material and the most expert knowl- 
edge of its difficulty will have little effect except as these be- 
come the possession of the pupil and give propulsive force 
to his purpose and his will to learn.

12. TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
SUMMARY 
A few words, making up a very large part of written and printed 
material, constitute a fundamental vocabulary. 
In such a vocabulary, however, many of the words present no 
spelling difficulty, while many words not included in it are, 
nevertheless, so useful that they constitute a necessary part of 
the verbal equipment of most literate people. 
. One of the first requisites in teaching spelling is to know~ the 
difficulty of the words to be taught; and for this the judgment 
of individual teachers is exceedingly unreliable, unless it is based 
upon the success of children in their attempts to spell. 
. In the measurement of spelling ability an evaluated test material 
in the form of words of known difficulty is required. Such ma- 
terial is gradually appearing. 
. In the method of teaching spelling, both presentation and ‘man- 
agement” should rest upon the activities of the learner rather 
than upon those of the teacher. 
. Initial focalization should be sharp and should involve a multiple 
sense appeal, with a shift of emphasis to the visual for older 
pupils and for especially difficult words, and to the auditory for 
young children; while both visual and auditory presentation 
should be reinforced by motor processes. 
. The process of recall, as distinct from that of perception, should 
be consciously provided for in the presentation, and the aim 
should be to devote to each process just sufficient time for its 
completion. , 
. In the matter of “‘management,” experimental evidence supperts 
the superiority of short and frequent periods, especially for 
young children. 
. Pupils should be encouraged to keep individual spelling lists and 
they should be tested upon these lists at frequent intervals. 
Since the learning process is affected by the purpose of the learner 
teachers should avoid allowing pupils to entertain the mere in- 
tention to retain temporarily. Not only permanent retention 
but ability to reproduce in spontaneously written discourse 
should be the purpose of the learner. 
It is demonstrated that knowledge of progress is a strong incen- 
tive, and this fact should be utilized by the keeping of system- 
atic records. 
For this purpose and for evaluating the work of grades and schools 
the need of definite objective standards of work is evident.

PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
. From ten pages of the speller you are using select (a) the words 
which, in your judgment, all the children will use; (b) those which 
none of them will use unless they become highly educated. 
. When children are writing should they be permitted to use the dic’ 
tionary? Should they be required to do so? 
. Group a term’s assignment of words according to similarities in 
spelling. Teach the words by groups and compare the results 
with results by your usual method. There is evidence (unpub- 
lished) in favor of grouping the words. See also Pryor [11 : 86]. 
. Select from the 1,000 words of the Ayres [14] list those which, in 
your judgment, do not need to be taught. 
. What relation exists between easy words and frequently used 
words, according to Doctor Ayres’s report? Do you think it may 
be possible to omit the teaching of many frequently used words, 
relying upon their repetition in use to “imprint” them perma- 
nently? 
. From Ayres’s [14 : 43-50] alphabetical list select ten words and ar- 
range them in what you think is the order of their difficulty. 
Compare with the order of difficulty according to the scale. Con- 
tinue this exercise, increasing the number of words. Compare 
your reliability for short lists with your reliability for long lists. 
. What rules do you find helpful in your own spelling? The case 
for rules is not made out, according to the reports. May this 
not be due to a general defect in the way they are taught? 
. To what extent may matters of “Word Study” such as prefixes, 
suffixes and stems, synonyms, etc., be introduced to give “con- 
tent” to the work of the spelling period? What other kinds of 
“content”? should be introduced? 
. Secure a cross-ruled note-book, enter at the left of a double page 
the words of each written test you give. Along the top enter 
numbers for individual pupils. For each misspelling score under 
the pupil’s number and opposite the word. After all scores are 
entered, the vertical totals will give the pupils’ records and the 
horizontal totals the records for words. If these are kept over 
a series of terms, the teachers of the same grades co-operating, 
the material will be extremely valuable as a measure of the suc- 
cess of teaching, and as material for word analysis. 
ro. What dictionary is best for each pupil to have in his desk and 
learn to use by using? How can the “dictionary habit” be 
developed ?

CHAPTER IV 
HANDWRITING 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
1. Are you prepared to show your pupils how to write, or do you only 
tell them? 
2. Is your penmanship period dreaded by teacher and pupils or is 
it a period happily anticipated ? 
3-(a) Do you find pupils more easily interested by class instruction 
or individual teaching? 
(0) What, in your estimation, is the proper proportion? 
4. Are pupils more readily stimulated by the sense of acquired free- 
dom of movement and power or the ability to draw correct 
letters? : 
5. Do you prepare the penmanship lesson as carefully as you pre- 
pare the assignment in history or arithmetic? 
6. What proportion of “do” and “don’t” should govern the pen- 
manship teacher’s instruction to pupils? 
7. Do your pupils hand in as well executed work in English as in 
penmanship? 
8. How nearly should this ideal be realized in every-day practice? 
9. Have you learned to interpret the meaning of jerky, uncertain 
lines? Can you apply the proper remedy? 
to. Are you motivating the work in penmanship to the extent that 
you do the other branches in the curriculum? 
, I. Prace oF HANDWRITING IN THE CURRICULUM 
_ Too many teachers underestimate the place of penman- 
ship in the curriculum and what it requires of them in terms 
of preparation, skill, and enthusiasm. It should be as care- 
fully prepared and as successfully taught as any other sub- 
ject: the goal to be attained should be as definite, and results 
should be as critically estimated as they are, for example, 
in arithmetic. ).To a teacher who is able to meet such require- 
ments as these, penmanship becomes one of the most inter-

  86 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
esting subjects she has to teach, for the fact that the results 
in it are tangible makes it easy to arouse the enthusiasm of 
children of all ages, and enthusiasm in both teacher and 
pupils is a prerequisite of success in any undertaking. 
Teacher Must Be Well Prepared.——Satisfactory results can 
never be reached by merely compelling children to imitate 
the copy in a writing-book. To give a general adverse criti- 
cism of a child’s writing is useless unless the underlying diffi- 
culty can be found and remedied, if need be, by the illustra- 
tive teaching of correct forms and how to obtain them. If 
a class is required to master certain forms and movements 
and to attain a measure of muscular control, simple justice 
demands that the teacher previously shall have reached in 
actual practice the standard she upholds. 
Correlation and Habit.—There is no subject in the school 
curriculum which, if it has been properly taught, may be so 
effectively correlated with other subjects; and one of the very 
first principles to be grasped is the necessity of insisting on 
excellence in all written work, whether it be the main point 
under consideration, as in the penmanship period, or incidental 
to other subjects. If the effort to improve is confined to the 
short time devoted to penmanship itself, it is impossible to 
produce a class of good. writers, for when slovenly written 
work in other subjects ig accepted by a teacher, even the best 
writers grow careless. \The habit of writing well is fully as 
important as the ability to do so. Legibility is an easily 
recognized necessity, but in, addition to good form and free- 
dom of line there must be a reasonable rate of speed, and the 
ability to maintain both form and speed for a reasonable 
length of time. In brief, the writing lesson must be entirely 
practical, and no better test of its practicality can be devised 
than this application of it to all subjects which find their 
expression through the written rather than the oral word. 
The Teaching of Beginners.—With first-grade pupils the 
teaching of penmanship is largely a matter of physical train- 
ing, because the chief difficulty in the way of the child is his
-P-A-G-E-115

lack of power to control and co-ordinate his muscles.!_ While 
form, freedom, and control must all be taught at the same 
time, in the primary grades greater emphasis should be placed 
upon correct position and pen-holding, with freedom of move- 
ment, than upon excellence of letter formation; although the 
teacher should not be too insistent upon a uniform standard 
of position. Children are no more alike physically than they 
are mentally, and within well-defined limits each child should 
be allowed to discover for himself the natural position of his 
body and the easiest way of holding his pencil. Good letter 
formation must not be expected until the pupil has acquired 
muscular control, and control comes only with long and 
patient practice. The primary teacher should not be too 
critical of the children’s efforts, and should never criticise 
without encouraging and showing the way out of the diffi- 
culty. 
II. OvTtine By GRADES 
1B Grade.—The first step in the work with beginners is 
to teach them to follow directions, and to gain free use of the 
arm. This may be accomplished most easily by use of the 
blackboard. 
1. Divide the board into spaces, using lines which have 
the slant you wish the pupils to acquire. 
/ Ce Ong 2. Place in each space an ellipse, the long diameter of 
which measures three or four inches. 
3. Have pupils stand about a foot from the blackboard, 
facing it squarely. 
4. Let them begin at the top of the ellipse and trace it to 
the teacher’s count: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., using the direct move- 
1 See Freeman, “The Psychology of the Common Branches,” chap, II. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
88 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ment, that is, the direction in which O is made. This is the 
time to begin insisting that they keep with the count. Move- 
ment exercises are useless unless they result in the freedom 
and control necessary for following the count. The crayon 
in use should be short enough to allow one end , rest in the 
palm of the hand. 
Another similar scheme for beginners has bod worked 
out successfully, as follows: The teacher places upon the 
blackboard ten horizontal lines, three inches apart, which 
are to be used for illustrating written work and for exercises. 
Each child is allowed twenty-two inches, measured hori- 
zontally, of the three-inch spacing, placed at a height within 
his reach. The following diagram illustrates the develop- 
ment of the scheme: 
WOGAO? 
  This device is to get the forward slant. No. 1 shows how 
the ellipse is started. No. 2 is developed from No. 1. No. 
3 is made without letting the hand stop. Count 1, 2, 3— 
4, 5,6—7, 8, 9; then tap three times with the arm moving 
continuously, and then begin to count 1, 2,3, etc. The 
children, at the count 1, touch the board, and at the begin- 
ning of No. 3 lift the crayon, but do not 
cease moving the arm. 4 f 
5. A little later the push-pull exercises 7 4 a 
may be used in the same manner. 
6. Finally, practise the compact ellipse, imitating the 
copy set. 
7. When the pupils have become fairly proficient in the 
exercises, let them trace, and then write, easy or such as 
on, one, none, etc. 
In this work, be sure that each pupil begins in the right 
place and moves in the right direction around each letter. 
Remember that exact form is not expected at this stage.
-P-A-G-E-119
  
HANDWRITING 89 
8. After pupils have gained some proficiency in black- 
board writing, plain paper, and large, soft lead-pencils may 
be given them, and the same method of teaching followed as 
at the blackboard. 
9. The child should learn to write his name and small 
words early in the year. 
10. Position and pencil-holding must be taught. Pupils 
should sit with their feet flat on the floor, backs straight, 
heads up, and both arms resting easily on the desk and bent 
at nearly right angles. The left hand should hold the paper. 
  The proper position for the pencil is between the right thumb 
and forefinger, crossing the second finger on the inside about 
opposite the first joint. The thumb-joint should be bent 
outward with the tip of the thumb (not the ball) resting on 
the pencil. The end of the forefinger should be about an 
inch from the point of the pencil.’ All fingers should be held 
closely together and the hand well closed. The hand may be 
turned a little to the side in finger writing, but not very much. 
Talk about keeping the thumb shorter than the forefinger, 
rather than about keeping the forefinger straight, and sug- 
gest that the end of the thumb be kept as close to the paper 
as possible. The pencil should cross the hand near the 
knuckle-joint, as this gives a good angle and helps prevent 
gripping. All writing during this half-year should be very large (an 
inch, or more, for the height of minimum letters). Large 
writing will be done by the large muscles of the arm rather 
than by the less developed finger-muscles, without any par- 
ticular direction from the teacher. : 
1A Grade.—Continue blackboard work. Require large 
writing, and still allow pencils to be held quite vertically, as  
-P-A-G-E-120
  go TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
| this assists in overcoming gripping. The wrist should be 
slightly raised from the desk, which should be touched only 
by the elbow and the third and fourth fingers. Use the 
compact ellipse, and have it made lightly and rather rapidly. 
Write longer and more difficult words. 
The paper in use should be ruled in five-eighths-inch spac- 
ing, so that minimum letters may be made one space high, 
and others two spaces. This will make the writing even and 
teach the relative height of letters. Pupils should first trace 
a copy set by the teacher, then copy it below while the teacher 
names the letters, as: n-o-o-n. This device will keep the 
class together and result in their writing at the proper speed. 
2B Grade.—Reduce the size of the writing a little by using 
paper ruled in three-eighths-inch spacing, instead of five- 
eighths-inch, as in 1A, but still make minimum letters one 
space high, and tall letters and capitals two spaces high. Do 
more work on paper in this grade, and less on the blackboard. 
Ordinary lead-pencils may now be given pupils. 
Begin teaching the small letters by count to get a more 
exact form. There are many good ways to count for the 
different letters, but in this grade the directions given should 
be as definite and detailed as possible, impressing the chil- 
dren’s minds with exactly what is to be done. In teach- 
ing 7, for instance, the count may be—‘‘up curve, down 
straight, up curve, dot.” For u, “up curve, down straight, 
up curve,” etc. To make this exercise of any value, the class 
must keep with the count. Rhythm helps. Never let the 
writing drag. Make words from the letters taught, and have 
pupils write them as you name the letters. Watch position 
and pencil-holding. Make sentences, using words you have 
taught, and letting the pupils write as you name the words. 
2A Grade.—Continue as in 2B, making only one change. 
Use paper ruled in five-eighths-inch spacing, and make the 
minimum letters half a space high, and others a whole space 
high, excepting ¢, d, and p, which are a little shorter. Board 
work and seat work may be alternated by days.

3B Grade.—Introduce ink and pens. Reduce the size 
of the writing a trifle by using paper ruled in three-eighths- 
inch spacing instead of five-eighths-inch, as in 2A. See to 
it that the children’s writing is not too slow, too small, nor 
too heavy. Arm-movement work is not emphasized in this 
grade because the position exacted creates arm movement 
unconsciously, and if the teacher’s work has been well done 
in the previous grades, many third-grade pupils will use it 
naturally. Review the small letters by count, and begin 
teaching the capitals, using the proper count for each one. 
3A Grade.—Complete the teaching of capitals and take 
up words and sentences. Use the same methods as in Grade 
2. Give much attention to position and pen-holding. It 
should be nearly perfect in this grade. In adjusting the pen- 
holder, the palm of the hand should be held directly over 
the paper, and the fingers should be turned under to give a 
good position for easy writing. The size of the writing should 
be one-third of a space for minimum letters, and not quite a 
space for the tall ones. By the end of this year’s work the 
pupil should have acquired good form, correct position and 
pen-holding, and fair control and freedom. ! 
4B Grade.—At this point emphasize movement exercises. 
In all movement writing, the arm should rest upon the thick 
muscles just below the elbow, and the hand should move on 
the nails of the third and fourth fingers. The hand should 
be held squarely palm down, and the wrist must not touch the 
desk. In this position the penholder, which is held just as 
the pencil position is described in 1B, will point toward the 
right shoulder. 
In beginning movement work, have the pupils take a good 
sitting position with both arms resting equally on the desk 
(as described above) and bent at nearly right angles. Ask 
them to close their right hands. Now the arm rests on the 
muscles of the forearm, and the hand and wrist are free from 
the desk. In this position, have the pupils make the arm go 
in and out of the sleeve rapidly, at the rate of about 160
-P-A-G-E-124
  
92 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
counts per minute. Count 1, 2, 3; 1, 2, 3; or, better, use 
a Victrola if one is at hand. Use a light, rhythmic tone in 
counting. Rhythm is of very great importance, as Freeman 
finds in his studies.! The speed should be 3 counts per 
second, 15 counts in 5 seconds. Use a watch until this speed 
has become habitual. It is important that all muscles be 
relaxed while doing movement writing. The movements 
for the retraced ellipse, both direct and indirect, should be 
practised in the same manner. When the exercises have 
been done properly, words may be taught. The following 
is an easy way to pass from exercises to words: 
COON 
Use the Victrola or the rhythmic count. Keep to a speed 
of 160 down strokes per minute, since smooth lines cannot be 
obtained at too slow speed, and good form cannot be main- 
tained at too great speed. 
4A Grade.—Continue the compact ellipse and the push- 
pull exercises. To form a free swing for word and sentence 
writing, the small e may be used in the form of an exercise, 
as follows: 
bei AS lia ee 
The speed of the gliding ‘‘e”’ exercise should be the same as 
for the ellipse. When pupils can write words of minimum 
letters, introduce words having one tall letter, such as “lame,” 
and, later, words having more than one tall letter. The letters 
may be named, as l-a-m-e, as the children write, but they 
should be named fast enough to get the rate of at least 160 
counts per minute. 
During the last two months of this year, require pupils 
to write their spelling words with the arm movement. Al- 
though in the spelling lesson the letters cannot be named, 
the teacher may count 1, 2, 3, etc. (a letter being made on 
1“The Teaching of Handwriting.”
-P-A-G-E-125
HANDWRITING 93 
each count), if necessary to keep up speed. Do not drag. 
Correct position and movement are of more importance in 
this grade than exact form. If any pupils wish to do all 
their written work with the arm movement, they should not 
be discouraged. 
5th Grade.—Require occasional board work here, as in 
all grades. The application of movement writing to all 
school work should be begun in this grade. It is impracticable 
before this because of lack of physical development and 
necessary control, especially in the case of the boys. The 
free glide and movement is developed very rapid'y from this 
point. The same exercises are used here as in Grade 4, 
Ae SAA ZES th     
with the addition of the two-space retraced direct oval. The 
pen should begin moving before making the form, starting 
the path for the exercise, then touching the paper and re- 
tracing until the count 9 is reached, when it is lifted and kept 
moving until the count is begun and the previous exercise 
repeated. 
6th, 7th, and 8th Grades.—Continue the exercises on paper 
—especially the direct compact ellipse, two spaces high— 
and have occasional board work. Review all capitals and 
small letters to get exact forms. Use the same methods as 
in the lower grades and drill on words and sentences from a 
copy. Use dictation freely. 
Drill on figures should be used in all grades. Remember 
that the speed must not change. Too low a speed spoils 
freedom and ease of movement, and too high a speed spoils 
form. Insist in these grades upon the things emphasized 
during all previous years, good position of the body, of feet, 
and of paper, proper pen-holding and arm movement. The 
essentials, like the speed, do not change.

  04 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
III. Sranparp Tests 
Function.—The teacher must keep clearly in mind the 
function of the standard test, such as the Ayres quality scale 
and the Freeman speed scale. It should be used solely as a 
measure of the increase in power of the class and the indi- 
vidual, not as an arbitrary standard imposing mechanical 
methods of teaching. Properly applied, it reveals the strong 
points as well as the weaknesses in existing methods, and 
furnishes a stimulus to both class and teacher which in itself 
makes for increased efficiency. 
Use of Standard Tests.—Under existing circumstances the 
standard test for penmanship should be used for but two 
purposes: first, to make plain the actual conditions in the 
classroom; second, to show whether the methods in use are 
producing a steady improvement or whether time is being 
wasted. Efficiency is possible only when the teacher knows 
these two factors so clearly that she is able to make definite 
demands upon her pupils. 
~ Improvement in the penmanship of a class depends en- 
tirely on the pupils themselves, but progress is certain when 
the daily practice has back of it a clear-cut resolve to improve 
the quality of the writing of the previous day, and the knowl- 
edge of how to do it. Aimless drill produces little or no im- 
provement. It may tend to actual deterioration, because a 
bad habit may become firmly fixed. 
During the past few years standard measurements have 
been developed in several subjects of the elementary school 
curriculum, but none is easier of application than that for 
penmanship. In measuring the quality of writing by the 
standard scale, little opportunity is afforded for individual 
opinion. The question is simply one of putting a specimen 
of penmanship beside the one most like it in the scale em- 
ployed.

Children,” by Doctor Leonard P. Ayres, of the Russell Sage y yres, g' 
Foundation, are the most noteworthy. They differ slightly 
in the methods by which the different specimens were selected,    
-P-A-G-E-128
    
96 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
but in both cases they represent the consensus of a large 
number of individual judgments. Each is made up of twenty 
specimens of penmanship, graded from 20 to 100. Theo- 
retically these are separated by equal intervals, 7.e., the 
variation in quality between 20 and 30 is exactly the same 
as the variation between 80 and go, or between any other 
two specimens of the scale. Herein lies one of the advantages 
of grading papers by such a method rather than according 
to the judgment of the teacher. When a teacher marks a 
set of papers in per cents, the difference in quality be- 
tween 4o and 50 per cent is almost never the same as the 
variation between go and too per cent. In the case of the 
‘scale the standard is fixed: with per cents it constantly 
varies. Be sure to get the latest revised edition. 
What Scale to Use.—In the judgment of the writer, 
neither of the two published quality scales is practicable for 
general use. The variation in the style of writing in differ- 
ent communities is sufficient to make comparison with them 
a slow and tedious process. They are, however, invaluable to 
a teacher who wishes to develop a scale of her own, made up 
of specimens of the style of writing used by her class. 
For such a purpose, hundreds of papers representing the 
best writing of the pupils should be collected. Comparing 
them individually with one of these two standard scales di- 
vides them roughly into groups, each group being made up of 
all the papers which resemble the same specimen in the scale. 
The next step is to compare the papers of each group with 
its corresponding specimen, eliminating one after another 
until only the paper most like the type is left. Repeated 
with group after group, this finally gives specimens separated 
by approximately equal intervals and exactly corresponding in 
number to the steps of the first scale, but with the advantage 
of being in the style of writing used by the class, since it has 
been made up from their own work. If the final selection is 
approved by two or three examiners, the resulting scale will 
be even more accurate.
-P-A-G-E-129
  
HANDWRITING 97 
How Used.—The selected specimens should be fastened 
on a large sheet of paper or cardboard, or spread. out on a 
desk in the order of their merit. The paper to be rated is 
then moved along the scale until it rests beside the specimen 
it most resembles, when it is given the corresponding mark. 
This is the rating of the individual pupil. The average of 
such ratings will represent the standing of the class. The 
median is more exact than the average, but the method of 
obtaining it is a little more complicated. As the name indi- 
cates, it is the paper so selected that the number of papers 
which surpass it in quality equals the number of papers of 
poorer quality. In rating papers in this way there is but 
one important factor, constancy of judgment, and it is reason- 
ably certain that this will be attained if the ratings at succes- 
sive times are made by the same person. Since the im- 
portant consideration is that the class shall improve, rather 
than that it shall reach some arbitrary rank, it makes no essen- 
tial difference whether the judge is severe or lenient. Degree 
of improvement is measured equally whether a severe judge 
gives the initial and final ratings as 10-13, or a more lenient 
one as 12-15. The only variation will be in the absolute 
standard reached. 
The writer is fully convinced that if pupils are given ac- 
cess to the standard scale they will rate their own papers with 
a degree of accuracy sufficient for all practical purposes. Ifa 
pupil judges himself leniently both at the initial and final com- 
parison and makes an improvement represented by an inter- 
val of the scale, he is no better off than the pupil who judges 
himself severely and makes the same degree of improvement, 
since the goal is gain in power, not the attainment of a fixed 
rank. As a matter of actual experience two, or even three, 
judges are in practical harmony so far as class averages are 
concerned. The reason for this agreement is evident. The 
majority of the papers plainly fall into their proper position 
on the scale: the only difficulty occurs with those coming on 
the border-line. By the law of probabilities, if a judge throws   
     
-P-A-G-E-130
    98 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
one of these border-line papers into the lower group, he is 
likely to place another border-line paper in the higher group. 
This brings his average into exact agreement with the second

judge, who perhaps reverses the distribution. It is not a 
matter of theory: the facts prove beyond dispute that the 
averages are reasonably constant. 
What Quality to Expect.—In Doctor Ayres’s original 
scale 18,000 specimens were employed, taken from grades
-P-A-G-E-131
  HANDWRITING 99 
5 to 8 in forty different cities. The average quality was 
found to be 50 percent. In his survey of Springfield, Ill., with 
2,359 papers from the same grades, rated by different judges 
from those employed in developing the original scale, the 
average quality was found to be 49.3 per cent. This is indi- 
cated by the specimen marked 50 in the series of graded 
specimens on preceding page, reproduced by permission from 
Doctor Ayres’s report of the Springfield survey. 
That quality 50 represents approximately the initial stand- 
ard of writing which may be expected from grammar school 
children finds striking corroboration from the writer’s own 
experience in Elmira, N. Y. In that city 2,486 specimens of 
writing were collected and rated in the office of the superin- 
tendent. The average quality of these papers was 60. The 
variation between this figure and that given by Doctor Ayres 
is due to the fact that a scale for measuring handwriting had 
been used in Elmira for two years, and had radically improved 
the quality of the penmanship. This difference furnishes the 
best argument for the value of a standard scale to any school 
system.

Doctor Starch, in his book on “Educational Measurements ’—gives a slide-rule de- 
vice for getting a combined mark for both speed and quality. 
Any method must be judged by its results. If the use of 
the standard test in penmanship will produce a radical im- 
provement in the quality of the writing of school children, it 
is worth while. Its effect on a normal seventh grade appears

The figures at the left represent the numbering of the

indicates the quality of each pupil’s writing in September, 
while the lower figure shows the same fact for the following 
May. In the scale employed, the standard specimens were 
graded from 1 to 20, so the figures as given on the chart 
should be multiplied by 5 if they are to be reduced to the 
same basis as that employed in the scale by Doctor Ayres. 
That a similar improvement may be expected for the en-

  These experiences with the standard test in penmanship 
have convinced the writer that it affords an instrument so 
simple and effective that every teacher not only may, but 
ought to, know definitely the quality and progress of the 
work being accomplished by her own pupils.! Freeman’s 
proposed standards of achievement for the various grades in 
quality according to the Ayres scale and in speed according 
to the letters written a minute are given on page 99. The 
children are asked to write some simple sentence such as 
“Mary had a little lamb” for exactly three minutes. The 
number of letters per minute and the quality can then both 
be ascertained for each sample. 
1 The Ayres scale may be obtained for five cents from the Sage Foundation, 
New York City, or the Thorndike scale from Teachers College, Columbia, in 
the same city, at the same price. Doctor Ayres has also prepared a scale for 
measuring adult handwriting.

  HANDWRITING 107 
V. Wuat System To UsE 
At the present time there is no conclusive evidence as to 
what constitutes the one best style of writing. At times the 
controversy among the advocates of vertical penmanship 
and those who favored the extreme slant, or the medium slant, 
has waxed warm. All are agreed that a good system of 
penmanship must be legible and must enable the writer to 
execute it at a reasonable speed and without undue fatigue. 
Which system will secure these desirable results is a disputed 
question. The study made by Doctor Ayres throws some 
light on this question, but he would be one of the first to declare 
that further investigation is needed before it is safe to ac- 
cept his conclusions as final. He found but little difference 
in the speed actually developed by pupils in using the different 
systems of penmanship. His results are reproduced in the 
following table:

  It is probable that the pronounced opposition of the 
business world will prevent vertical penmanship from ever 
being taught in the public schools. The writer’s conviction 
is that the semi-slant represents the style of penmanship 
most satisfactory for use in the schools when everything is 
taken into consideration. 
VI. Motivation 
While the standard scale furnishes incidental motivation, 
there are many attractive combinations of the push-pull ex-
-P-A-G-E-140
  108 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ercises and spirals which arouse the children’s interest, and 
should be introduced as soon as a reasonable degree of free- 
dom has been attained. The pupils should be allowed to 
exercise their own creative ability after a good example of 
possible combinations suited to their power has been pre- 
sented to them. The use of colored inks results in realistic 
butterflies, flowers, fans, quaint costumes, turkeys, log cabins, 
and automobiles, and gives the children delightful practice 
instead of tiresome tasks.' 
SUMMARY 
1. Good handwriting should be a habit, not an attainment. 
2. The teacher should be able to illustrate concretely the skill she 
wishes to secure from the pupils. 
3. Let first-grade teaching be largely a matter of physical training. 
4. Beginners should work entirely at the blackboard until some de- 
gree of freedom and muscular control has been secured. 
5. Below the fifth grade correct position and movement are of more 
importance than correct form. 
6. Correlation should begin with the fifth grade if the proper founda- 
tion has been laid in the lower grades. 
7. The standard test applied to penmanship furnishes a powerful 
incentive to teacher and pupils. 
8. A home-made scale based on the Ayres scale is the most practical 
for average classroom use. The Freeman standards of speed 
may be used with it. . 
9. Pupils reaching a certain standard on their written school work 
should not be required to continue penmanship as a regular 
class exercise. 
to. Motivate wherever possible for the great amount of practice 
necessary to secure freedom with legibility and reasonable 
speed. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
The problems presented in the teaching of handwriting naturally 
group themselves about the relation between speed and legibility and 
the best methods of securing power and freedom. Interesting inves- 
tigation may be made by the teacher of the following topics: 
1 See Wilson’s “ Motivation of School Work,” chap. X. 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
II. HANDWRITING 10g 
. Whether a pupil who writes slowly is apt to be a superior writer. 
. Is a rapid writer more likely to be a poor writer? 
. Ifin teaching penmanship emphasis is laid upon speed, is it apt to 
be at the expense of form? 
. Does emphasis upon form mean a sacrifice of speed ? 
. The effect of rhythm upon both speed and form may be studied 
by taking samples of children’s writing and the amount written 
within a given time, before and after several months’ training, 
using Victrola or rhythmic counting. 
. The relative fatigue resulting from rapid and slow writing which 
would determine where the most emphasis in training should 
be placed. 
. The probable number of pupils who will have most or all of their 
important writing done by a typewriter in later years. 
. The quality of writing, according to a scale, which business men 
' and other persons in the community consider minimum. 
. What methods work best in getting pupils to do their best, rapid, 
and accurate writing in all class exercises ? 
. Post the Thorndike and the Ayres scales for measuring children’s 
handwriting on the wall where pupils can measure their own 
writing and encourage them to do so. Another method is to 
place a scale under a large pane of glass on a table, or to frame 
the scale. 
If the principal writing that pupils will do is in the form of cor- 
respondence, how much of handwriting and composition should 
be letter writing ? 
There are broader problems for investigating which could be car- 
ried on in the same school system or among different systems, which 
would determine the relative value of different methods of instruction 
as advocated by leading penmanship supervisors, but these do not 
come within the province of the individual teacher.

COMPOSITION 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
Why do many teachers regard composition as a study suitable 
only for the higher grades of the school? 
What are the chief values of composition? 
What are the typical social situations demanding communication 
of ideas in speech or in writing? 
What should a particular individual speak or write about ? 
How does a trained writer proceed with the revision of a manu- 
script before submitting it for publication? Why should chil- 
dren proceed in substantially the same way? 
Why should children be permitted to read their compositions to 
their classmates? 
As a topic in a course of study, which is better: “Exposition,” or 
“How to make people understand you”? 
What objection is there to beginning a composition exercise with 
the study of a classical “model”? 
. What should be included in elementary composition—grammar? 
What is the purpose of a composition ‘‘scale”’? 
Since composition is a part of all studies, why have special classes 
in it? 
. Why have vocational topics proved useful in composition work? 
I. Tur Nature AND VALUE OF COMPOSITION AS 
A SUBJECT 
Composition, Not Language.—There is a great deal in a 
name. The growing tendency to employ the word composi- 
tion to designate certain elementary school activities should 
be encouraged. The word is to be preferred to “English” 
or “language,” because it is more precise and more sugges- 
tive than either. ‘English’ has fairly established itself as 
the inclusive term for all school studies in which the mastery 
of the vernacular for either practical or esthetic uses is the 
IIr 
   
-P-A-G-E-144
Ii2 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
chief end. Like science, it serves to denominate several re- 
lated subjects, as, for example, reading, literature, and oral 
and written expression. “Language,” on the other hand, 
calls to mind the external forms of speech and writing. The 
word suggests inflection, punctuation, the use of capital 
letters, the choice of synonyms, etc. It has for many also 
the associations developed by contact with those nondescript 
collections of facts, pictures, poems, blanks to fill, dictations 
to write, passages to copy, and stories to reproduce which 
have, for a generation, been supplied to children in the last 
four or five years of the elementary school as text-books in 
“language” or “English.” It is high time for a change both 
of material and of name. 
The new name should be composition. This name should 
be consciously and definitely applied, not alone to the prepa- 
ration of written papers in the higher grammar grades, but 
to certain activities in all grades. Even primary teachers, 
who have been all the while inducing and guiding composi- 
tional activities, should have no scruples about employing the 
term. 
That they do have such scruples was recently demon- 
strated. In a system of schools employing over a hundred 
teachers, “‘round tables” for the discussion of the various 
elementary school subjects were announced, among them a 
round table on composition. To this round table not a 
single primary teacher came. Inquiry disclosed the fact that 
these teachers understood the term as applying only to the 
writing of “‘themes” in the upper grades. 
What Composition Is.—As has been hinted above, com- 
position is a fundamental activity, not confined to any grade 
or stage of learning, nor even to the school. It is primarily 
a mental process, and only secondarily a matter of speaking 
or writing. It is in part identical with thinking, and with 
much of what is properly called study. It is analogous to 
house-building, cabinetmaking, landscape-gardening, and all 
other arts, industrial or fine. Like these arts, it involves the
-P-A-G-E-145
  COMPOSITION 113 
development and organization of ideas, and the giving to them 
of an appropriate, an effective form of expression. It is, 
then, first of all a process; afterward a product. It is prac- 
tised by every normal human being of every age, except that 
of earliest infancy; and, while capable of being reduced to 
formal rules and laws, it is learned chiefly by imitation and 
is in large measure a matter of habit, not of consciously 
directed effort. It involves the use of language, and hence 
is hindered or helped, as the case may be, by the degree of 
mastery of vocabulary, sentence idiom, and other units of 
form which the individual has attained. It is essentially a 
social activity; men speak or write in order to communicate. 
Hence it functions only where a genuine social relationship 
exists [29 : 1-5]. 
The Value of Composition.—From the point of view of 
the elementary school, composition is primarily a means for 
the establishment of certain important habits. Among these 
may be noted the habit of observing, that is, of seeing curi- 
ously and thoughtfully. Here composition is a powerful ally 
of all other school studies. Nature study, for example, may 
tend to make children observant of certain classes of natural 
phenomena. But scientists, as everybody knows, are not 
keen to notice objects outside of the range of their special in- 
terests. Artists are equally narrow. Composition, however, 
may be made inclusive, and therefore broadening. In order 
to depict or explain you must see. 
As implied above, composition may strengthen the ten- 
dency to reflect, to turn experiences and ideas over’ in the 
mind so as to perceive their meaning and relationships. This 
is seeing in the deeper sense. Not all attain to any degree 
of power in doing it, even in mature years, but the founda- 
tion of the habit may be firmly laid in composition if any- 
where—much more firmly laid than teachers generally sus- 
pect [1 : 123-4]. 
The tendency to weigh and judge the value of statements 
may be promoted also [32, 33, 34]. Composition means
-P-A-G-E-146
  II4 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
selection. Among the ideas which association presents, some 
may be included, many must be rejected. Conscious choice 
implies standards and the custom of referring to them. This 
means, in other words, that composition is logical, consistent, 
must convince, and hence must appeal as valid. In a word, 
it must seek to be truthful. 
More obviously the practice of composition leads to obedi- 
ence to good usage, to the choice of expressions agreeable to 
one’s fellows because understood and approved by them. It 
enormously increases the possibilities of thought and feeling 
by furnishing the vehicles in which thought and feeling are 
carried. Thus life is broadened and enriched, and the possi- 
bilities of intellectual intercourse multiplied a thousandfold. 
Freedom of expression is ultimately the gauge of a man’s 
education [16a: 170-187]. 
II. Merrnop IN THE TEACHING OF COMPOSITION 
How Method in Composition Is to Be Discovered.—The 
discussion of the teaching of composition cannot proceed 
worthily except upon the basis of the fundamental assump- 
tions which have been outlined in the preceding paragraphs. 
Method is not merely a matter of personal idiosyncrasy, but 
of rational procedure. In the nature and purpose of the sub- 
ject itself method is to be discovered. A clear view of the 
values to be realized and of the psychology of the process of 
gaining control of them will provide us with the principles in 
accordance with which details of classroom technic may be 
consistently worked out [8, 36]. 
What is the essential process of composition? First of all, 
there must be an occasion for communication. Men speak 
when they have something to say and somebody to say it to. 
When Jennie, aged five, wishes to play with her small neigh- 
bor, she makes a convincing plea and mamma consents. 
When Ralph’s baseball team wins from its rival, the boy 
gives the people at home an enthusiastic account of the vic- 
tory. The older sister falls in with her chum on the way to
-P-A-G-E-147
COMPOSITION II5 
school and enters into an animated conversation about plans 
for a new spring costume. Meanwhile papa discusses poli- 
tics or business with an acquaintance while journeying to the 
office, and later in the day mamma attends the club and reads 
a paper on the Irish Theatre. Evening finds all at home, 
and, more likely than not, one or more of the family occupies 
the time in writing letters to distant friends. These are some 
of the ordinary occasions for composition. Strange that the 
school should have so formalized a process which is essentially 
spontaneous, natural, and enjoyable. 
An Outline of Method—Real Composition Situations.— 
The first step in teaching composition, then, is to create, or 
seize upon, situations in which expression in speech or in 
writing is urgent and gratifying. They are numerous and 
near at hand. Everybody likes to tell about himself and his 
own experiences; everybody likes to give welcome information; 
everybody likes to entertain, to merit approval, to carry his 
point, to play a part, to add to his possessions, to reciprocate 
a favor. If only the class period is conceived of as a meet- 
ing of friends, not primarily as a formal recitation or testing 
place, real situations for composition will present themselves. 
Socialize the composition hour [9 : 26; 29 : 36]. 
This does not mean, however, unbridled license to imma- 
turity. Socializing is an active, not a passive process. The 
teacher must lead in it, not merely keep hands off. She will 
help her pupils to find both the occasion and the topic. She 
will suggest, arouse, start ideas to working, point the way to 
the raw material, discover to each his proper resources. In 
short she will neither make formal assignment of topics nor 
leave raw boys and girls, who have little conscious command 
of their powers, to grope about or stand helpless, unaware of 
their possibilities. On the contrary, she will reveal each to 
himself, for it is her business to know her children. The boy 
who sells papers, or who spends his summer on his uncle’s 
sheep-ranch, or who makes a garden and sells vegetables, will 
be encouraged to transmute his unique experience into the
-P-A-G-E-148
116 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
gold of human speech. Likewise the girl who feels certain 
that she has nothing to say will be helped to find in her per- 
sonal interests that which it is worth while to tell about 
[32, az]. 
Time Necessary.—But neither the boy nor the girl should 
be expected to do this without reflection. Why teachers 
should require of children what the veteran of the platform 
never undertakes will always remain a mystery. Webster 
replied to Hayne extemporaneously. He had but to reach 
up, so he declared, and seize thunderbolts to hurl at his 
opponent. But for many a month he had been forging his 
thunderbolts for just such an encounter. Given the occasion 
for speech and the fit topic upon which to discourse, there must 
follow a period of incubation, time for the idea to develop, 
to take shape, to gather to itself appropriate details. And 
these must be ordered into somewhat of system. There must 
bea plan. One idea must come first, another follow, and so 
on to an appropriate end. All of this takes time and con- 
sciously directed effort. Babbling on like Tennyson’s brook 
will never accomplish it. 
* Nevertheless, it cannot be done by rule. It is, as has 
been suggested above, a matter chiefly of imitation, of habit- 
uation; children learn to do it by working sympathetically 
with others who have the secret. Little by little they be- 
come conscious of the process, and bend the will to it. The 
primary teacher is herself orderly, systematic. Her board 
lessons have unity and coherence. Her stories proceed by 
well-defined units. Her explanations are clear and logical. 
She holds the pupils to the point, draws them back on the 
track, discourages wandering, challenges their thought, ques- 
tions them, makes them think things out, turns a deaf ear to 
foolish, half-baked assumptions, praises the thoughtful, the 
orderly, stimulates right intellectual activity. She lays— 
or ought to lay—the indispensable foundation. Hence she 
should know the principles of effective composition; she should 
have a clear vision of the goal toward which her protégés are
-P-A-G-E-149
COMPOSITION 117 
moving. Above all she should know the psychology of lan- 
guage. Otherwise how can she understand the immense im- 
portance of the informal methods by which right habits of 
thought and expression are to be established long before a 
single rule is learned [9, 18, 23, 32, 39]. 
In this is to be found the answer to the question so often 
asked: Shall I correct grammatical and other errors of speech 
at the time they are made? Generally, yes. Supply the 
correct form. Cause it to be spoken by the child in its proper 
connection. Save all those present from the influence of a 
bad example while you seek to establish the right habit in 
the offender. But do it tactfully. It is not necessary or 
desirable to upset Frank’s train of thought in giving him the 
expression he needs. The teacher is his living dictionary, 
and a much better one than any printed book can be for 
many a year. 
But will the tactful correction do any good? Yes, if 
quietly persistent. It should, however, be followed up by 
language games, in which errors which are found to be 
troublesome to the whole class are practised upon. Not 
formal lessons with generalization, note, but drills, repetition, 
with attention focussed on the form and with all the zest 
which ingenuity can arouse. Let one row ask questions of 
another which will require ‘‘I saw,” “‘I have seen,” etc., in 
answer. Choose sides to see who can make up the most sen- 
tences involving ‘‘were,” and so on [r: 29]. 
In the first three years of school, it may almost be said, 
the composition battle is lost or won. Almost, we say, be- 
cause the work of the years to follow is indispensable. Step 
by step the learner must master the technic of the craft. 
Mere informal direction will not suffice—not for the many, 
at all events. The pupil must learn what the tools are and 
how to use them. Not apart from actual life, be it said 
again, but by employing them for purposes as real and as 
worthy as later life will ever afford. Juggling with the forms 
of language is a poor substitute for actual communication.  
-P-A-G-E-150
  118 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The time for William’s account of his visit to the country is 
necessarily short. Therefore William can tell about only a 
single experience. Let him choose the breaking in of the bay 
colt. That will be interesting, especially if William puts in 
the details which will enable all to picture just what hap- 
pened. Thus he learns to narrow his subject and to treat 
it concretely. Mary is to report in the assembly on how the 
class has managed its window-boxes. What do the members 
of the class want her to tell? She puts her outline on the 
board. It is criticised. All learn how to plan a speech, 
using the standard means of ordering a body of ideas. So 
it may be with the hundreds of facts and principles which the 
children should master. The need of them arises; they are 
clearly taught through use; and afterward, being consistently 
called for and required, are fixed for all time. 
Note the importance of publication in all of this. Con- 
sciousness of my audience, of what is due to them, of what 
is necessary on my part to win success, this and this only 
will lead to conscience for form. I must win the approval 
of my audience, otherwise what matter? Let the teacher 
who piously prates about correctness for its own sake consider 
herself as she would be wholly apart from social influence and ~ 
social compulsion. Morality in vacuo may be made to ap- 
pear plausible in the abstract but nowhere exists in reality. 
For my audience I must prepare to speak clearly and cor- 
rectly; for my reader I must write out a fair copy [30]. 
Which suggests another of the foolish practices of the 
school, namely, the demanding of perfect first drafts with- 
out time even for reflection, much less revision and sober 
second thought. What no practised writer ever does, not 
even the hectic newspaper penny-a-liner, the fledgling of 
the elementary school is expected to undertake. The bur- 
den of dealing with half-matured, wholly restrained and 
stiffened writing might have been expected to force a reform 
long ago, but tradition is powerful, and teachers have not 
been much in the habit of criticising their methods by the

COMPOSITION 119 
light of life without the walls. Not of course that there 
should never be writing wholly spontaneous and unrevised, 
but certainly not more of it than is common with adults, 
and not under circumstances which are not readily dupli- 
cated outside of school. Let children make notes. Let 
them dash off first drafts. Let them revise their own work. 
The man who submits for publication the first-fruits of his 
brain is rare—a myth, in fact, a mere creature of supersti- 
tion. To take him for the model of the mere beginner is 
indefensible [23, 29a, 31]. 
Judgment by One’s Peers.—And let the work be passed 
upon by a jury of the writer’s peers. True, the teacher must 
act as judge, but she will do well to remember that it is the 
decision of the speaker’s or writer’s classmates which weighs. 
It is to them that he appealed. They are his society, his asso- 
ciates. Their standard cannot reasonably be thought too high. 
Moreover, the members of the class need to exercise their 
judgments. The impression of one is speedily corrected by 
that of another. Each marvels that so obvious a fact should 
have escaped his observation. ‘There was never such a train- 
ing ground for the exercise of fairness, courtesy, tact, and the 
spirit of helpfulness. Here is opportunity for the intimate 
exercise of the duties and privileges of citizenship. 
Perhaps no method of class criticism equals in effective- 
ness that of group work at the blackboard. It begins in the 
first grades with the teacher herself at the board writing for 
the class. Later a good penman among the pupils may take 
her place, or several pupils may put their work where all can 
see. In the higher grades it is well to divide the class into 
small sections. Let one member of each section write a 
short composition which he has prepared, while the other 
members make suggestions as he goes along. The teacher 
should go about to settle moot questions and see that there is 
no lack of serious attempt. Those who have not tried it have 
no idea how effective this method is in improving the technic 
of writing [rx].

  120 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Summed up, the main principles of successful method in 
the teaching of composition are these: (1) Provide real situa- 
tions for oral and written expression. (2) See to it that each 
pupil finds a topic upon which he has, or can get, abundant 
information, and that he attains to a definite, specific point 
of view from which to treat that topic. (3) Allow sufficient 
time for the topic to develop in the mind of the speaker or 
writer, and make sure that the ideas take shape according 
to some workable plan. (4) Then, and then only, encourage 
the composer to clothe his theme in appropriate details of 
language and to put it before his hearers or his readers. 
(5) Depend in large measure upon the pupils themselves to 
make upon each performance the criticisms which will enable 
the individual to improve. The teacher should encourage 
where possible, and should show each how to correct and 
revise his work [1, 3, 7, 9, 18, 27, 29]. 
Ill. Tue Course or Stupy AND STANDARDS OF 
ATTAINMENT 
The Course of Study.—Many other phases of our subject 
which are now frequently discussed remain to be touched 
upon. If, however, the doctrines set forth above are ac- 
cepted, the remaining questions may be somewhat sum- 
marily disposed of. What of the course of study? The an- 
swer is that a course of study is a series of experiences through 
which the learner moves to the realization one by one of con- 
sciously prized values. A course in composition, then, is 
something more than a collection of facts and principles of 
language expression scattered more or less arbitrarily over a 
certain school period. In a very real sense the course in 
composition is made up of subjects to be treated rather than 
of forms of language to be learned. It is, however, neither 
alone. It is the handling of subjects of vital interest in such 
a way that step by step, as the maturing intellectual life of 
the child permits it and demands it, mastery of the forms of 
expression is actually attained. At the beginning conscious
-P-A-G-E-155
COMPOSITION I2t 
knowledge of technic is brought very little into play. With 
the passing years this knowledge matures, but nowhere is 
it worth while to give it as pure science, as facts cherished up 
against the day of possible use. The effort to give command 
of such technic as the needs of communication actually de- 
mand will be found more than the teacher is ordinarily equal 
to [23, 32, 37]. How absurd it is, then, to attempt to deal with the “forms 
of discourse” in the grades—one might venture to add, in 
the early years of high school [17, 35]. What children need 
to learn is how to tell a clear and connected story, not how to 
state the theory of prose narrative, and how it differs from 
prose description; to make people understand or believe 
them, not to define exposition and argumentation, and to 
discourse upon the methods of carrying these on. The study 
of composition is mainly well-directed and tactfully criticised 
practice in speaking and in writing, not the reading over of 
statements of rhetorical theory derived from an examination 
of the work of successful writers [11]. 
The Use of Models.—But is not the use of models praise- 
worthy? Yes and no. Nothing so completely prevents 
originality and the free play of one’s own ideas as first to 
read what another has written and immediately after try to 
write something similar oneself. Especially is this true if 
the writer of the ‘‘model” is a master, and has treated the 
subject in a manner far beyond the present powers of the 
learner. It is far better frankly to attempt to reproduce 
what one can remember of such a model than to pretend to 
imitate it [z3, 29]. 
There is, however, a legitimate and important use for ex- 
amples of good writing in the elementary course in com- 
position. The study of the “model” should follow, not pre- 
cede, the attempt of the learner. Once he has his own ideas 
collected and expressed, the reading or hearing of the words 
of another will but lead to revision and improvement, not to 
paralysis, of individual effort. The model, moreover, should
-P-A-G-E-156
    
122 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
not be too far beyond the present powers of the pupils. For 
most of the class the work of the leaders of it will suffice as 
stimulus and example. For the sake of the leaders, however, 
there should be provided also specimens of the work of some- 
what more mature writers, preferably that of other students 
or of the teacher, and these models should be used merely 
to suggest larger and better possibilities of method and treat- 
ment rather than details of technic. Imitation of style is 
only for the specialist. Until the text-books provide them, 
teachers should be enabled to have pieces of good work 
duplicated at will, in a form to be placed in permanent books 
kept by the pupils. 
Such examples may be chosen partly to serve the pur- 
pose of dictation. The danger in this exercise is, however, 
that it will become entirely perfunctory, a time-killer. Dic- 
tation is valuable mainly for drill, and hence should be em- 
ployed only when there is a particular fact or usage to be 
drilled upon. The pupils should know exactly what this is, 
and should study the example carefully with this in mind 
before it is read to them. They should then pass judgment 
upon their own work to determine the degree to which they 
have mastered the form or principle, and the drill should 
proceed just so long as it is actually seen to be needed and 
no longer. 
Correlation with Literature.—These examples, it will be 
seen at once, are not to be mainly “literary.” It is a pretty 
sentiment, now much cherished, that the study of poetry is 
the chief means by which children are to acquire the power 
of oral and written expression. One is in danger, no doubt, 
of appearing ungracious to attack so sweet a dogma, but a 
moment’s reflection will make it clear that, Wordsworth to 
the contrary, the language of poetry is not the language of 
common life, however poetical the language of common life 
may be. Literature, except for the homely folk-tales and 
fables of the earliest years, and the prose hero-tales of the 
middle grades, is at best an indirect means of language train-

  COMPOSITION 123 
ing, and should be permitted to occupy its own place on the 
program, as geography does. The time of the composi- 
tion hour is needed for such activities as have been described 
above. Once the teaching of composition and the teaching 
of literature are merged, there follows, almost inevitably, 
neglect of practical training and dependence upon a vague 
influence which is never tested or measured, and which has 
far less value in every-day expression than is commonly 
ascribed to it. Literature must not be substituted for com- 
position merely because teachers find it more to their taste 
or can arouse greater enthusiasm by means of it. Let the 
example of the quack who threw all of his patients into fits 
because he was death on fits suffice as a solemn warning. 
The Place of Grammar.—This same example might well 
be cited also to those who persist in parsing and diagramming. 
From what has already been said, it must be evident that the 
present writer has no faith in formal English grammar as an 
isolated science to be studied by children. The investiga- 
tions which have been made throw the gravest doubt upon 
all the claims which have been set up for formal grammar as 
an elementary school subject [24]. The fact seems to be that 
the principles of grammar, like the principles of rhetoric, are 
of value only as pupils grow up to and into them through 
their own experience. Good speaking and writing obeys 
standard grammatical usage; there can be no doubt about 
that. The only question is: In what way can boys and 
girls be most effectively aided in attaining to grammatical 
correctness in their speaking and writing? 
The answer seems to be: Neither by ignoring grammar 
nor by apotheosizing it. Just as in the case of rhetoric, the 
beginnings are made through informal correction of errors 
and the setting of a good example. Standard terms, not 
baby talk, should always be employed. If this is done, gram- 
matical concepts will gradually define themselves in a purely 
objective way, as other concepts do. A child does not wait 
until he may take up the study of cabinetmaking and master  
-P-A-G-E-160
  124 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
a formal definition to learn what a chair is. ‘‘Sentence,” 
“subject,” “predicate,” “noun,” “verb,” “conjunction,” 
“modifiers,” and many other grammatical ideas should come 
to him in the same way. And when he does take up formally 
the study of grammatical principles, it should be in the 
closest connection with his practice of composition, and with 
constant application thereto. 
What topics in grammar it is worth while to emphasize 
investigation must determine. A good beginning upon such 
an investigation has already been made and should be car- 
ried forward everywhere [10, 19]. With the definite aim be- 
fore us of including in the course of study such grammar 
study as can actually be made to function in composition, and 
this only, we shall beyond doubt be able to learn in the near 
future how much of English grammar we ought to teach. 
Already two classes of topics are clearly defined. One of 
these includes those inflected forms in which error is common 
and difficult to avoid. Such are the tense forms of verbs 
and the cases of pronouns. The other involves the so-called 
“sentence sense,” the clear perception of a thought as a 
completely expressed unit, a group of words made up of sub- 
ject and predicate. This is, of course, conventional. One 
may make himself fairly well understood by means of gestures 
and ejaculations. But civilization communicates by means 
of sentences, and to this standard it is necessary to attain. 
It is best also for the sake of the sheer power to think. 
Standards and Grading.—The settlement of the grammar 
question will leave behind the question of when a pupil is 
up to grade. At present nobody knows. The startling 
variations which will result from the attempt of any group of 
teachers to mark any set of pupils’ papers are now familiar 
to everybody [28]. A beginning of scale-making has been 
made, but the pioneer attempts leave much to be desired 
[2; 21; 24; 28; 38]. The important fact is that a method of 
arriving at a scale has been suggested, and during the next 
decade we may expect to see the practice of local conferences
-P-A-G-E-161
  COMPOSITION 125 
of teachers and local scale-making become common. All the 
teachers of a school should know by what standards the work 
of pupils is to be judged, and should mark papers with con- 
scious educational purposes in view, distinguishing clearly 
between grades for teaching and grades for testing. By 
means of suitable collections of typical compositions, which 
have been filed with comments as to their production and 
respective merits, it will become possible to maintain in a 
school standards for promotion that shall be reasonably free 
from mere individual idiosyncrasy, not to mention temporary 
mood or caprice. As it is, the teacher may only pray to be 
forgiven for the unintentional injustice which she does each 
year when she makes out her pupils’ standings in composition. 
Why Have Composition Classes?—There are those who 
would abolish the teacher of composition. It is, say they, 
not a formal subject at all, but merely incident to other activi- 
ties, in connection with which it should be taught. The 
theory is plausible but the thing has not been done. The 
principal limitation is found in the power of attention, which 
somehow cannot be focussed upon several things at the same 
time. History, it will be granted at once, affords excellent 
opportunity for the organization and expression of ideas. 
In the history class one may teach the outline, the use of the 
full sentence, correct forms of verbs and pronouns, punctua- 
tion, etc., etc. The difficulty is, first, that enthusiasm for 
getting on with history invariably prevents adequate atten- 
tion to these things. If the pupils know them, they may 
be required to use them, but never will it happen that time for 
teaching them adequately will—or should—be taken in the 
midst of an absorbing historical thought movement. Be- 
sides, history is only one phase of intellectual interest; there 
are dozens more. Many of these fall quite outside all organ- 
ized school subjects. Composition alone is fitted to give 
opportunity for the expression of the whole range of one’s 
interests, to say nothing of its limitless possibilities for broad- 
ening that range. , And lastly, while the body of composition
-P-A-G-E-162
  126 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
technic of which elementary pupils should have a system- 
atic knowledge is relatively small, there is such a body, 
and it will never be ordered into a working system by means 
of incidental treatment in connection with the various school 
subjects. These subjects offer rather the opportunity for 
using and fixing as habit the conscious knowledge of technic 
which the class in composition has developed. This they 
must on no account fail to do. 
Vocational Guidance and Composition.—Enormous possi- 
bilities for training in expression appear in a subject which 
at present lies partly within and partly without the field of 
English Composition. This is the subject of vocational 
guidance or vocational outlook. With the raising of the 
compulsory age limit of school attendance, the school has 
been confronted more and more with the problem of assist- 
ing young people to find and prepare themselves for a suitable 
calling. Here is an opportunity, obviously, for extensive 
investigation. There are numerous occupations; they have 
their peculiar requirements and their unique possibilities. 
Few can claim acquaintance with many of them. Which is 
selected by a given individual is largely accidental. Few per- 
sons are definitely trained for a specific occupation until mature 
years, except as they leave school and take apprenticeship or 
employment in the humblest duties of the occupation. 
Those aware of these facts and impressed with the duty 
of providing counsel, hit upon composition as the most avail- 
able instrument. In the schools of Grand Rapids, Mich., 
more fully it appears than elsewhere, studies of vocations are 
carried on, and here composition has drawn most fully upon 
such studies for its material [15; 16; 42]. The various occupa- 
tions to be found in the community are surveyed and re- 
ported by the pupils themselves, who learn something of the 
values of each. The lives of successful persons are read and 
reviewed. The pupil’s own experiences as a worker are re- 
counted. And not least of all, first-hand studies are made 
to determine the value of education to those who earn their

living and attempt to render service to the community 
[15; 16; qr]. 
Such activities, with parallel studies in community civics 
and in the life of plants and animals, furnish the raw material 
and occasion of expression in the vocabulary and in the 
manner of common life. Coupled with the reading of liter- 
ature and the making of stories, poems, and plays for the 
satisfaction of the emotional and esthetic life, they may 
serve to round out and give balance to a course in composi- 
tion which is dynamic and fruitful because it is the expres- 
sion of the child himself [33]. 
SUMMARY 
1. Composition is a fundamental social activity, not merely a formal 
study. It is complex in nature, expression in speech or writing 
constituting only one of the processes involved. Its value, 
therefore, is very great; no other study is so well adapted to 
many-sided training of mind and body. 
2. Method in composition should be deduced from actual social prac- 
tices and psychological experiment. The first step is to make 
sure of a motive to expression. Time for the development and 
organization of ideas must be allowed. The pupil should revise 
his own work. Class criticism is more effective than the teach- 
er’s criticism. Help the individual. 
3. The course of study should define purposes of communication and 
fields of subject-matter rather than facts and principles of theory. 
Technic should be only the handmaid of expression, not the 
dictator of it. Models should consist mainly of good but not 
exalted specimens of writing done by contemporaries, and should 
follow rather than precede the attempts of the children to carry 
out similar purposes. 
4. Grammar should be regarded as a part of the composition course, 
and only the topics really useful should be included. The ac- 
curacy of grading will be greatly increased, it is believed, by the 
development of scales made up of samples of composition. 
Classes in composition will always be necessary, as in the case 
of other arts. Topics for such classes should, moreover, have 
definite informational or literary value, as in the case of the 
study of vocations,

  128 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
1. Examine several courses of study for the elementary school in 
order to discover what conception of the nature and value of 
composition each embodies. 
2. Examine several text-books in the same way. 
. Learn, if possible, how well-known writers practise their art. 
4. Classify the possible subjects for oral and written composition by 
children, and write out ten topics with as much variety as possi- 
ble under each class. 
5. Select a general subject—outdoor sports, for example—and limit 
it so as to secure a definite topic capable of being treated from a 
specific point of view. State the point of view in a full sen- 
tence. , 
6. Trace from the first grade to the eighth, the possibility of teaching 
the use of the outline, writing two examples for each grade. 
7. Select six models of different kinds of writing for a certain grade 
and write a comment on each, setting forth its merits and its 
possibilities for class use. 
8. If possible, secure a set of children’s compositions substantially 
alike in main purpose, and grade them on the scale of a hundred, 
deciding beforehand how you will apportion credit for thought, 
structure, treatment, and mechanical correctness. Then com- 
pare your grades with those of several other persons and con- 
struct a table of averages.

CHAPTER VI 
GRAMMAR 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
. What are some opinions regarding the teaching of grammar in the 
grades which you have recently heard expressed? What con- 
ditions make an opinion in such a matter valuable? 
What percentage of school systems require grammar to be taught 
in the elementary schools? 
3- What proportion of children who study grammar in the grades go 
on to a study of rhetoric and foreign language? 
4. Can you give concrete examples, from your own experience or ob- 
servation, of help in expression through the knowledge of gram- 
mar? 
. According to your observation, how thoroughly are the grammat- 
ical facts in the course of study mastered by the children? By 
the teacher? 
6. At what point in the grades, if at any, should the classification of 
grammatical facts begin? 
What are some differences in methods to be used in teaching a sci- 
ence and an art? To what extent should children be taught how 
and why they are to do certain things in such a subject as music, 
drawing, or composition work? To what extent should their 
work in any art be spontaneous? Imitative? Deductive?

I. Tue PRESENT STANDING OF GRAMMAR 
The subject called grammar differs so greatly in different 
schools that any discussion should begin with a definition. 
In this chapter, grammar is understood in its accepted sense 
as denoting the science of language. Modern English gram- 
mar, then, is the orderly arrangement and classification of the 
132
-P-A-G-E-171
  GRAMMAR 133 
present facts of the English language. The definition im- 
mediately suggests the insistent questions that are pro- 
pounded by the modern scientific spirit in education: Has 
this science of language any place in the elementary school? 
If so, what place? Every intelligent teacher should be aware 
of these questions, and of the attempts that have been made 
to answer them. Thousands of teachers are required to 
teach grammar. It is important for them to understand its 
present place in the school and, if possible, how to make time 
spent on it worth while. 
The chief reasons given for keeping grammar in the ele- 
mentary curriculum, aside from a mere deference to tradi- 
tion, have been: (1) That it contributes more than any- 
thing which can be put into its place to the aims of education; 
(2) that it is in itself an interesting and useful study for 
children; (3) that it provides a necessary, or at least a de- 
sirable, preparation for the study of rhetoric and foreign lan- 
guages; (4) that it contributes to a mastery of the art of 
speaking and writing correctly; (5) that it introduces chil- 
dren to the methods of scientific thinking, using material 
familiar from babyhood. Two other claims sometimes 
made—that grammar is helpful in the study of literature, 
and that its terminology is indispensable—may be dis- 
missed with the stating. 
With regard to the first and second reasons there is at 
present very little difference of opinion: the mere facts of 
grammar are mot of sufficient interest and usefulness to the 
majority of children to justify their being taught in the ele- 
mentary school. The third reason is valid for the minority 
of pupils who are to study rhetoric and foreign languages; 
therefore this reason alone would justify a fairly thorough 
course of the right kind for such children in places where a 
goodly proportion of pupils continue their education beyond 
the eighth grade. Certainly this important minority should 
not be overlooked in planning a course of study. Some con- 
sideration of their interests is likely to result from the present 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  134 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
movement for a better articulation between the elementary 
and the high school courses in English, the one subject con- 
tinuous throughout the twelve years. The movement for 
the unification of grammatical nomenclature also has regard 
chiefly to the ever-increasing army of high school and college 
students. But in a large system of schools the course must 
be planned for the greatest good of the greatest number, 
perhaps subject to modification for special localities. Since 
the great majority of children never go beyond the eighth 
grade, the only reasons that can be valid to give grammar a 
place in the course of study are the last two: its usefulness 
for training either in logical thinking or in practical mastery 
of the language. 
Claims Challenged.—These two claims have recently been 
challenged by students of education, with interesting results. 
First, there are those who, reasoning either a priori or from 
observation, declare that training in logical thinking in one 
field will not lead to logical thinking in another field; that the 
field of language facts is too remote from life to be important 
to children; that logical thinking in that field is beyond the 
power of children anyway; and that the practical results of 
the study of grammar are not discernible in oral or written 
language work. Then there are other students of education 
who, believing that a priori reasoning on such matters is 
futile, have set themselves to test these last claims of grammar 
by experiment. Supt. Franklin S. Hoyt, experimenting with 
two hundred pupils entering an Indianapolis high school 
from practically every grammar school in the city, found that 
the influence of the scientific grammar taught in that city 
was approximately zero as applied to composition work and 
the interpretation of language. The results of this experi- 
ment were corroborated by Doctor L. W. Rapeer’s tests con- 
ducted in 1906 with two hundred Minneapolis pupils. More 
recently, Professor Thomas H. Briggs, of Columbia, in a series 
of ingenious experiments has investigated the effect of scien- 
tific grammar upon thinking ability, He discovered that 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
GRAMMAR 135 
the measurable improvement of the children in logical think- 
ing was approximately zero. 
If the evidence of these experiments be accepted as final 
proof, it would appear that scientific grammar, as such, has 
no place in the elementary school, except where a large pro- 
portion of the pupils go on to high school. It should be re- 
membered, however, that the experimenters themselves do not 
claim to have proved positively that grammar, even as now 
taught, is entirely valueless for elementary school children; 
they claim only that their experiments tend to show this. 
In a matter of values so extremely complicated, a very large 
number of experiments would be requisite to a sound conclu- 
sion, as any scientist will affirm. Still less have these experi- 
ments proved that grammar as it might be taught could not 
train pupils to think logically about spoken and written words 
at least, or give them some tools of general use in scientific 
thinking, or improve their oral and written English. As to 
whether the most carefully selected and arranged course in 
grammar, well taught, can be made to do so, and to do so in 
a sufficiently high degree to deserve a place in the crowded 
curriculum of the elementary school, only further careful 
study can determine. It is very doubtful whether such a 
question is capable of being answered positively and finally 
and for all cases now, but a sincere attempt to get at the 
truth cannot fail to bring better results than those at present 
attained in the schools. 
The Emergency.—Meanwhile, with a full course in the 
subject required in many schools, at least in the two upper 
grades, the teachers are facing the practical problems of what 
to teach, and how to teach it. If there is such a thing as a 
course of study in grammar, or a method of teaching it that 
will help to train the pupils in logical thinking, and more 
especially to give them a mastery of good English, what is 
it? Every teacher of English in the grades should consider

herself an investigator into the possibilities of teaching the 
right facts of grammar in the right way to make them practical. 
Il. Tse Course or Stupy 
Governing Principles.—The outline of an ideal course of 
study in this disputed territory is not within the province of 
this chapter; and indeed, as has already been implied, such 
an outline is still to be discovered. Moreover, most teach- 
ers are powerless in choosing a course; they may only modify 
to some extent, according to circumstances, a course laid 
down for them. Since, however, they may usually emphasize 
important matters at their discretion, they may find useful 
some general principles which must determine the course of 
study, and some specific suggestions. The subject must be 
taught in many schools, and we should as teachers make it 
contribute as much as possible to the aims of education. 
x. Since it is evident that not all the facts with regard to 
the grammar of modern English can be or should be taught 
in the elementary school, only those facts should be chosen 
which are (a) important to a clear understanding of sentence 
structure, (b) useful, (c) comprehensible to the children. 
2. In the lower grades every effort should be made to 
correct grammatical errors and to fix right forms by imita- 
tion and drill, with little or no attempt at explanation of 
reasons or at classification of errors. The important point 
is to make the right form sound right and the wrong form 
sound wrong. 
3. A few forms should be assigned to each grade for mas- 
tery. Nearly all English teachers attempt to do too many 
different kinds of things and fail to give thorough drill on a 
few elementary forms. A careful study of prevalent gram- 
matical mistakes should be made for each locality, and the 
few most common errors should be carefully distributed for 
correction in the several grades. A pupil in the sixth grade, 
then, should be held rigidly to account for forms supposedly 
mastered in the five preceding grades, and so on.
-P-A-G-E-175
  GRAMMAR 137 
4. Since imitation and drill on a few forms are often in- 
sufficient to overcome the handicap of a pupil’s home influ- 
ences, reasons, explanations, classification, and rules, should 
be given to the older pupils; that is, scientific grammar used 
as a tool should help to govern practice when pupils are old 
enough to understand it. 
5. Scientific grammar should be truly scientific as far as it 
goes. That is, no fact should be taught until it can be taught 
truly and in sufficient relation to needs of expression to mean 
something. ‘| j 
6. Children below the seventh grade as a rule are not 
sufficiently mature to deal with language facts scientifically, 
without unwise expenditure of time. All the necessary 
grammar can be taught in one year, or even in part of a year; 
but since this grammar should be closely and constantly re- 
lated to the composition work, it is better to distribute it 
over the seventh and eighth, or, in the intermediate or junior 
high schools, the seventh, eighth, and ninth years. 
7. In explaining the phenomena of the English language 
there is a logical order of procedure from basic facts to those 
that depend upon them, an order which cannot be changed 
without some sacrifice of clear understanding. While seem- 
ing to grow out of the composition work, the study of gram- 
matical facts should perhaps be planned to progress from 
fundamental ideas to those that are built upon them. Yet 
development in language should not be subordinated to the 
sequence of the science. 
8. Since in an analytic language like English the impor- 
tance of the sentence to the meaning of the word can hardly 
be exaggerated, the sentence as the unit of thought is the 
unit in any scientific study of such a language. 
9. To be of practical value, any study must be thorough. 
Therefore, since there is not time for all the facts, it is best 
to dwell at length on the larger facts of sentence structure, 
ignoring minutiz. 
~ ro. No fact need be taught that has not some direct bear-
-P-A-G-E-176
  138 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ing on the use of good English. Too often, however, it seems 
to be assumed that the only practical grammar has to do with 
the forms of words, and that the only test of its efficiency is 
its influence on correctness of oral speech. All knowledge that 
may be applied to the construction of good sentences, to proper 
punctuation, as well as to the choice of right forms of words, 
and that does not crowd out more valuable knowledge, is 
practical. 
11. The study of the parts of speech as such may well be 
limited to such facts as have to do with the choice of right 
forms. If this plan is followed, complete parsing will gener- 
ally be found as impossible as it is unnecessary. 
12. For those who are interested and who have some 
feeling for the integrity of subject-matter, and for all those 
who expect to teach, there should be provided somewhere in 
the high school a thorough elective course, to which the chil- 
dren can be referred when they question the gaps in their 
knowledge. 
Specific Suggestions.—Some teachers may like to see listed 
the most practical material of grammar, together with spe- 
cific applications to the language and composition work. 
They should remember, however, that none of it is likely to 
be practical unless it is made so by constant application of 
knowledge to practice. Children do not usually apply the 
general to the particular, the knowing to the doing, unless 
they are taught and required to do so. 
Sentence Analysis.—Of the matter usually included under 
sentence analysis, everything is practical that helps to de- 
velop the sentence feeling, the grasp of essential elements, 
the recognition of subject and predicate, and of predication 
or assertion as such. This last notion is necessary to the cor- 
rection of errors caused by confusion between the past tense 
of the verb and the past participle, which can never assert. 
In a study of the grammatical errors made by Kansas City 
school children, Professor Charters of the University of Mis- 
souri found that 1,426, or 24 per cent of the total errors re-
-P-A-G-E-177
  GRAMMAR 139 
ported in oral English, were made by the confusion of these 
two forms. Complete predication is what distinguishes a 
sentence from a phrase or clause. When sentence-sense be- 
gins to be achieved it should be turned to account in a final 
assault on the comma blunder, and its opposite, the ampu- 
tated phrase or clause. Mr. Charters found that 30 per cent 
of the errors in written work, 3,600 all told, consisted in the 
failure to put a period at the end of a sentence. No pupil 
should be permitted to enter business or high school making 
this mistake in his writing. 
Pronouns, Possessives, and Appositives.—When pronouns 
are first considered, some matters pertaining to clear refer- 
ence of pronouns to their antecedents and afterward, at 
least in written work, every pronoun whose antecedent is not 
immediately clear should be challenged. Jé and this and 
which are peculiarly liable to obscure or weak reference. 
Possessive modifiers and appositives are obviously practical. 
Perhaps no simple and well-known rule of punctuation is 
more frequently violated than the one that concerns the use 
of the apostrophe with the genitive, or possessive, of nouns, 
and its omission from the corresponding pronoun forms. 
The rules for these cases and for the comma with appositive 
words and phrases have probably been taught long before 
the seventh grade; but if, as is likely, the application of these 
tules has not been made habitual with the pupils, the new 
emphasis that comes from meeting the constructions in gram- 
mar may be utilized to give purpose to thorough drill. It 
should be noted that the Kansas City study brought to light 
the fact that children use the appositive scarcely at all, and 
hence made scarcely any mistakes in punctuating it. For 
this reason it is struck out of the course, by those who made 
the study. However, it is a useful construction; and it would 
seem better, perhaps, to teach the children to use it in 
their written work correctly, to avoid wordiness in many 
sentences. Older pupils do use it, and fail to punctuate it 
correctly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  I40 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Clauses.—The study of clauses has important practical 
bearings. When adjective and adverb clauses are first met, 
their recognition should lead to freer use in compositions, 
driving out some of the stringy compound sentences of child- 
ish writing. As they are taken up in greater detail, one of 
the most important and difficult of distinctions should by 
all means be insisted upon—that between restrictive and non- 
restrictive modifiers. When this is thoroughly understood, 
it can be applied in punctuation. The discussion of noun 
clauses gives opportunity for new drill on the punctuation of 
direct and indirect quotations. Of adverb clauses it is the 
meanings that are important. The relations of if and though 
clauses—that is, the real notions of concession and condition 
—are almost new to many children. Again, and more specif- 
ically than at first, the study should lead to freer use of 
clauses, to the occasional substitution of though for but, to 
the more definite expression of relations. Eighth-grade chil- 
dren can be interested and profited by such application of 
their grammatical knowledge, if they really have the knowl- 
edge. The right use of as and as if as clause connectives, 
instead of like, which should never introduce a clause, may 
well be emphasized at this point; and until instead of before 
may be given some attention in places where it is misused. 
There is no reason, either, why the subordination of the 
truly subordinate should not be insisted upon; any eighth- 
grade child is capable of understanding that to say, for ex- 
ample: “I was walking down the street when I saw an auto- 
mobile accident” gives a false emphasis to the less important 
idea. The placing of subordinate clauses for coherence and 
emphasis is well within their grasp, though the abstract 
rhetorical terms need not be used. 
Practical material in the study of the parts of speech is 
chiefly: correct plurals; capitals for proper nouns; the pos- 
sessive case; case forms of pronouns for subject, predicate 
attribute, object, and object of a preposition; matters of 
agreement; choice of adjectives and adverbs; matters of
-P-A-G-E-179
GRAMMAR IAI 
tense; choice between past participle and past tense; choice 
between transitive and intransitive verb forms (e. g., lie and 
lay); principal parts and conjugation of certain verbs (attach, 
ask, drag, drown, among those perfectly regular); correct for- 
mation of certain verb phrases (e. g., must have gone instead 
of must of went); right uses of the passive voice; and, per- 
haps, proper grammatical and logical subjects of verbals, 
the genitive with gerunds especially.t 
Throughout the study, after compound elements are in- 
troduced, there should be much drill upon proper subordina- 
tion and co-ordination, the proper junction of verb with verb, 
subject with subject, phrase with phrase, clause with clause, 
sentence with sentence. If children have been taught to 
write freely and sincerely in the first six grades, they may 
well begin to take thought for the structure of their sentences 
more consciously in the work of the last two years; and if 
they are taught to keep their attention primarily on the 
thought to be conveyed and on the reader to whom they 
are conveying it, and to consider sentence structure only in 
revision, they need not sacrifice sincerity and spontaneity to 
correctness and effectiveness. 
The teacher who has well in mind the whole list of prac- 
tical applications for the year’s course can collect in advance 
abundant material for drill from the children’s own speech 
and writing. An example of a comma blunder, a mistaken. 
verb form, an adjective for an adverb, or some other error 
from the children’s work may well serve to introduce a careful 
study of each point in grammar. The grammatical knowledge 
once given, must be tested and applied in special exercises, 
and then carried over into original language and composition 
work, oral or written, or both. Perhaps it may not be out 
of place at this point to remark that the same kind of English 
should be required in all classes as is required in the English

class. All oral or written expression in school should be part 
of the course of study in English. 
III. Tse Tracuinc oF GRAMMAR 
The consideration of the application of grammar to com- 
position work has led us inevitably from the course of study 
to methods of teaching, since the choice of material depends 
very much on the use that is to be made of that material. 
Some more specific consideration of the teaching of this sub- 
ject-matter is next in order. 
1. Requisites for Teaching.—Of course a sensible plan of 
campaign is the first requisite for successful teaching. Next, 
in grammar, as in every subject, comes a thorough equipment 
of the teacher. For the teacher of grammar in the upper 
grades this will include real scholarship in the field—that is, 
more than a mastery of the particular text to be taught or 
of any elementary text, at least a passing acquaintance with 
the real scholars in English grammar; it will include also a 
competent grasp of the elementary principles of rhetoric and, 
for best results, the knowledge of at least one other language. 
Besides these attainments, the teacher must have a sense of 
proportionate values and needs, along with a clear realization 
of how much the pupils already have. She must be a student 
of her pupils’ language habits. Imagination, an asset not 
usually included as necessary to grammar-teaching, is indis- 
pensable if we are to avoid ‘‘make-believe grammar,”! if 
words and sentences are to be what they are in real life, and 
not mere dried specimens. It is also needed here, as in any 
field, to illuminate a pupil’s state of mind, and thus enable 
the teacher to forestall difficulties. Skill in questioning and 
ingenuity in devices both for presentation and for drill are 
in no subject more valuable. 
2. Aim and Point of View.—The general aim in the teach- 
ing of grammar is easily deducible from what has already 
been said. The purpose of whatever training in grammar is 
1See Bibliography.  
-P-A-G-E-181
GRAMMAR 143 
given in the lower grades is to make the right forms habitual. 
The purpose of teaching English grammar in the upper grades 
in a more systematic way is to supplement such training by 
giving a thorough knowledge of such facts of the English lan- 
guage as apply to its intelligent use, and to teach these in such 
a way as to train the pupil in logical thinking, in so far as any 
systematic study can train him. Since language is the ex- 
pression of thought, and especially since the English lan- 
guage is almost without inflection, there is no escape from 
thinking as the basis of all study of this language. The out- 
cry against teaching logic in the elementary schools is liable 
to misinterpretation by many teachers. How much of the 
science of logic would a logician find in any widely used 
grammar? If the outcry means that sentences should be 
taught without reference to the thoughts they express—that 
is, to their meaning—it is palpably absurd. Consideration 
of English sentences is a consideration of meaning; and any 
other point of view will make the study of grammar merely 
mechanical, and therefore most useless and impractical. 
Real insight is necessary if a bit of knowledge is to be ap- 
plied. The teacher’s aim should be to give this insight, and 
then to take and to make opportunities for its use.t 
The specific aim will thus differ with different lessons. 
In the lower grades, and in the same sort of work continued, 
as it should be, in the upper grades, the aim will be to im- 
press the fact that one form in common use is wrong and 
another right, and so to fix the right form through repetition 
that it will at length be chosen unconsciously. In the upper 
grades, when presenting a new bit of grammatical knowledge, 
the teacher will ignore all future applications to concentrate 
on the clearest possible first impression of the fact itself. 
In first testing the pupil’s knowledge after such a fact has 
been presented, the aim will be to examine this first impres- 
sion and correct it if necessary. A drill lesson in grammar 
1See the chapter on “ Language and the Training of Thought” in Dewey’s 
“How We Think.”
-P-A-G-E-182
  I44 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
will be designed to fix this impression. A lesson applying the 
grammatica! knowledge to use will test the knowledge in the 
most thorough way. Its aim will be to fix good habits, and 
to root out bad by applying reason first and then by repeti- 
tion. The final test and training is, of course, in the com- 
position lessons, with which this chapter is not concerned. 
3- Motives.—If{ the course of study is sensible, the teach-' 
er’s equipment adequate, and the aim and point of view 
tight, the question of motive will, for the majority of pupils, 
take care of itself. Perhaps hardly anything so stimulates 
effort as the sense of progress. Children in the seventh 
grade are susceptible to this feeling, and are quick to lose 
interest if their work appears to them haphazard and purpose- 
less. To them no remote end is half so real as the immediate 
next step. The constant and systematic working up of 
grammar in making reasonable the corrections of practice 
will give a further and perhaps more vital motive. This will 
be true only if the children are held strictly accountable for 
facts once taught and drilled upon. For example, after the 
comma blunder has been thoroughly aired in the seventh 
grade, no finished paper in any subject should be accepted if 
it contains this error. It is human nature to take no more 
pains than the occasion requires. Grading should be just, 
uniform, yet increasingly severe, if effort is to be steady and 
increasingly fruitful. Children who are not susceptible to 
the motives of immediate interest, the sense of increasing 
mastery, of evident need, or to the stimulus of grades, must, 
of course, be penalized in some way—by detention or other- 
wise. 
4. Methods—(a) General Suggestions —Methods are merely 
ways and means of teaching. The most important general 
principle of grammar-teaching is that the pupils must by all 
means be made to think of meanings, to discriminate like- 
nesses and differences, and not merely to memorize definitions 
and rules. For the purpose of this scientific study all kinds 
of specimens are readily available. These the pupil must
-P-A-G-E-183
GRAMMAR 145 
‘learn to examine and classify. For authority, step by step, 
he must learn to look into his own mind, not to a teacher, a 
dictionary, or any other guide. For each new step in anal- 
ysis the inductive method is therefore the best.!_ For all drill 
and habit-forming, the problem of method is to make repeti- 
tion and memory work constantly fresh and interesting with 
skilful devices. It is evident, then, that the teacher must 
adapt means to end, must have no stereotyped procedures— 
not Method, but methods. She must learn to keep still and 
let the pupil think when confronted with problematic matters 
for thought, but to exact instant response when the pupil is 
supposedly reciting from memory. She must learn to em- 
phasize different material for different classes. For an eighth 
grade that has slipped through all the years without learning 
to write a decent business or personal letter to spend its time 
discussing the analysis of an interestingly idiomatic sentence 
like: “A few years ago men were a month travelling a thou- 
sand miles,” is the height of folly; whereas another eighth 
grade, well ready for high school, might possibly be al- 
lowed to amuse itself and to test its insight with such a 
puzzle. 
(0) Some Kinds of Lessons—Outlines of various kinds 
of lessons may prove suggestive. It will be observed that 
what the teacher must do is always to see clearly the exact 
purpose of the lesson, the relation of this to previous lessons, 
and the probable difficulties. All the lessons outlined below 
bear more or less directly upon the same grammatical fact, 
and one that is fundamental. The lessons, as will be seen, 
are not consecutive. The first lesson should be followed by 
one on transitive verbs, and another on the direct object be- 
fore the second is given. The examples in Lesson II are 
rather difficult, and may be simplified for inferior classes. 
Its only practical bearing is to sharpen the notion of transi- 
tive. The fourth lesson cannot be taught as given until 
1 See chapters on inductive and deductive lessons in Strayer’s “The Teach- 
ing Process,” also Chap. 7 in his ‘‘ How to Teach.”
-P-A-G-E-184
  146 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
principal parts of verbs and old and new conjugations have 
been discussed, but it may be modified to follow Lesson III 
directly. 
Lesson I. Inductive 
Special Aim.—To give the class a true first impression of 
the meaning of transitive. If attention is centered not on 
the transitive idea expressed by the verb but on the word fol- 
lowing the verb—the object—classification will be haphazard 
and mechanical. Such verbs as walked and cost in “He walked 
a mile,” “The book cost a dollar,” will be felt as transitive. 
In presenting the idea of transitiveness it is best to use verbs 
in which the children do not make mistakes in form, in order 
to avoid confusion. Attention should here be fixed on the 
meaning, entirely without regard to words as parts of speech. 
Basis Assumed.—An understanding of the sentence, 
subject and predicate, and verb. 
Presentation.—(The idea to be presented is so new that 
it may be attacked without preliminary review.) 
Teacher: We have often talked about actions, and about predi- 
cates (or verbs) that express action. To-day we need to discover two 
different kinds of action. Jimmy (to an unsuspecting and rather 
slow pupil), stand. (Jimmy stands, automatically.) Tear. (Jimmy 
looks blank; perhaps says something about a verb. The teacher 
quietly insists.) No, why don’t you do as I say—tear. (Jimmy 
probably still stares blankly, while perhaps half the rest of the class 
begin to beam.) 
Teacher (still quietly insisting): Jimmy, I told you to tear. 
Jimmy (finally): I haven’t got anything to tear. 
Teacher (ignoring the got in the exigency of the moment): Somebody 
give him something. (A neighbor hands him a piece of paper.) Now, 
Jimmy, tear the paper. Why did you hesitate when I told you to 
tear? Why didn’t you hesitate when I told you to stand? (From 
Jimmy and others in the class several statements, as clear as possible 
in answer to these questions.) What other acts can you put into the 
same class with standing, acts that involve nothing but the actor? 
(Writes standing on the board, and under it sitting, walking, running, 
crying, etc., as the class suggest them. If some have not seemed to 
get the point, some of the acts are actually performed.) What other
-P-A-G-E-185
  
GRAMMAR 147 
acts can you class with tearing, acts involving something besides the 
actor? (Note.—Caution is needed here, since many acts, writing, 
reading, etc., may be thought of either as transitive or as intransitive. 
For the moment, if suggested, they may be accepted in the transitive 
sense, unless some bright pupil objects; then they may be entered in 
both columns. A list is made as before.) How many see clearly 
that some acts involve merely an actor while others involve also some- 
thing besides the actor? The first are called intransitive, the sec- 
ond transitive. (Writes words above lists on the board.) 
Who can define a transitive act? Julia, Mary, Richard, Ola, 
class. What now are the two kinds of acts? How would you define 
an intransitive act? Give me some sentences asserting transitive 
acts of some boy, or man, or dog. Some sentences asserting intransi- 
tive acts. (Note.—If the recitation period is long enough, the classi- 
fication of verbs as transitive or intransitive may follow immediately, 
based upon easy sentences in the text or on the board. Otherwise 
this topic may be taken up at the next recitation. The conception of 
what is meant by action must be made very broad to cover mental 
acts, as well as owning and owing, etc.) 
Assignment.—Write to hand in ten sentences expressing transitive 
acts and ten expressing intransitive acts. Underline the words ex- 
pressing these acts. See if you can make a good definition of a transi- 
tive verb. 
Lesson II. Deductive 
Special Aim.—To test the pupils’ understanding of tran- 
sitive verbs by applying their definitions to fairly difficult 
examples. 
Basis Assumed.—Thorough mastery of definition of tran- 
sitive verb worked out by induction; understanding of the 
object of a transitive verb. 
Preparation.—Review of definitions. Rapid oral classi- 
fication of easy verbs in: 
. The children found a lame puppy. 
. He walked to town. 
. Nobody saw the culprit. 
. Still water runs deep. 
. We planted sweet peas in March. 
. The new boy sits at our table.

Teacher: Read the sentence, name the verb, classify it as transi- 
tive or intransitive, telling why in each case. If the verb is transitive, 
name the actor and the other thing involved besides the actor. John, 
Susan, etc. 
(The children make topical recitations, without further questions 
or repetitions of directions. Mistakes are corrected by classmates 
as far as possible. Free discussion is encouraged.) 
Assignment.—Write to hand in ten sentences using the verbs grow, 
become, pass, write, and think first transitively and then intransitively. 
Underline each object. 
Lesson III. Drill 
Special Aim.—To make the classification of verbs as tran- 
sitive and intransitive rapid and accurate. 
Basis Assumed.—As above. 
Preparation.—Define a transitive verb, an intransitive 
verb. The object. 
Presentation.—T wenty sentences on the board, either easy 
or more difficult ones, that have been discussed before. 
Teacher: Read the sentence and classify the verb, saying: “The 
verb—is transitive” (or intransitive)—nothing more. Julia, Sarah,

etc., very quickly. (Papers prepared by the children and brought to 
class, based upon this assignment: “Make or find fifteen sentences 
in which the verbs are just hard enough and not too hard for this class 
now. Be sure you know how to classify them yourself.”) John, read 
a sentence and call on some one to classify the verb. If he does this 
promptly and correctly, he may read a sentence and call on some 
one else; if not, you have another turn, and so on. 
When this begins to lag, the papers are collected and the teacher 
reads carefully chosen sentences, not previously assigned, to the class, 
who are provided with slips of paper. As each sentence is read, each 
pupil puts down in columns on his slip the number of the sentence, 
the verb, and its classification (transitive or intransitive) only. Slips 
are exchanged for correction, and the sentences read again with the 
correct classification, pupils checking mistakes. The slips are then 
collected. 
(Note.—Here three different devices are suggested for one lesson. 
Usually, however, the drill lessons should be shorter, and should pref- 
ace the introduction of a new topic.) 
Assignment.—A written test (or an entirely different topic). 
Lesson IV. Application, Deductive and Drill* 
Special Aim.—To apply the knowledge of transitive verbs 
and of old and new conjugation to the choice between the 
-forms of lie and lay. 
Basis Assumed.—A knowledge of transitive and intransi- 
tive, and of the principal parts of the two verbs. 
Preparation.—Give me the principal parts of lie, of lay. 
Give all the forms of each. Which has no d anywhere? 
Which is transitive? Why are these two verbs more con- 
fusing than any others in the language? (Because the past 
tense of lie is the same as the present tense of lay—except the 
form Jays.) What does each verb mean? 
Presentation.—Fifteen or twenty sentences, on the board 
or on papers, or in the text, requiring forms of /ée to fill blanks 
—including the present participle in various uses. Teacher: 
Read the sentence, filling the blank correctly. Then give all 
1Jt will be noticed that the movement of this series of four lessons is largely 
inductive up to the understanding and definition of transitive and intransitive 
verbs, and largely deductive afterward.

the parts—lie, lies, lying, lay, lain—each time. (Fifteen or 
twenty sentences requiring forms of Jay.) Teacher: Read 
the sentence, filling the blank correctly, and give all the 
parts. Show why the verb is transitive. (Fifteen or twenty 
sentences requiring a choice from forms of lie or lay.) Teacher: 
Read the sentence correctly and justify your choice. Teacher: 
Give me now a synopsis of Jie in the third person singular, 
adding an appropriate phrase of place. Give a synopsis of 
Jay in the third person singular, using an appropriate object 
(e. g., I lay the carpet, etc.). 
Teacher: Answer my statement with a corresponding one for the 
other verb. “TI laid the carpet.” 
Pupil: I lay on the grass. 
Teacher: I was laying the carpet. 
Pupil: I was lying on the grass, etc., etc. 
Assignment.—Write to read in class twenty sensible and not too 
short sentences, using forms of lie and lay. Be ready to analyze each. 
Use especially lying, laying, and lain. 
(c). Use of Analysis and Diagramming. —A discussion of 
grammar methods would be incomplete without some con- 
sideration of various kinds of analysis and diagramming. Any 
form of analysis is good that emphasizes the principal facts 
about a sentence, and that insures a logical order of thinking 
them out. Any form of analysis is bad that calls attention 
to the form itself, away from the facts about the sentence. 
Both oral and written analysis should be used. The complete, 
coherent analysis of a sentence, either orally or in a written 
paragraph, may be made an admirable exercise in composition. 
Such clear statement in connected English sentences should 
never be crowded out by shorthand forms or diagrams; yet 
it is not invariably necessary or desirable. A quick and 
certain grasp of the essential elements of the sentence is 
the most important attainment for the children; and there- 
fore they should have much rapid drill in finding these with- 
out regard to anything else. In many sentences only one or 
two grammatical relations are of interest, and the rest may
-P-A-G-E-189
GRAMMAR I5I 
be taken for granted. As has been already remarked, co- 
ordination and subordination of members should be drilled 
upon until either is quickly recognized. 
A Code.—Some code for numbering essential elements 
and underlining (or overlining) modifiers may be devised for 
rapid shorthand analysis. The tabular form originated by 
Sir Joshua Fitch! is familiar to most teachers. Two speci- 
mens of these quick forms are given below, the first suitable 
for long sentences with clause and phrase adjuncts; the 
second (Fitch’s), most useful for shorter sentences. These 
forms differ from diagramming in being less mechanical and in 
keeping the words in their natural order, and the first is 
especially useful in exhibiting to the eye the relation of clauses 
and phrases.

The forms of diagramming are too numerous and too familiar to be 
illustrated here. If diagramming is used at all, it should be some very 
simple system that cannot become a mere exercise in drawing; and it 
should never drive out other methods of analysis. 
(d). The Use of Definitions —The place of definitions in 
the teaching of grammar is an important one. In this day 
it is probably unnecessary to remark that definitions should 
not be memorized if they are not understood. It may not 
be so unnecessary to insist that definitions should be memo- 
rized when they ave understood. Moreover a definition should 
be as accurate and at the same time as simple as the facts 
permit. An untrue definition vitiates the whole understand- 
ing of the fact; and if the pupil is not prepared to grasp a true 
definition he is not prepared to study the subject under dis- 
cussion. The old practice of teaching, for example, some- 
where about the fourth grade, that “a verb is an action word ” 
is fortunately no longer prevalent. A definition should be, 
what the word implies, a true boundary between classes. It 
should be the summing up of the pupil’s knowledge, induc- 
tively developed. 
Seventh and eighth grade pupils are old enough to appre- 
ciate the wording of a clear definition and to attempt such 
clear definitions of their own. They may be asked to define 
a chair, a wagon, and other well-known objects, so that they
-P-A-G-E-191
GRAMMAR 153 
may discover the two things to be accomplished in defining 
—classification and differentiation. They may criticise defi- 
nitions of familiar things, made purposely defective in classi- 
fication or in differentiation. Such training helps them to 
learn understandingly necessary definitions both in grammar 
and in other subjects, and is one of the most helpful contri- 
butions of grammar to the general thinking ability of the 
pupils. 
The definition once learned should be kept ready in mind 
by constant drill, and should be used as a touchstone for 
trying new facts. Of course it is perfectly evident that the 
child with a quick memory may glibly recite words that are 
to him mere syllables, and that no value should be attached 
to such parrot-talk. But the skilful teacher will make the defi- 
nition useful as a test of insight, a summary of observed facts, 
and a key to the right classification and use of further facts. 
5. Nomenclature.—The vexed subject of grammatical 
nomenclature cannot be adequately discussed within the 
limits set for this chapter. Every teacher of grammar should 
procure the bulletin of the National Education Association 
for July, 1913, which contains the report of the joint com- 
mittee on grammatical nomenclature from the National 
Education Association, the Modern Language Association, 
and the American Philological Association, indorsed by the 
committee from the National Council of Teachers of English. 
While the report may seem to grade teachers extremely com- 
plicated, it is to be remembered that only such terms as are 
required are to be used;! that is, whatever 7s taught may be 
taught in terms that are uniform everywhere. The report, 
moreover, is not presented as final, and is especially recom- 
mended to the criticism of teachers in the elementary schools. 
It is to be remarked that these teachers were not directly 
represented on the committees; and that, although this 
movement for uniformity may not touch them in any prac- 
1See the recommendation in the Minnesota Bulletin No. 51, also the Iowa 
teport on needed eliminations.
-P-A-G-E-192
  
154 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tical way until publishers and superintendents begin to act 
upon the recommendations of the committee, nevertheless 
the movement does concern them, and should enlist their 
intelligent criticism in its experimental stage. 
It has been suggested that if grammar is to be taught in 
the elementary school the course of study must be planned 
(x) to emphasize the essentials for understanding; (2) to cor- 
relate very closely with practical language and composition 
work. Then this subject-matter must be taught in such a 
way as to insure logical thinking about it, and to contribute 
as directly as possible to correct and effective use of the 
English language. For the fortunate few who master their 
native tongue unconsciously through daily imitation of good 
English, no such scientific knowledge is needed to bolster up 
their practice. They may get from elementary English gram- 
mar some insight into the laws of language and some help- 
ful data for future study. But for most children in the 
grades, the science of grammar should be not theoretic but 
applied; and to this end it should be—what there is of it— 
truly scientific; not wide but deep. 
SUMMARY 
1. The traditional reasons for teaching grammar in the elementary 
school are no longer sufficient to keep it there; the two most 
important of these—that it trains in logical thinking and that 
it contributes to correct use of English—have been challenged 
by recent experimenters. Hence all teachers of English in the 
grades should test the practical application of grammar to the 
oral and written speech of their pupils, and should not be satis- 
fied with mechanically following a text-book. 
2. The course of study should provide for thorough drill on a few 
troublesome forms in each grade; for constant application of 
grammatical knowledge in composition work; for emphasis of 
only those facts of sentence structure and word forms that can 
be made to contribute to correct and effective speech. 
3. In the upper grades grammatical facts should be presented in a 
logical order from basic facts to those that rest upon them; but 
they should never be divorced from use.
-P-A-G-E-193
GRAMMAR 155 
4. The subject-matter to be included should be determined partly by 
the kinds of mistakes made by children, and partly by the pos- 
sible application of a given grammatical notion to the improve- 
ment of their resources of expression. 
5.. The chief requisites for successful teaching of grammar are a 
sensible plan of campaign and the thorough equipment of the 
teacher. 
J6. The aim in the teaching of grammar is to supplement drill in 
\ good habits with a knowledge of reasons, and to give a ready 
\ recognition of the relations of words. The point of view is al- 
\ ways that language is the expression of thought. 
7. The chief motive of the children should be an increasing sense of 
mastery over their native tongue, as they are made to feel in- 
creasingly the need of such mastery. 
8. The teacher should have not Method but methods, being resource- 
ful in the adaptation of means to ends. In developing a new 
point induction should generally be used; in testing and apply- 
ing the new knowledge deduction is generally necessary. 
g. The most important general principle of grammar-teaching is that 
the pupils must be made to think. 
to, Analysis and diagramming may be made useful if they are simple 
in form, and applied to sentences such as the pupils themselves 
may speak or write. Analysis that shows co-ordination and 
subordination of sentence elements is especially valuable, if not 
carried out in great detail. 
11. Definitions should be accurate and concise; summaries of facts 
learned, and touchstones for questionable usage. 
12. The pupils should be specifically taught how to define, and should 
be led to classify and differentiate for themselves both in gram- 
mar and in other fields. 
13. The vexed question of grammatical nomenclature is not yet set- 
tled; and every teacher should be informed as to the recent 
discussion and decisions with regard to this matter. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
x. Examine two texts in grammar intended for the grades, and com- 
pare them in plan, method of development, definitions, ter- 
minology, variety of exercises, and specific application of gram- 
matical facts to good usage and to composition work. 
2. Take some concise manual of good form in English composition, 
such as Woolley’s ‘‘ Handbook,”-and check every rule for sentence 
structure, usage, punctuation, or spelling that is based on gram-

156 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
matical knowledge. Which of the above rules are important for 
children in the grades? Which are often broken by them? 
3. Make an outline for seventh or eighth year English work, showing 
the proportions of grammar and composition work, the subject- 
matter to be covered, and the correlation of the two kinds of 
material. If Latin, French, or German is to be introduced in the 
upper grades, as it is coming to be in many places, what additional 
facts about the grammar of English should be emphasized, if any? 
4. Suggest six different exercises for impressing children in different 
grades with one matter of good form; e. g., the use of a period 
at the end of a declarative or an imperative sentence. These 
exercises may include games or any device suited to the kind of 
mistake to be corrected. 
5. Plan three lessons on the distinction between the past tense and 
the past participle of some verbs often misused, stating the 
grade or grades where these lessons are to be taught. 
6. Review Doctor Briggs’s study in the Teachers College Record. Do 
you agree with his conclusions?

which follows a preposition is called its object and is in the objective 
case. 
4. (a) Most nouns form their plural by adding s or es to the singular. 
Nouns ending in y preceded by a consonant change y to 7 and add es

GRAMMAR 157 
The words half, wife, knife, life, and a few others change f to v be- 
fore adding the suffix s or es. 
A few nouns form their plural in en. 
A few nouns form their plural by a change of vowel. 
A few nouns have the same form for singular and plural. 
The possessive case of most singular nouns is formed by adding ’s 
to the nominative. 
The feminine gender is often indicated by the ending ess. _ (Fre- 
quently when the masculine form ends in or or er, the feminine ends 
in ress.) 
Gender is sometimes indicated by the ending man, woman, maid, 
boy, or girl. 
(6) Person is that form of a pronoun which shows whether it refers 
to the person speaking, the person addressed, or the person (or thing) 
spoken of. Thus, there are three persons. Pronouns, also, have 
number—singular and plural, the singular referring to one person 
(as I) and the plura? referring to that one person jointly with one or 
more other persons (as we—I and. one or more other persons). 
There is no change of form to denote the gender of the person 
speaking or the person spoken to, but there are forms to represent 
the difference in gender in the person or thing spoken of: he (if mascu- 
line gender), se (if feminine), and i# (if lower animal or inanimate ob- 
ject). The plural of all genders of the third person is they. 
For case of pronouns, see 1, 2, and 3 under this table. 
The compound personal pronouns are formed (a) in the first person 
by adding self to the possessive singular, selves to the possessive plural, 
(b) in the second person as in the first. 
(c) In the third by adding self to the objective singular, selves to 
the objective plural. 
These forms are to be used only after the occurrence of the cor- 
responding personal pronouns (e. g.: ‘You yourself must go.” “He 
hurt himself’’). 
The relative pronoun who, like the personal pronouns, has dif- 
ferent forms for the different cases. Their use is like that of sub- 
stantives. (See Table J, 1, 2, 3.) 
Of the relative pronouns, who refers to persons, which to animals 
and inanimate objects. That may have any antecedent. What takes 
the place of both antecedent and relative. 
5. In a series of nouns and pronouns the pronoun of the first per- 
son always stands last. 
6. A pronoun must agree with its noun in gender, number, and 
person. 
7. The demonstratiyes are this, plural these, and that, plural those.
-P-A-G-E-196
  
158 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
They may be used as adjectives or as pronouns. The personal pro- 
noun them is not used as an adjective. 
8. A verb must agree with its subject in number and person. If, 
in a compound subject, the substantives connected by or or nor differ 
in number or person the verb usually agrees with the nearer. 
9, 10, 11. Verbs have forms of tense to indicate present, past, or 
future time. 
Weak verbs form the past by adding ed, d, or ¢ to the present, some- 
times with change of vowel. Strong verbs form the past by changing 
the vowel of the present without an additional ending. 
The future tense is a verb phrase consisting of the auxiliary verbs 
shall or will followed by the infinitive without to. The past participle 
is that part of the verb form which is used after J have to form the 
perfect tense. 
Ought is a finite verb, not a participle and, therefore, cannot be used 
with have (had) to form compound tenses. ; 
12. Some verbs may be followed by a substantive denoting that 
which receives the action or is produced by it. These are called 
transitive verbs. All others are intransitive. 
Some transitive verbs take a secondary object denoting the person 
or thing toward whom or toward which the action of the verb is di- 
rected. 
May indicates permission, possibility, wish. Can indicates ability. 
In the first person sail, in the second and third will, indicates 
simple futurity. 
In the first person will, in the second and third shall, denote a prom- 
ise, threat, consent, or resolve, the volition always being that of the 
speaker. 
Should and would follow the same rules in use as do shall and will. 
13. Subjunctive forms are used in wishes, prayers, conditions, and 
concessions. They are rare except in the copula be. 
14. Double comparison is common in older English but now it is 
a gross error. 
The comparative degree of an adjective is usually formed by adding 
er to the positive. There are a few irregular forms. 
The superlative is usually formed by adding est. There are a few 
irregular forms. 
Many adjectives of two syllables, and most adjectives of three or 
more syllables, are compared by the use of more and most. 
15. The comparative and not the superlative is used in comparing 
two persons or things. 
The superlative is used to compare one person or thing with two or 
more others.
-P-A-G-E-197
  GRAMMAR 159 
16. An adjective is a word which modifies a substantive. An ad- 
verb is a word which modifies a verb, adjective, or adverb. 
17. Modifiers should be placed as near as possible to the word or 
words they limit. No modifier should be inserted between to and its 
infinitive. 
18. Two negatives contradict each other and make an affirmative. 
19. Prepositions, also conjunctions, show various distinctions in 
use and meaning which must be learned by practice and the study of 
synonyms. 
20. Unnecessary words, after the meaning is made clear, should be 
avoided. 
21. Many words though pronounced alike have different functions 
to perform. The spelling usually varies according to the function. 
22. The end of a declarative and very often of an imperative sen- 
tence is marked by a period. 
23. The end of a direct question is marked by an interrogation- 
point. 
24. The possessive case of mdst singular nouns has ’s. Plural 
nouns ending in s add an apostrophe to denote possession. Plural 
nouns not ending in s take ’s. 
25 and 26. A sentence must contain subject and predicate. 
27. A sentence is the expression of a complete thought. 
CAPITALIZATION 
1. Every sentence begins with a capital letter. 
2. Proper nouns and adjectives derived therefrom begin with cap- 
ital letters. 
The rules listed in Table J are broken by the children and should, 
therefore, from the point of view of this study, constitute the core of 
the course of study in grammar. But if these rules constitute the 
whole course the pupils cannot understand them without learning 
the meaning of subject and predicate, noun, pronoun, etc., which are 
themselves rules or definitions of grammar. Hence, the course of 
study must include not only the rules broken, but in addition thereto 
the rules and definitions necessary for an understanding of the broken 
tules. The complete list is worked out in Table K. 
Nore sy Eprror: The assumption underlying this selection must be kept 
clear, that pupils will use such principles even if they do know them. Grammar 
is to be used as a tool to help children to correct speech. We have yet to 
discover the relative place of habit and of principles in such usage. It is 
safe to teach composition and use grammar only when needed.

TABLE K 
AN ANALYSIS OF THE GRAMMATICAL FACTS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND 
THE RULES LISTED IN TABLE J 
The rules are indicated by the numbers used in Table J, rule r. 
Rule 1. Rule 1 involves a knowledge of subject and predicate and, 
therefore, of the sentence. Subject involves a knowledge of noun 
and pronoun. Nominative case includes case and nominative case in 
pronouns. Predicate involves the use of the verb. 
Rule 2. This rule involves the copula, the expletive, and the pred- 
icate nominative as new facts. 
Rule 3. (x) The new elements in this rule are the object, objective 
case, and the transitive verb. 
(2) The preposition is introduced in 3 (2). 
Rule 4.. (1) In rule 4 (a) are introduced number in nouns, gender 
in nouns, and the possessive case in nouns. 
(2) In rule 4 (b) is added case, person, gender, and number in per- 
sonal pronouns, the compound personal pronoun, case of relative 
pronouns, gender of relative pronouns, use of which and uses of what. 
Rule 5. Rule 5 introduces the conjunction. 
Rule 6. No new element is added. 
Rule 7. The new facts introduced are demonstrative adjectives and 
demonstrative pronouns. 
Rule 8. (1) Rule 8 (a) involves two new elements—person in verbs 
and number in verbs. 
(2) Rule 8 () adds the compound subject. 
Rule 9. The new facts included in the rules given under 9g are 
strong verbs, weak verbs, present tense, and past tense. 
Rule 10. Here is introduced the past participle, the perfect tense 
of the active voice, and all the tenses of the passive voice. 
Rule 11. No new elements are added in rule 11. 
Rule 12. Rule 12 needs three new facts—the intransitive verb, the 
direct object (as such), and the indirect object. The auxiliaries can 
and may are introduced. Other new facts needed to understand 
rule 12 are the future tense, shall and will, as auxiliaries and should 
and would. 
Rule 13. This rule implies a knowledge of the subjunctive mood 
in the copula be. 
Rule 14. The supplementary facts needed in these rules are com- 
parison of adjectives. 
Rule 15. No new element is needed. 
Rule 16. The new facts introduced in rule 18 are the adverb and 
the comparison of adverbs.

  CHAPTER VII 
READING IN THE LOWER GRADES 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
1. How and when did you learn to read? 
2. When does reading become a social factor in a child’s life? Do 
people use oral or silent reading most in every-day life? Why 
do we emphasize oral reading in school? 
3. What elements make a story or poem a child’s favorite? What 
influence should this have on primary reading? 
4. How may the memory of a story or poem help early reading? 
How may it hinder? 
5. How may pointing to words develop a slow rate of reading? How 
may pointing be used helpfully? 
6. Can you justify a teacher in telling a child unknown words in a 
reading lesson? Under what conditions? 
7. According to what principles should teachers select words for 
drills? 
8. Name several ways in which dramatization may react upon 
reading. 
9. What study habits may the child gain from his primary reading 
and its accompanying seat work? 
to. Do you know how any particular child learned to read at home 
largely as play and stimulated principally by the desire to read 
stories? If so, how was it done? 
Persisting Problems.—The joy of a little child when he 
finds that he can read is a force which the teacher needs to 
appreciate. If she can keep this joy alive from the time 
when he first triumphs in his recognition of a few words until 
he leaves the fourth grade with the ability to read and enjoy 
the simple material adapted to his age, she will have done 
much for her pupil. “What has been the hardest thing about 
learning to read?” was asked of a fifth-grade boy who was 
just beginning to show some self-confidence in his reading, 
and whose work in the first grade had been satisfactory.

  164 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
“Well, you see my second-grade teacher used to say things, 
and I’ve always been afraid, when I’ve tried to read, that my 
teacher would say things.” Many tragedies of sensitive chil- 
dren would be averted, interest would be aroused, and efforts 
renewed, if, when the teacher began to ‘‘say things,” she 
would seek to arouse joy in the stories read, and joy in each 
triumph shown in mastering the difficulties in the process. 
Primary teachers have developed great skill in the initial 
y attack upon reading; teachers of beginners realize the need 
for careful study of their problems [7 : 64-70]. Teachers of 
second, third, and fourth grades have a much richer oppor- 
tunity in this field than they are aware of. In many instances 
their problems are the same as those of the teachers of be- 
ginners, differing in degree rather than in kind, but the added 
ability and maturity of the pupils open new possibilities for 
the reading recitation. 
In general, the teaching of reading divides itself into 
problems of thought and problems of form. The skilful 
teacher helps her pupils to keep the thought in mind, to de- 
velop and enjoy it, while at the same time she is guiding them 
in the mastery of the words and word groups which convey 
the thought. Perhaps the safest single direction to give an 
inexperienced teacher is to keep trying in various ways to 
teach the children to read, and to repeat those ways which 
work best. There are many ways of accomplishing good 
results. 
Types of Readers.—The reading-books which the children 
use determine in large measure the results which may be 
obtained, but a good teacher will find ways of supplementing 
poor material, and a poor teacher will fail to get possible 
values from the best books. Three types of readers are in 
use in our schools to-day; each has its advantages and its 
dangers. 
Certain readers contain a definite method of teaching 
reading. Lists of words and phonic elements are carefully 
worked out, and the reading lessons are based upon these
-P-A-G-E-203
  READING IN THE LOWER GRADES 165 
lists. The definiteness of this plan appeals to many teachers. 
Successfully used, such readers make the pupils independent 
in their reading. A poor teacher cannot use them success- 
fully, however. The grave danger is that pupils will become 
mere word-callers, that little thinking will be done, and that 
results secured in expression will be poor. 
Another group of readers use repetition stories for all 
early work. These readers arouse interest, give children 
much to think about, and lend themselves to expressive read- 
ing. They give splendid opportunity for work with phrase 
groups, and for learning words through context. The great 
danger is that teachers will not train pupils to become inde- 
pendent in their reading; memory of the story often hides 
ignorance of words. Persistent effort will secure excellent 
results, however, and charming childlike interpretation will 
follow. 
A third group of readers present a variety of material, 
much of it based upon children’s own experiences; poems and 
stories are mingled with accounts of real children and their 
_various activities. Children read these accounts with a high 
degree of understanding, and with very natural expression. 
The variety of subject keeps interest keen. Vocabulary and 
sentence structure are likely to be simple and childlike. The 
dangers are that there may be a lack of literary quality, and 
that the pupil may not be led to think beyond his own ex- 
periences. Pupils are likely to become independent readers 
in using these books. 
The teacher needs to supplement any reader in all possible 
ways—by getting her school board to buy supplementary 
readers, by co-operating with libraries, by having pupils 
bring books and papers from home, by having older pupils 
rewrite stories for younger ones, by her own blackboard 
lessons [6 : 260-300; 10 : 36-80]. 
Getting Acquainted with the Text.—The reader used as a 
basic text is to be a source of inspiration and joyful activity 
for the children. The teacher needs to know the text in order
-P-A-G-E-204
  166 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  to plan her lessons intelligently. She should read it through 
first as a whole, thinking of the interests and activities of the 
children as she reads, planning special lessons for special 
occasions, perhaps, but mainly getting the atmosphere of the 
stories and poems. Some lessons will suggest the flowers and 
fruits, birds and bees, which mark the passing seasons. So 
the teacher will plan to have her children observe and talk 
about these beauties of nature. Other lessons deal with 
dolls and carts, suggesting a doll day or a parade. Others are 
related to circus day or Christmas. The stories will arouse 
the dramatic instinct, the poems will appeal to the love of 
rhyme and rhythm. So the teacher plans as she gives this 
first rapid reading, but the detailed plans for individual les- 
sons are of slower growth. In some books there may be 
lessons which the wise teacher will omit, realizing that they 
are not worth reading. 
Planning to Complete the Text.—A term’s work or a 
year’s work may be represented by the text. The teacher 
may well have in mind from the first the amount which she 
will try to cover in the first month, the second, and so on. 
At the beginning of the year the children work slowly; they 
need much easy supplementary reading; blackboard lessons 
will be especially helpful. Yet even here they must not be 
allowed to drag, ways must be discovered to cover ground 
enough so that the children will know that they are progressing. 
During the middle of the term progress is steady. There 
are discouraging days, but the teacher must steadily forge 
ahead, requiring persistent work by the children. The re- 
reading of the easier stories during this period will help the 
children to gain in fluency, and will lead the teacher to appre- 
ciate their accomplishment. 
By the last month of the term a dangerous fluency may 
have been acquired, unless the teacher is watchful to give 
the children new ways of attacking the lessons; then the more 
fluent reading becomes a great aid. Some teachers reserve 
certain lessons in the basic reader for this last month, so that

  READING IN THE LOWER GRADES 167 
there shall be fresh material even to the end. This is prob- 
ably better planning than hurrying through the text and 
spending all the last month in review, though there will be 
much review during the year. 
Securing Variety of Motive.—The energy of a pupil’s 
attack upon his reading lesson depends largely upon the value 
which he believes it possesses for him. In order to keep his 
interest alive so that he is ready to expend a high degree of 
energy in accomplishing his work, a variety of motives must 
be presented for his reading from day to day. He reads so 
that he may act, may express by pantomime or dramatization 
the author’s thought. He reads so that he may enjoy the 
story or poem, the teacher often measuring his enjoyment by 
his expressive reading or by the lighting up of his face. He 
reads in order to recall experience or to learn from the experi- 
ence of others. He reads at times for the purpose of sharing 
with others the delights of his book, reading to an audience 
at home or at school the lesson which he has mastered. Again 
he reads in order to illustrate by drawings the author’s thought, 
to sing the musical poem. He reads frequently for the sense 
of mastery, of power, which links him with all educated peo- 
ple. It is a splendid thing to be able to read, and emphasis 
needs to be laid upon the power which it brings. 
The teacher may not be able to determine which of these 
motives is impelling the pupil to master his reading, but she 
can determine the motive which her questions and sugges- 
tions will seek to arouse. ‘Time spent by the teacher in study- 
ing the motive for a lesson or series of lessons is exception- 
ally well spent; the alert, attentive work of the pupils as they 
press forward under the stimulus of an appealing motive 
proves this. The pupils expend their energy in search for 
something worth while for them; they do not need to be 
driven to work. 
Training in Organizing Ideas.—The use which a pupil 
makes of the ideas presented to him in his reading determines 
the value to him of his reading. Many ideas occurring in
-P-A-G-E-208
168 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  his lessons are very clear to him, relating themselves to his 
every-day life—home, playtime, holidays, the beautiful nature 
world about him. Other ideas are new to him, and the 
teacher knows they need careful explanation. Many ideas 
which are so common that the teacher supposes they are 
understood, prove to be stumbling-blocks, however. It is 
impossible for intelligent reading to be done unless the pupils 
have clear ideas of the conditions of which they are reading. 
One of the best means for clarifying ideas is to organize 
them, to find their relations to one another. In a reading 
lesson this needs to be done by working more with the related 
experiences in the text than with the outside experiences of 
the pupils, enough of the latter being discussed to help in 
interpretation. 
In real life certain things, certain events, naturally go to- 
gether. In a reading lesson these natural relationships are 
found and help in organizing the material. Even the simple 
lessons of our primers show this, and first-grade children can 
discover the related ideas, can suggest the ideas they will 
look for. A dainty picture in one of our primers shows three 
little girls standing about a tiny table at which several dolls 
are seated. One girl has a large doll in her arms, a second 
girl holds three small dolls. The picture itself suggests 
a party. The question naturally comes: ‘‘Who is having 
this party?” The first sentence answers it: ‘I am having 
a party.” Another question, follows: ‘Who are the other 
little girls?’”’ A search through the page discovers the names 
Alice and Helen. ‘How can we tell which is Alice and which 
isHelen?” Again the text tells: “Alice has three little dolls. 
Helen has one big doll.” The invitation, the food, the games 
played, are all discussed, and in this way the entire reading 
lesson is covered. Not a sentence is read except in response 
to some question arising from the central idea—the party. 
No attempt is made to have the sentences read in sequence, 
the sentences describing Alice and Helen being near the 
bottom of the page, yet being read almost at first. A second
-P-A-G-E-209
  
READING IN THE LOWER GRADES 169 
reading of the lesson in sequence follows as the period 
closes. 
Put together those ideas which belong together. Train 
pupils to do this. Help them to find natural divisions in the 
story, to read together those sentences which belong together. 
Teach children to find a sentence which tells an important 
fact, or suggests surprise or suspense, then to read all those 
sentences which lead up to or grow out of such a sentence. 
Varying Importance of Parts.—Some characters, pictures, 
or events in a story stand out as essential, the others are de- 
tails which serve as a background. Discussion should gen- 
erally centre upon the essentials, these parts should be dwelt 
upon far more than the relatively unimportant. Children 
may be asked to name or list the important characters, those 
of less importance; to draw a picture of an important scene; 
to dramatize one of the most interesting parts. In working for 
expressive reading, sentences or paragraphs in which surprise, 
suspense, or climax appear should receive the most attention. 
It is not uncommon for a teacher in planning a reading 
lesson to look for probable difficulties, perhaps expecting to 
spend a greater proportion of time upon a paragraph which 
bristles with hard words. Her attention would better be 
given to those parts which have the most influence upon the 
spirit of the story, which Ge color and character to the 
whole [11 : 82-84]. 
What Pupils May Do with a Lesson.—The cut-and-dried 
reading lesson is gradually disappearing as new types of les- 
sons are evolved. There are times when the choice of treat- 
ment of the entire lesson may be left to the class. Shall we 
read this lesson silently or dramatize it?’ What would you 
like to do during the reading period to-day? Such choice 
means that the pupils have had experience with different 
types of lessons, so that their choice is made intelligently. 
Again a lesson may be assigned to a group of pupils to 
plan and give to the class in any way they may choose. The 
greater the variety of treatment when the teacher is direct-.
-P-A-G-E-210
170 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ing the class, the more versatile the groups will be when this 
responsibility is given them. They should be held to earnest 
effort in pleasing their audience. 
When pupils are given opportunity to bring from home 
and read to the class such reading material as they believe 
the class will enjoy, provision is made for much exercise of 
initiative. Here, too, pupils need to be required to prepare 
carefully the stories which they present. 
In every reading lesson of any type pupils should be en- 
couraged to ask questions and pass judgment without wait- 
ing for prompting by the teacher. Guidance will be needed 
to prevent disorder, and at first to help in framing worthy 
questions. A skilful teacher will soon provide for these, 
however, and will be surprised at the intelligent response 
which pupils will make when the way is opened. 
Utilizing Pupils’ Experiences.—The better the teacher 
understands her pupils, the more opportunities she will find 
for relating the reading material to their interests, for help- 
ing them to find comradeship in the lessons. This lesson fits 
some children especially, another suits a different group a 
little better. This one appeals to children’s sense of humor, 
that to their sympathy, a third to their love of family and 
playmates. At times the experience of one member of a 
class illuminates a point for all of the others, again the lesson 
fits a common experience. 
When once the riches of a story have been opened up for 
the class, the story should be referred to by the teacher from 
time to time, the characters and events should become 
thought currency with an abiding value. 
The Reading Vocabulary.—During the first months, the 
growth of the reading vocabulary is slow, but in the second 
half of the first year more rapid mastery is gained, and in 
the second and third years comes still more rapid progress. 
Fourth-grade pupils should have a large reading vocabulary, 
though there will still be need for much sensible work in word 
mastery. The teacher needs to select with care those words  
-P-A-G-E-211
  READING IN THE LOWER GRADES I7I 
and word groups for which she will hold the class responsible, 
those for which the stronger pupils only will be held, and 
those which she will tell. Pupils must gain in independence, 
yet they must not be kept at work on uninteresting material 
because they lack in technical word mastery. Fresh material 
and new types of drill will help in gaining independence. 
Emphasis upon the words and word groups which a child 
knows, praise for the gains made, will prove a stimulus to 
renewed effort [11 : 4-6, 52-56]. 
Reaching Words Through Context.—Recognition of words 
during the thinking process of reading in such a way as to 
have them contribute to that thinking, is a necessity if read- 
ing is to be intelligent. It is therefore necessary to give 
training in the use of the context thought as an aid in word 
recognition. In all reading there is a reaching forward, an 
expecting in the thinking process. Training a child to make 
use of this expectancy in thinking out a new word, is training 
in getting a word through the context. What do you expect 
the story to say? Where do you think the hen hid her nest? 
What would the boys do in the garden? Such questions 
help to carry the thought forward and suggest the needed 
word. At times a pupil reads into the text a synonym for 
the word in the text. This is an evidence that he is think- 
ing as he reads and seldom needs correction [11 : 156-158° 
6 : 348-351]. 
Presentation of New Words.—Many words may be 
taught most quickly by thoughtful use of the lesson as it 
occurs on the page. A picture of children carrying an um- 
brella suggests not only the words children and umbrella, but 
rain and storm also. These ideas are all familiar ones, the 
picture forms a connecting-link, all that is necessary is for 
the pupils to find the words on the page. The very fact that 
the children have these words in mind helps them in their 
search. Whatever knowledge of phonics they have, helps in 
this word recognition. 
Some words are most economically drilled upon in pairs
-P-A-G-E-212
  172 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  or in groups. No word should be taught which does not re- 
late to some experience of the children. Contrast is one of 
the strongest factors to use in teaching words, so lists of 
opposites may well be used for drill: 
yes boy father up sleep come little good fast 
no girl mother down wake go big bad slow 
It is economy also to teach together words which stand for 
related ideas: mother, baby, love, sing; egg, nest, bird, tree; 
seed, plant, garden. Another advantage is gained by teach- 
ing as units those word groups which most frequently occur: 
good morning, good-by; a little girl (boy, kitten); in the 
house (garden, tree); there is; once upon a time. 
There was a time when the teacher was supposed to weave 
into story form all words presented in lists. This is waste 
effort. The essentials are for the children to have the idea, 
to relate the idea to the printed word, to make the connec- 
tion frequently enough so that it becomes automatic. The 
day’s book lesson may or may not be the unit for word work. 
By using lists of opposites, series of related words, and common 
word groups, the word work will at times go more rapidly 
than the reading lessons. 
Phonic Work.—There are three phases of phonic work: 
training the ear to recognize sounds; training the voice to 
make them; training the eye to recognize their symbols. 
The first two may well precede the third. Perhaps the most 
natural sounds for children to imitate, those which lead to 
the most unconscious use of the vocal organs, are the sounds 
made by the animals and machines with which the child is 
in daily contact: buzz, buzz; cluck, cluck; chug, chug. Later 
the sight words which they have learned may be grouped, and 
the common phonic elements taught. Work at first with ini- 
tial consonants only: s, k, t, p, m, f, r. Later use common 
phonograms: ate, est, at, an, ight, ay. 
As soon as a phonic element is taught, the pupils may
-P-A-G-E-213
READING IN THE LOWER GRADES 173 
give words which begin with it. The element itself may be 
presented on the blackboard or on a card, the words may be 
given orally only. Later will come word building. Use the 
phonics in the reading lessons as early as possible after they 
are taught. Turn toa familiar story and say: “I find a word 
which begins with 7.” Let the children find the word and 
name it. Gradually make use of this knowledge in attacking 
new words in the reading lesson [10 : 102-123]. 
Other Means of Recognizing Words.—A body of knowl- 
edge is being accumulated showing how the eye recognizes 
words. Difference in length is one factor. Other things 
being equal, the eye distinguishes more rapidly between a 
long and a short word than between two short words: big, 
little present a greater contrast than man, fan. Height of 
letters is another factor, letters which extend above and be- 
low the line being more readily recognized than single-space 
letters: little, pretty have more character than are, run. The 
first and last parts of a word are more quickly noticed than 
the middle: barn, wonder have difficulties, or and on. Call 
attention to those features which attract the eye most readily, 
have patience with the difficult parts [tz : 125-135; 6 : 96—-r1or]. 
Essentials of Drill—Drills must be very short in order 
to hold the attention of pupils; from three to five minutes is 
long enough. Fatigue sets in after a very few minutes, and 
loss of energy results. Drills should be rapid. The eye 
recognizes words very rapidly, and this rapid recognition 
should be cultivated. The class must (1) focus attention upon 
the work, (2) repeat the words or phonic elements with atten- 
tion, (3) give the correct response each time. In general, it 
is better to have individual rather than concert responses, 
the children answering in turn so that no time shall be wasted 
in calling names. When an incorrect answer is given, call 
upon the class for the correct answer. Get back several times 
to the child who makes a mistake, until the right response 
seems fixed. Be patient with the slow child, give him the 
easier words. Let children select and point to the words
-P-A-G-E-214
  174 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
which they know. Challenge the stronger pupils to name the 
entire list [6 : 52-60]. 
Motivated Reviews.—Every time that a story is reread 
attentively, recognition of the words is more rapid, and the 
reading is smoother. The motives of enjoyment, of drama- 
tization, of sharing may suggest such rereadings. Certain 
texts have review pages so arranged as to recall the lessons 
already read, while at the same time appealing to the puzzle 
instinct, the rhyming instinct, the delight in voice play. 
Some teachers are able to plan delightful reviews of this type, 
using the blackboard for their presentation. The use of sup- 
plementary readers often makes it possible to read another 
version of a favorite story. 
New Context Relationships.—The new word may be sug- 
gested by a picture, found in the text, drilled upon in the 
drill period, and recognized more readily in the motivated 
review. Each of these steps is essential. The final test, 
however, is the recognition of the word in new context rela- 
tions. Proper gradation of the basal text and the use of 
simple, attractive supplementary readers will provide for this 
test. In selecting supplementary readers, attention must be 
paid to the vocabulary of each. Fortunately a number of 
charming readers are on the market, containing interesting 
stories told in childlike language, and using over and over 
again the fundamental words of the child’s early reading 
vocabulary. Needed fluency and sense of power come as a 
class finds itself able to take set after set of these simple books 
and read their delightful contents. Gradually the words be- 
come, as they should, but the tools of thought, they are recog- 
nized reflexly, and the pupils become eager, independent 
readers. 
Planning for Variety of Material.—The story, the poem, 
informational lessons, dramatizations are all found in the 
reading material—if not in the basic text, then in the sup- 
plementary readers and blackboard lessons. Exclusive use 
of any one kind of material is likely to produce a surfeit,

  READING IN THE LOWER GRADES 175 
some child may not respond as readily to one kind as to 
another. The treatment of these lessons emphasizes the 
difference between fact and fancy, between diction which 
lends itself to musical reading and that which may be read 
silently and told, as well as read orally. Experiences of the 
class may be developed into reading material in the language 
period. Older classes may rewrite in dramatic form for 
younger classes some of the fine fables and fairy-stories. 
Types of Lessons.—The first lesson with a new selection 
should frequently be a study recitation. In this the teacher 
helps the children to find problems for themselves, to ask 
questions, to discover the essential parts. Frequently the 
problems and questions become the assignment for the next 
study period, and their answers form the basis for the recita- 
tion period following. Another recitation may consist of 
work upon dramatic oral reading of sections best adapted for 
expressive reading. Informational lessons may be read 
silently, the class discussing the facts as they read, or each 
reading at his own pace and questioning the teacher as he 
finds it necessary [6 : 75-87]. 
Seat Work and Study Periods.—The pupil needs to make 
a companion of his book, to browse over it by himself. In 
some way the assignment for seat work or study needs to direct 
him so that he shall attack his book with some definite work 
to do. This may be either preparation for a class recitation, 
or the outgrowth of a previous recitation.’ Essentials should 
be dwelt upon, organizing ideas should be worked over; judg- 
ment, reason, fancy, humor—all should come into play. 
The assignment may deal with form as well as with thought, 
with words as well as with ideas. Whatever is given the 
pupil to do at his seat, care should be taken that he under- 
stands what is required. He should be trained to attack his 
work promptly and energetically, and in some way use should 
be made of his results [6 : 106-111]. 
Accomplishment in Lesson Periods.—The purpose of a 
reading lesson is for the pupils to grow in reading ability.
-P-A-G-E-218
  176 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The teacher must see that pupils keep the place, follow the 
thought, help one another with difficulties of thought and 
form. Some questioning and discussion are necessary in 
order to illuminate the author’s thought, to relate it to the 
experiences of the pupils. The lesson should not degenerate, 
however, into mere discussion and exchange of experience; 
the reading is the essential activity. Push the work with 
vigor, do not fuss over minor points, be certain that the main 
ideas are expressed clearly. It seems a miracle almost when 
this steady, effective work is carried on without strain, time 
being taken to enjoy the bits of humor or fancy; yet such a 
pace combined with the atmosphere of leisure is possible. 
The teacher to whom the lesson appeals as a literary whole 
will see to it that the end is reached during the lesson period, 
she herself or a strong pupil reading the final paragraph if 
time presses [rr : 106-108]. 
Working for Expression.—Children are naturally dra- 
matic, every class has some who are leaders in this line. By 
selecting with care those parts of the reading lesson which 
are most fitted for dramatic expression, by getting the pupils 
into the spirit of such parts, by utilizing the ability of the 
leaders, good expression may be obtained. There should be 
no servile imitation, but the teacher and better pupils may 
set a standard. Care needs to be taken that the leaders 
themselves develop in their rendering. There is danger of 
their becoming self-satisfied. The reading of poems should 
receive more careful attention than is usual, the musical dic- 
tion, rhyme, and rhythm all being recognized. Natural, child- 
like expression is all that is asked, but it should be intelligent 
and pleasing. 
The Slow Child and the Slow Class.—Speed in reading is 
a desirable factor and we need to train for it. Certain chil- 
dren have greater difficulties than others. They frequently 
become discouraged and effort ceases. A class which has had 
poor teaching may be a puzzle to a good teacher, for it is 
hard to find what they know. . In both cases use simple read- _
-P-A-G-E-219
  READING IN THE LOWER GRADES 177 
ing so far as possible, call on the slow child for the easier sen- 
tences. Give much encouragement whenever a word or a 
sentence is mastered. The teacher may read a new lesson to 
the slow class, they following in their own books with eyes and 
fingers, she calling on them to name certain words as she 
progresses, or to reread paragraphs or sentences after her. 
Later they read the lesson for themselves. . Rapid drills on 
common words are necessary, but should not be depended 
upon altogether. 
Measuring Results.—Standards in rate of reading and in 
thought-getting are rapidly being developed. Doctor Thorn- 
dike, for example, has published a very valuable scale for 
measuring the progress and results in reading, and very satis- 
factory and practical standards will soon be perfected by 
experiment, adaptation, and wide use. Every teacher of 
reading should possess the Thorndike or other satisfactory 
scale, the same as she possesses and uses handwriting and 
spelling scales, and should learn to use it in her work. This 
is her opportunity to help make teaching a science and a 
profession instead of a rule-of-thumb trade. Moreover, pres- 
ent subjective standards should be utilized. The teacher 
needs to cultivate her judgment and appreciation of good work 
in reading by visiting other classes and having others criti- 
cise her work. She needs to set herself to determining whether 
her pupils are strong and rapid in thought-getting, reasonably 
charming in oral reading, independent in attacking words, 
happy in their growing power of accomplishment, and inter- 
ested in the stories and other thought content provided for 
their instruction and enjoyment. 
SUMMARY 
1. Reading is concerned with problems of thought and problems of 
form. 
2. The teacher needs to know her reader as a whole, both strong 
and weak points. 
3. Reading motives should be varied in order to keep interest keen. 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
178 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  4. Intelligent reading is secured by discussing the thought pre- 
sented in the text. 
5. Reading lessons should be related to the experiences of pupils and 
should lead them into new lines of activity. 
6. New words should generally be presented first in their context, 
then tested in drills, and so gradually become part of the work- 
ing vocabulary. 
Phonics should include ear, voice, and eye training. 
The pupil needs to attack his reading lessons in different ways 
from day to day. 
9. Assignments for study should be definite and within the student’s 
ability. 
to. Results are shown in knowledge of vocabulary, rate of reading, 
grasp of thought, and natural, childlike expression. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
1. Examine two or more primary readers, classifying by titles and 
pages the selections which relate to children’s varied interests 
and activities; ¢. g., games, seasons, holidays. 
2. Classify the words and word groups on a primer page under these 
headings: 
(t) Words pupils should know instantly. 
(2) Words strong pupils may know. 
(3) Unknown words to be reached through context. 
(4) Unknown words to be reached through sounds. 
(5) Unknown words to be told by teacher. 
3. Divide a long story from a third or fourth reader into its main 
parts, giving each part a fitting name which would attract a 
child. 
4. Make note during one day of the sounds you hear made by animals, 
machines, and children. How could these be utilized in phonic 
work? In expressive reading? 
5. Study several long stories in primary readers. List three or four 
sentences from each which need especial attention in oral 
reading; several from each which are most essential for the 
understanding of the story. 
6. From the vocabulary of any primer select those words which are 
opposites. Which of these could be taught in relation to chil- 
dren’s schoolroom activities? 
7. Examine several primers and list the word groups which occur 
most frequently in each. How many of these groups are com- 
mon idiomatic expressions? Could they be used as units in 
spelling as well as in reading? art

8. Visit a popular bookstore and examine the books for children 
which are offered for sale. Note their literary value, hygiene 
of type and page, and artistic features. Visit the children’s 
department of your public library and make the same notes. 
What practical means could be taken to improve the character 
of the books offered for sale? 
9. When visiting homes in which there are primary children note 
the amount and suitability of the reading material at their 
disposal. What companionship in reading does the home 
afford ? 
to. Have pupils bring in daily from home for a week five or ten words 
which they know, which they have cut from newspaper headings 
or advertisements. Let them mount these words on cards, 
fourth-grade pupils first arranging theirs in alphabetical order. 
What effect does this seem to have on their interest in words? 
Why? 
rz. Measure several series of readers as to size of type and width of 
leading, and compare with the standards given in the appendix.! 
1 Appendix under Hygiene of Readers. 
12. In visiting motion-picture productions note when and how the 
films provide for looking into the future, for recalling the past. 
How may these opportunities be made use of in a reading les- 
son?

CHAPTER VIII 
READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
. What percentage of pupils, as you know them, can be excused in 
fourth and later grades from reading lessons as such, thus con- 
fining themselves to such reading as is necessary to the study 
of other lessons? Would it be desirable to do so for any, or all? 
If silent reading is the type of reading most used in life and if 
continued practice in oral reading slows up the process of 
silent reading, why not have most reading done ‘silently in the 
upper grades? 
. If literature is not taught as a separate subject to any great extent 
and if history, geography, civics, hygiene, moral education, 
manual education, and other subjects are too lacking in emo- 
tional, literary elements for cultivating ideals and apprecia- 
tions, cannot most of the desirable literature be correlated 
with these subjects? 
. What literary selections could be used in the upper grades to 
develop ideals and appreciations of (1) citizenship on the child’s 
plane? See “A Course in Citizenship” by Cabot and others, 
for example. (Houghton Mifflin Co.) 
. What literary selections can be used to contribute ideals and en- 
thusiasms for (2) good health and a fine physique, for clean 
sport and a clean life? 
. What selections actually do change pupils emotionally in the 
direction, also, of the ideals needed for (3) vocational efficiency 
in and out of the home, for (4) avocational, or recreational, effi- 
ciency, and for (5) moral efficiency? 
. Which of the five social aims of education named above and in 
Chapter I is most influenced by “The King of the Golden 
River,” as read in class or otherwise? By other selections? 
. What literature have you seen that would counteract such ideals 
as that of “bullying” smaller boys on the playground? 
. What is the best scale for measuring ability in silent reading? 
. What success have we had in constructing an oral reading scale?

I. Tue Reapinc ProspremM 
The problem of reading, 7.¢., the interpretation of the 
page with accuracy and with reasonable speed, remains the 
same, irrespective of the grade or the department of the school 
in which the subject is taught. There is, however, a disposi- 
tion on the part of many teachers, particularly in the inter- 
mediate and grammar grades, to confuse the values of read- 
ing and literature. Literature as such is not taught primarily 
for its habit-forming or informational values, while reading is. 
The fundamental purpose of beginning reading is that of 
training children in the facile recognition, use, and interpreta- 
tion of words and sentences; later reading becomes the pri- 
mary intellectual instrument for the acquisition of informa- 
tion. Both literature and reading have certain conventional 
and disciplinary values, but instruction in them is not justi- 
fied wholly for these reasons. Literature, considered as the 
finest of the fine arts, is one of the chief sources, also, for the 
development of ideals; but this outcome is only incidental to 
reading. 
How appreciation for literature can best be developed has 
long been one of the mooted questions in education. If one 
were to take current practice as the criterion, he would say 
that the best way to accomplish this is by a study of literary 
technic. Selections ranging in value from the poorest to the 
very best, both in poetry and in prose, are analyzed, appar- 
ently, for the exclusive purpose of giving a knowledge of liter- 
ary construction. It is doubtful if literary appreciation will 
ever be secured by this means. Some knowledge of the 
technical phases of literary structure are essential to literary 
appreciation, but any attempt to secure this appreciation 
through analysis only is likely to be futile. Some selections 
are so delicate in structure and subtle in sentiment that it 
seems almost sacrilegious to subject them to literary analysis. 
Appreciation may be secured for any art: (1) by an analysis 
and understanding of its fundamental principles (this to be
-P-A-G-E-225
READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 183 
  secured by a study of examples perfect in structure, but of 
ordinary sentimental value), and (2) by placing one in an 
environment saturated with the best types of art, e. g., the 
best music must be heard over and over, the most beautiful - 
pictures must be seen again and again, and the most perfect 
works of literary art must be read and reread. The things 
one sees, hears, and reads eventually sink into his soul and 
become a constituent part of his character. 
Oral Reading and Silent Reading.—The desire to culti- 
vate an appreciation for good literature accounts in part for 
the introduction of so much supplementary material of a 
literary character in the intermediate and grammar grades. 
Complete literary selections or parts of masterpieces now 
constitute the bulk of the collateral material used. Such seléc- 
tions lend themselves to oral reading. But most of the mate- 
rial in the readers and in the other text-books of the school 
was never intended to be read aloud. It was written to 
convey information. Unfortunately, the practice of having 
practically all selections read aloud prevails in most sections 
of the United States. It would be far better and of much 
greater educative value if a teaching technic were developed 
for silent reading so that all material of a strictly informa- 
tional character could be read accurately and with great speed. 
There is no one thing that would pay greater dividends in 
the economy of mental life, for it has been established that 
there is a direct relationship between one’s retentiveness and 
his speed in reading. Asa rule,:slow readers are forgetful 
readers, while rapid readers are retentive readers. A direct 
and positive relation exists between speed and accuracy in 
reading when one reads with a maximum degree of concen- 
tration. Children should be taught to read as fast as they 
can and as accurately as they can. 
Oral Reading and Its Criticism.—The traditional practice 
is to have selections read paragraph by paragraph, and to 
have the reading criticised. The criticisms are often of a 
most useless character, such as: “She didn’t pause at the 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
184 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  comma,” “She didn’t let her voice fall at the period,” “She 
said wuz for was,” and the like. Unless these criticisms are 
valid, and the reader is compelled to correct his faults then 
and there, nothing of value is likely to result from them. But 
suppose a teacher were to say to a class: “ Now, to-morrow I 
want each of you to choose for oral reading the funniest part 
of the story, or the most interesting part of the story, or the 
part which would be of the greatest value to old people. You 
must be able to read it to show that it is funny, or interesting, 
or of great worth.” With such instructions as these in mind 
no child would think of preparing himself to read the entire 
selection aloud; he would omit the explanatory parts that do 
not lend themselves to oral reading. Will anything be lost 
if different children have different ideas as to what is funny, 
or interesting, or of great value to old people? Is not that 
exactly what the teacher should expect? And will it not 
furnish her with the only natural basis for intelligent criti- 
cisms? Now, the reading of those who have chosen the same 
part can be compared, or it can be contrasted with those who 
have chosen different parts. Criticism under such a condi- 
tion would be rational, full of interest and meaning. In order 
to present their parts effectively the children would have an 
incentive for oral practice. 
By the time children have reached the intermediate grades 
it is presumed that they have acquired a mastery of the 
mechanics of reading. They should now know how to read. 
It does not follow that they are therefore good readers. In- 
deed we know that constant and unremitting attention must 
still be given to word drills. But articulation, enunciation, 
and pronunciation drills now become more characteristic of 
class work than drills upon sight words or phonograms. 
Intermediate-Grade Reading and Retardation.—Some of 
the recent studies on retardation seem to have a bearing upon 
the problem of intermediate-grade reading. These studies 
have established the fact that the retards are congested in the 
third, fourth, and fifth grades. School superintendents, recog-
-P-A-G-E-227
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 185 
nizing this fact, have been casting about to find some means 
of reducing the amount of retardation. Among other things 
that have been tried with varying success, has been the plan 
of introducing more reading of an informational and concrete 
character in these grades. Our school readers are sadly defi- 
cient in this sort of material. All pupils, and particularly 
boys of the intermediate-grade age, have a growing interest 
in material reality. They want to know how things are made. 
In some of the Indianapolis schools where reading material 
of this sort has been introduced there has been a marked 
decrease in the various forms of grade delinquency. Certainly 
this experiment is well worth trying in other schools. 
The argument presented in the preceding paragraph must 
not be construed as an argument for omitting the better types 
of literature from our readers. They must be retained, but 
for other reasons. 
II. Ars To READING 
Aids to Reading: PositionImportant as the matter of 
position is in reading, it can easily be overemphasized. 
“There is no surer way of producing all that is not wanted 
in a recitation than to let a class rise in the same way; use 
their hands, heads, legs, in the same way; smile, wink, ogle, 
start, plunge, stamp, snort, sniff, yawn, stare, and fool in the 
same’ way. They cease to be a class; they are a hydra- 
headed automaton.” Neither this condition nor that where 
the class is given unrestricted liberty is the right point of 
view; it must lie somewhere in between these extremes. 
The rules to be followed in securing a satisfactory posi- 
tion are few and simple. Children should be required to 
rise quickly and quietly when called upon, and to stand rea- 
sonably still. There is no excuse for weaving, backward and 
forward, for shuffling the feet, for twisting the body, inter- 
lacing the fingers, or twiddling with pencils. An upright 
position should be demanded. ‘This brings the chest forward
-P-A-G-E-228
  186 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
makes the reading easier, and gives a sort of dignity to read- 
ing not always obtained in the elementary schools. 
Teachers should give special attention to the position of 
the book. While no absolute rule should be laid down with 
reference to the hand in which the book should be held, in 
every instance it should be held so as to secure the best light 
and thus avoid eye-strain. The child with normal eyes will 
get the best results if the book is held about eighteen inches 
from the eyes, and in such a position so that the light falls 
upon the page from the left side. 
“Aids to Reading: Articulation.—Intelligent oral reading 
and speaking are proper correctives for poor articulation and 
enunciation. Sloven articulation, indistinct enunciation, and 
slurring pronunciation, are common American vices, which 
the school can do much to correct. Unless the school de- 
votes itself without ceasing to the destruction of these habits, 
we may expect them to spread and the people to become more 
and more satisfied with them. There is nothing that so 
quickly distinguishes culture from crudeness, good breed- 
ing from poor breeding, intelligence from ignorance, as the 
language one uses, and the manner in which he uses it. 
Language habits are a fair index of one’s training and of his 
social station. We use ‘‘harsh, commonplace, affected, stri- 
dent, feeble, fluffy, sloppy, grating, silly” voices partly be- 
cause we have not been intelligently instructed and habitu- 
ated in correct language habits. 
Articulation, enunciation, and pronunciation drills should 
be regarded as fundamental and essential to proper reading. 
These drills are not reading; they are the preparation for 
reading. They should not be engaged in while one is read- 
ing. The main purpose of oral reading is to convey thought 
and emotion through expression. . Articulation drills merely 
prepare and equip one to do this effectively. 
These drills should usually be carried on apart from the 
regular reading lesson. They should be short. If two min- 
utes a day are devoted to such drills, surprising results will
-P-A-G-E-229
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 187 
be secured. Drill is not economical if the teacher spends a 
large share of the class time in talking or in doing things to 
attract the attention of the children. She will not say: 
“ Now, children, let me have your attention,” ‘“‘ We are going 
to have a drill in articulation; I think it will be interesting.” 
“Tf John will turn his face to the front and Mary will put 
aside her papers, we will begin,” “Now answer promptly, 
etc., etc.” This is bad; the teacher wastes half or more of 
the time. The class should know that this drill exercise will 
start promptly, that it will be short, aggressive, and system- 
atic, and that they must give their undivided attention to it 
every second of the time. 
The method involved in drill is the method of habit 
formation. The attention of the children must be focussed 
upon the thing drilled upon. The point of difficulty should 
be raised to consciousness. Mere repetition is uneconomical. 
The number of repetitions necessary to reduce a process to 
habit varies inversely with the intensity of the focalization of 
the attention of the children upon the part that gives diffi- 
culty. Interest in drill work increases as the devices are 
varied. There must, however, be constantly recurring situa- 
tions. It is not sufficient merely to call the attention of the 
_ children to their mistakes, nor is it sufficient to expect when 
they have been drilled upon a thing until they are perfect in 
it that it will not be necessary for them to be drilled upon it 
a week later. 
The material to be used in drill work in articulation and 
pronunciation should consist of consonant and vowel sounds, 
isolated words, sentences, and alliterative exercises. Very 
excellent material for drill along each of these lines is given 
in “ Clear Speaking and Good Reading,” by Arthur Burrell, 
published by Longmans, Green & Co. 
Professor Burrell gives many gymnastic exercises that are 
of service in training the vocal mechanism. ‘These exercises 
range from simple consonant and vowel sounds to difficult 
combinations of words.
-P-A-G-E-230
188 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The following illustrate some of the types suggested: 
. Ha, ha, ha, ha, he, he, he, he, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. 
. Have, had, happen, heaven, help, hoist, hall, whole, holy, Harry. 
. Pool, tooth, moon, rule, rude, loom, room (not room), food. 
. Rye, type, like, scythe, oblige, chime, wine, sigh. 
. Rash, cattle, dazzle, landed, tackle, facts, acts, apt. 
. I have said, he is, he is not, we don’t know, I saw her, I haven’t, 
I shouldn’t do it. 
. The sick stammerer, muddled heads, difficult questions. Six sim- 
ple sisters sat sewing shirts. Hold your hands up high, Harry. 
Mrs. Fiske’s fried fish sauce shop. 
Any resourceful teacher can easily add to this list or make 
others equally as good. 
In Sherman and Reed’s ‘Essentials of Teaching Read- 
ing,” published by the University Publishing Company, 
Lincoln, Nebraska, there is an interesting list of alliterative 
exercises. I have chosen five of the best ones: 
  x. Brother Ben boldly beat, battered, and bruised the British with 
his bludgeon. 
2. Columbus Capricorn was cross, crabbed, crooked, carbuncled, and 
crusty. 
3. Nancy Nimble, with a nice new needle, netted neat nets. 
4. The stripling strangers strayed through the struggling stream. 
5. Six brave maids sat on six broad beds, and braided broad braids. 
Children delight in manufacturing such tongue-twisters 
as the above. There is no reason why they should not be 
permitted to put their ingenuity to such use. 
Some may have wondered as they have read this discus- 
sion why I have not urged the use of words for drill that occur 
in the daily work of the children. This is exactly what I 
should do. Most of the exercises should be of this character. 
However, they should not all be; for drill upon the elements 
of words and alliterative terms insures a facility and tone 
which the mere pronunciation of more or less easy words can 
never produce.
-P-A-G-E-231
READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 189 
Aids to Reading: the Dictionary.—The dictionary is but 
little, if any, more a phase of reading than it is of geography, 
history, or of any other content subject. Every one admits 
its value, but few have the habit of using it. Like the Bible, 
the dictionary is one of those things that are very valuable 
but are seldom used. Lessons in it are of a formal character. 
In this respect they are like lessons in pronunciation, capitali- 
zation, the use of margins, indentations, cyclopedias, gazet- 
teers, tables of contents, and glossaries. All such lessons are 
not in themselves intrinsically interesting. The material used 
is matter-of-fact; it is not something that increases in mean- 
ing and significance as a geographical fact does. For this 
reason interest must be infused into recitations dealing with 
this type of material. 
The first important lesson for children to learn in the use 
of the dictionary is that of finding words quickly. To ac- 
complish this they must be able to use the alphabet forward 
and backward with equal facility. Time will be saved if the 
dictionary adopted has a thumb index. One of the devices to 
be taught is the use of the index words at the top of the page. 
These index words show what words are included on any 
given page. A few whole lessons should be given in which 
the children do nothing but locate words in the dictionary. 
From the fourth grade on every pupil should have a good 
dictionary, indexed and well printed in large type, furnished 
by the schools. i 
At the very outset children must be taught to note the 
alphabetical order of the word structure. 
The time to teach diacritical marks is when the dictionary 
is introduced. The pupils can then see and appreciate their 
use in the pronunciation of difficult words. Two other things 
are involved in teaching pronunciation: one is the spelling of 
words, including the syllabic division and the use of the 
hyphen, and the other is the primary and secondary accents. 
How to find a word and how to pronounce it are important 
for reading purposes. In the upper grades some attention
-P-A-G-E-232
  Igo TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
should be given to the aid the dictionary gives in the study 
of grammar and the etymology of words. These, how- 
ever, have only a very remote relationship to reading. The 
dictionary serves one other purpose which contributes to 
better reading: it gives the meaning of words. Inasmuch as 
several definitions are usually given, definitions varying in 
shades of meaning, the pupils must be taught to discriminate 
between them and to choose the one that fits in with the con- 
text best. Pupils should not be permitted to repeat defini- 
tions from memory. 
Note.—The various steps in the treatment of each of 
these problems, together with an abundance of illustrative 
examples, may be found in a pamphlet prepared by Professor 
Thomas Briggs, and published by G. & C. Merriam & Co., 
Springfield, Mass. This pamphlet may be had for the asking. 
Assignment in Reading.—The assignment of lessons is 
one of the teacher’s means of preparing pupils for private 
study. By it the teacher shows the pupils how to engage in 
individual drill, the manner in which they may successfully 
apply principles already developed, or the method to be used 
in treating new material. The assignment is the teacher’s one 
best chance of stimulating children with a desire for the work 
that is to follow. For this reason it should be carefully and 
methodically given, and should be definite and clear. 
The obscurity of most assignments is due to the failure 
of the teacher to make adequate personal preparation. With- 
out this they are frequently nothing more than mere guess- 
work; each succeeding part of the text is treated in the same 
cut-and-dried fashion as the preceding. The teacher being 
unfamiliar with approaching difficulties, may by her habit- 
ually monotonous way of making assignments really inter- 
fere, if not block, the pupil’s progress. Study increases in 
intelligence somewhat in the degree that the main or salient 
features of the material to be studied are emphasized in the 
assignments. The unprepared teacher cannot point the way 
to that collateral material which is necessary to illuminate

the text. And again the teacher who has thought the new 
lesson through is better able to supply those stimulating hints 
that are essential to valuable study. 
These general principles are as applicable to reading as 
to any other subject. If the material to be studied lends it- 
self to oral reading, the discussion and the questions asked 
preceding the study should be of such a character as to call 
for the reading of the entire selection, and that several times. 
Correct and effective oral reading depends upon an under- 
standing of the selection. Moreover, it depends upon a fa- 
miliarity with the difficulties and a knowledge of the allusions 
found in the selection. However, it is easily possible to put 
so much stress upon these that effective oral practice will not 
be indulged in. The proper method must be somewhere be- 
tween that assignment which puts all its emphasis upon 
words, difficult passages, and allusions, and that kind of 
reading which places no stress upon such matters. Intelli- 
gent oral reading depends upon intelligent practice, and this 
depends upon effective assignments. 
Material used primarily for silent reading should be so 
assigned as to call for organization. The emotional element 
and coloring present in reading the “literature of power” is 
largely absent in that type of silent reading in which the 
school seeks to educate and train children. In adult life, to 
be sure, nearly all material will be read silently. The habits 
of silent reading and the forms of organization essential to 
recall growing out of it should be emphasized in the assign- 
ment of the “literature of information.” 
The two types of assignment are not mutually exclusive. 
They do, however, represent different nodal points in our 
thinking. By the form of the question used, and the material 
that appears in the assignments, the supervising critic has a 
fair notion of the large purpose that the teacher hopes to 
realize. He can tell whether the end sought is facility in 
intellectual organization or a taste and appreciation for the 
artistic aspects of literature. If the aim be some definite 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  
192 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
changes in the pupils’ ideals in the direction of the larger 
aims of education, then all methods and devices must be so 
directed. 
Dramatics.—Few doubt the wisdom of continuing dra- 
matics through the upper grades. It was pointed out in the 
preceding chapter that young children possess the power of 
concrete imagery, and that this power is easily lost. Sym- 
pathy with the forms of artistic expression can be cultivated 
by the revival of concrete imagery. As children mature there 
is danger that they will acquire the adult tendency of em- 
phasizing the symbols of prose and poetry, and that the living 
images and scenes described by them will be without genuine 
significance. Whenever this state is reached literary inter- 
pretation becomes impossible. Verbal imagery, concrete 
imagery, and the imaginal elements are devitalized. Such 
subjects as geography and science are adapted by nature to 
the cultivation of the symbolic types of imagery; such sub- 
jects as literature and. art are adapted by nature to the cultiva- 
tion of the concrete types of imagery. Each of these must 
receive its proper emphasis in the school. Whenever litera- 
ture, using the word in its highest and best sense, appeals to 
the eye alone the choicest pieces of poetry and prose go unin- 
terpreted. From the earliest times literary masterpieces have 
been interpreted and communicated through oral and dra- 
matic representation. Those early racial devices are still 
the ones, psychologically speaking, required for the most 
sympathetic interpretation of literature. Story-telling and 
dramatization, currently used in the earlier grades, should be 
given a wider use than they now enjoy in the later grades. 
What children normally indulge in in the world is some 
evidence of the method that might be employed with profit 
in the school. Out of school they are the myth makers as 
well as the myth actors of the race. The cultivation of their 
imaginative powers through dramatic performance is one of 
the new obligations resting upon the present teaching force. 
The teacher who will not make use of the device is either in-
-P-A-G-E-237
READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 193 
crusted by an unworthy tradition and conservatism, or is 
ignorant of its worth. It is this spirit of child life, which, 
when kept alive in adulthood, prolongs plasticity and effi- 
ciency. 
It is true that some teachers decline to use dramatization 
on the ground that it will attract the attention of other chil- 
dren, and thus interfere with the regular work. The teach- 
ers who make this claim are usually the ones who have not 
given the plan a fair trial. Country teachers object more 
strenuously to its use than town or city teachers. This is 
due to the fact that they have a number of grades in one 
room. Those teachers who have given it a fair test assert 
that it does attract attention while it is new; but when the 
novelty has worn off, and it has come to be regarded by the 
school as one of the regular parts of reading or language 
work, it distracts others from their work no more than other 
interesting devices do. : 
Dramatization properly conducted, is simple in its nature 
and far-reaching in its results. It requires nothing but imag- 
ination for a girl with a pail to represent a milk maid, a boy 
crouching on the floor to represent a fox, or looking through 
the rounds of a chair to pretend that he is a wolf, or for a boy 
seated in a box of straw to act as if he were a dog in the 
manger. Any kind of animal and almost any character can 
be effectually imitated or represented without elaborate cos- 
tumes or paraphernalia; the simple things about the school 
will be sufficient. 
There is one fallacy of which I should like to undeceive 
some teachers. It is the fallacy that grammar-grade children 
either cannot or do not like to dramatize. In either case, if 
such a situation exists, it is not nearly so much a criticism 
upon the children as it is upon the kind of instruction they 
have been receiving. They should like it, and will like it 
if they have been taught to like it. Really the work should 
be far more finished and polished in character in the upper 
than in the lower grades. I am well acquainted with one 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  
194 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
school where every grade dramatizes. The children are 
given the privilege of practising their “play” in an adjoining 
room, in a corner of the corridor, at the side of the building, 
or under the shade of some convenient tree. It may be 
urged that they abuse their privileges. Such a suspicion or 
accusation is unfounded, for these children know full well 
that to abuse their: privileges means that they will lose them; 
furthermore, they know that another group is rehearsing the 
same scene, and that the two groups will be compared. Prac- 
tice, of course, improves the product. Those teachers who 
can find no place to permit practice are not resourceful. 
Reading of Memory Gems.—Another factor that has an 
indirect bearing upon reading is the committing of memory 
gems. We know that the number of repetitions decreases in 
proportion as the memorizing is done by thought units. Ordi- 
narily the following directions can be followed safely: Under- 
stand the meaning of the selection, repeat the whole selection 
every time, pause and take stock at suitable divisions, and 
work intensively. Do not ignore the last factor. It is true 
that one might eventually commit a passage to memory by 
saying it over and over in a dilatory manner. Persistent 
effort counts in the long run, but it does not count nearly so 
much as intense effort. A combination of the two effectually 
insures an effective result in a minimum time. 
Direction of Private Reading.—The necessity of directing 
the private reading of pupils should increase with their ma- 
turity. Something may be done with it in the lower grades. 
Every room and every school should be supplied with its own 
library, and the books contained in the library should be 
adapted to the age and attainment of the pupils. Appropri- 
ate books wisely selected have been great silent forces in 
modifying the discipline of many a school, and in cultivating 
the intellectual interests of many a boy and girl. Fathers 
and mothers have shared in the reading of the books. In- 
directly, no doubt, the school library movement has been 
responsible for the enlargement of many a home library,
-P-A-G-E-239
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 195 
not to mention the enlargement of vision, experience, and 
ideals. 
The direction of outside reading is an extra-school problem 
of paramount importance. Boys are likely to be attracted 
by racy and salacious literature, while girls are likely to be 
attracted by insipid love-stories. Indiscriminate and un- 
directed reading may lead to vicious results. Wherever the 
home consciously assumes control of this function, the obli- 
gation resting upon the school is correspondingly lessened. 
But all too frequently the home is willing to shift the burden 
of this responsibility upon the school. To insure the read- 
ing of the right kind of books at home, the school is war- 
ranted in requiring some kind of formal report from the pupils. 
This may be done by setting aside a regular time in the weekly 
schedule for oral reports, or by having the pupils hand in 
synoptical statements of the books read. The former is 
much the better plan as it avoids cheating and stimulates 
others to do additional reading. 
The regular reading lesson should be used frequently as 
a pleasure reading period, an “appreciative lesson.” Pupils 
should be encouraged to practise upon the part they want to 
read. The test of their reading is found in the interest and 
attitude of the best of the class, who constitute a true audi- 
ence. Such a plan gives an opportunity to several pupils to 
read parts from different books. They should read these 
better than they read the assignments from their texts, be- 
cause the parts read will be selected on account of the per- 
sonal interest the individuals have in them. A teacher will 
be making a good use of her time if she insists upon each pupil 
who wishes to read during the pleasure period, giving her a 
private demonstration of the skill and effectiveness with 
which he can read the part he has selected. Occasionally a 
pupil may be encouraged to tell parts of the story, reading 
only here and there; if this plan is followed, the pupil might 
be permitted to tell the story up to the dramatic point. The 
book should then be left in some convenient place so that those
-P-A-G-E-240
  196 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
who have been caught by the story may have an opportunity 
to finish it. Many teachers are helping pupils and parents 
to get at club rates attractive magazines for home and school 
reading. Every school should be the vublic-librarv centre 
for the community. 
All private reading should be encouraged for two reasons: 
(x) That it may be controlled and directed until the pupils 
have acquired an ability to choose intelligently their own 
material for independent reading; (2) that the pupils may be 
stimulated to read much in many fields. There is an old 
saying that we had better be a master of one book than a 
master of none. The statement is true only when that one 
book is a good book. It is certainly better to know many 
books, to have a kind of cosmopolitan interest in the various 
fields of literary endeavor, than to spend one’s time mulling 
over one or two books. This wider knowledge and familiarity 
with books the school can give. 
Professor Chubb in “‘The Teaching of English,” published 
by the Macmillan Co., a most admirable book for teachers, 
advises the elimination of three types of reading material 
from the grammar grades: (1) Whatever is touched with the 
more conscious reflective sentiment of adult love (e. g., in 
“Enoch Arden” and in “TIdylls of the King”); (2) whatever 
is bathed in an atmosphere of settled gloom—many of Haw- 
thorne’s stories; and (3) whatever leads to the more solemn 
and darker mysteries of life. He recommends that outside 
reading in the grammar grades consist at times (a) of tasta- 
ble books, like “‘ Alice in Wonderland,” or Irving’s “ Sketch- 
Book,” or “Alhambra,” or “ Knickerbocker’s New York,” or 
the “Boys’ King Arthur”; (6) of read-to-the finish books, 
like “Ivanhoe,” or “The Talisman,” or “Westward Ho,” or 
“The Pied Piper,” or ‘‘The Lady of the Lake”; (c) of read- 
carefully-every-word books, like some of the “Wayside Inn 
Stories,” ‘Snowbound,” “The Great Stone Face,” Gray’s 
“Elegy,” “Deserted Village.”

Applicability of Existing Scales and Tests in Reading.— 
We have at our command several tests and scales for the 
measurement of ability in reading. No one of the series of 
tests yet devised for the measurement of efficiency in reading 
combines all the requisites of a good scale—uniformity of test 
material, standards in rate and its measurement, test of com- 
prehension, and a practical method of scoring results, but they 
are all of such value as to merit the approval of teachers. 
For instance, the primary purpose of the Courtis test! is to 
test speed; of the Thorndike? scale, comprehension; of the 
Pinter* tests, the value of oral and silent reading in relation 
to speed. Dr. W. S. Gray has published a large monograph 
on “Studies of Elementary-School Reading Through Stan- 
dardized Tests,” University of Chicago Press, and has con- 
tributed a suggestive discussion to the sixteenth year-book 
of the National Society for the Study of Education.* 
Speed in Silent Reading 
Mr. S. A. Courtis and Mr. Daniel Starch have both arrived 
at what they deem fair standards for speed in réading by 
means of extensive experiments. Speed is measured by the 
number of words of a given type of material that students can 
read silently in a given unit of time. The two scales stand 
as follows:

198 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
From this it will be seen that Mr. Courtis maintains that 
a pupil of the sixth grade in normal reading should be able to 
read 220 words of simple prose a minute, while Mr. Starch 
places a lower estimate—only 192 words. The actual rates 
which each found in the schools tested from which the stand- 
ards were evolved are as follows: 
GRADE 
  
Starch (words per minute) 
Courtis (words per minute) 
  The difference in the standards set by Mr. Starch and 
Mr. Courtis is doubtless due to the differing conditions gov- 
erning the tests. The pupils whom Mr. Starch tested knew 
that their ability to comprehend, as well as their speed, was 
being tested. Those tested by Mr. Courtis were simply told 
to read as they usually did. It is, however, interesting to 
note that a similar test to that of Mr. Starch, given by H. 
A. Brown, in seven schools, produced almost identical results 
—the pupils of the sixth grade read 3.17 words per second, 
or 190 words per minute.! From this it would seem safe to 
conclude that every teacher should be expected to bring her 
pupils up to the standard set by Mr. Starch.? She should 
aspire to the higher standard, for as Mr. Courtis explains, 
that degree of skill is needed for social efficiency, and is de- 
manded of the ordinary adult. 
Measures of Comprehension.—Professor Thorndike has 
prepared scales designed to measure visual vocabulary and 
the understanding of words and sentences.* The scale for 
testing the visual vocabulary indicates the child’s ability to 
classify words which he sees, and consists of a series of unre- 
lated words arranged in lines, the words in each line being of

READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 199 
approximately equal difficulty, and the lines differing from 
each other by equal degrees of difficulty. The line, which a 
pupil or grade can give 80 per cent correctly is considered to 
be the degree of difficulty which that child or grade is capable 
of handling. 
The scale for measuring the understanding of sentences 
or paragraphs is equally exact. Paragraphs varying by equal 
degrees of difficulty are arranged in a series. The pupils are 
required to read the paragraphs and to answer a series of 
questions based upon the paragraphs. Each child’s score is 
in terms of his ability to answer these questions. Such scales 
have many advantages. The supervisor can say, after using 
them, that the fourth grade of the West Side School can read 
literature or text-books of the difficulty of ‘‘Set 6” (a series 
of paragraphs in the scale); while the fourth grade on the 
North Side can only read paragraphs of a little greater diffi- 
culty than “Set 4.” A discovery of this sort should be 
followed by a careful diagnosis of the conditions. The super- 
visor must determine what should be done. It may be neces- 
sary to reclassify the pupils on the basis of their abilities, to 
change text-books, or to modify the methods of instruction. 
At any rate the teacher and supervisor have at their command 
a device which will enable them to discover the strengths and 
weaknesses of classes and schools so far as reading is con- 
cerned.

Wisconsin, in fifteen schools,! a second set used by Superinten-

by H. A. Brown,‘ and a fifth by F. J. Kelly*—all present 
schemes by which the comprehension may be tested in con- 
nection with the speed in reading. In each case the pupil is

asked to reproduce in writing that which he has read. The 
methods for scoring reproduction vary. Some count the 
total number of written words correctly expressing the 
thought,! others count the number of ideas correctly repro- 
duced. The chief objection to the former lies in the fact 
that some pupils express themselves more tersely than others, 
and to the latter in the fact that difficulty is experienced in 
determining just what constitutes one idea. The advocates 
of either plan, however, prove quite conclusively that these 
conditions have little weight. Probably the simplest and 
best test at the present writing (1917) is that devised by 
Mr. S. H. Courtis, of the Detroit, Mich., public schools. 
Index of Reading Efficiency.—One of the most accurate 
and most elaborate methods of scoring is that used by Mr. 
H. A. Brown, deputy state superintendent of New Hamp- 
shire. In ranking a pupil, he takes into consideration the 
rate of reading, the quantity of reproduction, and the quality 
of reproduction—the three combined make up an arbitrary 
unit of reading efficiency. The mathematical computations 
which he employs are extremely simple and are clearly ex- 
plained by him.* The following is a table of results which 
he secured in testing the third grade of the city schools:

  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 201 
A glance at this table reveals at once that the grades which 
rank higher in speed are not necessarily excellent in general 
reading efficiency—School E, for example. The teacher who 
uses this method of checking can discover whether her room 
is below par in the speed element or in the comprehension 
element. If she is striving for rate improvement, she can see 
by the use of this test, whether she is doing so at the expense 
of comprehension. One might infer that such was the case 
in School G, which had a very large quantity of reproduc- 
tion, but exceedingly poor quality. The use of Mr. Brown’s 
scoring method will show the teacher where she needs to lay 
the emphasis. Indeed, Mr. Brown believes that he has dis- 
covered that the different types of teaching bring widely 
different results in the three factors of silent-reading efficiency. 
He expresses the conviction: “ It cannot be pointed out too 
often that reading is more than mere word pronunciation. 
It is feared that some of our prevailing methods of instruction 
in primary reading are faulty for the reason that undue em- 
phasis is placed on too rapid and too complete mastery of the 
difficulties of word pronunciation in the earliest stages of 
reading at the expense of apperceptive and assimilative activi- 
ties, and that this type of teaching produces a pronounced 
word consciousness and a confirmed habit of reading words 
instead of thoughts from the printed page.” ! 
Just how much oral reading is a help rather than a hin- 
drance ought to be determined. If a teacher finds her grade 
below the average in reading efficiency according to Mr. 
Brown’s method and suspects that too much attention has 
been given in her grade and preceding ones to oral reading, 
she should drop it for a time, and devote her efforts to train- 
ing the pupils in more efficient silent reading. 
Materials to Be Used in Testing.—A practical question for 
every teacher is what material may be used to test children. 
Mr. Courtis chose a piece of simple prose for conducting his 
speed tests. Mr. Waldo used selections from the school 
1 Elementary School Teacher, June, 1914, p. 489. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
    
202 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
paper, Current Events, which the pupils were accustomed to 
reading. Mr. E. E. Oberholtzer suggests that the children 
may use their own text-books, and may be tested in regard 
to speed and ability to reproduce with the following kinds of 
passages: (1) A familiar passage read some time before; (2) a 
familiar passage read recently; (3) a new easy passage; (4) 
a new difficult passage.””!_ Average together the results which 
are secured from these passages to get the ability in silent 
reading. Mr. Oberholtzer chooses passages that require two 
minutes to read. 
The plan of giving a test intended for one grade to the 
grade either above or below was adopted by Mr. Starch for 
purposes of comparison. He offers a graded series of passages 
as test material. These passages, eight in all, have been 
chosen from typical readers of the eight grades. But immedi- 
ately the question arises—how are we to feel sure that the 
readers differ from each other by equal degrees of difficulty? 
The only assurance we have is that the results of the test in 
all of the schools combined indicate a steady increase in ability 
to read the passages from the first to the eighth grade—a 
smooth curve rising at a fairly uniform rate. 
Time Consumed in Testing.—Another attractive feature 
of the scale is that each passage is of such length as to take 
the brightest pupil a little more than thirty (30) seconds to 
read. If thirty seconds is long enough to insure reliability, the 
test becomes doubly practical. In order to be sure in this 
matter, Mr. Starch conducted some tests upon three different 
sets of passages of varying lengths, and found that an indi- 
vidual’s rank is nearly the same in all three. For ordinary 
purposes, then, it would seem that the interval of thirty sec- 
onds is sufficient to insure a fair measure of reliability. Mr. 
Starch says: ‘‘The speed of reading is determined by ascer- 
taining the number of words read per second. This can be 
done very rapidly by having a blank on which is indicated 
the number of words to the end of the line. By this blank 
1 The Elementary School Journal, February, 1915, p. 315.
-P-A-G-E-247
READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 203 
the total number of words read can be determined almost 
instantaneously. Dividing by thirty will give the speed of 
reading per second. The comprehension is determined by 
counting the number of words written which correctly repro- 
duce the thought.” 
Values of the Tests and Scales.—The various units and 
scales thus far devised for measuring achievement in reading 
are of value to pupils and teachers and superintendents. 
They will enable pupils to compete with their past records; 
they set definite standards of attainment for teachers and 
will enable them to measure more accurately the work of indi- 
vidual pupils. Adjustments of materials and methods can 
thus be made more nearly in accord with the needs of pupils. 
Superintendents can use these tests and scales as devices for 
comparing the achievements of different rooms, the stand- 
ards that should be attained by pupils of different ages, and 
relative merits of different methods of instruction. 
SUMMARY 
1. Rapid and accurate interpretation of the printed page up to a 
reasonable standard is a minimal and common essential of the 
educative process to-day. 
2. Instead of training pupils to read by reading the various subjects 
of study, such as geography and history, the subject of reading 
has had connected with it the subject of “literature,” largely 
fiction, and principally directed toward developing certain 
miscellaneous ideals and other emotional changes rather than 
furnishing information. 
3. The problem of reading is principally to develop at an early age 
skill in silent reading and to furnish children with such reading 
material as will lead them voluntarily to read enough to fix 
certain habits and interests in reading for life. Other aims, 
such as appreciation of good literature, skill in oral reading, 
getting magazines and books into the homes, and furnishing 
the great ideals necessary to vital, vocational, avocational, 
civic, and moral efficiency have conventionally been added to 
the fundamental aim. 
   
-P-A-G-E-248
204 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
4. By the time children have reached the intermediate grades they 
should be able to read widely for pleasure and information. 
Stories have been used to draw children into the delights of 
reading, but informational matter as found in books, magazines, 
and newspapers, and as constructed by the children themselves 
is being used in many schools. 
5. Various aids to teachers in giving instruction in oral and silent 
reading are suggested in connection with position and articula- 
tion in oral reading and the use of the dictionary, making in- 
telligent assignments, utilizing the dramatic instinct, reading 
memory gems, and directing private and home reading for 
silent and oral reading. 
6. Remarkable progress has been made in measuring reading ability, 
especially silent reading, and setting reasonably attainable 
standards of speed and comprehension for each grade. When 
we know what good teachers with typical children can accom- 
plish with certain methods, texts, and devices, and can mea- 
sure these accomplishments accurately, then we can begin to 
put at the disposal of all teachers definite standards and the 
best methods of helping children to attain to them. 
7. Thorndike, Kelly, Brown, Gray, Courtis, Starch, and others have 
organized and improved standard tests of reading ability. 
There are tests of knowledge of vocabulary, of comprehension, 
of oral-reading ability, and other abilities connected with read- 
ing. Mr. S. A. Courtis has, at the time of this writing, devised 
very easily applied and accurate tests of silent reading. The 
teacher should learn what are the latest and best tests and use 
them, thus measuring not only the ability of her pupils but 
of her own, and the teachers who have previously taught her 
group. 
8. Training in silent reading is being very greatly emphasized in these 
tests and investigations. The art of oral reading and decla- 
mation will be less emphasized, while silent reading and public 
speaking will more largely take their place. Recitations in 
reading will become more like recitations in the content, or 
knowledge, subjects. / It is probable that continued oral read- 
ing weakens pupils for the rapid_and thorough reading they 
need to do out of school as children and,adults, while training 
in silent reading promotes these abilities,

READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 205 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
1. Learn what is the best test in silent reading for pupils of your grade; 
send for enough copies of the test; and test your pupils in speed 
and comprehension with it. 
2. Take Gray’s oral reading test as given in his “Studies of Elemen- 
tary-School Reading through Standardized Tests” and compare 
results with it and those obtained by your silent-reading test. 
3. What conclusions as to facts and as to methods do you draw from 
the following comparison of rates of oral and silent reading as 
made by Oberholtzer (Elementary School Journal, 15, February, 
1915), after a study of rates for 1,800 pupils. Results are 
given as number of words read per second. What would be 
differences in words for an hour’s reading if the rate were con- 
stant ? 
Grade. . 
  
Oral-reading rate. 
  
Silent-reading rate 
  4. What arguments for silent reading does Gray make in his mono- 
graph in the “Sixteenth Year-Book of the National Society 
for the Study of Education” (Public School Publishing Com- 
pany, Bloomington, Ill.)? Are they valid? What shall be 
the place of oral reading? 
5. In the same volume take the graded list of children’s library books 
for schools as worked out by Munson and Hoskinson, check 
the list for one grade or group of grades and mark any you 
find that should not be offered pupils of those grades and 
write down any books you think should be included. 
6. What good methods have you seen used for getting either a gen- 
eral public or a school library located at a public school? 
What responsibility has a teacher of reading for the outside 
reading of the children and adults of the community? 
7. In some high schools the separate period for English is being given 
up while correct English is being emphasized in all classes, and 
any teacher feels free to bring in fiction with which to cultivate 
ideals and appreciations along the line of his subject. Do you 
know of any attempts to give up separate reading classes in 
the elementary school? Are they successful? 
8. What function of reading is being partly cared for by the motion 
picture for many children?

all should thoroughly learn? 
I. Intropuction 
The General Problem.—The general problem of teaching 
arithmetic is not a particularly complex one. If we seek 
merely the ability to perform those calculations which are 
needed by the average citizen in his daily life, this ability can 
be imparted to the child without any great difficulty. The 
problem is far easier of solution than is that of teaching Eng- 
207
-P-A-G-E-252
  208 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
lish, biology, or history, because it is much simpler and more 
direct. It is true that we have complicated it in all sorts of 
ways, trying to use arithmetic as a cover for various other 
subjects, and in doing this we have made the work unneces- 
sarily difficult; but the subject itself, so far as it involves 
merely the ability to do practical calculations, is relatively 
simple. The average citizen needs to know how to add, sub- 
tract, multiply, and divide whole numbers. This is the chief 
thing that he is called upon to do in arithmetic, unless we add 
thereto the adding and subtracting of decimal fractions as 
shown in the case of United States money. Next in order 
will probably come the ability to find a fractional part of a 
number, say of 16 inches. Next will come, perhaps, the find- 
ing of some per cent of a number, say 5% of $125. And 
next, the citizen will need to know how to multiply and 
divide a mixed decimal (dollars and cents) by a whole num- 
ber. Given this equipment, the average person will get 
along very well so far as mere practical calculation is concerned. 
If we were certain that children when they leave school could 
perform these operations with perfect accuracy and fair 
rapidity we might be reasonably well satisfied, and we should 
not hear the continual complaint that our pupils are weak in 
the essentials of arithmetic. 
So much for these essentials. Surely, with six or eight 
years at our command, we should bring the children to such 
proficiency in these processes as to leave no ground for re- 
proach. That we fail to do this is because we encumber it 
unnecessarily with other features, manufacturing trouble 
without any real justification for it. 
Troubles.—Now what are these troubles which we pile 
up before the children? Some are more or less necessary, 
while others are quite the reverse. In the first place, we take 
about a year in which to teach fractions. Some of this work 
is necessary, particularly the case above mentioned, that of 
finding a fractional part of a number. But will any reader 
of this page ask himself when he last had occasion to add two
-P-A-G-E-253
ARITHMETIC 209 
fractions like % and %, or when he last heard of any one else 
doing so? And, having answered that, will he ask when he 
last had occasion to subtract, say % from 4? or to multiply 
these fractions together? or to divide one by the other? and 
when he last heard of any one doing so? And, after these 
questions have been answered to his satisfaction, will he ask 
himself when he was last called upon to divide one decimal 
fraction by another? or to add, let us say 15 gal. 1 qt. to s gal. 
2 qt.? or to multiply 18 Ib. 12 oz. by 7 
This does not mean that we can give up the teuslohe of 
fractions and compound numbers. We have to do more or 
less of this work for the benefit of the few who will use it, 
knowing all the time that the child must learn it while young 
or he will never master it, and realizing that, even if he does 
not use it, he is having continued drill in calculation while 
studying it. But the object of the remark is to show that 
there are relative values in arithmetic, and that these values 
are not sufficiently recognized. We tend to teach the divi- 
sion of one fraction by another, which not one person in a 
thousand ever uses, as if it were equally as important as 
addition, which every one uses frequently. The fact is, we 
overemphasize the importance of fractions and compound 
numbers, and we underestimate the relative value of the 
more necessary part of arithmetic mentioned above. 
What has been said of certain of these processes, however, 
becomes more serious when we contemplate the fact that a 
considerable part of our work with fractions often includes 
such cases as %s X 1%s5 and 2%; + %7, cases which are wholly 
unwarranted either by the demands of business or by sound 
educational principles, except as a few problems may be 
given as curious examples. 
When we consider the applications of arithmetic we find 
an even greater lack of appreciation of relative values, and 
of these there will be mention later in this chapter. 
Let it suffice, therefore, to repeat that the problem of 
teaching the essentials of arithmetic is not a difficult one.   
     
-P-A-G-E-254
    
210 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
We must teach some things which are not essential to the great 
body of people; but, once we understand something of rela- 
tive values, we may place the emphasis where it more properly 
belongs, feeling less concerned with perfection in such rela- 
tively unimportant topics as must still have place in our 
schools. 
A General Survey of the Curriculum.—There are so many 
variants of the curriculum in arithmetic that it might at first 
seem a hopeless task to try to find any points of agreement. 
In reality, however, there is more agreement on the large 
questions than one would think at first sight. The lack of 
uniformity is most apparent in minor matters, usually of no 
great consequence. 
The curriculum of the first four years is quite the same, 
so far as its large features go, in all leading countries. At 
the close of the fourth school year the child is supposed to 
know the four operations with integers, the meaning of frac- 
tions, the most common tables of measures, and the meaning ~ 
of the decimal point in the writing of certain denominate 
numbers (in our country,. United States money). An exami- 
nation of the courses of study in all of these countries shows 
this practical uniformity. In some places there will be in- 
cluded the four operations with simple common fractions; 
in others, two operations are required; while in others a little 
more attention is given to decimal forms (as in multiplying 
United States money). But the great features are the same, 
and these should not be obscured. 
After the first four grades America rapidly falls behind 
the other leading nations. Our general plan is to make com- 
mon fractions the central feature in Grade V, decimal frac- 
tions and some percentage in Grade VI, percentage and its 
applications in Grade VII, and business arithmetic in Grade 
VIII. This is more or less varied, however. For example, 
one of our best courses of study makes decimal fractions the 
centre in Grade V, and common fractions in Grade VI. Of 
course, the pupils acquire some knowledge of common frac-
-P-A-G-E-255
ARITHMETIC 211 
tions in Grade IV, so that this arrangement is entirely feasi- 
ble. Furthermore, many schools join a considerable amount 
of work in the applications of percentage to the work in 
Grade VI, a desirable thing to do, particularly in view of the 
fact that the Junior High School will probably reduce, by at 
least half, the arithmetic of Grades VII and VIII. But ina 
large way the curriculum is about what has been set forth 
above. 
As stated above, the United States begins to fall behind 
other countries in Grade V. There are several reasons for 
this; but since the same conditions are found in relation to 
other subjects, these reasons should be studied in connection 
with the general problem rather than in a chapter on the 
teaching of some particular subject. The nature of the work 
in the various school years will be considered later. 
Method.—A generation ago the subject of methods played 
a more prominent réle than it does at the present time. 
Every normal school had as its central feature the work in 
methods. Usually the courses in this subject did little more, 
with respect to teaching arithmetic, than give to the prospec- 
tive teachers just what any good text-book would give, 
namely, the explanations of the various topics and operations. 
Occasionally some enthusiastic teacher would venture upon 
some supposedly new plan of teaching this thing or that; 
frequently ideas would: be advanced which had long before 
been discarded as impracticable; but in spite of it all the 
courses did much good because they concentrated the atten- 
tion of the novice upon the chief difficulties of the subject. 
At present there is a more scholarly idea of methods than 
was formerly found in educational circles. Teachers have 
grown suspicious of those who magnify the little methods 
which they may have devised for teaching any subject. The 
impression has become well established that one of the easi- 
est things in the teaching of arithmetic is the creation of 
“Method”’—and one of the most useless. We may start off 
upon the idea that all number is measure, and hence that
-P-A-G-E-256
  212 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
arithmetic must consist of measuring everything in sight— 
and we have a “Measuring Method.” It will be a narrow 
idea; we shall neglect much that is important; but if we put 
energy back of it we shall attract attention and will very 
likely turn out better computers than a poor teacher will 
who is wise enough to have no “Method” in this narrow sense 
of the term. Again, we may say that every number is a frac- 
tion, the numerator being an integral multiple of the de- 
nominator in the case of whole numbers. From this assump- 
tion we may proceed to teach arithmetic only as the science 
of fractions. It will be hard work, but, given enough energy 
and patience and skill, the children will survive it and will 
learn more of arithmetic than may be the case with listless 
teaching on a better plan. We might also start with the 
idea that every lesson should be a unit, and that in it should 
come every process of arithmetic, so far as this is possible, 
and we could stir up a good deal of interest in our “Unit 
Method.”’ Or, again, we could begin with the idea that all 
action demands reaction, and that every lesson containing 
additfon should also contain subtraction; that 6 + 4 = 10 
should be followed by 10 — 6 = 4 and 10 — 4 = 6; and that 
2X5 = 10 should be followed by to+2=5 and 
Io +5 = 2. By sufficient ingenuity a very taking scheme 
could be evolved, and the ‘“‘Inverse Method” would begin to 
make a brief stir in the world. This, in fact, has been the 
genesis, rise, and decline of methods; given a strong but 
narrow-minded personality, with some little idea such as 
those above mentioned, this idea is exploited as a panacea; 
it creates some little stir in circles more or less local; it is 
tried ‘in a greater or less number of schools; the author and 
his pupils die; and in due time the method is remembered, 
if at all, only by some inscription in those pedagogical grave- 
yards known as histories of education. 
The object in writing thus is manifest. For the teacher 
with but little experience there is a valuable lesson, namely, 
that there is no “Method” that will lead to easy victory in
-P-A-G-E-257
ARITHMETIC 213 
the teaching of arithmetic. There are a few great principles 
that may well be taken to heart, but any single narrow plan 
and any single line of material will be fatal to the best success. 
In this same spirit the National Education Association only 
a few years ago expressed itself as follows: “The complaints 
of business men that pupils from the schools are inaccurate 
in results and careless of details is a criticism that should be 
removed. The principles of sound and accurate training are 
as fixed as natural laws, and should be insistently followed. 
Ill-considered experiments and indiscriminate methodizing 
should be abandoned, and attention devoted to the persever- 
ing and continuous drill necessary for accurate and efficient 
training; and we hold that no course of study in any public 
school should be so advanced or so rigid as to prevent instruc- 
tion to any student, who may need it, in the essential and 
practical parts of the common English branches.” 
Eccentricities in Teaching.—Before considering the work 
in detail, a word should be said as to those eccentricities of 
teaching which constantly appear and which tend to cloud 
the general problem. It is necessary that the world should 
continue to experiment if it would continue to advance. But 
it is not necessary that it-should continue to try experiments 
which have been repeated hundreds of times and which have 
been proved unsuited to the needs of the general body of 
teachers. Any method, mode, device—call it what we will, 
is likely to succeed with the individual who feels himself the 
author of it, because it is put forward with the enthusiasm of 
a zealot; but for the profession at large the great mass of 
these minor devices are of value only as suggestions for oc- 
casional use. 
In particular, a method like that of Grube is certain to 
fail because it is based upon a false idea, namely, that every 
number should be thoroughly known before the child pro- 
ceeds to the next one. Great teacher as Pestalozzi was, his 
idea of consciously treating every number as a collection 
of units, asin 2X 1+5X1=7 X 1, was too narrow to  
-P-A-G-E-258
  214 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
admit of general success. Enthusiast as Tillich was, his plan 
of continually using sticks of various lengths in teaching num- 
ber relations was not a good one for the schools at large; it 
was suggestive of occasional development work, but it was a 
very stupid method for constant use. So the habit of always 
being tied to some particular number table, or style of frac- 
tion disk, or box of blocks, or sets of cards, is a bad one. 
These devices have their place, but it is not desirable to be 
eccentric in their use. The same thing may be said of oral 
arithmetic; it is not merely desirable to have it, but it is 
essential to the pupil’s success. But when some school 
authority demands that there should be no written work 
whatever in the first four years, an eccentricity of judgment 
is apparent. A few years ago there was the same eccentricity 
of having no arithmetic in the first school year, and some even 
advocated its elimination in the first two or even three years. 
Like all such extremes, this has passed away, and at present 
we merely hear that it should be taught “incidentally,” “as 
it naturally arises,” or “as it functions in the life of the child” 
—this last being a particularly pleasing phrase in educational 
gatherings. This particular eccentricity arose, as many others 
have, as a protest against an evil; arithmetic had been stu- 
pidly and too formally taught in Grade I, and hence the edu- 
cator comes along and pursues his usual course of saying: 
“Let us cut it all out.” He has done that so often that the 
world is getting used to it; he is continually doing it for 
algebra, grammar, physiology, ancient history, and various 
other subjects—always seeking to destroy, rarely seeking to 
remedy defects. 
At present the prevailing ideas of those whose interest 
lies rather in pedagogy than in mathematics relate to measure- 
ment of efficiency and to problem material which concerns 
only the immediate needs of the child. The former has re- 
sulted in such plans as the Courtis tests, the most scientifically 
worked out of any similar devices for measuring the work of 
any given grade in arithmetic. A school will do well to adopt
-P-A-G-E-259
  ARITHMETIC 215 
tests of this character so long as it recognizes that the results 
are averages, and that we cannot expect to bring all pupils 
up to these standards. The relating of all problem material 
to the immediate needs of children is not so easily sanctioned, 
since in its ultimate analysis it would take away much of the 
preparation which the schools must give for after life. 
II. ArriTHMETIC IN THE LOWER GRADES 
The Present Interest in the Subject.'—There is no sub- 
ject in the curriculum of the elementary school that is excit- 
ing more interest to-day than arithmetic. Yet, although the 
subject has been studied, experimented upon, and discussed 
for a great many years, there is no uniformity of opinion 
concerning some of the great principles of its teaching. 
It was not until the time of Pestalozzi that any serious 
attempt was made to teach arithmetic to young children, and 
as a result of the work of this great teacher the subject began 
to appear much earlier in the school course. Pestalozzi made 
arithmetic attractive to young children by making the sub- 
ject real to them by means of objects and by appeal to their 
every-day interests. 
Professor Henry Suzzallo, in his little book on “The Teach- 
ing of Primary Arithmetic,” says of present-day arithmetic 
teaching that “The grind of sheer mechanical drill decreases 
in teaching, and a reasoned understanding of relations, in 
some degree at least, is substituted. Artificial motives and 
incentives are less frequently used to get work done, while 
the quantitative needs of the child’s life and the intrinsic in- 
terest of children in the institutional occupations of their 
elders provide a more vital motive for the use of arith- 
metic.” 
Value of Experience.—Because of the great variety of 
opinions concerning the teaching of arithmetic, the best that 
teachers of the subject can do is to learn what experiments 
1 This section was written by Miss Worden.
-P-A-G-E-260
  216 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
have been made, and what results have been secured with the 
best-known methods, and then be guided accordingly. As 
Mr. S. A. Courtis says in his “ Better Teaching of Arithmetic,” 
“Ours is the fortunate day of a new ideal. On every side is 
heard the insistent demand for a scientific survey, not only 
of education, but of every form of social activity that makes 
for human betterment.” 
There have been all sorts of experiments in primary 
arithmetic, some going to one extreme and some to another, 
the tendency to follow a new fad being quite evident in text- 
books and courses of study which have appeared from time 
to time. A comparative study of courses of mathematics 
and results obtained, both in this country and Europe, should 
give us valuable assistance in determining the answers to 
such questions as: When shall we begin the study of arith- 
metic? How shall we teach the subject? And how much 
shall we require of the child? 
Such a thorough study of ways and means as was made 
by the teachers at Connersville, Ind., when getting out their 
course of study in mathematics, should be of valuable assis- 
tance to the progressive teacher who, in the light of modern 
psychology, pedagogy, and child-study, desires to make his 
work most profitable for the child. 
Experience Abroad.—Any one who knows about the amount 
of mathematical attainment of children in European coun- 
tries will admit that they are much in advance of children of 
the same age in the United States. As a consequence, when 
the European child is ready to leave the elementary school he 
is much better trained. Of course, there are many things to 
take into consideration in making such a comparison, such as 
the employment of better-trained teachers generally, and the 
shorter vacations, while even the general use of the metric 
system of weights and measures is proved to be consider- 
able of a time-saver. The valuable investigations of J. C. 
Brown, president of the State Normal School, Winona, 
Minn., on comparative attainments of European and Ameri-
-P-A-G-E-261
ARITHMETIC 217 
  can pupils in mathematics bring out this fact very clearly. 
‘They bring out the question as to what there is in their sys- 
tem that is worthy of imitation, and lead us to ask if our 
schools are so organized and our conditions are such that we 
can adopt the method used abroad. 
When Arithmetic Should Begin.—Let us discuss the 
question first as to when the child should begin the study of 
formal arithmetic. “Not to put arithmetic as a topic in the 
first grade is to make sure that it will not be seriously or sys- 
tematically taught there in nine-tenths of the schools of the 
country. The average teacher, not in the cities merely but 
throughout the country generally, will simply touch upon it 
in the most perfunctory way. Whatever of scientific statis- 
tics we have show that this is true, and that children so taught 
are not as well prepared when they enter the intermediate 
grades in arithmetic as those who have studied the subject 
as a topic from the first grade on.” ? 
J. C. Brown, in his investigations mentioned above, data 
for which were secured from the reports of the International 
Commission on the Teaching of Mathematics, finds that in 
almost every country in Europe arithmetic from four to six 
periods a week is required of all children the first year in school, 
and in almost every country children enter the first year be- 
tween the ages of six and seven years, the notable exceptions 
being Finland and Russia, where children enter between the 
ages of seven and eight. And so we should find it if we exam- 
ined the courses of study of the most progressive cities and 
states in our own country. Social and economic conditions 
in this country are very naturally having their effects upon 
the school and in no particular branch is this more evident 
than in the arithmetic required in the best courses of study. 
Mr. Brown found that in Europe there was great variety as

bers of the International Commission on the Teaching of Mathematics, and 
was published by the United States Bureau of Education in 1914.

  218 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  to just what was to be required during that first year, but 
practical uniformity in requiring much oral work. The daily 
drill in mathematics is provided in almost every course from 
which reports were obtained. 
The committees at Connersville mentioned above, which 
were appointed to draw up a course in mathematics for that 
city, examined seventy-eight courses of study from thirty- 
three states, and in sixty-one of them arithmetic was required 
in the first grade. This committee, in addition to the study 
made of courses from other schools, consulted with teachers 
and business men before making their recommendations, so 
we may feel sure that the work was very carefully planned 
and is entirely reliable. 
Importance of Oral Work.—The question as to the general 
principles of teaching the young child is one upon which there 
is more agreement. To be sure, we have had all sorts of fads 
and devices which have appeared from time to time, as, for 
example, the intensive study of one number as it is taken up, 
so well illustrated in the Grube method. There have also 
been such efforts as the Speer method, the extreme spiral 
method, and the visualizing method, all of which have had 
their value and have helped to better the teaching of this 
important subject in spite of the extreme views of their advo- 
cates. No one believes that any one of these methods is safe 
in itself, but each has its good features. Upon one thing, 
however, all writers now agree, namely, that the primary 
work should be largely oral. Superintendents, supervisors, 
and county overseers have considerable difficulty, especially 
with untrained teachers, in this particular. It is well known 
that it requires more effort onthe part of the teacher to con- 
duct a good oral lesson than to assign written work for pupils 
to do either on the blackboard or at their seats, but it is vital 
to good work, and the teacher who cannot carry it on success- 
fully is sure to fail. 
Furthermore, there is the important question of time. 
In the rural school, where the teacher has but a few minutes,
-P-A-G-E-263
- ARITHMETIC 219 
often only ten, for her primary class each day, it is much more 
difficult to make satisfactory progress in a subject when the 
work is largely oral. But in spite of the difficulties of teach- 
ing the subject in this way it is generally agreed that oral 
work should have great prominence in the early study of the 
subject. 
Lack of Preparation.—The writer, having taught in a 
State normal school for a number of years, and having had 
considerable experience in the preparation of young people 
to teach in both country and city schools, knows something 
of the lack of preparation of even our supposedly trained 
teachers in arithmetic. Time that should be spent in the 
study of general principles and methods has often to be de- 
voted to academic work, even high-school graduates being 
often found who do not know the forty-five combinations 
either in addition or in multiplication so that they can give 
them quickly. The country-trained children, who often are 
preparing to go back into the country to teach, are even worse 
off. What kind of rapid oral drill will they be able to give a 
primary class in arithmetic? They have been poorly trained 
themselves, and a term of from ten to twenty weeks in a 
normal school in professional arithmetic cannot do every- 
thing that is necessary to overcome their lack of training in 
earlier years. The next generation, however, with earnest 
effort on the part of our conscientious young teachers, will 
show great improvement in these particulars. Time now 
being spent in normal schools on academic work which belongs 
in the elementary school can then be given more largely to 
professional training. 
Use of Objects.—Another feature which is generally ac- 
cepted in the methods of teaching primary arithmetic is the 
constant employment of objects in the beginning of the work. 
Great care must be exercised, however, that this object- 
teaching is not carried too far, for a child must not be kept 
on a milk-and-water diet when he is ready for solid food. 
As the young mind requires frequent change, the teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  
220 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
should remember this fact in preparing her lessons, and should 
vary her class work accordingly. There are many excel- 
lent aids and suggestions which will be helpful to her, and 
which may be secured at little or no expense. In early life 
the desire to play games is a strong one, and an appeal to this 
side of the child’s nature always meets with a ready response 
and gives the teacher opportunity to vary her lessons. Many 
a child has been interested to learn numbers so that he might 
play dominoes with an older brother or sister, and many a 
boy has maintained his interest in percentage in order to learn 
how to compute the baseball percentages. An excellent list 
of games is given in Doctor Smith’s ‘‘Teaching of Arithmetic,” 
Chapter 14. An ingenious teacher, however, can make a game 
of any number lesson by looking upon it as a contest in which 
a score is kept, the class being divided into competing sec- 
tions. The spirit of good-natured rivalry is one to which the 
teacher may often appeal in the primary grades. Great care 
must be exercised, however, that the game idea is not carried 
too far, and that the purpose of the lesson be not forgotten. 
Nature of the Arithmetic.—There has been much com- 
plaint in years past that the kind of arithmetic which children 
have been getting is not the kind that they will use when 
out of school. This criticism has had its effect upon the school 
course, and the result is an elimination of all but the essen- 
tials, and a demand that these essentials shall be thoroughly 
mastered. Too much emphasis cannot be put upon the im- 
portance of frequent reviews and daily drill. The results of 
an investigation of J. C. Brown, published in the Journal of 
Educational Psychology a few years ago, may be of interest 
here. He showed the comparative progress of two classes as 
nearly alike as possible, one class having a daily drill period 
of five minutes on fundamental operations and the other not. 
The result showed that the class with the drill period increased 
its speed as well as its accuracy, the drill seeming to act as a 
sort of tonic. The. effect upon the poorer students was es- 
pecially noticeable, and after the long vacation another test
-P-A-G-E-265
  ARITHMETIC 221 
showed that the drill class had retained the number relations 
much better than the non-drill class. 
Changes in Teaching.—The changes in teaching brought 
about during the last few years have come through pressure 
brought to bear from both within and without the school. 
A scientific study of methods and of the development of the 
child has brought about changes coming from the school it- 
self, while changes in economic conditions and other facts 
requiring a practical knowledge of the business transactions 
of every-day life have brought about changes coming from out- 
side the school. We no longer hear serious defenders of the 
idea of teaching arithmetic for what was once thought to be 
the best mental discipline. At the present time parents and 
business men are demanding that the school shall prepare 
the child so that when he leaves the elementary school he 
shall be able to do the arithmetic required of the average 
citizen, and do this with accuracy and reasonable rapidity. 
In consequence of these facts our primary arithmetic must be 
largely drill work upon the fundamental operations, and upon 
simple problems that appeal to the life interests of the child. 
In recent years our work in the primary grades has be- 
come more rational. If one steps into the room of a first-class 
teacher of primary arithmetic he may see work quite different 
from that which was common a few years ago. The teacher 
may be conducting a lively oral drill on simple combinations, 
the children being on the alert and ready to answer quickly 
when called upon. In a few moments the work may change 
to some exercises in actual measuring and computing, the 
children moving about the room freely and quietly. Or the 
class may be purchasing the foodstuffs for the day’s luncheon, 
use being made of current prices which have been obtained 
by the children themselves. A part of the hour may be de- 
voted to an interesting game in which a score has to be kept. 
If the class is in the country, problems relating to the farm 
may be the subject of the day, the farm furnishing excellent 
material for such work in arithmetic. The text-book may 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
222 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  be in use, but if so the prices will be revised to suit local con- 
ditions of the day. No long explanations will be required of 
children in the lower grades, but the teacher will be sure 
that the children understand the work and by careful ques- 
tioning will bring out the reasons for the processes used. 
The visitor will find that the teacher always requires accu- 
rate statements, no child, for example, being allowed to state 
that 80 acres of land at $100 per acre will cost $100 times 80 
acres. The teacher will not permit the children to say that 
the area of the schoolyard is 4 rods times 6 rods, or 24 square 
rods, even though such forms have a legitimate place in 
physics. Although children and even high-school students 
write such careless expressions as 2 X 7 = 14 + 4 = 18 + 3 
= 6, the visitor to the model schoolroom will not find work 
of this kind, since it is apparent that 2 X 7 does not equal 
14 + 4, and that this equals neither 18 + 3 nor 6. 
Experience proves that children like to count, to measure, 
and to work with numbers. They like to solve problems 
which appeal to them, for they enjoy the satisfaction of really 
having done something in the line of discovery. The teacher 
may often add interest to an abstract process by showing the 
children what they may do when the new process is learned. 
The writer once saw this idea of anticipation as a stimulus 
used in a class in third-grade arithmetic. The teacher stepped 
to the board and put before the class a problem in the addi- 
tion of three-digit numbers involving carrying, a problem the 
children could not do, and then said:- “How many of you 
would like to learn how to do that?” Of course, they all 
wanted to know how and the teacher began her lesson. 
Splints (which had been used before in the explanation of 
the place value. of numbers) were passed to the children, 
‘less than ten being given to some, groups of tens bound by 
rubber bands being given to others, and bundles of groups 
bound into bunches of hundreds to others. The teacher then 
brought before the class three children—one units’ child, one 
tens’ child, and one hundreds’ child. Numbers were then
-P-A-G-E-267
  
ARITHMETIC 223 
called upon to add their splints to those of the children rep- 
resenting the number before the class. Units’ child was to 
bind ten splints quickly, and pass them to tens’ if he received 
as many as ten, and the tens’ in the same way was to bind and 
pass on to hundreds’. The teacher put down on the black- 
board the results in symbols. The exercise became a sort of 
game, and at the end of the lesson the children had a clear 
idea of how to add and carry. Upon going to their seats some 
problems involving the new principle were given and were 
solved under the direction of the teacher. 
The Study Period.—There is a great advantage in the 
teacher’s having charge of the study period. In this way 
tendencies may be corrected before habits are formed which 
are difficult to break. Furthermore, if the pupil works under 
the direction of the teacher, habits of dawdling may be pre- 
vented, habits which are fatal to good work in arithmetic. 
Let me quote here from an article in the Thirteenth Year 
Book of the National Society for the Study of Education, 
written by E. R. Breslich, of the University High School, 
University of Chicago. Mr. Breslich says: “One of the most 
pressing problems before the educational public at the pres- 
ent time is to find a means of eliminating the enormous waste 
of the time of pupils that results from two conditions which 
prevail in the schools, namely, the failure to provide for the 
individual differences in capacity found among pupils in the 
same class, and failure to organize the studying done by 
pupils so as to avoid the futile efforts which they now put 
forth to master lessons assigned for home work. One of the 
most important factors in solving both parts of this problem 
is the organization of periods for supervised study during 
school hours.”? 
The Pueblo plan or the Batavia system of supervised 
study, although subject to criticism, greatly assists the 
1See also Dearborn’s “How to Learn Easily,’”’ Hall-Quest’s “Supervised 
Study,” Kitson’s “How to Use Your Mind,” and Whipple’s ““How to Study 
Effectively.”  
-P-A-G-E-268
224 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
weaker and slower pupils in making progress. Similar meth- 
ods also provide for the very bright pupils, a class of children 
who have been much neglected in the past, and who are 
rarely considered in most educational discussions even to- 
day. 
This guidance of the study period is much more difficult 
in the country school on account of the lack of time, but it 
is often possible to ask a pupil in the upper grades to act as 
an assistant. The supervisor may often encourage the use 
of short cuts and mental work when, if left alone, the chil- 
dren would use long methods and the pencil. This is espe- 
cially true in text-book work. 
Work to Be Done in the Primary Grades.—The question 
as to just what should be taught in the primary grades, say 
the first four years, is one upon which authorities are not at 
all agreed. In most schools the teacher will find a course 
already planned, which must be followed more or less rigidly. 
The writer suggests the following as only tentative and as 
the result of conclusions drawn after examining many of the 
best courses offered in this country. 
Suggestions for the First Grade.—In this grade the work 
should be based upon counting and be largely oral and mem- 
ory work. Objects should be used very freely, and an at- 
tempt should be made to rationalize the work as far as pos- 
sible. At the end of the year the children should be able to 
count to 100 by 1’s, 2’s, 5’s, and 10’s. The simple combina- 
tions to 10 or 12 should be learned. There is no need to 
limit the upper range, for it is much easier to add 5 and 10 
than 5 and 6. Since children enjoy counting, they may be 
asked to begin with 1 and add by 2’s to 13, or begin with 2 - 
and add by 3’s to 14, and so on with other numbers. At- 
tention may be called very early to endings in addition, as in 
the cases of o+ 5=5, 10 + 5 = 15, andsoon. In this grade 
the Roman numerals, as they come in chapters or lessons, or 
as seen on the clock face, may be taught. 
The fractions ¥ and 4 may be learned in a concrete way.
-P-A-G-E-269
  
ARITHMETIC 225 
Most children know the idea of these fractions when they 
enter school. The foot rule in measuring will give an idea 
of foot, of inch, and perhaps of yard. The teacher should 
always remember that children learn to do by doing. In 
this grade the teacher can develop the idea of number through 
the eye, the ear, and the hand, and can also make use of the 
motor activity of the child. The young teacher will find 
great assistance in Doctor David Eugene Smith’s book on 
“The Teaching of Arithmetic,” in the chapter on “Work of 
the First School Year.” The game element may be ap- 
pealed to early in the first school year, since there are many 
excellent games suitable for this grade. The work of the 
recitation period must be varied for young children, for they 
can be kept interested in one kind of thing for only a short 
time before showing signs of fatigue. Number primers, like 
the Wentworth-Smith ‘City Arithmetic, Grade I,” or the 
“Work and Play with Numbers,” are valuable. Publishers 
of school supplies now have such excellent helps for teachers, 
and at reasonable prices, that most schools now make use 
of such helps all through the primary grades. Number cards, 
fraction disks, number tables, splints, and the like, can be 
procured through any of the large supply houses.! 
Suggestions for the Second Grade.—In the second year 
the reading and writing of numbers to 1,000 should be taught, 
with counting by 2’s, 3’s, 4’s, 5’s, 9’s, and 1o’s. In counting 
by 9’s, the child should notice that he adds one less than 10 
every time, but he should not rely upon this fact in his rapid 
work. In adding columns of numbers, the grouping by tens 
may occasionally help in the accuracy and rapidity of the 
-work. The remainder of the forty-five combinations should 
be learned and should be the subject of daily drill. There 
should be much oral work in this grade, as in all the primary 
grades. When the children have learned to read, a text- 
book may be used to advantage, the text being employed 
1For example, the Educational Equipment Company, 70 Fifth Avenue, 
New York.
-P-A-G-E-270
  
226 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
only as a help to the teacher, and not being looked upon as 
dictating exactly what is to be done. The so-called drama- 
tized occupations, such as buying and selling, may be of use 
in this grade, especially in the city where young children make 
actual purchases more frequently than in the country. The 
coins should be recognized, and the reading and writing of 
dollars and cents should be taught. The fractions %, %, %4, 
and may be applied in such simple problems as these: One- 
half of a gallon equals how may quarts? or, One-third of a 
foot equals how many inches? The actual measures should 
be used in teaching the meaning of such words as pint, quart, 
and gallon. The multiplication tables to about 5 X 10 may 
be learned this year. Additions of two-figure numbers not 
involving carrying may be taught, and the subtraction of such 
numbers may be taken up, preferably by the addition method. 
The addition method of subtraction is not universally used, 
but some schools require it, and it should be familiar to all 
teachers. It is illustrated in the following problem: Sup- 
pose you were to subtract 26 from 88. Instead of saying, 
“6 from 8 leave 2,” you would say, “6 and 2 make 8,” writ- 
ing the 2. In the same way you would say, ‘“‘2 and 6 make 
8,” writing the result, 6. Children who already know another 
method, and subtract easily and accurately, should not be 
forced to learn a new method of this kind. 
In the drill work the teacher should aim to have the re- 
sults given quickly, and should not allow the child time to 
“count up.” He knows how the result is obtained, and the 
teacher would better give the result to the child, requiring 
him to memorize that particular combination for the next 
day, than to have him form a habit of counting for each case. 
These combinations should be recognized by the eye and the 
ear at once. 
In the teaching of such geometric figures as come up in 
this year’s work, including the square and circle, paper fold- 
ing and cutting will be of assistance, especially in the work in 
fractions.
-P-A-G-E-271
  ARITHMETIC 227 
Children of this age delight in making up number stories, 
and this practice is not only good drill for arithmetic, but is 
also of value in language work. 
Suggestions for the Third Grade.—In the third year the 
counting can be made more difficult; for example, the chil- 
dren may be asked to begin with 2 and add alternately 3 
and 4. They may also be taught to add 6’s and 7’s, or, in 
other words, they may use this simple method to complete 
their addition tables and multiplication tables. Whether the 
tables shall be taught to 10 X 10 or to 12 X 12 depends upon 
the course of study and the ability of the class. There is 
little more reason for stopping at 12 X 12 than for going on 
to 15 X 15; but, on the other hand, there is little reason for 
going beyond 10 X 1o in our country, the table 12 X 12 
being a relic of English teaching, where it is made necessary 
by the fact that 12 pence make a shilling. Numbers may be 
separated into their prime factors, and the simpler factors 
may be learned in this year; but the work should not be car- 
ried far, because we seldom have occasion to reduce fractions to 
lowest terms. 
Division by one-digit numbers, as far as the tables are 
learned, may be required, always using short division. Some 
teachers prefer the quotient written above the dividend in 
short division, because it is so written in long division for 
convenience in placing the decimal point, but the practice is 
opposed to business custom, and the plan is inconvenient 
in subsequent work in mathematics. Easy long divisions 
may be taught in the latter part of the year. 
Much concrete work in measurement may be done in this 
year, especially in connection with simple problems in draw- 
ing to a scale. Playing at keeping store, if carefully con- 
ducted by the teacher, may prove very profitable. Actual 
prices should be used, and the children may be required to 
find prices by inquiry at home the day before the work is 
given. Empty labelled cans and cartons may often be 
secured by application to the large firms handling the goods, 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  228 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  but they are preferably brought from the children’s homes. 
To make the work more real, toy money also may be used. 
The reading of problems, and the explaining of the proc- 
esses involved often proves a profitable exercise. In one or 
two of our standard text-books there are lists of “problems 
without numbers,” which are excellent for such purposes. In 
every process there should always be the spirit of time-saving, 
but not that nervous haste which is so discouraging to the 
slow. A minimum of time should be the aim of both teacher 
and pupil, always keeping in mind that accuracy comes first. 
Suggestions for the Fourth Grade.—At the beginning of 
every school year there should be a thorough review of and 
drill upon the work of the preceding grade. We all know 
how easily children forget, especially during the long sum- 
mer vacation. By means of simple tests the teacher may 
learn the mental equipment of her children, and what their 
stumbling-blocks are. The “Standardized Tests” of Mr. S. 
A. Courtis are especially beneficial for the advancement of the 
pupils, if the teacher will carefully make use of the results 
obtained by such examinations.! This is especially true of 
the first tests. Drill upon the weak points, with especial at- 
tention to the slow pupils, will greatly help to increase the 
efficiency of the work given during the rest of the year.. The 
review may put in the form of tables the facts learned during 
the preceding years; for example, the tables of linear measure, 
capacity, and the like, should now be memorized. 
At the end of the fourth year the fundamentals and foun- 
dations of the science of arithmetic should be thoroughly 
mastered. The forty-five combinations, both in addition 
and in multiplication, should be known at sight, the mul- 
tiplication and division tables should be learned, the funda- 
mental operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division should be so well known that any simple problem 
involving them can be quickly solved. The addition and 
subtraction of simple fractions whose denominators can easily

ARITHMETIC 229 
be factored may be studied in the fourth year, together with 
some work involving very simple decimals, particularly with 
reference to dollars and cents. The work now admits of a 
much more extended use of the text-book, the teacher select- 
ing and supplementing whenever the text does not supply 
the needs of the class. Simple problems involving cancella- 
tion may be taught, and the children may then be asked to 
indicate the operations and cancel equal factors whenever 
this is possible. If the child is well drilled upon the work 
of the above outline, he should be able to enter the inter- 
mediate grades, feeling confident that, even if the work is 
more complicated, he will not be hindered by a lack of knowl- 
edge of the fundamentals. 
Note-—Summary, problems, and references will be found 
at the end of the next chapter.

  CHAPTER X 
ARITHMETIC 
(CONTINUED) 
TI. ARITHMETIC IN THE UPPER GRADES 
Work Presupposed.—When the child enters Grade V he 
is supposed to know thoroughly the forty-five usual combina- 
tions in addition, and the same number in multiplication. 
That is, we have nine characters, 1, 2, .., 9, and we can add 
r to any one of them, giving nine combinations with 1; we 
can add 2 to any one of them, but since we already have 
2-+1 there are only eight new combinations; with 3 there 
are seven new combinations, and so on, so that the total 
number of different combinations isg +8 +7+..+1=45. 
This excludes combinations with o, which must be known, 
but which are so simple as to be excluded from the forty- 
five. It also gives only 3 + 2, not 2 + 3, and this is in accord 
with world experience. Indeed, in learning the multiplica- 
tion table it is a question whether we do not make a mistake 
to require both 9 X 7 and 7 X g learned, either one serving 
the purpose quite well. But whatever be the answer to 
these minor questions, the child must now know these forty- 
five combinations if he is ever to know them. Furthermore, 
he must know them both in tabular form and as isolated 
facts if he is to know them well, whatever some theorist may 
say about the danger of learning the multiplication table. 
One of the constant complaints in those European schools to 
which our children are frequently sent is that they do not 
know the addition and multiplication tables thoroughly, with 
the result that they cannot keep pace with children of the 
same age who have been well taught. This work should be 
230 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  
ARITHMETIC 231 
done thoroughly in the primary grades, and the teacher in 
Grade V should merely have to review it, not teach it anew. 
There is also presupposed the ability to perform the four 
operations with any ordinary integers. To be sure, this must 
be continually reviewed, and in this work some such device 
as the Thompson “Minimum Essentials” or the Courtis tests 
is very helpful, but the operations themselves must be pre- 
supposed in any well-regulated school system. 
There is also presupposed a familiarity with the common 
tables of measures, and at least a fair knowledge of the mean- 
ing of fractions. 
Upon such a basis the teacher of Grade V can build; with- 
out it the structure will always be weak. 
Nature of the Problems.—In Grades V—VIII, the nature 
of the problems changes from the isolated’ type, which illus- 
trates the particular operation, to a more general type. It 
is, therefore, desirable to consider the various types of ap- 
plied problem which we find in arithmetic. 
When arithmetics were first printed, no problems were in- 
cluded except such as were completely solved. These were, 
in the strict sense of the word, “examples” to be followed. 
When the boy went into his apprenticeship he solved such 
problems as naturally arose, referring back to the example in 
the book to find how to proceed. As schools came to be 
more Common, boys attended who were not going to be 
apprentices in some particular trade, and books were pre- 
pared which supplied a small number of applied problems in 
various fields, chiefly mercantile. It is only very recently 
that modern life has required such facility in arithmetic that 
a large amount of abstract drill work is necessary, accom- 
panied by a large range of applied problems. 
At the present time there are several types of exercises in 
arithmetic. First, there is the problem which involves only 
the work which has just been studied; that is, a child who is 
adding fractions is given a number of unrelated problems, 
1See chapter on “Measurement of Results.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  
232 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
usually of no special interest, which can all be solved by 
merely following the rule. This is the ordinary type of prob- 
lem; it is universal; it serves a good purpose; and there is no 
reason why it should not endure. It frankly says to a child 
that it illustrates the process just studied, and the child 
thereupon solves the problem more or less mechanically. As 
an illustration it has merit. 
Next, there is the so-called narrative problem, in which a 
kind of story is told from problem to problem on a page. 
This sounds well, but the trouble with the plan is that it 
usually makes one problem depend upon another, so that if 
a pupil makes a mistake in one case this vitiates all the fol- 
lowing solutions, a very discouraging thing for the child. In 
this form, therefore, such a series of problems is not a success. 
Next, there are grouped problems, say a page on one indus- 
try, a page on another, and so on. These are usually not 
dependent on one another, and derive their value over the 
ordinary type by concentrating on some one occupation, thus 
adding a little to the pupil’s interest and giving some infor- 
mation of general value. Such groups are coming to be 
somewhat common. They usually have the advantage of 
reviewing preceding work, not all of the examples referring 
to any single operation. 
Another type consists of problems which seek to place a 
child in @ real situation where he must decide for himself, as 
a result of solving a number of related but independent prob- 
lems, how he will act. These may relate to his going into 
business; perhaps as to whether he will do better to leave 
school now and be an office boy, or go on in school and pre- 
pare for some other walk in life; they may relate to the pur- 
chase of supplies for a ball team—whether they will be made 
in a large city department store, with parcel-post rates con- 
sidered, or be made in some other way; or they may concern 
a real camping expedition, a real case of a boy’s corn club in 
a rural school, or a genuine case of purchasing home supplies. 
Such sets of problems are best made by the teacher with the
-P-A-G-E-277
  
ARITHMETIC 233 
help of the pupils, but text-books can render valuable assis- 
tance by giving types to be followed. 
In order that this last type may be better understood at 
this time, the following set, used by the writer in one of his 
other works, will serve as an example. 
1. Harriet wishes to earn some money. She has learned to bake 
bread, and her mother suggests that they stop buying bread from the 
baker, and make their own, Harriet doing the work and receiving 
what is saved. If flour is worth $5 per barrel of 196 lb., and % lb. 
of flour makes a loaf of bread, and we allow $4.12 per barrel of flour 
for the cost of the other ingredients and fuel, what will it cost per 
loaf to make the bread? 
2. The family uses 2 loaves a day, and the baker’s price is 5¢ a 
loaf. If Harriet bakes the bread, how much is saved every day, and 
how much does Harriet earn in a year? 
3. After a few weeks Harriet gets so that she makes much better 
bread than the baker, and Mrs. Cook, their neighbor, wishes to buy 
8 loaves a week. ‘The bread is so good that she is willing to pay 60¢ 
a week for the 8 loaves. What are Harriet’s profits per week on these 
sales? What do they amount to in a year? 
4. Another neighbor wishes to buy a loaf a day, at the same rate 
per loaf that Mrs. Cook pays. If Harriet agrees to this, what is her 
yearly income from this source? What is now her total yearly in- 
come from baking bread? 
5. Harriet wants to earn $2,200 to pay her four years of college 
expenses when she is old enough to go, six years from now. How 
many loaves will she have to bake to save this amount? 
6. Her father helps her by adding enough to her savings to put 
$300 in the bank at the end of each of the six years. If this money 
draws 4% simple interest, how much will Harriet have at the end of 
six years? 
7. If flour goes up to $6.25 a barrel (196 Ib.), or 34¢ a pound if 
bought by the pound, how much will Harriet save on 1096 Ib. of flour 
in buying by the barrel? 
Oral problems can be found in any good oral arithmetic, 
and such a text-book should be in the hands of all pupils. 
The teacher will find it very helpful to supplement such work 
by problems relating to school life, purchases of the home, 
street life, games and amusements, and the like. In particu-  
-P-A-G-E-278
  234 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
lar, problems without numbers are of great value, for they 
require thought as to how to proceed to solve a concrete 
problem, without having the mind concentrated on the actual 
operation itself. The following are types of such problems, 
taken from one of the other works of the author: 
x. A man buys a certain number of pecks of chestnuts. How 
do you find how many bushels he buys? 
2. Given the length of a sheet and the amount to be added for 
hemming, how do you find the number of sheets that can be made 
from a given number of yards of sheeting of the right width? 
3. If you know the number of yards of lawn needed to make a 
skirt, and the price per yard, how do you find the cost of the lawn 
for a given number of skirts? 
4. If you know the number of cups of flour needed for a certain 
number of loaves of bread, how do you find the number of cups of 
flour needed for a certain other number of loaves? 
5. If you know the price of syrup per quart and also by the 
gallon can, how will you find the difference in price in buying a cer- 
tain number of gallons by the quart or by the can? 
6. If you know how much water flows through a pipe in a min- 
ute, how do you find how much water will flow through it in a whole 
day, at the same rate? 
7. If a boy wishes a piece of board to make a book-shelf, how do 
you find the cost of the board, knowing the size of the shelf and the 
cost of the lumber per M? 
8. If you know how much iron expands per foot when heated 
from the ordinary temperature to red heat, how do you find the amount 
of expansion of an iron rod of a given number of inches of length 
when heated to red heat? 
9. If a salesman sells on a salary plus a certain commission, how 
do you find the amount of his income for a year? 
to. If you know the number of hours per day that a man works, 
for each day of the week, and his rate of wages per hour, how do you 
find the amount due at the end of the week? 
In general, it may be said that the teacher will do well to 
make up and have the children make up real problems of 
‘local interest, but that not too much time should be taken 
for such work. It is the province of the text-book to save
-P-A-G-E-279
ARITHMETIC - 235 
time by furnishing enough material to make any great amount 
of this kind of work unnecessary. 
The Question of Rules.—About the close of the third 
quarter of the nineteenth century, rules had so increased in 
arithmetic that the work required no thought worthy of the 
name. Pupils learned rules for everything, and it was sup- 
posed to be a mark of understanding to recite glibly one after 
another. It was a foolish extreme, and the extreme to which 
the reforms of 1875 went was equally foolish, namely, to 
abolish rules altogether. The fact is, we all multiply one 
fraction by another by rule; we may not recite it to ourselves, 
but we know it and we act accordingly, never stopping for 
an instant to think out the reason. So there are certain rules 
that must be learned, whether in book form or not. The 
great desideratum is that these rules be quickly and naturally 
developed, so that the child formulates them for himself, 
thereafter adopting the wording of the text-book if that is 
clearer and more succinct. No rules at all is as bad as a rule 
for everything. Modern text-books are reasonable in this 
matter and may safely be taken as guides. 
Pupils’ Analyses.—How much attention should be given 
to the analyses of problems on the part of the pupils, and to 
their explanations of processes? Formerly there was much 
more of this work done than is generally the case to-day. 
When we come to consider the matter carefully, it is seen 
that the only reason for the requiring of any analysis on the 
part of the child is that it shows that he understands a par- 
ticular problem or operation. That he acquires a habit of 
formal statement that is helpful in other lines of work, or 
that his memory is strengthened by learning set forms of 
analysis, has been too often disproved to require argument. 
To the extent that this analysis is really an explanation of 
his process there is an unquestionable advantage, since it 
enables a teacher to commend or improve the pupil’s work. 
But how often is this the case? Indeed, how often should it 
be expected to be the case? Is it not the general experience  
-P-A-G-E-280
    236 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that pupils too often memorize their analyses, and that the 
teachers commend glib repetitions of their own words or 
those of the text-book, the matter being so imperfectly 
comprehended by the child that he is able to bear no ques- 
tioning ? 
But does this mean that no explanations are to be given 
or required? By no means. A child should know, for ex- 
ample, the process of dividing, and he should learn it by a 
teacher’s questioning; he should thereby know that it is 
reasonable, and he should feel that for the time he under- 
stands why he proceeds in the particular way that he does. 
While the work is being developed he may be questioned as 
to all this, but that he should long remember the “why” of 
it all, or that he should be able, at any time that some teacher 
or supervisor thinks fit, to give a lucid explanation of such 
a mature process, is as unnatural as it is unscientific. 
The Work of Grade V.—In the United States the large 
feature of the work of Grade V is usually common fractions. 
Experience shows, however, that there is necessity for a 
, thorough review of the four operations with whole numbers. 
There are two reasons for this: first, that the child may be 
certain that he knows these basal operations thoroughly; 
secondly, because he is now ready to use larger numbers than 
before, and needs a little exercise in so doing. 
As to whether the rest of the work of Grade V should be 
in common fractions or in decimals does not seem to be very 
serious. The child already knows something of common 
fractions and may, therefore, undertake simple work with 
decimals. On the other hand, the decimal fraction is more 
abstract than the common fraction; it is historically a much 
later development; and it more naturally follows the earlier 
form. Ifa child is not somewhat familiar with common frac- 
tions these should certainly have precedence in Grade V. 
Concerning methods of teaching common fractions, there 
are certain general principles. One of these relates to the 
question as to whether the child should be able to explain the
-P-A-G-E-281
ARITHMETIC 237 
process or merely be able to perform the operation, “ratio- 
cination, or habituation of the manipulation,” as the educator 
likes to put it. The world seems coming more and more to 
hold to the common-sense principle that a child should be 
led to understand a process when it is being taught, but that 
thereafter the process should become mechanical. For, after 
all, why should any child of eleven be expected to give the 
reason for inverting the divisor in the division of fractions? 
No adult can do it, unless he is a teacher, and even then the 
reason will probably be quite unscientific. Therefore, we 
hear much less about children’s explanations of such processes 
than we did some years ago. The principle seems entirely 
sound. 
The second general principle relates to the scope of the 
work. Before the decimal fraction was invented (say about 
1600 A.D.) there was some necessity for common fractions 
with large denominators. That time passed away with the 
coming of the decimal, and with it went any necessity for the 
greatest common divisor in reducing fractions to lowest terms. 
To-day the world almost never has occasion to operate with 
a fraction whose numerator exceeds eight, although it rather’ 
commonly uses fractions with numerators as high as sixty- 
four in practical measurements. This custom of business 
would seem to fix limits to the fractions which we teach, a 
child knowing the significance of fractions up to sixty-fourths, 
but operating with fractions only as far as eighths. The 
operation to be emphasized is multiplication, for it is a com- 
mon thing to find the cost of 2% pounds or 3% yards of 
something, but it is a very rare thing to be called upon to 
divide 2% by 3%, and it is not very often that we have to 
add or subtract fractions, particularly if their denominators 
are any numbers except 2, 4, and 8. It is necessary to teach 
all the processes, for they are all actually used in business, 
but it is multiplication that deserves the greatest attention. 
The third principle relates to the use of objects in the 
teaching of fractions. It is not limited to fractions, however,  
-P-A-G-E-282
238 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
for it relates to all other work in arithmetic as well. The 
principle is this: Use objects whenever, in developing a rule, 
they contribute to a clear understanding of the situation, 
but abandon them the instant they have served their pur- 
pose. As to the nature of these objects, the question is not 
particularly important. Paper folding, paper cutting, inch 
cubes, blocks of different lengths, fraction charts and disks, 
figures on the blackboard—all these are helpful, and some 
variety is desirable. But all of them become harmful after 
they have served their purpose. 
The fourth principle relates to the form of explanation to 
be given. Here any text-book will always supply as good 
material as the teacher is likely to have from any other 
source. The little methods of doing this thing or that, which 
used to be so magnified in classes for teachers, are not now 
so much in evidence. Any teacher who can read will find a 
good explanation of the addition of fractions, for example, in 
the book she is using, and if she will study this and use the 
common principles of education (which, after all, are mere 
common sense) in developing it to the class, using objects 
when necessary, she will get good results if she has the power 
of getting them. 
As to the mathematics of the subject, the above will suf- 
fice to show the reader what the problems are and how they 
can be solved. If we eliminate such fractions as Pai, and 
the requiring a child to explain the operations, which means 
merely the memorizing of words which signify little to him, 
the work with fractions offers relatively little difficulty. 
The reputation that it has for being hard comes from these 
very two features, and their loss will never be felt except 
for the better. 
In Grade V there is also given, in most cases, some work 
with compound numbers. Happily this is becoming less 
prominent from year to year, for it is being recognized that 
the compound number has to a large extent served its pur- 
pose. In ancient times it was found easier to speak of 5
-P-A-G-E-283
ARITHMETIC 239 
pounds 12 ounces than of 5% pounds, because people did 
not know much about working with fractions. But to-day 
we employ the latter form because every one now knows 
how to use fractions. Courses of study are, therefore, recom- 
mending that but little attention be paid to compound num- 
bers, except in such simple and common cases as feet and 
inches, and the teacher will do well to carry out the same 
idea. 
In foreign countries but little of the above work is taught 
in Grade V. The child is supposed to have acquired a suffi- 
cient working knowledge of fractions in Grade IV. Therefore 
decimal fractions are usually taken up in Grade V, together 
with the necessary parts of percentage. The study of in- 
tuitional geometry is almost always begun in this grade, and 
often some work in proportion is given. 
The Work of Grade VI.—In the United States the work 
of Grade VI usually centres about decimal fractions and the 
elements of percentage. This is really very little for a year’s 
work, and the reason why teachers find it difficult to cover 
the ground is that we often find the course burdened with 
non-essentials. If we accept the principle that the child 
should be fully informed of the “why” when a subject is pre- 
sented to him, being placed as far as reasonable in the posi- 
tion of a discoverer, but that he should then be called upon 
to do the work rather than recite explanations of processes 
day after day, the ground is easily covered. To add or sub- 
tract decimal fractions is merely like adding or subtracting 
dollars and cents, processes with which the pupil is entirely 
familiar, and in which his explanations add little to his under- 
standing and nothing to his facility. The multiplication of 
¥%o by % should lead without any great amount of talk to the 
understanding of the rule for 0.3 X 0.7, and similarly for 
division. After that the work should become entirely me- 
chanical for the pupil, as it is for us. Certainly there is 
nothing in this, if presented in a reasonable manner, that 
makes any great demand upon the pupil’s time or energy.  
-P-A-G-E-284
  240 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The percentage question is also a simple one, if we con- 
sider the essentials of the subject. Of course a teacher who 
begins by having the children learn the statement that “per 
cent means by the hundred,” a statement quite without 
meaning to all children and to most teachers, and who then 
takes up numerous “cases” with their rules, will not find 
the question simple. But one who takes up the topic in a 
reasonable way will find that it has few difficulties. In the 
first place, the pupil must be led to see that %o, 0.07, 7%, all 
mean exactly the same thing; that sometimes we find it con- 
venient to speak of 18 inches, sometimes of 1 foot 6 inches, 
and sometimes of yard; and that sometimes we find it 
better to say 7% than 7 hundredths, though they mean 
exactly the same thing. 
If, now, we remember that about the only practical uses 
we have for percentage are covered by two very simple cases, 
we shall be able to give the essentials of the subject without 
much difficulty. These cases are illustrated by two very 
simple questions: 
1. How much is 6% of $150? 
2. $9 is what per cent of $150? 
A pupil who can solve these two problems can solve every 
practical problem in percentage that he is ever likely to meet. 
Teachers will find that the subject loses much of its difficulty 
when they concentrate their attention on these two, with 
the possible addition of another which is related to the second 
one, namely: 
3. $9 is 6% of what number? 
With these three a pupil is equipped for any reasonable 
demand that can be made upon him. 
Let us now see how this compares with the work done 
abroad. In general it is at least a year behind that done in 
most other countries, What we do in Grade VI is done else-
-P-A-G-E-285
  
ARITHMETIC 241 
where in Grade V, and other work besides, and is done thor- 
oughly. In Grade VI most countries complete formal arith- 
metic, except as it is thereafter reviewed along with the study 
of algebra and geometry. At least four of the leading Euro- 
pean countries begin algebra in this grade. Practically all 
give a good course in geometry, intuitional rather than for- 
mal in character, and in this they introduce work in geomet- 
ric drawing. Slowly, as our country gets more in sympathy 
with scholarship and as teachers get better trained, we shall 
begin to approach this plan. It is true that the school year 
abroad is a little longer than with us, but this is not the 
chief reason for the difference.t 
The Work of Grade VII.—In our country it is a common 
practice to complete the work in percentage in Grade VII, 
and take up the most important applications of the subject. 
Arithmetic now ceases to be mathematical in the United 
States and becomes merely a branch of elementary civics or 
sociology. In those applications of percentage, in our Amer- 
ican courses of study that are within the range of under- 
standing of the pupils, there is nothing of a mathematical 
nature that is new, and so the pupil simply marks time. 
This was not the case under the old régime, for the examples 
were made so hard as to require some mental exertion in 
their solution; but these examples were not practical and, 
properly enough, they were discarded. Nothing of any 
mathematical content was, however, put in their place. Let 
us consider, for example, the subject of taxes. If we are to 
teach it at all, and we are compelled to do so under present 
conditions, we should present it in some such way as this: 
Some boys in a school wanted to organize a ball team: They 
found that they could rent a piece of land for a ball field for 
$4 a month, and that they needed $5.50 at once for balls and 
bats. Each boy bought his own suit, but they had to raise 
$9.50 for the first month. They decided that ten boys should 
* Selections of such phases of higher mathematics as prove valuable tools. 
—Ed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
    242 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
be allowed to join, and that each should pay his share, which 
was 95 cents for the first month. This 95 cents was a tax 
upon each member of the club. 
A class wished to buy a picture for the schoolroom. 
There were 30 pupils in the class, and the picture cost $3.90. 
Each pupil agreed to pay his share. A committee was ap- 
pointed, and each member of the class was taxed 13 cents. 
Here the total tax on the class was $3.90, the tax of each 
pupil was 13 cents, the committee levied a tax of 13 cents 
on each, and a collector received the money. 
A village needed $8,000 for building a new schoolhouse, 
and its citizens agreed to raise the amount by a tax. The 
sum was so large that it would not be fair to make each citi- 
zen pay the same amount, so each one was required to pay 
according to the value of his property. In this way those 
who had more property were taxed more than those who 
had little property. A man who owned $10,000 worth of 
property was required to pay twice as much as one who 
owned $5,000 worth, and half as much as one who owned 
$20,000 worth. This is the rule of taxation usually followed 
by States, cities, villages, and counties. 
A county has to pay its share toward the repair of its 
roads. Every one uses the roads, and so every one ought to 
pay something toward keeping them in good condition. The 
county may require each of its voters to pay a tax of $1 or 
more for this purpose. This is called a poll tax, the word 
“poll” being an old word for “head.” Teachers should then 
have the pupils inquire as to the local tax rate, and should 
show them a tax notice of the village, city, or town in which 
they live. They should make clear to them the source of 
the income to run the school, pay the teachers, light the 
streets, and so on, so that they may see their own responsi- 
bilities and that of their parents. 
Now all this is excellent, and since we are compelled to 
teach taxes in arithmetic, this should be the spirit of our 
work—but let us understand clearly that it is civics, eco-

ARITHMETIC 243 
nomics, or sociology—not mathematics. The mathematics in 
the subjects of taxes, insurance, commission, brokerage, profit 
and loss, banking, and various other applications of percen- 
tage, as taught at present in our schools, is puerile. If the 
tax rate is 7 mills on $1, how much is it on $10,000? At 
$1.25 per thousand, how much does it cost to insure a house 
for $5,000? Such problems are, mathematically considered, 
the work of pupils in Grade V. They are perfectly proper 
as problems in economics, civics, and sociology, and every 
child should meet them, but they have no place as mathe- 
matics in Grade VII, and in the long run this will be recog- 
nized, although we are forced by circumstances to give them 
this place at the present time. So long as this compulsion 
exists, it is our duty to see that these subjects are taught in 
the spirit above mentioned, but with the advent of the junior 
high school it is probable that the time allotted to arithme- 
tic in Grades VII and VIII will be reduced and some definite 
work will be given in intuitional geometry and the algebra 
of the formula. See our last paragraph on this point. 
Simple Interest.—The subject of simple interest offers, 
however, a field in which mathematical reasoning is involved 
to some extent, and in which there is much drill in practical 
multiplication and division. Nevertheless it must be said 
that here, too, the mathematics is becoming very attenuated, 
and will probably not long survive. People now borrow 
money at banks; the terms of credit are usually 30 days, 60 
days, or go days; the principal is usually some such even 
amount as $100, $500, $1,000, or the like; the rate is usually 
6% or 5%; and the interest is computed by the use of tables. 
The mathematics involved is slight. Fifty years ago a man 
who owed his grocer $78.30 would give a note due on some 
convenient date, and it would be a practical problem to find 
the difference in time, and then to find the interest on $78.30 
for 5 months 22 days at 7%. Such a problem to-day is prac- 
tically obsolete so far as the experience of the great mass of 
our people is concerned. Partial payments on notes is also 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  
  244 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
passing away as a business custom. To the next generation 
the mathematics of simple interest will be very slight. 
_ What has been done in other countries to furnish material 
of mathematical content for this grade? Practically every- 
where is intuitional geometry taught, even including locus 
problems. In all other countries the simple (linear) equation 
in one unknown quantity is taught in this grade, and with 
this often go graphs and factoring. Algebra is made much 
more real than our arithmetic, and this is done by showing 
the practical and extensive value of the formula and the 
graph. Geometric drawing is very common; arithmetic is 
briefly reviewed, and the entire work has a mathematical 
content which ours entirely lacks. With departmental teach- 
ing of mathematics we may hope for work of this kind in 
America; under any other plan it would be a failure. 
The Work of Grade VIII.—What has been said with 
respect to Grade VII holds equally true with respect to 
Grade VIII. The work as it now stands is chiefly in the 
important fields of civics, economics, and social affairs, but 
hardly at all in the field of mathematics. Formerly there 
were taught in Grade VIII such subjects as square and cube 
root, progressions, alligation, equation of payments, and sim- 
ple and compound proportion. These had mathematical 
content, but they were not related to the life of any pupil 
or to the interests of the majority; they had served their pur- 
pose at a time when arithmetic of this kind was taught to 
an older and more carefully selected lot of pupils, and when 
certain of these topics had more practical significance; but 
their day has passed. Their elimination left a gap which 
had to be filled, and this was done with no reference what- 
ever to mathematics, but solely with reference to the other 
subjects mentioned. Much of the material is valuable, but 
not from any mathematical consideration. 
We are, then, confronted by this condition in Grade VIII: 
we must either teach civics and economics, with a little 
sociology, all involving merely the mathematics that can
-P-A-G-E-291
ARITHMETIC 245 
easily be covered in Grades I-V; or we must follow the lead 
of other countries and teach some real mathematics. The 
latter alternative necessitates departmental teaching, the 
high-school department taking over grades VII and VIII. 
Such a change cannot be made at once, however; indeed, it 
will be many years before we can get enough teachers to do 
work of this kind, and it will require another generation of 
school administrators with greater desire themselves to add 
to the world’s fund of scholarship. At present, all that can 
be done is to teach civics in arithmetic as well as possible, or 
to put grades VII and VIII into the Junior High School, 
with departmental teaching and a richer curriculum. 
How, then, shall we go about to teach the subjects of 
Grade VIII? Experience shows that we do best to drama- 
tize the situations as far as this is possible. Every boy and 
girl should know the meaning of a corporation, for this is 
the age of corporations; the children should know the large 
features of such organizations, what is meant by directors 
and officers, and by stocks and bonds. To this end they 
should organize a corporation and play the game. This may 
be done in some such way as this: Some boys in the eighth 
grade have organized a ball club. There are fourteen boys 
and they pay $100 for uniforms and $12 for balls and bats. 
If each of the boys should contribute \, of $112, he would 
contribute $8, and if the team made some money from tickets 
to the games, each boy would have \, of the profits after the 
expenses were paid. 
But some of the boys cannot afford to contribute as much 
as others, so they divide the $112 into 224 shares of 50 cents 
each, and sell to the members as many shares as they care 
to buy. 
James is one of the chief promoters of the club, and he 
takes 40 shares, thus making his payment $20. Fred takes 
20 shares, and the rest take various amounts. 
The first three games draw large crowds, and the gate 
receipts are heavy. The boys divide the profits according to 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  246 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the number of shares they hold. Fred tries to buy some of 
the shares that James owns, so as to get more of the profits, 
but James will not sell for less than 60 cents a share. He 
says his stock is now above par. 
The boys really formed a corporation. The capital was 
$112. There were 224 shares of stock, the par value of each 
being 50 cents. The profits they divided were dividends, 
and these dividends were so high that the stock went above 
par. 
In practical life men form corporations in this way, only 
they play the game of business instead of ball. 
It is not possible, in the space allowed to this chapter, 
to give further suggestions with respect to details of the 
course. In general, however, a pupil should be placed in a 
position to use his judgment with respect to the mathematics 
of a definite situation in which he may find himself. In a 
rural school it should be with respect to laying out and mea- 
suring fields, fertilizing the soil, the nature and value of 
crops, putting up fences and farm buildings, draining, bal- 
anced rations, taxes, and farm and household economics. 
In the city the range of subjects is equally broad, including 
the local industries, home economics, street life, amusements, 
and civic expenditures. The following are examples selected 
from the author’s other works, which show what is meant 
by the real-situation problem adapted to this grade: 
THRIFT IN THE HoME 
1. Mrs. Brown finds that she can save at least 50¢ a week by going 
to the market and buying in person. By doing this she will save how 
much a year, at least? 
2. Frank gets interested in the idea of helping to cut down the 
high cost of living. He says he will raise vegetables. Allowing $1.25 
for ploughing, $3.25 for fertilizer, $1.30 for seed, and 75¢ a week for 
22 wk., which wages his mother insists that he shall have for his 
bank, what are the total expenses for the season’s vegetables? 
3. Mrs. Brown used to spend $54 for these same vegetables at 
the store, What was the saving in having their own garden?

4. Since Frank’s mother no longer buys over the telephone, she 
decides to cut off that expense. This comes to $2.25 a month. How 
much does she save in a year by not using the telephone? 
5. Frank notices that at certain times there are bargain sales at 
the stores. By buying at a sale, an $18 suit at 15% off, three $1.50 
shirts at 10% off, a dozen 25-cent handkerchiefs at 1634 % off, a pair 
of $4.75 shoes at 25% off, and a hat and some collars and ties amount- 
ing to $5.35 at 20% off, how much does he save in all on the pur- 
chases in Exs. 1-5? 
6. How much have Frank and his mother together saved as 
stated above? 
7. They find that they can invest this money at 5% interest. 
What will it amount to in ro yr.? 
8. At the end of a year after the investment mentioned in Ex. 7 
was made, they invest an equal amount again at 5% interest, and 
they do this every year until the end of the 10 yr. How much will 
they have at the end of that time, including the interest? 
9. Frank will then be old enough to go to college. His mother 
says that he will need $1,500 if he is studious enough to earn a free 
scholarship. Will they have money enough saved to allow Frank to 
go to college? If not, how much must Frank’s father contribute to 
help them out? 
How Tom Earnep His SpENDING-MoNEY 
1. Tom’s father gives him his choice of 35¢ for spending-money a 
week, or a dozen hens with which to earn what he can. How much 
would 35¢ a week amount to in a year? If the hens laid 100 eggs 
apiece in a year and eggs averaged 28¢ a dozen, how much more 
would Tom have for spending-money by keeping hens? 
2. Tom figured this out, but forgot to deduct the expense of feed- 
ing the chickens. Suppose this to be $1 per year for each hen, and 
suppose that the hens averaged 125 eggs apiece, how much better 
would Tom’s annual income be than 35¢ a week? 
3. Tom chooses the hens and keeps a record of income and ex- 
penses. He finds that there are more table scraps than he had counted 
on, so that he needs each week only 1 pk. of corn costing 60 ¢ a bushel, 
¥% pk. of oats costing 36¢ a bushel, and 5 lb. of bran costing $1.40 
per 100 lb. What is the expense of the feed per year? 
4. During the year the hens averaged 21% doz. eggs a week, and 
these he sold at an average price of 25¢a dozen. What is his income 
per year? Deducting his expenses, does this leave him more than 
or less than 35¢ a week, and how much for the year?

5. Tom wishes to make more money. He learns that by selling 
eggs for hatching purposes in the late winter and early spring he can 
get 75¢ for a setting of 15 eggs. If he sells 20 doz. at this price, how 
much does it add to his yearly income? What does this make his 
average income per week? 
6. He finds that his friend Dick keeps bees, getting 33 lb. of honey 
a year from each hive. Dick has four hives, and he sells the honey 
for 18¢ a pound. Is he doing better or worse than Tom, and how 
much per week? 
7. Tom decides to add bees to his source of income. If he can 
buy two hives of Italian bees for $4.25 a hive, and needs in addition 
$1.80 worth of supplies, how many weeks will he have to save his 
income as found in Ex. 5 in order to pay for the bees and supplies? 
SUMMARY 
1. The problem of teaching the essentials of arithmetic is not one 
of special difficulty. 
2. The curriculum in arithmetic in the primary grades, determined 
by world experience, is more uniform than is generally thought 
to be the case. 
3. There is no single narrow method which will make every one a 
good teacher of arithmetic. 
4. Our American schools begin to fall behind those of other coun- 
tries, with respect to the content of mathematics, at about 
the beginning of the fifth school year, and at the end of the 
twelfth school year they are a year or so behind. 
5. Much of the difficulty in arithmetic can be removed by confining 
the work to the essentials and by ne scientific supervision 
of the study periods. 
6. Some form of standardized tests in wisaciestd) is valuable in as- 
suring the teacher that the work is fairly up to the average of 
other schools. 
sie There are various types of problems, each of which has its value, 
/ and the teacher should recognize the value of each, and not 
confine the work to any one type. 
8. A pupil’s memorized analysis of a problem or of an operation is 
of relatively little value. 
9. The prime object in elementary calculation is intelligently to 
secure an accurate result, and to do this in a reasonably short 
time, but accuracy is much more important than speed. 
ro. The work in the seventh and eighth school years should relate 
chiefly to business arithmetic, but with the advent of the
-P-A-G-E-295
  
ARITHMETIC 249 
junior high schools we shall probably fall in line with the rest 
of the world and add some definite work in intuitional geometry 
in Grade VII, and some definite work in practical algebra in 
Grade VIII. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
1. Make a list of sixteen examples in the four fundamental operations 
with (a) integers, (b) common fractions, (c) mixed numbers, 
(d) decimals which represent, to your mind, the hardest work 
that any school child should be called upon to do in order to 
be prepared for ordinary business life. 
2. Make a list of such applications of percentage to business needs 
as you feel a pupil should know, and which involve enough 
arithmetic to make them worth while. 
3- Make a list of number games which you feel can profitably be used 
in the first two school years. 
4. Write out a list of topics which you feel should be thoroughly cov- 
ered in the arithmetic of the first four school years, and in the 
order in which you feel they should be taken up. Express your 
opinion as to the advantages of the well-ordered arrangement 
of matter over presenting the work with no system of arrange- 
ment on any basis of psychology or arithmetical sequence. 
5. Write three problems which you feel would appeal to the interests 
of children in connection with the teaching of long division, 
and three in connection with the teaching of the multiplication 
of a fraction by a fraction. 
6. Write a set of ten examples which you could use in testing the 
accuracy and speed of children in arithmetic at the close of 
Grade IV. Write your estimate of the time that should be 
taken for the test, and, if possible, test your judgment by as- 
signing the examples to a class. Acquaint yourself with the 
Courtis tests in arithmetic. 
7. What arguments can you bring in favor of or against teaching 
algebra and geometry in the seventh and eighth grades, say 
in a junior high school. 
8. To what extent should mathematics be taught in connection with 
occupational activities which require its use as a tool?

CHAPTER XI 
HOUSEHOLD ARTS 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
. What do I, an adult, know of the processes involved in the growth, 
production, manufacture, and preservation of the foods that 
appear daily on my table? 
. Why did my great-grandparents understand the fundamental 
processes which underlie the industries related to our home 
life? 
To what extent are the children of to-day acquiring this information 
as a part of their general education? 
. How can this body of vital material be introduced into an appar- 
ently overcrowded curriculum ? 
. What are the household arts? : 
. What are the elements in modern life which make it necessary to 
supplement home training by introducing household arts into 
the upper elementary school? 
. In what way will the home life of the community and the general 
aims of the school in which I teach regulate the selection of 
subject matter in the household arts course? 
. What are the fundamental problems in the home life in our school 
neighborhood which should serve as a basis for organizing this 
subject matter into a course of study? 
9. What criticisms can you make of the ordinary instruction in house- 
hold arts in elementary schools? 
I. GENERAL Survey oF HovsEHOLD ARTS 
Why the Industrial and Household Arts Should be Found 
in the School Curriculum.—The dust on the spinning-wheel, 
the rusty condition of the candle-moulds, and the countless 
other symbols of bygone days now resting in the attics of 
our grandmothers are responsible for the present-day status 
of the industrial and household arts in the elementary school. 
253
-P-A-G-E-300
  254 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The home life of the child of to-day offers a minimum educa- 
tion in the sources of food, clothing, and shelter. His knowl- 
edge of his life necessities is limited to the simple operations 
which furnish him with material comforts. Press the but- 
ton and the room is flooded with light; a telephone message 
brings the daily rations, in many cases prepared for ser- 
vice; a mail-order or a shopping expedition equips the child 
with the season’s clothing; a house hunt determines his 
home for the following year. 
Great economic and social changes during the past cen- 
tury have taken from the home many chances for the child 
to learn the “how” and ‘‘why” of simple home and indus- 
trial processes. The factory, with its huge daily output, has 
supplanted innumerable home activities; and with this change 
the education of the girl and boy has suffered. Industry 
and machinery have taken from the child’s experience the 
former opportunity of learning from the father and mother, 
as all worked together at their tasks. As a result of these 
radical changes, there have entered into the curriculum of 
the elementary school the industrial and household-arts sub- 
jects which by their very presence enliven and unify those 
already existent. 
Their Place in the Curriculum.—The subjects of indus- 
trial and household arts in the elementary school naturally 
divide into two time divisions: 
(a) Grades 1-5 or 1-6 inclusive, during which period the 
boys’ and girls’ work is not diversified, save as the problems 
selected are adapted to their special interests in Grades 5 and 6. 
(6) Grades 6, 7, and 8, or Grades 7 and 8, during which 
period separate lines of work for boys and girls are estab- 
lished. In some school systems the seventh and eighth 
grades form the first two years of the junior high school. 
(There is a strong tendency to-day to meet common de- 
mands made upon both men and women as consumers by 
giving girls short courses in the shops, and boys a series of 
lessons in the household-arts laboratories.)
-P-A-G-E-301
  HOUSEHOLD ARTS 255 
Aims.—The aims of all industrial and household-arts 
work in the elementary school may be stated as follows: 
1. To create a clear understanding of the processes which 
support our daily lives. 
2. To establish through accurate manipulation of mate- 
rials in true industrial processes an appreciative understand- 
ing of the labor involved in the manufacture of various prod- 
ucts, and a respect for that labor. 
3. To develop skill and technic in the handling of food- 
stuffs, textiles, woods, metals, clays and other allied earth 
materials, in accordance with the powers of the child. 
Although a degree of skill commensurate with the ability 
of the child is essential in the lower elementary school work, 
the guiding principle of the industrial and household arts in 
this field is one of appreciation and understanding. In the 
suggestive work as outlined for the second grade later in the 
chapter, the making of furniture, bedding, and table-linen 
was taught, not specifically for the purpose of training the 
child in these processes, but 
1. In order that the work of the cabinetmaker and the 
home-maker may be understood through the doing, and 
2. In order that the characteristics of the materials han- 
dled may be understood. 
On the other hand, in the upper elementary school work, 
definite skill and technic in handling materials and secur- 
ing results, paralleled by an intelligent insight into econom- 
ics and elementary science and social connections, form the 
_ basic underlying principles. 
Teachers.—In the lower elementary school the ideal situ- 
ation provides the supervisor of industrial and household arts 
who is trained in the processes and who appreciates the value 
of his subject as a means toward an end, not as an end in 
itself; and a@ classroom teacher who, through training and 
adaptability, is equipped to teach all subjects in her grade, 
including industrial and household arts, and who through a 
keen appreciation of the needs of the child will establish
-P-A-G-E-302
2 56 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
vital connections whenever possible among the various sub- 
jects. It is impossible to overemphasize correct standards 
in all industrial and household processes throughout the ele- 
mentary school, for early habits and concepts must essen- 
tially “ring true” in order to build the superstructure well. 
The household-arts work of the upper elementary school, 
or, as it is known in some schools, the junior high school, 
should be handled by the specialist, who may also be the 
supervisor of household-arts work in the lower grades. The 
nature of the subject demands a woman who has an opti- 
mistic, adaptable personality, and a love for home interests 
and ideals. She must have a keen appreciation of relative 
values and the ability to blend subject matter, placing em- 
phasis where emphasis is needed. 
Suggestions for Equipment.—It may be said that the old 
adage, ‘‘where there’s a will there’s a way,” proves true in 
the household-arts work in the elementary school. All the 
way from the one-room rural school, with its large heating- 
stove, to the well-equipped modern school-building, the op- 
portunities for introducing the problems of the home are 
constantly present. The work as planned must, to be sure, 
meet the exigencies of the situation. The school luncheon 
may offer the initial opportunity in the work in foods. The 
classroom curtains and other furnishings may be the “‘enter- 
ing wedge” in sewing. The care of the room will offer a 
vital problem in cleaning and sanitation. Co-operation in 
beautifying and caring for the school-building and school- 
gardens will form a basis for lessons in home-making. 
The famous cooks in the neighborhood may be delighted 
to show the children how to make their “specialties,” and a 
visit to their well-kept homes will be a living example of 
household efficiency. 
The ordinary classroom, with a few borrowed utensils, 
will enable the teacher to show her class how the flour which 
they have been studying in connection with the wheat indus- 
try is finally made into bread; and this same bread may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  HOUSEHOLD ARTS 257 
baked by the children in the borrowed oven, in the kitchen 
next door or across the road. 
But let us sanction such emergencies only as a beginning, 
or as an adjunct to work done with a better equipment in 
the classroom or special laboratory. The board of educa- 
tion or school directors may need tangible evidence before 
voting to spend any money for equipment. As a means of 
showing its true worth as a school subject, the emergency 
equipment or the ‘‘open house” of the neighbor will furnish 
a means of approach. Furthermore, some co-operative 
money-making by pupils and teacher for purchasing equip- 
ment through sales of simple food and textile products may 
inspire the respect and appreciation of the “powers that be” 
and result in the necessary appropriation. 
Equipment for individual or group projects in food prep- 
aration may be purchased, dependent upon the opportunity 
for use. A combination of both is desirable in order to give 
opportunity for independent manipulation, as well as the 
normal home problem. 
Opportunities for introducing the teaching of sanitation 
into any school-building will be apparent. It must be a 
constant in the teaching field, and innumerable lessons will 
present themselves to the wide-awake teacher. Fortunate, 
indeed, is the teacher who has access to typical home rooms 
in the planning of these lessons. 
Emergency tables in the classroom will serve many pur- 
poses in the teaching of household arts. From the low kin- 
dergarten table to the special table for use in the cutting of 
garments and the commercial-laboratory table for food prep- 
aration, there are several intermediate steps. The large 
wooden table tops which may be placed over the desks or 
on wooden horses, or swung as shelves against the walls of 
the room, are easily stored, and are very satisfactory for 
teaching in either field. The ordinary kitchen table may be 
covered with zinc or oil-cloth if desired, and will serve well 
for the work in foods.  
-P-A-G-E-304
2 58 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The sewing-machines in the homes of the children may 
meet the need for machine work, with a demonstration and 
practice lesson in one home. Co-operation of the women’s 
philanthropic organizations is desirable. This may solve 
the problem of materials, and give opportunity for machine 
practice. 
Individual sewing equipment may be supplied by the 
home, but the economy in the purchase of these materials in 
quantity is evident. 
Packing-Box Equipment.—As a suggestion for the teacher 
in the rural school, the packing-box equipment may prove an 
inspiration. Two ordinary packing-boxes, stained, with 
shelves built in, top covered with zinc, and each box fitted 
with curtains on double rods (to exclude dust), serve the 
double purpose of cupboard and work-table. Well-adjusted 
hooks for dish-pan and rinsing-pan, wire towel-rack, blue- 
flame kerosene-stove, and portable oven—and the setting is 
complete for serious work in food preparation. Small kero- 
sene-stoves (for individual work) may be added. The uten- 
sils may be selected as needed. 
In this brief consideration of equipment possibilities the 
difficult situation has been considered, as a means of showing 
that the work in household arts is not impossible under such 
conditions; but that the more complete and ideal the equip- 
ment the more vital and practical can the work be made. 
The Real Home as a Laboratory.—With the progress of 
events in the educational field has come the real home as 
the laboratory for household-arts teaching. This home must 
meet, so far as possible, the home conditions of the children. 
Ideally, a typical family should live in the home, whose con- 
crete problems will vitalize all phases of household-arts work. 
The selection of the home, its decoration and furnishing, its 
care, the economics and preparation of clothing and food

Teaching Domestic Science” (illustrated), by Helen Kinne, and “Domestic 
Art in Woman’s Education,” by Anna M. Cooley, chap. VI.

HOUSEHOLD ARTS 259 
for the family, and the social responsibilities of the various 
members of the household within the home and in the com- 
munity may be woven into a very practical unit of study. 
The reality of such a course guarantees its success under the 
direction of the skilful teacher.’ 
The growing number of consolidated farm schools offer 
excellent opportunities when each principal lives in a house 
built on the farm as a part of the school plant.

Point of Contact.—The illustrations of the cartoonist that 
picture the child sitting in the schoolroom gazing longingly 
through the window at real life should be suggestive to all 
teachers. The children in the first and second grades are, of 
course, most of all interested in their homes, in their mothers, 
fathers, sisters, and brothers. It is through this interest 
that the real work of these grades may wisely be attacked.” 
The following work done by a second-grade class is a 
unit that is suggestive of the connections that can be made 
by the versatile teacher between the subject matter that she 
thinks the children should be taught and the many attrac- 
tions of real living. A little home in the schoolroom was 
the means of giving real motive to a variety of school sub- 
jects. 
I. Food.—(Details omitted.) 
II. Shelter. 
1. Making a simple house form with a frame of wood covered with 
burlap, containing a door and window, using mica for window-panes; 
the top or roof is left open; the parts are in panels and are easily 
folded; the wall of the classroom may be used as one side of the house. 
1 This home-school idea has been very successfully developed by several 
teachers of upper elementary and high school work. The writers will be glad 
to furnish further information upon request.

The geography, number work, writing, and spelling that 
can be found necessary in planning and making the furniture 
may be realized after reading the following chapter on “In- 
dustrial Arts.” Only the household arts growing out of the 
house problem will be discussed here. 
Elementary Study of Textiles.—The first questions to be 
solved were: “Of what shall we make our blanket, table-cloth, 
bureau scarf, mattress, etc.?”? This necessitated learning 
the conspicuous differences between cotton, linen, silk, and 
wool. Children can, of course, make only a beginning in 
such work, but by handling various pieces they can recognize 
those that are typical. The teacher must avoid making the 
problem too difficult. The choice of color was a problem-in 
art work. 
Correlation with Number Work.—Taking measures for 
the table-linen, bedding, curtains, etc., and allowing for hems 
of various widths gave material for problems in number work 
that had to be solved before the material could be cut into.

  HOUSEHOLD ARTS 261 
Small Children Should Work with Coarse Materials.— 
The teacher should choose materials for the hand-work itself 
that are adapted to the age and capacity of the children. 
Soft, loosely woven cloth, unstarched, number six needles 
and number fifty cotton thread, will tend to make the work 
easier and results more satisfactory. (The children’s indi- 
vidual equipment may be in boxes labelled with the names, 
kept in the desks or on the closet shelf.) The cutting out 
of the work cannot be expected of the little folks. Girls in 
the seventh or eighth grades learn a great deal by preparing 
such work for the lower-grade children and, when possible, 
in helping the teacher during the work periods. 
Devices for Class Presentation.—The feasibility of teach- 
ing a problem apparently so complicated depends entirely 
upon the unifying of the problems. All articles to be hemmed 
were considered together and assigned to the different chil- 
dren according to their respective ability. The holding of 
the work, measuring of hems, basting, and running were 
each taught to the whole class at one time by using a large 
piece of cloth representing a specific article and demonstrat- 
ing each step slowly and plainly. For showing how to pin, 
large pins were used; for sewing, a huge darning-needle 
threaded with brightly colored Germantown yarn. The 
stitches made very large were really only diagrammatic. 
The cloth left hanging on the wall, showing some completed 
stitches and the needle in position, blackboard sketches, and 
samples showing the stitches properly made on material such 
as the children were using—all were needed to help the 
children understand how the work should be done. 
The reader may wonder at the use of the running stitch 
instead of hemming. The hemming stitch is very hard for 
little children. Even children in the fourth grade find it 
difficult when they first learn it. The blanket-stitch was 
reviewed and served as a satisfactory finish for the articles 
needing unturned edges. The pillow and mattress needed a 
strong stitch, overhanding, a simple one to learn.
-P-A-G-E-310
202 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Laundry Work.—When the articles were completed the 
table and bed linen needed laundering before using. That 
each child might wash one piece, some washed their indi- 
vidual towels. Several pans of water in the schoolroom, 
small heated flat-irons, and improvised ironing-boards com- 
pleted the necessary equipment. The drying of the clothes 
had to be done on the roof. 
Housekeeping.—The housekeeping was a pleasure that, 
after the first real lessons in bed-making, sweeping, dusting, 
etc., had to be divided up by separating the class into fami- 
lies of four, each to hold his place as father, mother, boy, or 
girl for one week. The daily 10.30 milk-and-cracker luncheon 
supplied practice in simple table-setting and table etiquette. 
The family in each case enjoyed the privilege of using the 
dining-room, while the rest ate as usual on their desks. 
Toward the end of the year the sixth-grade class in the 
school gratified a longing of the families for some sort of floor 
covering by presenting a rug made on the Colonial loom, in 
connection with a study of the way in which design is pro- 
duced in cloth. 
A Unit of Work in Grade 5.—The household-arts phases 
of the work taught in the fifth grade in the same school show 
the widening interest that may be expected of a child of ten 
or eleven years, in contrast to the play home that is the 
natural point of contact for the primary children.

  264 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Foods.—The outline under “Foods” speaks for itself. 
The lessons were frequently taught in the school kitchen, 
but with substitutions and few changes the same lessons 
could have been taught in other rooms. The practical work 
in connection with the beet-sugar industry consisted in the 
cooking of chopped beets, draining out the beets and finally 
boiling down the liquor. The taste of the water is convincing. 
Clothing.—The making of charts under clothing may 
need explanation. Loose-leaved books were made by the 
children. On these pages’ were mounted illustrations of 
boys or girls of the age of fifth-grade children. 
Chart-Making.—Materials suited to the individual gar- 
ments were mounted in order in the book. Careful cutting, 
pasting, and placing on the page, definite consideration being 
given to color combinations, made an attractive result. Co- 
operative charts made to hang on the wall can tell the stories 
of cotton, linen, or other textile production, transportation, 
and manufacture much more graphically than discussion 
alone. Each child’s interest in adding contributions to the 
whole tends to make the problem vital. Free use of pictures, 
stereoscope, and lantern-slides helps to form correct mental 
pictures. 
Holding the Boy’s Interest.—The boys in the fifth grade 
are naturally not vitally interested in hand-sewing. Beyond 
the point of sewing on buttons, mending balls or tents, it is 
rather difficult for the teacher. Making of work aprons by 
hand for shop or kitchen and, in connection, a study of the 
garment-making industry in New York City helped the boys 
to realize the importance of the sewing-machine. An appre- 
ciation of labor involved, dangers of sweat-shop work, the 
injustice of the low rates on piece-work ought to lay founda- 
tions for a democratic social attitude. 
Arithmetic.—The arithmetic of the grade was given prac- 
tical application by various calculations in connection with 
the industry in New York City.

III. HovsEHotp ARTS IN THE UPPER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Planning the Course of Study in Household Arts for the 
Upper Elementary School.—With the home and its manifold 
problems as the source of subject matter, the responsibility 
for the selection of material suited to the needs of the chil- 
dren in the upper elementary school lies with the teacher. 
A survey of sanitary, economic, social, and spiritual home 
conditions of the neighborhood must help to determine the 
problems to be selected in this work. Close correlation with 
the work of the grade and an insight into the present inter- 
ests and future prospects of the girls must parallel this survey. 
Suggested Questions in Survey.—A few suggestive ques- 
tions for use in investigation follow: 
What is the average income of the families of these girls? 
Are their homes fitted with modern plumbing? 
What is the water-supply for these homes? 
Have they any connection with a sewage system? If 
not, what are the sanitary conditions about the homes? 
To what extent has the property been kept in repair? 
What is the fuel used ? 
What is the attitude of the family toward 
(a) House furnishings ? 
(6) Attractive meal service ? 
(c) Taste in dress? 
(d) Fresh air? 
(e) Flies? 
To what extent do the individual families feel a respon- 
sibility for the welfare of the neighborhood ? 
To what extent do ideal family relations exist ? 
Does the present generation understand and appreciate 
the work accomplished by parents and grandparents? 
In what way are the foods used by this community influ- 
enced by nationality and creed ? 
Need for Specific Adaptation to Community and Individ- 
ual Homes.—Although there are many problems common
-P-A-G-E-314
  266 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
to all homes, each course of study as planned must reflect 
the interests and the home life of the specific community in 
which it is to be taught. Live problems must form the basis 
for the course of study; and surely in this day of economic 
pressure, it will be the most natural thing in the world for 
the children to feel the need of solving the problems of their 
own homes. 
In addition to the worth-while problem, the course of 
study must evidence continuity of thought, gradation in 
manipulative processes, development and application of 
working principles, relation to other class work, interests, 
and unity of the whole. 
The Household-Arts Work as a Bond Between Home 
and School.—As a means of unifying home and school, this 
subject is very valuable. Every opportunity for strengthen- 
ing this bond should be cherished. In the case of limited 
school equipment, much valuable work may be done through 
home practice, supervised by the teacher and followed by 
reports and comparison of products. 
Co-operation with the School Lunch-Room.—Co-opera- 
tion between the department of household arts and the school 
lunch-room provides increased opportunity for making the 
work of the upper elementary school practical. It is neces- 
sary to exercise judgment in developing such a scheme. If 
the demands of the lunch-room are allowed to regulate the 
lessons taught, there is danger of limiting the educational 
value of the subject. On the other hand, the utilization in 
the lunch-room of the products prepared in the class in cook- 
ing results (1) in the use of family recipes in place of the 
very small quantity, (2) standardized products, and (3) an 
opportunity for occasional repetition of processes for the 
purpose of attaining skill.

IV. SvuGGESTIONS FOR COURSE OF STUDY IN THE UPPER 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
Suggestive Course of Study in Household Arts for the 
Upper Elementary School.—The following course of study is 
similar in nature to one which has been worked out in a 
school in a large city. The time allowance is three hours a 
week; but at certain times, when the course requires it, extra 
time is granted for excursions and discussions. This is con- 
sidered legitimate, because of the close correlation with the 
work in history, geography, and mathematics which gain 
strength through such readjustments. 
Scope of Work in the Upper Elementary School.—Every 
effort has been made to establish problems which represent 
the existing ones in the homes of the children; and in solv- 
ing them constant application is made to the individual 
home. The consecutive two-year course includes a study 
of the following home activities: 
1. Choice, making, and care of clothing. 
Furnishing and care of home. 
Buying, preparation, and service of foods. 
Personal and civic hygiene and sanitation. 
Elementary economics of the household. 
Varied needs of different members of the family. 
7. Home ideals. 
Economics of the Home an Important Factor.—Especial 
emphasis is laid throughout the course upon economy in the 
management of the home. A family of five is made the 
basis of calculation. 
Importance of Seeing Things ‘‘ At First Hand.””—Excur- 
sions to bakeries, mills, museums, exhibits, shops, markets, 
and well-ordered homes are strongly recommended. As a 
substitute for the real, in case such excursions are impossible, 
the stereopticon, reflectoscope, stereoscope, and moving-pic- 
ture films are not “just as good,” but have an educational 
value. SiC BS

268 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Vocational Guidance One of the Household-Arts Teacher’s 
Responsibilities.—In addition to training the girl in the art 
and science of home-making, the teacher of the household 
arts has as one of her sacred responsibilities the chance to 
help in the formation of the future plans of her girls. Through 
her guidance a girl may eventually enter a field which is suited 
to her needs and interests. The elementary school teacher 
may be able to lengthen the school life of the girl by helping 
her to plan a satisfactory high school course. 
An earnest twofold study is necessary for this: 
x. An appreciation and understanding of vocations open 
to girls. 
2. A sympathetic and intelligent study of the girl, her 
interests and her capabilities. 
Furthermore, opportunities for earning money present 
themselves to the girl who is able to assist in household ac- 
tivities. The alert teacher will serve as a medium for bring- 
ing to her girls these opportunities as a field for practical 
experience. 
SUGGESTED COURSE FOR GRADE 7 
Problems for the Year 
“How can I help to share my father’s and mother’s responsibilities 
in our home?”

HOUSE-FURNISHING COURSE IN GRADE 8 
Suggested Course in House-Furnishing in Grade 8.—A series of les- 
sons establishing ideals in home-furnishing may be given either parallel 
to or blended with the course already outlined. It is desirable that 
a definite problem supply the motive for this work. A typical apart- 
ment or a group of rooms will give a tangible basis for the discussion 
and application of principles of art and sanitation. The needs, inter- 
ests, and personality of each member of the K. family must enter into 
the problem of furnishing their home. 
This course furnishes a fitting climax for the work in art, textiles, 
and sanitation. Furthermore, it should be supported by history and 
literature, in the growth of home and home ideals. 
1In the Household Arts Review, December, 1913, a description of such a 
course is given. Since the article was written, a more concrete problem has 
been the basis for the work.

HOUSEHOLD ARTS 277 
SUMMARY 
. Since the Colonial period many of the home industries have been 
taken from the children’s environment. As a result, the sub- 
jects of industrial and household arts have been introduced into 
the school curriculum. 
. These subjects have a twofold aim, namely, general education and 
technical skill as a basis for vocational efficiency, one of the 
five great aims laid down in the introductory chapters. The 
nature of the course of study varies to meet the general and 
the local needs of those it serves. 
. In the lower elementary school the work in industrial arts includes 
the subjects of household arts in that it deals with processes 
and products connected with foods and textiles. 
. Because of the class teacher’s intimate knowledge of the children’s 
needs and her ability to unify all the subject-matter to be 
taught, it is desirable that she teach the household-arts phases 
of industrial arts under the advice of the supervisor who can 
establish continuity throughout the school. 
. The ingenious teacher will find it possible to teach the household- 
arts phases of industrial arts in her own classroom by devising 
or procuring simple and inexpensive equipment. 
. In the upper elementary or junior secondary school the work in 
household arts is differentiated from the industrial arts, and is 
taught by a special teacher when possible. 
. The household-arts courses may well be organized on the basis of 
problems which children meet daily in their own lives. 
. The earlier methods of teaching household arts, e. g., the use of 
small quantities in cooking, use of samplers and models in 
teaching stitches and processes of garment-making, the theo- 
retical treatment of laundering, housekeeping, house-furnishing, 
etc., are all being superseded by the utilization of real-life situa- 
tions. 
. The practice house, the canning clubs, the lunch-rooms, fairs, relief 
work of various kinds, home projects, and credit for home 
work, all offer opportunities for a kind of experience which is 
not only vitally interesting, but which is connected with the 
life experiences of the children.

278. TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
1. After studying the subject of spinning in the primitive, Colonial, 
and modern stages, plan a series of lessons for teaching the 
subject in Grade 4 in the school that you know best. What 
problems can you make out that will both help the arithmetic 
of the grade and the child’s grasp of the spinning industry? 
How could you vitalize the geography, English, and spelling, 
through the same subject? How much physical activity is 
included in your scheme? 
2. Adapt the subject matter of the spinning industry to Grade 2 in 
whatever school you may choose. 
3- Plan a series of lessons for Grade 5 which will make the children 
intelligent in their appreciation of milk as a food and in the 
selection of the grade of milk suited to their needs, when the 
prices vary from $0.08 to $0.20 per quart. In what ways can 
the other subjects of the grade be made more live through 
connection with the study of the milk problem? 
4. Plan a series of fifteen lessons in cookery to be taught to eighteen 
seventh-grade girls who, through heavy home responsibilities, 
see only drudgery in household work. 
5. Adapt the same general subject matter to girls who seldom have 
the opportunity of working in their own home kitchens. 
6. Outline six lessons in laundry work as related to textiles as you 
would teach it to a group of ten girls of twelve years of age in 
a city school in a congested district. 
7. List fifteen articles that you would consider it sensible to have 
made by hand in a rural school district. 
8. Select a detailed course of study in household arts for some ele- 
mentary school. Criticise it both constructively and destruc- 
tively in the light of your recent study. 
9. Devise schemes for incorporating lessons on care of the baby, 
house-furnishing, keeping accounts, hospitality, care of the bed- 
room, care of clothing into a household-arts course in a con- 
servative school. 
to. What are the minimal essentials in home education in the first 
six or nine grades and what has been done to measure results in 
this field ? 
11. What does such education do for the five great aims of teaching— 
vital, vocational, avocational, civic, and moral efficiency?

  CHAPTER XII 
INDUSTRIAL ARTS 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
. What capacities do children possess that require work in the manip- 
ulation of materials and tools for their appropriate develop- 
ment? 
. In industrial-arts work, in how far should children deal primarily 
with ideas and in how far with mere physical execution? 
. If the worth of a school subject is to be measured in terms of the 
richness and use of its body of thought, what changes are needed 
in the work usually called manual training to give it a place 
in school comparable with arithmetic, geography, and history? 
. Assume that in a given unit of industrial-arts work not one of the 
children is ever called upon in after-life actually to do the kind 
of hand-work used. What must be the character of the study 
of the unit as a whole to justify it educationally? 
. Make a list of the questions you yourself need to ask and answer 
in order to purchase clothing with intelligence and satisfaction 
—dquality of goods, design of fabrics, construction of garments, 
prices, and other important questions. Write a similar list for 
furniture and for foods. What problems might a course in 
industrial arts consider in bringing out values not usually in- 
cluded in manual training? 
. What are the industries about which it is most important that 
we should know in order to be intelligent consumers? 
. How does the study of the industries for giving the information 
and training required for intelligent selection and use differ 
from the technical training required for the industrial producer? 
. If you are a teacher without special training in industrial arts, how 
may you go about it to develop for yourself one kind of work 
at a time until you have adapted a full programme to the needs 
of your particular grade or grades? 
. If you cannot introduce industrial arts as a separate subject in 
your programme, which of the problems discussed in the fol- 
lowing pages can you introduce as parts of or in connection 
with the regular subjects of your school—arithmetic, geogra- 
phy, history, hygiene, nature study, or English?

  282 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
I. Invustriat Arts IN THE MODERN SCHOOL 
Need for Industrial Arts in Schools.—Our foods, shelter, 
clothing, tools, machines, and many other needs are all made 
from natural materials. To be of final use to us most of 
these materials must be changed from their natural state. 
Wood must be made into furniture, implements, or buildings; 
cotton and wool must be spun, woven, and made into gar- 
ments; metals must be refined and formed into tools, machine 
parts, building constructions, and many other forms. These 
changes from materials as provided by nature into prodiicts 
for use are called manufacturing processes or industrial arts. 
A study of the industries or industrial arts in the elemen- 
tary school is of greater importance than ever before, because 
of the concentration of industries in factories and shops, away 
from the home and every-day life of our time. The informa- 
tion and attitudes desirable about the making of our clothing, 
furniture, shelter, foods, and other products were once got- 
ten by children in their own homes and through their own 
participation. But to-day, if this experience is to be had at 
all, it must be gotten through the school. 
Values: Information.—The proper study of industrial arts 
should give values of three kinds, namely, information, appre- 
ciations, and habits and attitudes. The information most 
immediately valuable is that which makes one intelligent 
about industrial products from the standpoint of the con- 
sumer. We all have to select and purchase clothing, but few 
have to make it. The information all need about clothing 
is that of economic values, health qualities, appropriateness 
of various kinds of clothing to various purposes and occa- 
sions, and the proper care of clothing. To get this informa- 
tion we must learn something of the various processes in the 
making of fabrics—spinning, weaving, dyeing, designing, and 
finishing. We must know the various methods of adultera- 
tions, so that we can detect shoddy and other inferior goods. 
We must know the several tests by which to identify each
-P-A-G-E-331
  INDUSTRIAL ARTS 283 
particular textile material—cotton, wool, linen, and silk. All 
of these facts help us to judge of values in buying clothing or 
clothing materials. For furniture, the problem is also one of 
buying rather than making for most people. To buy intelli- 
gently, we must know the kinds of wood used in furniture, 
together with their desirability and proper cost. We must 
know as well the various types of construction—which are 
substantial and durable and which are not. Many of the 
problems about foods are also those of food values and cost 
values—matters of information that help us to purchase and 
use foods wisely and economically. 
Appreciations.—The second value for the study, that of 
appreciations, has to do with the cultivation of taste. We 
desire to train children to know good standards of form in all 
products and to like these. We want them to know good 
design in all its elements so that they will be able to select 
furniture, clothing, china, rugs, wall-papers, and all other 
material products, so that these will be beautiful and in har- 
mony with their purposes. School work should lead the 
children to know when things are beautiful by all good stand- 
ards, to like that which is beautiful, and be influenced in 
their choices by this work. 
Habits and Attitudes.—The third value, that of habits 
and attitudes, comes as a kind of by-product of the proper 
emphasis of the other values. The attitude of carefully con- 
sidering everything made or purchased from the standpoint 
of its economic value and its qualities of design or beauty 
naturally results from a consideration of these points in every 
problem taken up in the school. To avoid the waste of 
money, to get thoroughly good qualities, to secure designs 
that are excellent and permanent, is an attitude of very great 
worth to both men and women. The habits of thoroughness, 
of carefulness in workmanship, and of thinking a problem 
through before beginning its execution, are all inherent in 
the study of industrial arts. 
A further and more largely social kind of information, of
-P-A-G-E-332
  284 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
attitudes, and of appreciations is also included in a study of 
present-day industries. We should all know something of the 
factory system of to-day, the large amount of automatic 
machine production, the kinds of work each worker does, the 
surroundings of workers as to health, moral conditions, wages, 
and the relationships of the worker and the employer, the 
risks of limb and life, and such other questions as enable us 
to act intelligently as citizens. When we find sweat-shop 
conditions in an industry, we should be able to do something 
to help its workers. This we may do by buying from those 
producers only who have good conditions and pay living 
wages, and by helping to pass and enforce laws abolishing 
improper conditions. Our study of the industry should pro- 
vide us the information, and cultivate in us the appreciations 
and attitudes of mind toward the workers in industry which 
will help us to be just to them and aid, as good citizens, in 
making their conditions of work and life wholesome and 
happy. 
Industrial Arts vs. Manual Training.—This kind of study 
of the industries emphasizes their present-day methods. It 
differs from manual training in this particular. Manual 
training has emphasized very largely the development of 
manual dexterity and such physical and mental growth as 
might be promoted by this. Industrial arts includes all that 
might be thus accomplished by manual training and adds a 
great deal more. Manual training has been content to make 
a tabouret or a towel-roller or some other simple piece of 
furniture by handicraft methods; to make several garments 
by emphasizing chiefly the cutting and sewing processes; to 
make a few bowls or vases of clay by hand methods; and to 
omit almost wholly, whatever the field considered, the pres- 
ent-day problems of machine production, factory organiza- 
tion, and social changes which are so prominent in the world 
of industry. 
A Common Course the First Six Years.—Two rather dif- 
ferent forms of industrial-arts study are appropriate in the
-P-A-G-E-333
  
INDUSTRIAL ARTS 285 
elementary school of eight years. For the first five or six 
years the work may be the same for-both boys and girls, and 
without any reference to specific life-work later to be fol- 
lowed. The emphasis is from the standpoint of the con- 
sumer. The purpose is to provide that information, those 
appreciations, and those attitudes or habits which will be of 
equal value to all, whatever may be their means of livelihood. 
For the seventh and eighth grades the work may well be dif- 
ferentiated, the girls selecting the several household-arts 
fields included by foods, clothing, and the interior and deco- 
rative aspects of shelter, the boys selecting the wood-working, 
metal-working and allied fields usually occupied by men. 
The work primarily for girls is considered in Chapter XI, 
devoted to household arts. This unification’ of work for the 
first six years in many school systems is leading to the devel- 
opment of a six-year secondary school plan, with three years 
each for a junior and senior high school. The work of these 
seventh and eighth years, and of the ninth, also, in the junior 
high school, is of the kind to give boys a chance to try them- 
selves out and to discover their own capacities. It has high 
values for vocational-guidance purposes. 
To secure value from the study of industrial arts, it is 
clear that there must be a large body of subject matter or 
thought material for each industry, as well as many hand 
projects. While there is desired even more hand-work than 
is usually provided in manual-training courses, its purpose is 
more largely as a means than as an end in itself. Projects are 
made to clarify ideas, to serve as means of opening up the 
present-day field of some important industry, to cultivate 
appreciations in design and construction, to awaken right 
attitudes toward the workers in the industry, and to discover 
aptitudes and abilities for various types of industrial work.

  286 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
II. Content oF THE GENERAL COURSE 
The Unified Work of the First Six Grades.—That the 
study may accomplish the purposes required of it, the fields 
of industry must be carefully selected so that they will repre- 
sent the experience of most use and ‘value in daily living. 
On this basis, six rather large and definite kinds of industrial 
needs may be chosen as of fundamental importance. These 
are our needs for food, clothing, shelter, records, utensils, 
and tools and machines. About each of these large needs 
may be grouped problems and projects suited to clearer 
understanding and appreciation of the industry. The grad- 
ing of these problems and projects is not a very difficult mat- 
ter. Much flexibility may be used. Various problems may 
be placed in any of the first three or four grades, many others 
in any of the grades between fourth and sixth, inclusive. In 
suggesting problems and projects under each of the six fields, 
the order followed is that which has been found very satis- 
factory in practice through the first six grades. 
Foods.—Simple problems in what we eat, how our needs 
are supplied, and how some kinds of food are preserved for 
winter use may be taken up in the first grade. The canning 
or preserving of some one fruit may be done as a school proj- 
ect. If there is a school garden, use some product from it. 
A simple study of the grocery and fruit stand as the imme- 
diate source of foods may be made. A small display stand 
of wood for showing fruits and vegetables may be made 
and used. Some clay-modelling, paper-cutting, and painting 
lessons may use fruits and vegetables as studies, calling atten- 
tion definitely to form and color. The cleanliness of foods 
eaten, the avoidance of decayed fruits, and the need for 
cleaning foods thoroughly are suggestive topics in the hy- 
giene of foods. 
The early methods of food preservation as drying, salting, 
and smoking; the preparation of food for the table; noting

the kinds of food that are cooked; the kinds of food as to 
plant and animal; the sources from which the grocer and 
fruit dealer secure their supplies; storage of fruits and vege- 
tables for the winter; milk and milk products, showing the 
value of milk as compared with other foods, the making of 
butter and cheese; ways of thickening milk with flour, egg, 
starch, and rennet; a study of some of the tropical or sub- 
tropical fruits, as oranges, dates, figs, and olives, with the 
uses of these; the drying of apples and pumpkins; the meth- 
ods, historic and present, of making meal and flour; visiting 
a mill, if possible; and other simple problems and projects 
may be suitably adapted to second and third grade needs. 
Studies of eggs—food values, preserving, testing, uses in 
preparing other foods, and cooking; starch—food values, 
tests, methods of cooking and using rice and macaroni; manu- 
facture of macaroni; fish—food value, methods of preserving, 
kinds, sources; serving a luncheon, showing a well-balanced 
meal by proper selection of foods; and simple projects in 
cooking, as boiling eggs, cooking rice with cheese, cocoa; 
baked potato, and oyster soup or chowder may be used in 
the fourth grade. 
For the fifth and sixth grades problems in the study 
of cereals, meats, sugar, market-gardening, the by-products 
of foods, fermentation, beverages, dietaries, the economics of 
foods and simple projects in the preparation and cooking 
of some of the foods studied may be taken up. For schools 
having no equipment for cooking, much of value can be 
accomplished by the study of foods, and the projects other 
than those of cooking may be carried out. Teachers may 
well secure the co-operation of mothers and provide for some 
simple but valuable experiments for the children in their 
own homes. ‘The school should be willing to give credit for 
all such home work when done as directed and when results 
are shown. 
Among the most important of the values of food studies 
here suggested are those of economic selection and buying 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  288 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
and of the hygienic problems of food. The purpose is not 
to make cooks any more than the study of poetry in the 
elementary school is to make poets. The work which pro- 
vides training for cookery courses in later grades is discussed 
in the chapter on “Household Arts.” 
Especial attention should be directed to the problem of 
pure foods, of how to detect impurities, and of how to aid in 
pure-food production and selection. Problems in the pur- 
chase of foods should be emphasized. Methods of buying— 
by telephone, by the order clerk who comes to the door, and 
by visiting the grocery or meat shop, should be compared 
as to results in the selection and cost. How to get the right 
food values at the smallest reasonable cost is an important 
problem. How to use every part of the food purchased, the 
avoidance of waste, is part of this problem. Emphasis 
throughout the work should be upon those factors that make 
for wholesome, economic, and happy usage of foods. 
Closely related to the food studies are problems of impor- 
tance in table service, table conduct, and in accessories of 
dining-room and kitchen. The place of the daughter in the 
problems of cooking, sewing, and related work, and of the 
duties, privileges, and relationships of the cook or maid in 
homes having one, may be appropriately considered. 
Clothing.—The study of clothing includes knowledge and 
appreciations which enable us to select clothing and clothing 
materials as to quality, durability, cost, and good taste. The 
making of simple looms and the weaving of a rug, a wash- 
cloth, and a bag, belt, or tie may be used as means of study- 
ing the various methods, ancient and modern, of spinning 
and weaving. In middle and upper grades, such study 
should include a knowledge of sources and characteristics of 
the four principal textile fibres—cotton, wool, linen, and silk. 
One of the very important items of knowledge we should all 
have is that of the methods of testing cloth, to know of what 
it is made and to know of the various forms of adulterating 
textiles and how to avoid these. Testing textiles by appear-
-P-A-G-E-339
  INDUSTRIAL ARTS 289 
ance, touch, burning, and simple chemical tests should be a 
part of the work. This is quite as important for boys as for 
girls, as all have the problem of buying clothing sooner or 
later. Connected with these studies of textile manufacture 
there should be a consideration of the great present-day 
power-plants for spinning, weaving, and knitting, their loca- 
tions and the causes for these, the amount and evils of child 
labor in mills, and the historic development of textile manu- 
facture from the simple hand methods of primitive peoples, 
the household methods of Colonial and former days, and the 
industrial revolution, with its inventions by Cartwright, Kay, 
Hargreaves, Arkwright, Jacquard, Eli Whitney, and others, 
and the effects of their inventions upon the industries and the 
social life of the people. 
By such projects as dressing dolls, making bags for gym- 
nasium shoes, laundry, or other needs, making work aprons, 
dressing dolls in middle grades in the costumes of various 
nationalities, darning stockings and sweaters, patching gar- 
ments, drafting a pattern for some simple garment, buying 
the goods and making the garment, adapting a commercial 
pattern to measurements, sewing on the machine, and other 
problems connected with every-day life needs, the children 
will learn the various types of stitches, develop familiarity 
with plain hand-sewing, become acquainted with the sewing- 
machine, if this is available, and learn much of importance 
about garment-making and purchase of clothing. ‘Through- 
out the work there should be constant attention to the selec- 
tion of goods and garments appropriate to definite purposes. 
Textiles and garments appropriate from the standpoint of 
health, seasons, occasions, and economy in cost and durabil- 
ity is a very real problem. In all of the work the art element 
should be sufficiently emphasized to cultivate good taste 
in dress. The field offers one of the best of opportunities 
for studying good design. Textile design, problems of line, 
tone, and color harmony in dress, and the relationships of 
style to good taste may all be emphasized to great advan-  
-P-A-G-E-340
290 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tage. If children can be taught that, no matter how small 
the amount to be expended for clothing, combinations of line, 
tone, and color may be secured that are pleasing and beauti- 
ful, it will mean that all the time and effort expended in such 
studies are well worth while. 
Clothing budgets for individual children and for families 
should be studied. How much does it cost to clothe a child 
for one year? How much for a grown person? What should 
a good pair of shoes cost? May one really profit by pur- 
chasing clothing at special sales? Are clothes of good quality 
really more expensive than those of poor quality? These are 
questions suggestive of those that may be taken up with 
much practical profit. 
Shelter and Furnishings.—The study of shelter and house- 
furnishings includes that knowledge and appreciation of ma- 
terials, construction, and decoration which should enable us 
to live comfortably, economically, and in pleasing surround- 
ings. While relatively little may be done in constructing 
buildings or furniture typical of commercial methods in the 
first six grades, much may be done in gaining ideas and ideals 
which make for the selection of the right kinds of homes and 
furnishings. 
In the first grade, the construction of a house, using boxes 
for individual rooms, assembling them as a house of one 
story, two stories, or an apartment-house, offers opportunity 
for several months of study of excellent value. A key-hole 
saw may be used to saw out doors and windows; window and 
door frames, base-board, and roof may be made and placed. 
Brick-moulds may be made of wood, and bricks moulded from 
clay for a chimney. The work of the carpenter and the 
mason are thus introduced. Paper for walls may be de- 
signed, made, and hung. Linoleums for kitchen floors may 
be similarly made. The exterior of the house and its casings 
and base-boards may be painted. The work of the paper- 
hanger and painter will thus come into the study and will 
enlarge the appreciation of our dependence upon the workers

in the various occupations. The house may now be furnished 
with small beds, tables, chairs, bureaus, sideboards, book- 
cases, and other furniture; with suitable kitchen and bath- 
room equipment, part of which may be moulded in clay; and 
with curtains, rugs, bed-clothing, and other textile materials 
made by the children. . As a vital part of the method, many 
visits should be made. These should include a house in 
process of construction, a house in which paper-hangers and 
painters are at work, a furniture store, a wall-paper store, a 
dry-goods store, and any other places which would give ideas 
of how these various material needs are actually supplied 
and the problems that arise in their selection. It will be 
noted by the children that bricks, stone, cement, and iron 
are also used as building materials. 
In the second grade, furniture of a more substantial form 
than that used in furnishing the house may be made. A 
plain form of furniture, very attractive, has been made in 
the second grade by using screw construction. Chairs as 
large as kindergarten chairs, tables at which these may be 
placed, beds thirty inches long, and bookcases and buffets 
in proportion, have been made with decided success. Each 
piece is made by a group of from two to five children. When 
made, the furniture is used for study of the use and care of 
the several rooms to which they respectively belong—dining- 
room, living-room, and bedroom. This furniture may be 
made in the grade room and requires no shop and but few 
tools—rulers, try-squares, saws, a plane, hammers, and 
screw-drivers. For glass effects in bookcases and sideboard, 
celluloid or isinglass sheets may be used. In studying ele- 
mentary aspects of the sources of lumber, a lumber camp 
may be made on a sand-table. Excursions to a furniture- 
repair shop and to furniture stores should be a part of the 
work. All work in this field should relate to the use, appro- 
priateness, selection, and care of furnishings in the home. 
In the third grade the homes of other peoples, present and 
historic, provides much opportunity for closely related work  
-P-A-G-E-344
    292 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
in geography, history, and industrial arts. Indian wigwams, 
cliff-houses, Eskimo houses of snow, Hebrew tents, as differ- 
ing from wigwams, showing adaptations to conditions of pas- 
toral life, and sun-dried bricks as used for the houses in the 
later period of Hebrew life are all possible subjects of study 
and problems for projects in house building and furnishing. 
The making of a loom with a simple heddle is a project for 
further work in wood. In the fourth and fifth grades, shelter 
and furnishing problems of Greeks, Romans, and later Euro- 
pean peoples may be studied, showing the growth made by 
man in his use of more difficult materials, and his great ad- 
vance in architecture as found in temples, cathedrals, and 
castles. In the fifth grade, study of lumbering, milling, and 
manufacture of woods into building materials, vehicles, and 
furniture may continue in connection with regional geogra- 
phy. Projects in wood may include window-boxes or other 
boxes with butt-joints, game-boards, picture-frames, and a 
potter’s wheel, or a loom as needed in other lines of work. 
In the sixth grade the Colonial house of logs and the later 
developments of shelter down to the present may help to 
develop a usable knowledge of the problems one has to solve 
in selecting and caring for an appropriate home. The present 
variety of materials, their cost, durability, and appropriate- 
ness under differing conditions of climate and city or rural 
environment, are studies worth while. Problems in lighting 
and heating are appropriately included. The sanitation and 
hygiene of the home and home life may be vitally related at 
many points in this study of shelter. Projects in wood may 
include a book-rack, wooden forms for concrete projects, and 
projects in wood as needed in other fields. 
Throughout this work, the emphasis is upon that intelli- 
gence and appreciation needed for the selection and care of 
the home through a knowledge of its materials, its purposes, 
and its evolution. By the projects in various materials for 
sand-table and in shop, habits of dexterity and constructive 
control are normally developed,
-P-A-G-E-345
  INDUSTRIAL ARTS 293 
Records.—The problem of the race in recording its experi- 
ences has resulted in the present great arts of printing and 
publishing. The evolution of this industry from the simple 
cairn, or pile of stones, through notched sticks, picture-writing, 
invention of the alphabet, tablet and stylus, wood blocks, 
movable type, printing-presses, and the marvellous type- 
setting machines and printing-presses of to-day makes a 
story of interest and value. 
In lower grades, booklets of very simple form may be 
made for written work, drawings, and small charts. Sheets 
cut to appropriate size may be folded in the middle to form 
a hinge and tied with cord. Others, as for spelling lists, 
may be cut in appropriate strips and tied through holes 
punched at one end. In the third grade, binders in simple 
form with a hinge are easily made. In the fourth grade, 
pamphlet-binding may make up one or more projects, and 
a one-section book with a cloth-case cover and single-end 
sheets may be made. The historic aspects of book-making 
may be taken up in connection with history, or, if there is 
no such work provided in the course of study, the stories of 
parchment, of the invention of paper, of hand-copied books, 
of the invention of printing, and others may be introduced 
from time to time in connection with book-making projects. 
In the fifth and sixth grades, binders with hinged joints and 
eyelets, and a final book, sewed on tapes with double-end 
sheets, may be made. For the end sheets of the book, wood- 
block designs may be made for their decoration. An illumi- 
nated initial letter will introduce a study of the interesting 
illuminated lettering of books and manuscripts of the Middle 
Ages. Children may well begin to make card catalogues of 
references used in various subjects. A catalogue case of 
cardboard, with gummed-tape joining, is a good project for 
the fifth grade, while a similar case of wood may be made 
in the sixth grade. 
Visits should be made to a printing establishment, if pos- 
sible, where linotype or monotype machines, cylinder presses, 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
204 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
etchings, electroplating, color illustrations, machine binding, 
and other methods of this large industry may be studied. 
Attention to design in books and periodicals, quality of ma- 
terials and binding, and care of books are all important ele- 
ments. The present sources of wood-pulp and other mate- 
rials used in paper-making connects the work with some 
phases of geography and current civic problems. 
Utensils.—Utensils are made of clay, wood, metal, paper, 
and some other materials. The making of simple utensils in 
clay by the several methods of hand-modelling may be begun 
in the first grade and continued through the six grades with 
one or two projects each year. Commercial methods of 
making china and other pottery lead to a study of the pot- 
ter’s wheel, one and two piece moulds, glazes, decorations of 
various forms, and the characteristics of Italian, French, 
Delft, Dresden, English, and American wares. The pottery 
of historic peoples is worthy of attention, notably that of the 
Greeks. The stories of Palissy, Wood, and Wedgwood may 
well be connected with the study of pottery. Especial atten- 
tion should be given to design ih present-day wares found in 
stores and shops. 
In the sixth grade, some simple forms of flower pots or 
boxes may be made of concrete, the forms providing good 
projects in wood-working. 
Boxes of cardboard or paper may be made, as use for 
these appears in the several grades. A box for seeds, for 
candy, for gloves or handkerchiefs, a catalogue-card case, or a 
pencil-box are illustrations of possibilities in cardboard. 
In the fifth and sixth grades simple copper bowls may be 
made by hammering and annealing. The process of etching 
may be shown by etching a simple decorated design on such 
a bowl. ; 
Box forms in wood have been referred to under shelter 
and furnishing. One basket in each of two or three grades 
may be made illustrative of processes of weaving as modified 
for coarse materials and varieties of forms.

INDUSTRIAL ARTS 295 
In all this study of utensils the projects chosen should be 
the means of approaching the industry in its present aspects, 
and of leading to an appreciation of the factors concerning it 
which it is useful for us to know. 
Tools and Machines.—While relatively little may be 
done in making tools and machines in the elementary school, 
a great deal may be learned of their use and importance. 
Industry grows yearly more and more away from hand proc- 
esses to machine processes. But every machine had its fore- 
runner in a hand-tool. The uses of hand-tools in wood-work- 
ing, preparing foods, textile manufacture and sewing, metal- 
working, pottery, and in agriculture, are learned as they are 
employed in these several fields. The making of looms, pot- 
ter’s wheels, water-wheels, windmills, rowboats, aeroplanes, 
derricks, and other mechanical devices gives practice in the 
study and application of numerous simple mechanical prin- 
ciples. These principles and their wider application in ma- 
chinery should be emphasized wherever possible. The con- 
stant contact with many machines, simple and complex, may 
be used as an approach to a more detailed study of some 
of these. Bicycles, automobiles, and other vehicles, lift- 
ing pumps, vacuum cleaners, sewing-machines, power-driven 
saws, planes, hammers, and other machine-shop equipment, 
hand and power driven printing-presses, electrically driven 
machinery of all kinds, the great variety of farm implements 
for seeding, cultivating, harvesting and threshing, churns, 
washing-machines, and all other household devices—all of 
these are opportunities for study in this field, some knowledge 
of which is so essential to an understanding and appreciation 
of present-day industry. One of the purposes of excursions 
to industrial plants is to give this appreciation of the mean- 
ing of machinery in the industries as they are to-day. 
Survey of the First Six Grades.—From the foregoing 
brief outline of possibilities for a course of study in the indus- 
trial arts in the first six grades, the very close relationship 
between this work, arithmetic, geography, and history will  
-P-A-G-E-350
296 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
be apparent. Much of the work in these three fields can be 
quite directly motivated by problems and situations in the 
industrial arts. By due emphasis upon the common facts 
and problems included in the industrial-arts course, the work 
of the teacher is made easier and more effective rather than 
increased. Meanings are more clearly seen by the children, 
and the relationships vitally conneeting one subject with 
another make each support and help the others. 
TI. DirreRENTIATED WorRK FOR UPPER GRADES 
Seventh and Eighth Grades.—With the background of 
general industrial intelligence and the manipulative dexterity 
acquired in the first six grades, more intensive and detailed 
study of the most prominent mechanical industries may be 
made. For this work shops will be required. The work 
should employ as largely as possible the methods used in 
industry as actually carried on in the present day. Cabinet- 
making and elementary carpentry in wood, foundry work, 
forging, and machine-shop work in metals, plumbing, elec- 
trical wiring and construction, and printing are possible fields. 
Cabinetmaking in wood, foundry or machine shop work in 
metals, and printing might well be selected in smaller schools 
able to provide a small equipment. If one line of work only 
can be employed, probably wood-work is the most valuable 
because of the range of tools and machinery used. A shop 
for this work should have a circular saw and a lathe, as well 
as the usual hand-tools. The early use of machines is de- 
sirable in setting up ideals and giving standards of efficiency. 
Hand-work is improved rather than impaired by machine- 
work. 
For projects in wood or metal, it is impossible here more 
than to suggest that they should be typical of those demanded 
by the conditions of life round about. Care should be taken 
that they be graded in such a way as to develop increased 
capacity in the range of tools and processes included. Visits 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
  INDUSTRIAL ARTS 297 
to commercial shops should always be an important part of 
this work. : 
In printing, there are always projects for the school board 
which make it practicable to do work on a commercial basis 
from the beginning. Programs, report cards, notices, and 
other forms are in constant need in a school system. 
As an integral part of the industrial-arts work there should 
be problems in constructive drawing and design and in indus- 
trial arithmetic.and geometry. The industrial drawing and 
design should develop in direct relationship with the shop 
problems, and the mathematical problems should be those 
needed by the industrial worker in measurements and esti- 
mates, and in time and wages. 
Many problems in geography, history, and civics should 
also be approached through the study of industrial materials, 
manufacturing centres and markets, and to social phases of 
industry. Safety devices, shop sanitation, employer’s-lia- 
bility and workmen’s-compensation laws, factory inspection, 
labor laws, trade-unions, and the legal and moral privileges 
and obligations of workers and employers should all have a 
place in connection with the industries studied. Wages, 
standards of living, opportunities for advancement, and the 
probable future of the industry should be considered. Apti- 
tudes required for success, and especial attention to each 
boy’s capacities as shown by his work, should be thought of 
in connection with choice of vocation. 
For helps in the selection of projects teachers will find 
many text-books in any of the fields indicated. These should 
be consulted and used for whatever they may contribute, 
but care must be taken not to follow mechanically, or the 
vitality will be lost from the work. Contact with living 
industry itself and suggestion and guidance from it are the 
means of making the work of most value, both educationally 
and vocationally.

SUMMARY 
  . Industrial arts is a study of the changes made in natural raw ma- 
terials, converting them into products of greater value and use. 
This study includes consideration of materials, processes, meth- 
ods of construction in relationship to use, economic values, and 
elements of industrial design. 
. Industrial arts in the elementary school considers the problems of 
selection of materials and methods of construction more from 
the standpoint of the user than from that of the producer. It 
is not a study of industry for vocational production. It at- 
tempts to provide that information, develop those habits and 
attitudes, and cultivate those appreciations which will make 
intelligent consumers and citizens. 
3- Problems in construction are not primarily to develop skill in pro- 
duction. While reasonable growth in manipulative skill is an 
important by-product of the work, the higher aim is to develop 
insight and appreciation, which cannot be secured without 
active participation in the use of materials. 
4. Since our most common need for art appreciation is in the selection oe of products that should be beautiful rather than ugly, every 
project in industrial art should be a problem in fine art. The 
development of standards and principles of good design and of 
a love for good design may be most effectively secured through 
a study of these standards and principles as they are applied in 
clothing, house-furnishings, and other material utilities. 
For the first six grades the work may well be the same for both 
boys and girls, and without reference to future vocations. An 
organization of the six units, foods, clothing, shelter, utensils, 
tools and machines, and records, provides the fields of industry 
of most importance to all people. Suitable problems in each 
of these fields may be selected for each grade, the problems 
growing more complex and difficult as children advance in age 
and grade. 
6. In the seventh and eighth grades the work should be differentiated 
for boys and girls, the girls taking up the more direct and tech- 
nical phases of household arts. Boys should continue to work 
more intensively in the industries using wood, metals, concrete, 
and some other materials. Industrial conditions, as well as 
industrial processes, should be studied more thoroughly. The 
purpose is to develop broader industrial insight and intelli- 
gence, and to provide vocational-guidance values through test- 
ing capacities and interests.

7. The equipment for industrial arts in the first six grades need not 
be very elaborate or very expensive. Many commonplace ma- 
terials may be used. The industrial needs and activities of 
the community should be studied extensively through visits 
and through descriptive printed matter and pictures. 
8. In the elementary school, the very vital relationship between in- 
dustry and the other school subjects indicates that it is highly 
desirable that the regular grade teacher should teach the in- 
dustrial arts as well as the other subjects. So treated the sub- 
jects help each other and the work becomes unified and forceful. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
1. Make a full outline of the important facts one should know about 
the use, preparation, and care of milk and milk products, 
arranging these so that each grade will have those problems 
best adapted to its abilities. Make a similar outline for cereals, 
for meat, fish, and eggs, for fruits, and for vegetables. 
. Make a list of the most important facts one should know about 
the four principal textile materials—wool, cotton, linen, and 
silk—and suggest simple projects in the selection of materials, 
cutting, and sewing which will lead to a study of these facts. 
3. Make a collection of samples of each of the principal textile ma- 
terials which will illustrate the various forms of textile design, 
and the differences in goods of different qualities and prices. 
4. Compile a list of the several simple methods for testing the purity 
and quality of each of the important textile materials, and 
teach children how to make these tests. 
. Outline the most important points one should have in mind in the 
selection of furniture to secure excellence in material and con- 
struction, good design, and reasonable cost. Plan several sim- 
ple projects in wood which will form a basis for the study of 
these questions. 
6. Plan the building and complete furnishing of a doll house, con- 
necting with the various projects in construction a study of the 
work of those producing and handling these utilities commer- 
cially—the carpenter, mason, paper-hanger, furniture store, 
dry-goods store, and others. 
7. Plan a series of simple booklets which may be made by children, 
which will illustrate the essential steps in the making and bind- 
ing of books. Organize the more important steps in the evolu- 
tion of printing and book-making, and the present conditions 
in the printing and publishing industries. S na

8. Make a list of the facts which are of the greatest importance in 
the proper selection, use, and care of utensils of various mate- 
rials, and plan projects in pottery, box-making, and basketry 
which will provide a knowledge of these facts. 
9. Make an outline of the labor-saving devices, the implements, and 
the vehicles and other forms of machines in common use in 
the household or out of doors. What are the principles and 
facts about machine construction and operation which every 
one should know to be efficient and intelligent in the general 
use of machine implements and tools? 
to. After planning an adequate course in industrial projects and stud- 
“ies, make a list of the questions raised in these problems and 
studies which connect the work vitally with arithmetic, geogra- 
phy, history, civics, hygiene, and fine art. Note that these 
studies provide a means for unifying a very large part of the 
curriculum, offering problems of real meaning and of high 
value in every-day life.

  CHAPTER XIII 
FINE ART 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
1. What evidence have you observed which indicates that children 
have instinctive interests in artistic expression? 
2. In what ways do children manifest such interests? 
3. What was the attitude of the old-time school teachers toward such 
expression in school? 
4. Are the houses, barns, fences, and shrubbery outside, and the wall- 
paper, furniture, clothing, carpets, and pictures inside, of the 
homes of the persons who went to the old-time schools in good 
taste, or do they show a lack of esthetic education? 
5. What beauties of nature and of man’s artifices are most unappre- 
ciated by the people of your community? 
6. What ways can you suggest for promoting the appreciation of 
beauty? : 
7. Does one have to create beautiful things in order to gain appre- 
ciation ? 
8. What means can be employed for getting ugly school buildings 
made artistic? 
9. What is the best way to make an ugly schoolroom wall artistic? 
to, Can art appreciation be developed by an artistic environment 
alone? 
I. Its Prace in Community AND SCHOOL 
Art Appreciation the Chief Aim.—That the development 
of art appreciation is of far greater importance in general 
education than the teaching of delineation, will hardly be 
questioned by dny mature man or woman who has experi- 
enced the pleasures which art offers. To such an individual 
art in its various manifestations is recognized as one of the 
major interests of all highly civilized peoples. Indeed, it is 
very largely through their remaining examples of art that 
we have gained our knowledge of past civilizations. So, in 
302  
-P-A-G-E-359
FINE ART 303 
theory at least, nearly every educated man assigns to the 
development of power to appreciate art an important place 
in general education. 
Practice in Drawing a Means of Acquiring the Ability to 
Appreciate Art.—It is doubtless true that some have learned 
to respond keenly to the appeal of beauty of form, to the 
play of light and dark, and to subtle color relations, without 
having practised art. Nevertheless, it is obvious that art 
appreciation depends upon visual discrimination, and upon a 
realization of the principles of esthetic order which are diffi- 
cult, if not impossible, to teach without teaching the actual 
practice of drawing. It should be evident, therefore, that 
the most direct means of developing art appreciation is 
through right instruction in drawing, which necessarily in- 
cludes the constant study and emulation of fine examples of 
art. When a child attempts to represent an object, his mind 
is at once stimulated and directed to observe and to study 
successful representations of similar objects. The effort to 
arrange forms in order, which is design, arouses interest in 
looking at masterly designs, and makes it possible for the 
teacher to call attention to their excellencies with an assur- 
ance of being understood. Thus the heading of this chapter 
is significant of the fact that art appreciation and art prac- 
tice should be considered as one subject. 
Art Education a Gradual Growth and Change in Point of 
View.—The chief aim, then, in the teaching of drawing in 
the grades is the laying of a firm foundation for the apprecia- 
tion of the beauties of form and color. This appreciation is 
only possible where the eyes learn to see distinctions in line, 
degrees of dark and light, and differences in colors that are 
not seen by the untrained. Art education considered in this 
sense is not the acquisition of a definite number of facts, but 
is rather gradual growth in the power to respond to visual 
beauty, the beauty of fine relationships of form and color. 
This gradual growth will result from wisely guided practice, 
stimulated and corrected by constant study of fine examples. 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
  
304 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Study of Examples.—It may be asked whether fine ex- 
amples of art are generally available for study? Happily, 
to-day the answer can be given affirmatively. New art 
museums have sprung up, and the older ones have grown 
rapidly; so that in many cities throughout the country co- 
operation between schools and museums is becoming an im- 
portant part of the museum work. Where visits can be made 
to museums, the study of original works of art can be etfected. 
Thorough preparation for a definite piece of study well di- 
rected observation while at the museum, with sor.e required 
note-taking or sketching, will give great value to the museum 
visit, even if it occurs only at long intervals. 
In the form of photographs and the reproductions of 
photographs, we have to-day the world’s art within easy 
reach. It is true that a photograph of a work of art, whether 
architecture, sculpture, painting, or one of the minor arts, 
means much more to those who have seen the original. 
Nevertheless, the excellent and inexpensive reproductions 
now available offer a wonderful source of supply of examples 
to the art teacher, a source which a few years ago was almost 
entirely lacking. 
The best drawing-books now published offer an abun- 
dance of wonderfully good reproductions of excellent exam- 
ples of all types of art work, carefully selected with reference 
to the age and interest of the pupils of each grade. Such 
books may well serve as portfolios of reference material for 
each pupil. 
Art Education a Preparation for Good Citizenship.—The 
ultimate aim of art teaching in the grades is the education of 
’ citizens who shall grow up to demand the right kind of sur- 
roundings in the streets of the cities and towns and in the 
homes of the people, city or country. The art instruction 
which the schools have given during the past few years is 
already beginning to show results in a great popular interest 
in matters of taste, although doubtless other influences be- 
sides the school influence have helped to bring this condition

  about. Certain it is that better-designed objects for every- 
day use are more in evidence in the stores to-day than they 
were a very few years ago. Many of the popular magazines 
are constantly publishing illustrated articles on the choice 
of home furnishings, on the arrangement of the different 
rooms, and all sorts of practical hints for creating more taste- 
ful surroundings. Wide-spread interest in the beautifying of 
towns and cities has achieved much, and it cannot fail in the 
next few years to transform many places which are now un- 
sightly. 
The revival of pageantry and the great interest it is en- 
listing throughout the country is one of the most significant 
and popular expressions of the art instinct. The realization 
by the people of the traditions, history, industries, and call- 
ings of a community through artistic dramatization, and the 
idealization of the aims and aspirations of a city presented 
in symbolic form are art in the broadest and deepest sense. 
Form and color and expressively beautiful arrangements here 
may have full play. The influence of the artistry of the 
festival, whether in the great civic celebration or in a May 
Day celebration in a country village, may serve as a most 
complete opportunity for developing the art instinct. 
The Art Teaching Should Extend to the Other School 
Subjects; Influence of Surroundings.—And the school which 
is to give true art training cannot confine such to the periods 
of the drawing lesson. The lessons in art appreciation, or 
at least in good taste, should be given constantly. The school 
building and grounds, and each schoolroom with its furnish- 
ings and equipment, if well designed, will help the pupils to 
gain right standards of taste. Pictures, casts, vases of flow- 
ers, and other decorations should only after careful considera- 
tion be in the places they occupy. Schoolroom walls should 
be restful in effect. The eye should not be forced to look at 
the pictures; for these should be of such subjects, color, and 
framing that they take their places on the walls with reserve. 
But they should be worthy of most careful study. 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
306 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  Dress of Teacher.—That the teacher who dresses in good 
taste exerts a strong and constant influence no one will doubt. 
A fine sense of fitness for her work, and for the position she 
occupies, as well as for her own physical requirements and 
her financial resources will cause her to think twice before 
jauntily adopting passing fashions for schoolroom wear. That 
Fashion is one thing and Style, in the true sense of the 
word, is quite another, is too often forgotten. Appropriate- 
ness, neatness, well-combined material and color may result 
in style in its best sense. At all events, poor taste and taw- 
driness will surely be in evidence unless these fundamentals 
are well considered. 
Written Work, Festivals, Manual Arts.—Every writing 
lesson and, indeed, the written work throughout the school 
subjects, offers opportunity for the exercise of the principles 
of design. No craft is richer in examples of superb art than 
the craft of the scribe as practised before the days of print- 
ing. This craft of formal writing has recently been revived, 
and the study of writing as an art gives it a dignity and 
interest entirely lacking in the mechanical and prosaic pen- 
manship still too often held as the final ideal in school writ- 
ing. The need for invitations and programs for special 
occasions offers an ideal opportunity for design, as do also 
many other problems that naturally arise in connection with 
school festivals, such, for example, as designs for costumes, 
the making of significant decorations for the room, the paint- 
ing of simple scenery, etc.1_ The teaching of the industrial 
and household arts cannot escape the constant need of the 
exercise of esthetic judgment which is in reality the study 
of design in a most practical form. Many of these art prob- 
lems should be settled in the classes where they arise, for 
they cannot be taken over to the art class without loss of 
time and interest. 
Enough has been said to indicate that the ideal in art 
1See “Festivals and Plays,” chapters XVI-XVIII, “Art in School Fes- 
tivals.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
FINE ART 307 
instruction is to make the more formal instruction of the 
art periods serve as a means of developing an artistic con- 
sciousness which under right conditions will carry over with 
the aid of the teachers into all the school and outside activi- 
ties. A person who is artistically educated according to the 
modern ideal is one who is widely responsive and generally 
creative in matters of every-day beauty. While the study 
of pictures is one important phase of art study, we should 
do away with the outgrown idea that art deals principally 
with drawing and painting. If such were the case, it could 
not hold the important place in education that it now does. 
Drawing Regarded as a Fundamental in Education.— 
That drawing has some value as a soft-pedal disciplinary 
subject is not here questioned. Neither does it seem neces- 
sary to put in any plea for its utilitarian value. The larger 
aim of all art study which has here been set forth should 
include all other values. The ideal set is indeed high. It 
demands knowledge on the part of the teacher and feeling 
for the subject. But so does good instruction in other sub- 
jects, and fortunately good normal instruction in art and 
drawing is, possibly, as available as in the other subjects. 
In days past an excuse for poor teaching in the drawing was 
often given which was supposed to be valid. The substance 
of this excuse was that this teacher or that had no “talent” 
for drawing. This may have been perfectly true, in which 
case the drawing should have been taught by another teacher; 
but, on the other hand, teachers without talent in the vari- 
ous other subjects are not altogether unknown. Drawing and 
art are no longer regarded by educators as outside the learn- 
able and teachable branches. They are now numbered among 
the fundamentals of a liberal education. 
TI. A Survey oF THE WorRK OF THE GRADES 
Representation and Design.—The course of study may 
be considered under the two heads Representation (pictorial 
drawing) and Design. ; 
   
-P-A-G-E-366
  308 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Representation begins with the free pictorial expression 
‘suitable to the primary grades and leads gradually to the 
study of free-hand perspective, and to the reasonably correct 
delineations of the appearance of natural and artificial ob- 
jects in the grammar grades. 
Design is the study of orderly arrangement, and begins 
with the simplest decorations of the various objects made 
by the little children, leading gradually to problems involving 
more and more subtle relations of form and color. 
_ Working Drawing.—A third type of drawing is working 
“drawing, which shows facts of form by means of the various 
views, such as top, front, and side views. This is a most 
important kind of drawing, with which children should be- 
come acquainted, but it should be taught, if possible, in the 
shop in connection with objects actually made. It is there- 
fore omitted as a subject for consideration from this chapter. 
Representation in the Primary Grades.—The work in 
pictorial drawing in the first three grades of school should be 
an expression of the various childish interests, those of the 
home, of the seasons with their outdoor sports, and to some 
extent the illustration of stories from literature, history, etc. 
The free use of drawing as a language is perfectly natural 
to children up to about the fourth year of school. It is excep- 
tional for a primary child to hesitate to draw any subject 
within his range of interests. He is ready to attempt subjects 
requiring many objects and figures, and he is little troubled 
by lack of proportion and perspective effects. Work of this 
kind should be taken as seriously by the teacher as it is by 
the children. Criticism at first should be given cautiously. 
When the drawings of the class are shown such questions 
should be asked as will lead each child to explain (where it is 
necessary) just what he meant to say by his drawing. Those 
drawings that tell their stories best are to be commended, 
and kept on the bulletin-board for a few days to serve as 
a stimulus to the class. As the work goes on, simple ques- 
tions which will lead to a consideration of proportion and
-P-A-G-E-367
  FINE ART 309 
action are not out of place. But if progress is to be made,. 
some definite practice in drawing a selected object or animal 
from imagination should be given as a class exercise. With 
the teacher’s help and by the study of good but simple draw- 
ings, gradually a better type form is evolved. This form 
should be used in composing various story-telling pictures. 
A good form to begin with is something as interesting and 
simple as a rabbit, a chicken, or a duck. The side view 
should be mastered first, and this alone may be used in mak- 
ing grouped pictures. Changes in the tip of head or body 
can be made to give variety to the pictures. Probably it is 
better to teach quite a number of interesting forms in side 
view by this kind of practice before attempting to introduce 
foreshortened positions. A study of primitive art would 
seem to indicate that art developed a long way before fore- 
shortening was attempted. 
The illustrations of the children should gradually show 
better drawing, and with some definite help in simple group- 
ing given from time to time the improvement should be 
steady. But as children of primary age can gain only gen- 
eral ideas of form, very little work from the object seems 
profitable in these early years. Simple large flowers, as, for 
example, the tulip and fleur-de-lis, can be drawn from nature 
in color with childish success, if the teacher leads the class 
to try only for the larger characteristics of form and color 
and for general lines of movement. Thus the pictorial draw- 
ing in the primary grades should advance gradually. 
Design in the Primary Grades.—As with primitive peo- 
ples, it is an instinct with children to decorate the things 
that they make. In school these generally include Christ- 
mas candy-boxes, book-covers, valentines, Easter cards, etc. 
With proper guidance the beginnings of the principles of 
design can be taught in borders and surfaces, made in time 
with counting or music. These designs may be done with 
crayon or brush or printed with sticks. The making of rug 
designs, when little rugs are woven, offers an excellent begin- 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
310 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  ning in the study of the effect of variety in the widths of the 
stripes. 
Beginning of Color Study.—The use of color in design is 
most educational where the children are given an opportunity 
to make a choice within safe limits. For example, in the case 
of the rug, the materials may be presented in several good 
colors, such as a grayish blue, a rich red, a golden yellow, be- 
sides white and black. The children may then be left to 
choose one color with black and white for the rug design. 
The results will be various, and yet no bad combination of 
color can occur. In studying historic design, we find that 
the color combinations were usually, at least in part, the 
result of the limitations in natural material at hand or in 
available pigments. One explanation of the many inhar- 
monious combinations of color seen to-day lies in the fact 
that people now are not limited in their choice. Hence, to 
lay foundations for good taste in color, it seems reasonable 
to acquaint the children with some typical combinations that 
are good. Later on principles can be taught which will ex- 
plain how and why certain colors are harmonious. 
Representation in the Grammar Grades.—The instruc- 
tion in representation from the object should become of a 
very definite character from the fourth grade up. In the . 
upper grades pupils have become mature enough to take some 
interest in learning to draw correctly and to use materials 
in a more workmanlike manner than was possible in their 
primary years. Representation should include the drawing 
of well-shaped dish and pottery forms, great attention being 
given to the study of proportion and the character of the 
curvature. The pupils should learn to represent solidity by 
means of the correct drawing of the ellipses which show the 
appearance of the horizontal circles at different levels. They 
should learn also to show the effect of objects placed at dif- 
ferent distances from the eye, as in the case of a group of 
pottery forms. Study is here recommended of such fine ex- 
amples of simple object-drawing as are offered by the Japanese

brush drawings. This study may be carried on by means 
of free copying, by drawing from memory, or by tracing the 
prints. Any really excellent drawings studied in any one of 
these ways serves to implant ideals of good workmanship. 
The work from the object should teach pupils to see appear- 
ances and to record them truthfully. 
The study of rectilinear forms is best taken up in the 
seventh and eighth grades, and can be carried as far as the 
representation of buildings and furniture in pictorial compo- 
sitions. Throughout the work in object-drawing various tests 
may be occasionally used, but the best tests are only good in 
so far as they help the pupils to learn to see and to check up 
their progress. 
Flower-Drawing in Grammar Grades.—The drawing of 
natural forms, such as flowers and sprays, should progress 
definitely. The appearance of foreshortened leaves and of 
turned petals, as well as the representation of the third dimen- 
sion in flowers, stems, and joints, should appear in the work of 
the upper grades. The roughly generalized flower-drawing of 
the primary grades should give place to the more truthful 
representation of some of the beauty and grace of. plant 
growth. 
Tree-Drawing.—Tree-drawing is valuable when it is 
rightly presented to the lower grammar grades. The typical 
shapes of the common trees—apple, pine, elm, oak, maple, 
poplar, etc.—should become familiar to the pupils through 
efforts at representing them in mass. These tree forms may 
be used in making landscape compositions involving perspec- 
tive principles. 
The Place of Figure-Drawing.—It is an open question as 
to how far figure-drawing is generally a profitable study in 
the grammar grades. Under some conditions it has been 
proved well worth while. For example, it has sometimes 
been taught in connection with dress-designing in the eighth 
grade. If a study of simple costume design is possible in 
connection with the work in domestic art, the work in repre-  
-P-A-G-E-372
  312 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
sentation of the eighth grade in a class of girls might well 
centre around the study of the figure and its draping. Here 
is offered a rich opportunity for the study of Greek casts in 
connection with a live interest. The principles of Greek 
costuming can then be compared with a period radically dif- 
ferent; for example, that of Charles the First of England, as 
pictured by Van Dyck. 
Design in the Grammar Grades.—The study of design in 
the grammar grades should generally be in the form of some 
concrete problem. Such problems are perhaps oftenest pre- 
sented in school in the demand for a book-cover or portfolio 
design. This indicates the need that constantly arises for 
lettering as a part of design. Practice in lettering should be 
given throughout the grades until considerable skill is gained 
in making free-hand letters which are essentially classic in 
character. 
Booklets made in connection with some special topic in 
literature, history, or geography have fully proved their edu- 
cational value, and they are sure to enlist the interest of the 
pupils. The making of a manuscript book may quite prop- 
erly be taken as a problem of the art period in the seventh 
and eighth grades. No better problem of applied design can 
be found for the work of several weeks—if each step is taken 
up with full appreciation of the opportunity it offers. An 
appreciative study of typical work of the medieval scribes 
should precede practice in a modernized formal letter suitable 
for pencil or ordinary pen work. Questions of margins; the 
importance in the page effect of right spacing of letters and 
lines; the various good forms of simple initials and versals in 
color; the illustration of the booklet by drawings or by 
mounted pictures; the choice of cover paper, and a workman- 
like sewing together of the cover and pages; and, finally, the 
designing of the cover in dignified, built-up letters; all con- 
tribute the finest possible training in esthetic judgment. 
Other problems in design may be planned to contribute 
directly to the study of home-furnishing. Border and sur-
-P-A-G-E-373
  FINE ART 313 
face patterns may be designed, cut from the wood block, and 
printed for curtains, etc. The consideration of the choice of 
furnishings and the arrangement of a room is a problem that 
has been successfully taken up in upper grammar grades. 
In some cases the actual rooms have been furnished in the 
school-building or elsewhere. Some of the articles in such 
cases were selected by the pupils from the store, while others 
were made by the pupils in school. Where such a scheme is 
impracticable a valuable study in home-furnishing can be 
made from carefully collected pictures of interiors good and 
bad, the pupils finally deciding upon good arrangements and 
color schemes and working them out in pencil and water-color. 
Color in the Grammar Grades.—The use of color through- 
out the grades should occur wherever a problem in design 
demands it. Enough formal training should be given so that 
pupils can think of color clearly in its three qualities, hue, 
value, and intensity. Examples of fine harmonies of color 
in the art-museum collections of textiles, pottery, and paint- 
ing should be shown the pupils where opportunity allows. 
Any intelligent teacher can collect from the best magazines 
pictures in color which illustrate fine harmonies and also 
natural examples of beautiful color combinations, leaves, 
shells, feathers, etc., not to mention other sources of good 
examples for the school collection. 
Picture Study.—From what has already been said, it will 
be inferred that any course in picture study which would 
require study of the work of a given number of artists or pic- 
tures is too formal. It is doubtless a desirable thing for all 
children to become familiar with as many of the master works 
within their range of interests as is possible, but true art ap- 
preciation does not grow because of the number of things 
seen, nor as a result of knowing the facts of many artists’ 
lives. It seems to us that all little children should know the 
animal pictures of Rosa Bonheur and of Sir Edwin Landseer, 
and that Corot’s landscapes and Millet’s people of the fields 
should be familiar to the older ones. The stories of the lives  
-P-A-G-E-374
314 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of these artists are helpful in giving a key to the aims which 
they kept before them in their work. The work of some of 
our best American painters ought to become of living interest 
to the older pupils, and, if possible, they should be given 
opportunity to see examples from time to time in the many 
exhibitions of contemporary painting which occur throughout 
the country. The purely artistic study of pictures and other 
works of art has already been referred to as something that 
should take place in connection with the various art lessons. 
Exercises in copying may be given, and in making notes 
in the study of line, “spotting,” color, and other qualities. 
Thus principles may be illustrated and a genuine study made 
of the structure of pictures. 
Developing an Interest in Architecture—A beginning of 
an interest in architecture may be made by leading the chil- 
dren to observe the best buildings in their own cities or towns, 
and to see as far as possible wherein their beauty lies. 
III. Hanpiinc THE CLAss 
  Size of Classes.—The size of classes for drawing should, 
if possible, be small. Over thirty-five is a number too great 
for effective individual criticism. As small a number as 
twenty is much better to deal with. Many teachers must 
teach classes of forty and more. Many do even this feat 
exceptionally well. 
Materials.—The materials best suited to primary grades, 
besides paper, are colored crayon, scissors for cutting silhou- 
ettes, brush “and water-colors, and clay. If resources are 
limited the colored crayons “may be used for most of the 
work recommended. Pencils are needed occasionally, but 
for primary illustrative work and design color is desirable. 
In the grammar grades, brush and water-colors serve bet- 
ter than crayons for many types of work. The lead-pencil 
becomes more and more the important medium as the work 
advances.
-P-A-G-E-375
  FINE ART 315 
Care of Materials.—So far as possible each pupil should 
keep and care for his own materials. This, however, is an 
ideal which it is impossible always to follow. Water-cups, 
for example, had best be distributed with the water in them 
for the lesson, and collected after the lesson, to be emptied, 
rinsed, and dried. 
As pencils should be kept in perfect order, it is wise to 
collect these after use, and have them looked over and re- 
paired ready for the next lesson. Each pupil, however, 
should have his own pencil. The best way of distributing 
materials is through the help of a selected pupil for each 
row. 
Presentation of a Drawing Lesson.—In presenting a les- 
son in drawing it is important to remember that it is a com- 
mon error for the teacher to talk too much, and to ask too many 
questions requiring verbal answers from the class. At the 
beginning of a drawing lesson the problem should be pre- 
sented clearly and briefly. Generally examples of the type 
of work to be aimed for should be shown. Then with little 
delay the children should be set to work. They are to ex- 
press their ideas in graphic form and naturally they are 
impatient to begin. 
Individual Criticism.—Individual criticism may begin as 
soon as it is needed, the teacher passing quickly around the 
class first. to see that all are working in the right way. With 
the younger children the suggestions should be very simple 
and deal with but one thing at a time. In the case of the 
older children the criticisms should be more detailed, and 
given, where possible, in the form of questions such as, “Is 
your vase too high or too broad?” The pupil may thus be 
led to see his mistake at once. Where a lesson in design is 
being conducted and the class is busy at work experimenting, 
the best plan for the teacher is to remain at her desk and 
ask each pupil to come to her with his design. 
Class Criticism.—Class criticisms are most valuable and 
should occur often, at least after each problem has been
-P-A-G-E-376
316 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  worked out. The drawings of the class should be put up 
where all can see them. If necessary, the pupils leave their 
places and go up close enough to look at each drawing care- 
fully. The best, second best, etc., are then chosen by vote of 
the class, the teacher putting down the number of votes cast 
for each drawing. Sometimes it is best to consider only cer- 
tain qualities (as drawing, color, or composition) in calling for 
a vote. The teacher in any case guides the pupils’ observa- 
tion by a few clear questions before they choose. After the 
class has made its choice, the teacher gives her decision and 
states her reasons for the choice she has made. Continued 
practice by a class in judging its own drawings is a most 
valuable means of developing right standards. 
Motives in Lower and in Higher Grades.—In the primary 
grades the immediate interest in the subjects of representa- 
tion is quite sufficient as a motive. In the design, the de- 
sire to beautify the objects to be made is strong enough to 
hold the attention. Throughout the grades it is well to keep 
the art work in touch with vital school interests. This is not 
difficult in the subject of design, but is not always possible 
in the study of representation. More and more as the work 
advances, the doing of the problem in hand as well as possible 
will become a sufficient motive where the true art spirit has 
been developed. This can be said without danger of being 
misunderstood by those who have read the chapter with care. 
For throughout the thought has been reiterated that rightly 
conceived art study connects with the school work on all 
sides. To deny, however, that it has its own special values 
and power of appeal to the pupils would be to give it an 
inferior place in the curriculum, a place it cannot take. 
SUMMARY

tional efficiency through esthetic appreciation. 
2. Participation in the creation of art products of some kind is neces- 
sary to develop appreciation.

. We are interested to-day in making the entire environment a place 
of beauty and a joy forever; indeed, we strive to make of living 
itself a fine art. 
. A very wide range of activities and subject matter in the form and 
color arts is thus available for instruction purposes. 
. A survey of the work throughout the grades shows that representa- 
tion (pictorial drawing) and design are the two chief types of 
subject-matter. 
. Both representation and design should be carried through the 
grades as suggested. Creative, or story-telling drawing should 
be given its proper place. 
. The suggestions offered for handling classes relate to careful plan- 
ning and routine execution with reference to selecting and get- 
ting ready materials, avoiding too much talking, and encouraging 
individual and class criticisms. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
. What do supervisors of drawing: and design find as the chief 
weaknesses of new teachers? Of experienced teachers? 
Classify the ones you discover.

through drawing or other means? 
Read Sargent’s ‘‘How Children Learn to Draw.” 
Visit the homes of your pupils and quietly observe what could be 
done with little cost to bring more beauty into their homes 
if they and their parents only had the knowledge and cultivated 
taste. 
. What are the best pictures for the various grades to be hung on 
the wall? How can you learn that they best suit the children? 
. Learn what Thorndike and others have done to measure esthetic 
appreciation. (Journal of Educational Psychology, November, 
1916.) 
Get the latest drawing scale by Thorndike (Teachers College, 
New York) or others, and try to measure pupils’ art work. 
How are we going to tell what types of art work are of most worth 
educationally ?

CHAPTER XIV 
MUSIC 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
  1. If we train for knowledge and skill, does it necessarily follow that 
taste for music will result. without further thought, or must 
the pupil’s capacity for enjoyment, and, consequently, his taste, 
be a specific aim in music teaching? 
2. Formulate an aim for teaching music that will be a guide for a 
teacher, showing that you have considered the problem in 
question one. 
3. Give reasons based on the nature of music, and taking into con- 
sideration the nature of the child, why the rote song should be 
made the foundation of school music. 
4. Can you think of reasons why different sides of the pupil’s nature 
should be appealed to at different ages? How would such 
changes in age be likely to affect the subject matter? 
5. Can it be sound, educationally, to have the pupils memorize songs, 
the meaning of which they do not fully grasp? 
6. Which one of the five great aims of education given in Chapter I 
may music teaching especially promote? 
7. In what ways do people in your community satisfy their love of 
music? 
The Problem.—It is said that one of the questions that 
schoolmen of the Middle Ages loved to discuss was: “How 
many angels can dance on the point of a needle?”” No doubt 
it took great learning and logic to carry on such a discussion, 
but it fails to interest us, not because we do not care for the 
learning and skill exhibited, but because the number of 
angels who could dance on the end of a needle has no value 
for us. 
There is a sharp distinction between interest in a subject 
such as the schoolmen had and interest in a subject because 
of its practical worth. It is this worth of the subject that is 
320 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
MUSIC 3a 
emphasized by the modern school critic who says: ‘Granted 
your Latin, arithmetic, and language are well taught, what 
is their value after the pupil leaves school?” A new and 
exacting standard is being set up demanding that all school 
studies shall prove their worth, whether for the work or the 
enjoyment of life. 
There is no doubt but that music is for life’s enjoyment, 
and, therefore, this end should be the aim of school music. 
If we ask a mother, “What do you want your child to receive 
from his school music?” she may answer, “The ability to 
read music,” or ‘The ability to sing better,” but these are 
only means in her mind for accomplishing what is her real 
desire, namely, that her child shall enjoy music more; and, 
secondly, that the enjoyment should be of the best music. 
That is, she would require improvement in taste and judg- 
ment as well. She desires her child to have a fine type of 
wholesome enjoyment and an educative use of his leisure. 
In short, parents of school children, if they could state in 
abstract terms what they desired most as the result of the 
music teaching of the schools, would say: ‘‘We wish our 
children to increase the quantity and improve the quality of 
their musical enjoyment.” 
All teachers agree with these ultimate aims, but they 
disagree as to the means and methods to be employed to 
reach such results. What intensifies the disagreement is the 
little time allowed to music in the school program, limiting 
the choice of what shall be taught to the most important 
‘thing for accomplishing the aim. One says, “The singing of 
songs is to be desired, but the essential thing is sight-read- 
ing”; another says: “The knowledge of notation is valuable, 
but good voice production and expression is fundamental.” 
Having settled in their minds the methods to be used, they 
become so engrossed in accomplishing these technical ends 
that they forget the purpose for which they are done. The 
result is that the child who is studying music is apt to feel as 
little connection between his do, re, mi’s, or vocalization,
-P-A-G-E-382
    322 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
and irene pleasure in music, as we feel between the 
dialectical skill in the discussion of the dancing angels and 
every-day living. 
Arithmetic, geography, and language are for practical 
uses, but music has no such value, its enjoyment being the 
reason for its existence. Wholesome enjoyment, or avoca- 
tional efficiency, has been given by the editor in the first 
chapter as one of the five factors of social efficiency, the aim 
of education. Thus the cultivation of pleasure in music is 
not only vital to the subject but peculiar to this subject 
alone. A reason can always be given for demanding atten- 
tion to other studies. However little a child may feel the 
need of such subjects, he will accept the statement that they 
will be useful in after-life. No such motive can be given in 
music, except as we show that harmless recreation and right 
uses of leisure are important aims of life. If the child does 
not feel the satisfaction at the time, the subject is practically 
worthless to him. 
This brings us to the fundamental problem in teaching 
music: how to cultivate an affection for the subject, and at 
the same time accomplish the drill necessary for skill. Two 
main lines of procedure are recommended: First, singing tend- 
ing toward knowledge and skill; and, second, listening tend- 
ing toward taste and judgment. 
I. Srncmsc TENDING TowarD KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL 
A. From Song to Notation.—In order to gain sufficient 
elasticity for classification, it will be well to treat the first 
three grades as a unit and to consider them in seven steps. 
1. Selection of Songs——The first step that we shall con- 
sider deals with the selection of songs. The child’s remark- 
_ able power to sing by imitation, or by rote, makes it possible 
to introduce him to the most beautiful melodies of the art, 
without requiring any technical mastery. This makes the 
period extremely valuable for storing the pupil’s mind with
-P-A-G-E-383
  MUSIC 323 
those songs the singing of which will be a pleasure all his life. 
This thought should govern the selection of songs, not limit- 
ing them to childish ditties that he would be ashamed to 
sing in the upper grades, but including classic gems of 
the art, the acquaintance with which will form the basis of 
his musical taste and appreciation. 
The argument that the child does not understand what he 
sings about, or that the love and jollity in some songs are 
not appropriate, has little meaning if the songs are such as 
live from generation to generation. They must have a value 
that has preserved them, that will far outweigh any incidents 
in their expression that might be beyond, or unsuitable for 
the child. This is not asking any more from the child, nor 
nearly as much as we do when we read the Bible to him. 
Storing his mind with the literature of fine music is quite as 
important in satisfying his esthetic needs as filling his mind 
with Bible stories his religious needs. 
2. Awakening Musical Interest.—The second step deals 
with the value of the rote song as a means for awakening the 
pupil’s interest in music. He learns to sing and enjoy music 
before any technical problem is presented to him. We have 
seen in our introduction how important this awakening of 
interest is for a successful carrying on of this study. If the 
rote-song work has been rightly done, the technical work will 
be greeted with pleasure as a means for still further satisfying 
the interest awakened. 
3. Thoroughly Memorizing Desirable Songs.—The third 
important step in this early song work is the memorizing of 
songs worth while. Music, unlike all the other arts, except 
poetry, depends on the memory for its coherence. A beau- 
tiful melody means nothing, moreover, if at its close we have 
forgotten the impression of its beginning. Such memory 
work must be systematically done, and the songs that are to 
last through life must not only be repeated, year after year, 
but sung individually. The laws of habit here are the same 
as in other subjects mentioned in former chapters. This drill
-P-A-G-E-384
324 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
is of the utmost importance, for the value of these songs is 
to be measured in after-life. It is as an individual that each 
will have to remember them, and only as individually re- 
membered will there be any valuable deposit of usable songs. 
There is nothing more absurd in our educational system 
than limiting work in music, as is almost always done, to 
concerted singing. No other subject would be remembered 
if recitations were made in concert by the class. If the child 
did nothing more than learn twenty first-class songs, so that 
he had them as his own equipment, proved by the ability 
to sing all the stanzas through by himself, the work in music 
would be justified and a basis laid for further musical devel- 
opment. 
4. Learning to Use the Voice Expressively Through Song.— 
The fourth step in relation to the rote song is the opportunity 
it gives to use the voice expressively. No art is produced as 
correctly with so little conscious technical training. A musi- 
cal child of three can sing a song perfectly. Music is pre- 
eminently an art of the public schools, for it gives a maximum 
of opportunity for expression, with a minimum of technical 
skill, because proper tone and phrasing are acquired at this 
early age as a reflex to a desire to express the thought of the 
song. The pupil is not conscious of how he does it, for his 
mind is entirely centered on the effect to be produced. 
5. Developing Musical Discrimination —The fifth point is 
the development of musical discrimination. The first four 
steps described above would be sufficient if music had made no 
further progress than that represented by the folk-song, and 
for the majority of the population this would be enough, but 
music has developed very rapidly. It has added, we might 
say, another story to its tonal structure, for the comprehen- 
sion of which a keener discrimination is necessary than was 
sufficient for “the people’s art.” This discrimination is most 
effectively acquired in the practice necessary for singing from 
notes. At the same time the skill gained is of great practical 
value in extending our power of musical enjoyment. Read-
-P-A-G-E-385
  MUSIC 325 
ing music, however, is so little used by the general public 
that the only justification of the severe training it requires is 
the increase of our power of musical enjoyment due to the 
discrimination developed. 
This change of aim alters radically the character of the 
work and the method pursued. Instead of emphasizing sight- 
singing at first, attention is drawn to the structure of the music, 
and the pupil’s mind is stimulated to observe more keenly. 
For instance, commencing with the first song learned, the 
pupil is led to observe the characteristics of its movement. 
The most natural way for the child to define this movement 
is in some form of physical motion; it may resemble more 
nearly primitive dancing, where gesture and pantomime, as 
well as movement of the feet, are utilized to express an idea. 
Physical movement is the most natural ally of music and 
expresses its ideal motion better than any other means. 
Movement being in both space and time, is much more easily 
observed and analyzed, hence is a natural medium for pass- 
ing from a purely ideal expression of motion, such as music 
limited to time, to its representation in notation—an expres- 
sion limited to space. 
6. Learning Notation—This leads eventually into the 
sixth step, the learning of the notation that indicates the 
observations made in the previous step. This notation work 
is more for connecting the sign with the tone and not a drill 
for giving skill in reading at sight. After a child is able to 
show the direction of a melody by movements of his hand, 
he is quite able to picture this movement by long and short 
dashes and up and down positions, showing his observation 
of relative differences of duration and pitch. Notation can 
easily be introduced in such a manner that it will carry the 
intelligence of even the most unmusical pupil of the class. 
Thus not only is the significance of notation better learned, 
but habits of observation of musical motion are developed 
that will be of the greatest value in listening to the complex 
movements that are combined in modern music.
-P-A-G-E-386
326 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
  7. Song-Making—The seventh and last step of this 
period is song-making, and consists in putting to practical 
use the knowledge gained in song-singing and notation, thus 
utilizing both branches of the technical work that have been 
developed from the rote song. Little children enjoy making 
up short songs. Such work utilizes all the child’s musical ex- 
perience, and also appeals to his constructive imagination. 
There can be hardly any activity in this study that will be 
more productive of truly musical results than his attempt 
at first expressing in tone a suitable melody for a given stanza 
of words and then defining its general melodic outline, such 
as the metre, duration, and pitch. He may do this by act- 
ing and using the blackboard in the earlier stages, and later 
by giving much of the notation. 
Such work needs skill and preparation on the part of the 
teacher. It should not be thought because of the emphasis 
on singing by imitation and the very elementary technical 
work required, that the teacher needs but little equipment 
for this portion of music teaching. The fact that so much 
of the work must be done as a reflex to a right stimulation of 
the child’s mind requires the subtlest form of the teaching 
art, as well as a thorough study of the material and its appli- 
cation. Unfortunately, ordinary sight-singing can be done 
so mechanically that there is a low ideal as to the grade 
teacher’s responsibility and preparation for music teaching. 
An intelligent teacher can easily grasp the routine of sight- 
singing, but it takes artistic perception and considerable 
vocal drill to do adequately the song and creative work. 
The importance of this equipment is recognized on the 
continent and in England by paying a higher salary to teach- 
ers who add this equipment to their other training. Such 
teachers assist those less prepared, by teaching the music in 
their grades. 
To sum up the work of this period: If we glance over 
the seven steps we shall see that by focussing the work on 
actual song-singing we accomplish two important ends with 
reference to increasing the quantity and quality of our musi-
-P-A-G-E-387
  MUSIC 327 
cal enjoyment. First, we supply the child with a musical 
experience and a repertoire of song that will be a joy to him 
all his life; second, from these songs we develop the neces- 
sary technical training along two distinct lines: that of song- 
singing, developing all the arts of expression, and that of 
notation, developing musical discrimination and leading to 
the ability to read music. 
Following are the seven points: 
Selecting songs. 
. Awakening musical interest through song. 
. Memorizing desirable songs. 
. Learning to use the voice expressively through song. 
. Developing musical discrimination. 
. Learning notation. 
. Song-making. TAN RwWN H 
B. From Notation to Song.—In this period, including the 
fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, the approach to notation is 
the reverse of the earlier. In that we went from song to 
notation; in this the process is from notation to song. This 
is approximately the age in which drill work in other subjects 
is most effectively accomplished, and it is pre-eminently the 
time when the necessary speed work and concentration for 
successful note-reading should be done. Competitive skill 
appeals most strongly to the pupil when his budding self- 
consciousness will not allow him to take those frank, poetic 
aspects toward interpretation in song-singing and creative 
work that the earlier period made possible. It precedes the 
adolescent period and is a much more favorable time for de- 
veloping a technic which we wish to make automatic than 
is the later period, when the intellectual and emotional na- 
ture demands a more mature treatment. In the earlier period 
the musical thought came from imitation, and its relation to 
the notation was evolved only gradually. In this period 
musical thought is formed directly from the notation by the 
pupil himself, its accuracy being tested by the music pro- 
duced. In the first period ideas represented by the notation
-P-A-G-E-388
  328 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
were gradually formed; in this period a technic is developed 
that shall apply these ideas by means of the notation, to 
problems of note-reading. 
These problems present two aspects: First, the necessity 
for speed in recognizing what the notation calls for; and, 
secondly, the ability to produce at once what is recognized. 
1. Speed in Notation Work.—The notation aspect is often 
confused through comparison with language, the notes of the 
staff being thought of as letters, and their combination as 
syllables and words. A better comparison of the seven tones 
of the scale is with the nine digits in arithmetic. The func- 
tion of both notes and digits is to express relationships. As 
we have to be familiar with the multiplication table in order 
to be able to apply it to actual problems, so we have to be 
familiar with the important relationships that the notes pre- 
sent before we can interpret them with sufficient rapidity to be 
able to conceive and sing what they call for without inter- 
fering with the movement of the music. This problem is 
made difficult by our notation, which presents to the eye 
the same tonal relationship differently in every key, thus 
necessitating an eye-training. This is as mechanical a prob- 
lem as the multiplication table, but with this peculiar differ- 
ence, that it demands speed for successful use. To know 
that the third line of the G clef represents the second tone 
in the key of A is of no value if we have to take an instant 
of time for determining it. It must be recognized at once 
and related’ to what precedes and follows. Hence, speed in 
the recognition of intervals is a distinct technic that must 
be developed. It is wise to follow the example of arithmetic 
and teach the representation of intervals in keys by notation, 
independently of their tonal significance, as we do the mul- 
tiplication table, independently of its practical application in 
examples. 
2. Music-Reading by Phrases——The music-reader must 
know how the music goes before he can sing it musically. It 
is obvious that the reading of single notes, one after the
-P-A-G-E-389
  MUSIC 320 
other, would no more make possible fluent reading of music 
than the reading of single letters in a word would make 
smooth reading of language. This ability is even more neces- 
sary in music where the grasping of the movement of a phrase 
helps us quite as much in singing the intervals as the grasp- 
ing of the intervals helps to form the phrase. Therefore, 
with the development of speed in interpreting the signs of 
notation there must be developed the parallel technic of 
thinking music musically, that is, by the nature of its move- 
ment, the motives and phrases that make up its periods. 
3. Key Groups; Minor Mode; Cadence Chords.—Besides 
these two fundamental lines of work that will be prominent 
in this period, there are certain facts of the musical art that 
will grow out of the song material used. The pupils will dis- 
cover that with their growing skill in reading, the music has 
grown more difficult. The songs, instead of remaining in 
one key, modulate to related keys and back again. Such 
changes are so systematic that it is of great value in reading 
to have the ordinary relationship of keys, such as those of 
the tonic, dominant, subdominant, and their relative minors 
explained to the pupils by means of the characteristic tone 
that introduces each key. For instance, in the change to the 
dominant, the fourth of the old key becomes the seventh of 
the new. 
The second important fact grows out of the use, of minor 
songs. After considerable practice, especially of minor folk- 
songs, it is well to construct the scales and study the minor 
mode. . ; 
Pupils in this period will be singing many two and three 
part songs. To study the cadence effect of the tonic, domi- 
nant, and subdominant chords as they occur in three-part 
singing will help develop a musical ear. Such practice is 
given by separating the room into three choirs, each choir 
singing each of the tones of the triad, thus having an oppor- 
tunity to become familiar with the voice leading of these 
chords in cadence form.  
-P-A-G-E-390
  330 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
4. Memory Songs.—All of the preceding technical aspects 
of music grow out of the songs, so that the main work of this 
period, as of the first, is song-singing, but with this difference 
that, while the songs of the first period were largely learned 
by imitation, those of this period are learned by means of 
the notation. 
This is not done in a slavish way, merely to read, but the 
technic demanded by reading is used for quickening musical 
perception. Thus the fundamental aim of the work is kept 
in view. With this the pupil’s repertoire is increased by eight 
to ten more songs, so thoroughly learned and of such fine 
quality that they will be a joy to recollect and sing long after 
school-days are past. 
To sum up what we have attained in this period: 
1. Speed in notation work. 
2. Music-reading by phrases. 
3. A knowledge of key groups, minor modes, and cadence 
chords. 
4. The memorizing of songs. 
C. Broadening Musical Experience.—The third unit, 
covering the work of the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, 
which are often now classified as the junior high school, is a 
continuation of the first line of procedure, which starts with 
song-singing, and leads into technical voice production and 
note-reading. There is, however, a change in the subject 
of study as well as in the method pursued, due to the chang- 
ing nature of the pupil, who is now passing into the adolescent 
stage and requires a broader appeal to maturer sympathies 
and interests. The competitive work with technical drill of 
the previous period grows irksome as he reaches this age. 
His emotional nature, sensitive to the regard of others, makes 
him unwilling to do anything that is not significant. He 
demands at this age an emotional content in his musical 
activity more nearly corresponding to the demand of a ma- 
ture person.
-P-A-G-E-391
MUSIC 331 
A second reason for changing the character and method 
of the work grows out of the conditions of school life. A 
large proportion of the pupils leave school at the end of the 
sixth grade. Those who continue include the group that 
goes on to high school and college. The leaders come from 
this group, and they should be given a wider musical train- 
ing. The work so far has been in singing, with the technical 
aspects of voice and reading that grow out of singing. But 
the experience of the future citizen will be more largely 
with the instrumental rather than the vocal side of music, 
since instrumental works predominate over vocal, in number 
and in artistic worth. It is eminently fitting that the school 
should prepare the pupil for this musical heritage; hence, the 
characteristic work of this period will be devoted to the in- 
strumental aspects of the art. It will be presented in five 
steps. 
1. Review of Previous Knowledge——tThe first step will be 
to review the knowledge gained in the previous periods, so 
concisely that it will stay with the pupils the rest of their 
lives. This review is essential not only for those who have 
done the work, but for those who enter the upper grades, 
coming from places where no music has been taught. Such 
a rapid survey puts them in touch sufficiently with the pre- 
vious work to enable them to join in the choral work of the 
upper grades. 
2. Chorus-Singing.—The second step is a systematic de- 
velopment of part-singing as well as unison and solo work, 
taking up the larger songs, cantatas, and suitable choruses 
from classic works. The aim is primarily to introduce the 
pupil to the best vocal literature and at the same time develop 
ideals of production by working some of these up for school 
functions, such as graduation exercises. Chorus work should 
not be limited to perfecting every piece practised, so that it 
can be performed publicly. The student should be given 
the opportunity to become acquainted with many gems, while 
increasing his reading ability. 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
  332 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
3. Musical Instruments.—The third step prepares for in- 
strumental music by drawing attention to the instruments 
themselves, considered in the three great groups of wind, string, 
and percussion. Such work correlates well with the manual 
training and art work of this period. This broadening of the 
subject to include a study of instruments, covering the field 
from the primitive willow whistle to the elegant harp, makes 
a fascinating appeal, entirely different from the vocal, and 
frequently interests pupils in the art, especially boys, at this 
age of vocal difficulties. 
This interest may be developed along two important lines: 
that of playing orchestral instruments, and the study of in- 
strumental forms. Studying about instruments and seeing 
them often awakens a desire to play them. This is the time 
to encourage the formation of school bands and orchestras. 
Many pupils that are vainly attempting to play the piano 
would get more pleasure from their music if, instead of prac- 
tising such a difficult solo instrument they would take up 
one of the orchestral instruments, such as a flute, violin, or 
clarinet. A group of ten or fifteen players, united, will pro- 
duce music well worth hearing, much as a chorus is inter- 
esting, when the solo work of an individual in either group 
would not be worth listening to. To encourage the playing 
of such instruments may not only give a boy or girl a delight- 
ful life hobby, but will make him a valuable asset to the 
social life of the community. 
To do effective work in high-school orchestras, a boy 
should commence his instrument at least in the seventh grade. 
There is, however, this essential: many of the instruments 
necessary for an organization, such as the double bass, drums, 
and some of the horns are not such that a parent would be 
willing to spend money to buy them. The custom is becom- 
ing common for schools to own these instruments and lend 
them to students showing talent. This proves an encourag- 
ing factor and often insures a good school orchestra in a town 
where otherwise none would be possible. Such work inter-

  Music 333. 
ests instrument players of the community in the school and 
enlarges the appeal made by school music to the general pub- 
lic. It often helps a pupil to discover a talent that may lead 
to professional work. 
4. Instrumental Forms.—The fourth step is the study of 
instrumental forms. The interest awakened in instruments 
and their playing naturally leads on to interest in the music 
produced. To start with, this may be no more profound in 
style than dance-music. If, however, it is good of its kind, it 
makes a valuable introduction to the simpler musical forms. 
The pupil has an opportunity to study the effectiveness and 
essential need of repetition in music, and begins to realize 
the significance of a theme or motive as a text of the compo- 
sition. As the more classical types of music are taken up, 
whether by actually playing them or by hearing them on 
disks or rolls, it is possible to increase the interest to include 
studies of the sonata and fugue forms. By such study plea- 
sure in listening to them will be greatly enhanced. This 
study of design in music correlates effectively with design in 
the other arts and proves of invaluable worth in awakening 
interest in beauty of symmetry and design in general. 
5. Instrumental Work Outside of School.—The fifth step 
considers the value of instrumental work done outside of 
school. There is a tendency in leading schools to give credit 
to well-authenticated instrumental work done with private 
teachers. This makes it possible for many a talented girl 
who has worked up a technic on the piano to a point where 
it would bear fruit, to continue it and still not be overworked 
by her school studies. The granting of such credit by the 
school means considerable attention to records and examina- 
tions. It is worth while, not only in justice to the pupil, but 
also for what the pupil can contribute to the social life of the 
school through her art. It has value for the private teacher 
whose work thus tends to become standardized.
-P-A-G-E-396
  334 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
II. Listentnc; TENDING TowArD TaSTE AND JUDGMENT 
We have so far considered the work of the nine grades in 
groups of three periods. Starting with song-singing, the work 
has led to knowledge and skill, and has added to vocal work 
in the last three years a study of instruments and instrumen- 
tal music. 
The New Opportunity Afforded by Disks and Rolls.— 
This would be all that could be attempted under school con- 
ditions were it not for the invention of player-pianos and talk- 
ing-machines which have made it possible, through rolls and 
disks, to hear instrumental compositions and songs that were 
beyond common reach a few years ago. It would seem al- 
most criminal, therefore, not to use these aids for widening 
musical experience. In fact, progressive schools all over the 
country are doing so. 
A. Selection of Music.—The use of such devices for hear- 
ing music, selected so as to develop good taste and judgment, 
is an obligation as important for the school as the forming of 
taste for good literature. In fact, the attractive nature of 
music makes the growth of a low and coarse taste easier than 
in the case of literature, so that there is greater need for 
counteracting such an influence, not to speak of the value in 
the enjoyment of music that would come from a cultivated 
taste. 
The effectiveness of such music teaching through hear- 
ing depends on the success with which the teacher can get 
the pupils to listen attentively. We must have some way 
of focussing attention—in other words, give the pupil some- 
thing to explain which will show the way he is listening. For 
this purpose the first essential is that the music selected be 
of a nature that lends itself to fairly broad and definite inter- 
pretation. 
B. Facts Concerning Whai Is Heard.—Second, the teacher 
should relate such facts concerning the setting of the music 
as will tend to awaken interest in it in the mind of the pupil.
-P-A-G-E-397
  MUSIC 335 
C. Problem to Be Solved by Listening —Third, and most 
important of all, the teacher must present a problem to the 
pupil to solve, at the same time not limiting the pupil’s own 
imagination or forcing him to see things in the music he 
hears that may not be true to his experience. For instance, 
with younger children of this period, the request to have 
them, as fast as they imagine what the music says, skip for- 
ward and dance it in the open space before the desk, imme- 
diately makes them listen to the music with an intensity that 
they otherwise would not have. At the same time the atten- 
tion is not fixed on technical matters of form, but on what is 
suggested through the imagination. Thus the pupil’s own 
imagination is stimulated in relation to the music. The same 
thing occurs if a series of, say, three or four pictures, more or 
less descriptive of the moods of three or four pieces, are placed 
before the pupils, and they are asked to name which picture 
would go best with which piece of music. Or, again, the 
names of a number of little pieces could be given, such, for 
instance, as Schumann uses in pieces for children, and the 
children asked to state which name would go with which 
piece. Inquiries with reference to the reason a choice is 
made would show vigorous, attentive, and imaginative listen- 
ing going on. Or some romantic piece of music could be 
played, the poem or title that accompanies it being first read 
and the pupils asked how such designation was justified. 
Correlation with other subjects could be brought in. For in- 
stance, pupils might be asked to suggest poems or stories ap- 
propriate to what is heard, or tell what kind of a picture 
would make a good cover design for the music. 
While in the above work the player-piano would perhaps 
be the most convenient to use, records of instrumental com- 
positions on the talking-machines would serve to a large ex- 
tent. The wide field of song-music that the talking-machines 
present gives an opportunity for the student to tell why a 
given accompaniment and melody go with a given text. A 
good illustration is Schubert’s “Erl King.” Such practice
-P-A-G-E-398
  336 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
would quicken a lively interest in art songs and illustrate the 
expressive use of instrumental material. Not only this, but 
in records of the folk-music of foreign lands, excellent oppor- 
tunity is given to get the spirit of these people in their songs. 
After a Russian, Hungarian, Scandinavian, or Italian folk- 
song, the pupils’ powers of observation are taxed when asked 
what characteristics of the people these songs portray. 
It will be seen that in all this work there is required a 
playful exercise of the imagination. We are in the world of 
make-believe, not fact. The music does not tell a concrete 
story or give a definite picture, any more than the clouds 
that gather around the setting sun are intended to express 
definite shapes; but it certainly does not injure our enjoy- 
ment of the sunset to allow our fancies to play with the 
shifting forms that its colors light up. In music similar 
imaginative play induces concentrated attention and listening. 
Not only does the music heard impress itself on the mind 
through such effort, but in the statement of his interpreta- 
tions the pupil is required to express himself in relation to 
the beautiful in a way that should cultivate his appreciative 
power as well as his use of language. A pupil will learn the 
difference between vapid and insipid, and vigorous and 
imaginative music, and widen his power of healthy enjoyment. 
The difference in character of this sort of work from the 
vocal will suggest the value of having it done at a separate 
time. A period once a week, or'a few minutes daily, for 
such appreciative work will be time well spent in the musical 
education of the pupil. 
The success of the work depends much on the sympa- 
thetic attitude of the teacher. Her interest and enthusiasm 
in the composition being heard is worth more than all other 
factors combined in forming the taste of the pupils. Hence, 
different teachers need different materials. 
As technical difficulties in production do not limit what 
can be done, the sole classification must be based on the 
appeal that the music makes to the pupil. Here the good
-P-A-G-E-399
  MUSIC 337 
judgment of the teacher is of the utmost importance. Gener- 
ally speaking, it would be better to pass from music of the ro- 
mantic or program type, like the music of the “Peer Gynt” 
suite, or Mendelssohn’s ‘‘Midsummer Night’s Dream” over- 
ture, where the accompanying idea is fairly definite and vig- 
orously felt, to those more subtle compositions, especially of 
the classical type, that require experience both of life and of 
music to be comprehended. 
The principles suggested, plus the enthusiasm of the 
teacher, will accomplish more than any attempt at classifica- 
tion. of material apart from the pupils for whom the classifi- 
cation is being made; for if in any subject the taste and 
capacity for comprehension of the pupil should be consid- 
ered, it is in this appreciation work. 
To sum up: Selection of material will be as various as 
there are pupils and teachers making such selection, but the 
principle with reference to method must be kept constantly 
in mind in the conduct of such appreciation lessons. These 
principles are: 
A. The selection of music. . 
B. Facts concerning what is heard. 
C. <A problem to be solved by listening. 
III. ScuHoot Music AND THE COMMUNITY 
The music training in the schools has so far been consid- 
ered under two main heads—one emphasizing singing, the 
second emphasizing listening. Out of the first has grown 
technical knowledge and skill; out of the second has been 
developed the power of concentrated listening, appealing to 
the imagination and developing taste and judgment. There 
remains one further consideration; that is, the relation of the 
music of the schools to the community. 
We saw in our introduction that the ultimate aim of 
school music, if it could be stated in abstract terms, would be 
to increase the quantity and improve the quality of musical  
-P-A-G-E-400
  338 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
enjoyment, and that the test was not that this should be 
done merely for school-days, but that it should continue to 
bear fruit in after-life. This means that the work of the 
school is to be tested largely by its effect in the community. 
To this end the school should make definite plans. There is 
already a movement toward the greater use of school-build- 
ings. One such use effectually carried on in Paris requires 
the supervisor of music as a part of his work to give two 
evenings a week to conducting choruses made up of former 
pupils who are now a part of the community. Such use of 
the school-buildings for musical purposes gives one of the 
most valuable motives for the work of the school. Pupils 
see their older brothers and sisters getting a satisfaction and 
pleasure out of music that they feel they will have if they are 
diligent. Such work interests the community at large through 
the recitals and concerts given, and affords a practical illus- 
tration of the accomplishment of the school. It gives a de- 
lightful opportunity for artistic and healthful use of the 
leisure time so sorely needed in our larger towns. It makes 
possible correlation with dramatic work and folk and artistic 
dancing that will make the school the place most beloved by 
the community. In this way the school will supply one of 
the most needed elements for developing social life. 
As we have stated the purpose of music to be the increase 
of life’s enjoyment, the school that carries its work on into 
the community is the one that will best accomplish this noble 
aim. 
SUMMARY 
1. The effective aim of all musical activity in school is to increase 
the quantity and improve the quality of the pupils’ musical 
enjoyment. 
2. In pursuit of the above aim, the musical activity of the school 
is conducted along two complementary lines, the first primarily 
singing, developing knowledge and skill; the second mostly 
listening, cultivating taste and judgment. 
3. The singing activity of the school presents two aspects, the first 
vocal, memorizing of song gems as a part of one’s permanent

mental equipment, and developing skill in singing these songs 
with good voice, expression, and articulation. 
. The second aspect of singing is learning to read music, “ihe 
quickens the power of perceiving what is heard, necessary in 
learning notation, and develops knowledge of the science of 
music. 
. Growing out of and necessary for skill in reading music, is drill 
for cultivating automatic responses to notation, conducted as 
speed work. 
. The second complementary line of musical activity, learning to 
listen, more than doubles the pupils’ field of musical experi- 
ence, through the systematic use of instrumental music. This 
presents two aspects of work, the first conducted largely by 
means of reproducing instruments, the second includes the 
use of instruments themselves, both individually as in the 
use of the piano and collectively as in orchestral practice. 
. The activity in listening to music stimulates the imagination, 
develops power of concentration, and cultivates a discrim- 
inative use of language, all in the field of music. 
. The educative process in teaching to listen is first to produce a 
keen enjoyment of what is heard, ‘through a careful prepara- 
tion of the-class beforehand with reference to the origin, struc- 
ture, and value of the music; and second, presenting a problem 
to be solved, based on the pleasure experienced, such as, for 
instance, to suggest a name or picture for the composition, 
or to act or dance its motion, or to describe its mood through 
the use of any human experience. 
. The second aspect of the listening work, namely, that including . 
the use of instruments themselves, heightens the power of listen- 
ing through knowledge of instruments and the technical skill 
gained through practice, especially where this is carried on in 
groups requiring the player constantly to listen to the effect 
of what he is producing in relation to those with whom he is 
playing. 
The school may cap its effort to increase the quantity and im- 
prove the quality of the pupils’ musical enjoyment by supply- 
ing the most powerful motive within its reach, namely, by 
giving concerts and recitats“open to the whole community in 
which gifted pupils, graduates, and outside musicians may 
take part, thus supplying a worthy goal as an end of all musical 
instruction, and a widened field of musical experience for every 
one.

PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
. Think through your usual daily routine of activities to see how 
much you depend on devices that use the forces of nature in 
their operation. 
. Do you understand the method of operation of such devices? 
3. Have you ever been forced to know how things behave in the 
ordinary course of nature in order to make use of them, and has 
your success in the particular instance been in proportion to 
your. knowledge? 
. How have you learned what you know of natural phenomena? 
Has the school contributed to this knowledge? 
. Do you enjoy the out-of-doors? Is such enjoyment desirable? 
. Do you possess this enjoyment because you know considerable 
about natural phenomena or because you have come in contact 
with some person whose contagious enthusiasm gave you your 
attitude of mind toward nature? 
. What elements of this appreciation of nature can be imparted by 
school instruction ? 
. What is the most perplexing question you have had to decide 
recently ? 
. How did you go about it to decide it? 
. Are you conscious of a right method of going about it? How can 
this scientific attitude and habit of mind be imparted in school 
so that it will function in life? 
The End to be Achieved in Teaching Nature Study.— 
Surely it would be well to arrive at a clear concept as to what 
one is trying to do before he sets out to doit. At the outset 
the nature-study teacher is confused by discovering, as she 
reads the various books and articles on nature study, that 
there is no single aim on which all are agreed, but that various 
aims are emphasized by various authorities. We must there- 
fore discuss not the aim of nature study, but 
34m
-P-A-G-E-406
342 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The Aims of Nature Study.—The more important of these 
may be tabulated somewhat as follows: 
  I. Social.—(a) To teach the child such facts and principles of nature 
as will make him more efficient in the community. 
(6) To give the nature-study approach to personal 
hygiene. 
IL. Individual: 
(A) Physical.—To impart such a love of nature as will impel to 
healthful out-of-door living. 
(B) Spiritual — 
(1) Moral.—To inspire such a companionship with nature 
as will lead to high ideals and moral integrity. 
(2) Esthetic—To implant an appreciation of the beauty 
everywhere revealed. 
(3) Intellectual—(a) To know nature, that the commonplace 
environment may have significance. 
(6) To learn to reason to correct conclu- 
sions on the basis of one’s own obser- 
vations. 
(c) (Possibly to provide a fund of experi- 
ence as the basis for later science 
work.) 
Now, let us add content to this bare outline. 
The Social Aim.—As a good illustration of this sort of 
nature study let us take school work on the house-fly. The 
enthusiast sees how deadly the house-fly is, causing, as he 
believes, the spread of tuberculosis, typhoid, and the scourge 
of children’s summer complaints, that decimates the ranks of 
the new-born like some medieval pestilence. It would be a 
boon to humanity if it could be exterminated. Here right to 
hand in the schools are the thousands of children. Send the 
message through them to their homes of the dread nature of 
the fly. Teach them the filthy habits of the fly, its life his- 
tory, the means of its extermination, and send them out, cru- 
saders in this campaign of sanitation. Nature study has had 
its initial opportunity in many a community through some 
such practical problem.
-P-A-G-E-407
  
NATURE STUDY 343 
It is largely because we live in close association that so- 
ciety demands that the individual be healthy, a demand rein- 
forced by personal considerations of comfort and success. | It is 
more important that the child adopt a few simple hygienic 
habits than that he be taught a multitude of physiological 
facts. Often the nature-study method of approach is very 
impressive. The child is more influenced by conclusions he 
reaches on a basis of his own observations than by much he 
reads or is told. Let him see the numerous colonies of bac- 
teria growing on a prepared gelatine plate to which he has 
touched his unwashed hands, and compare with the few col- 
onies that grow on another plate as the result of contact with 
his freshly washed fingers, and he will be much more likely 
to be cleanly than from any amount of verbal instruction. 
Much of the hygiene instruction may similarly be given by 
the nature-study method, and so comes to relate directly to 
oneself, whereas book instruction often seems quite dissoci- 
ated from personal application. 
The Moral and Esthetic Aims.—Nature has been a pro- 
lific source of inspiration to the idealist, the seer, the artist. 
All through the ages the great souls have gone apart into the 
wilderness to wrestle with life’s great problems, instinctively 
assured of sympathetic guidance from Mother Nature. And 
“Nature, the dear old nurse,” has soothed them, healed the 
wounds of an unkind world, and led the way to higher ideals 
and larger achievement. Liberty has been born of the hills 
and religion conceived in the solitary places. Boyhood days 
in the open, under the tutelage of the arching sky, the rocky 
hills, the rolling ocean, are essential in the training of real 
greatness of character. And what is true of individuals seems 
also true of nations. Self-reliant, sturdy character, abound- 
ing energy, idealism, these are the gift of the sun-flecked sky, 
the bounding river, the wide prospect. 
- Appreciation of art in later life is surely dependent on 
stocking the mind of childhood with those elemental sense- 
impressions that are the very alphabet of art. Next to man
-P-A-G-E-408
  344. TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
himself nature has been the great theme of art. To sense its 
beauty one needs be a veritable child of nature. 
The Intellectual Aims.—The bulk of American children 
obtain only a common-school education. Their outlook on 
life is in a measure determined by what the grades give them. 
The average child lives his life in his home country. That 
commonplace environment is bound to mean little to him un- 
less his eyes are opened to its significance. But no environ- 
ment is commonplace. Everywhere one may see the opera- 
tion of those mighty forces that have been at work through 
countless ages to shape the contour of the earth. Hills are 
being sculptured. Valleys are in the making. Rocks are 
disintegrating and reforming. The rock strata are full of 
the vestiges of a wonderful past. The roadside flowers and 
the animals of the meadows are suggestive of problems of 
their origin and their mutual relationships. The child who 
is made aware of these wonderful mysteries, whose eyes are 
opened to the meaning of these commonplace things in his 
daily environment need never lack for mental stimulation. He 
may travel farther in his own back yard than most tourists 
do in a year’s journey. This is an important end of nature 
study—to teach the significance of the every-day surroundings. 
The Scientific Method of Thinking.—Finally, and most 
important, it is a function of nature study to drill the child 
in scientific thinking—to teach him to reason for himself 
and to reason to correct conclusions on the basis of his own 
observations. The term observe is used now, not in the 
sense of seeing, but means achieving impressions through any 
or all of the senses. 
Accuracy of Observation.—The first step in this process 
is to establish some conscious ideals of the accuracy of ob- 
servation. The average person senses an object in a very 
indefinite way. We need to register it in mind if its image 
is to be retained with careful regard to its details and their 
mutual relations. An attempt accurately to sketch a flower, 
for instance, helps one to become aware of the visual details
-P-A-G-E-409
  NATURE STUDY 345 
of it.. Trying to imitate the song of a bird will show one 
how lacking in accuracy and detail is his register of hearing. 
One must hear it repeatedly, analyze its elements and their 
relationships before he can begin to reproduce it. 
Sensory Impressions the Basis of Thinking.—It is worth 
while to bring to the child a wide range of sensory stimuli. 
Let him smell the varied odors of the fresh earth and the 
flowers, feel the countless sensations of the stony pathway, 
handle the numerous objects the inquisitive child will pick 
up, taste the growing herbs and fruits, hear attentively the 
bird song, the strident insect note, and all the voices of the 
out-of-doors. 
These sensations registered in our childish brains are the 
raw materials we later transmute into imagery and ideas. 
For all of our thinking and the resulting mature judgments 
come to be built upon the foundation of our sensory impres- 
sions. Read your Shakespeare and stop to see how dependent 
you are on the stored-up sensory impressions for an appre- 
ciation of the meaning. If the words are anything more 
than senseless hieroglyphics it is because they are connected 
up with significant sensory memories. 
Let us bear in mind that observation just for its own 
sake is absolutely useless. There must always be a question 
to be settled if contact with nature is to be worth while. 
Much so-called nature study misses the point entirely be- 
cause it neglects this fundamental principle. The nature trip 
or class exercise is often merely aimless wandering in contact 
with materials that are in themselves uninteresting. ‘How 
can we set up instruments so as to telegraph to the seventh- 
grade room?” “How does the ice-cream freezer work?” 
“Where do dragon-flies come from?’—these and similar 
problems set the pupils to observing because they need the 
facts in their thinking. Just ambling about in the out-of- 
doors is about as profitable as studying literature out of the 
dictionary; we go to the latter to find out something and 
then it functions.  
-P-A-G-E-410
  346 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Inductive Thinking.—Nature study not only affords abun- 
dant material for thought, but it should be made to furnish 
drill in the scientific method of thinking which, briefly, is 
reasoning to correct conclusions on the basis of accurate 
observations. Most school subjects afford little opportunity, 
as usually taught, for such drill. The facts may be beyond 
our personal observation, as in history, or the reasoning 
processes are presented in type problems that are outside 
our experience and interest. How we do need in a democ- 
racy citizens who are trained to observe accurately for them- 
selves and to reason to unbiassed conclusions on the basis of 
the facts! What a boon it would be if, in our elections, for 
instance, citizens could lay aside prejudice and personal 
animosities, and vote on the questions submitted in accord 
with their best judgments, formed from reasoning well on 
the facts they had taken the pains to learn! Nature study 
has one of the largest opportunities in education. If the 
average child can be so taught the value of the scientific 
method of thinking and so drilled in it that he will use it in 
the solution of the daily problems of later life, the school 
will have admirably served its day and generation. 
Summary.—Briefly, then, nature study aims to teach 
children to observe for themselves and to think inductively, 
to acquire a scientific attitude of mind, to appreciate the 
significance of the commonplace environment, and be mind- 
ful of the beauty about them, to form lifelong companion- 
ships with inspiring nature. Nature study is really a method 
rather than subject matter. 
Principles of Method.—The moment these aims of nature 
study are clearly apprehended certain principles of method 
in nature study are well-nigh self-evident. 
Commonplace Material.—The wise teacher will use only 
commonplace materials, for we are to teach through ob- 
servation, and only those materials, consequently, should be 
used that are so abundant and available that every child 
may have opportunity to handle and study them individu-  
-P-A-G-E-411
  NATURE STUDY 347 
ally. One not infrequently still encounters so-called nature 
study wherein the teacher with the one rare specimen in hand 
stands at the front of the room and endeavors to conduct the 
exercise. Ideally, the children go out of doors to study the 
objects, or obtain them from their home environment. In 
the garden, the field, on the farm, beside the brook, or in the 
woods, with abundant material, the desired plant, animal, 
utensil, or process is seen under natural conditions. Such out- 
of-door work under a teacher who has contagious enthusiasm. 
will do more than anything else to impart a love for nature 
and habituate the pupil to sympathetic appreciation of na- 
ture’s unvarying laws. 
Our homes and shops and streets are crowded with material 
that the inquisitive child wants to know how to make and use. 
Beg enough old telephone material from your local concern 
to set up an instrument, and see if you can make it work. 
Find out why baking-powder makes biscuit rise, not by read- 
ing about it in books, but by devising and trying out some ex- 
periments. Make and send up a tissue-paper balloon. Dis- 
cover how the cream separator works, and devise a simple 
experiment to show the principle involved. Make a compass. 
How much crushing force does the nut-cracker exert? Make 
a kite that will fly; why does it go up? At what time of the 
year can you make a willow whistle? These are suggestive 
activities. Such need to be graded, systematized, and selected 
for a particular community, but those given will show the 
wealth of materials available. 
The Field Trip.—The field work needs to be planned with 
care. The teacher should go over the territory to be tra- 
versed in advance. The objects to be studied must be 
located. This assures definiteness. The trip must not be so 
stereotyped, however, that interesting things discovered by 
the pupils may not be included on the spur of the moment. 
It need not be a long trip. A vacant lot or old pasture beside 
the schoolhouse may afford abundant material for several 
field class exercises. Seasonal changes alter the animal and
-P-A-G-E-412
  
  348 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
plant forms on the same area. A single trip may cursorily 
go over territory where pupils see many things hastily that 
later may be brought into the schoolroom for detailed study. 
It is well to devote a trip to some one group. The trees 
of the region about the school, the common farm products, 
if in a rural community, the common weeds, the other flower- 
ing plants, the birds, especially during the migration periods, 
birds’ nests, the common insects, the injurious insects of 
the neighborhood, the pond animals—these are all good 
materials to specialize on during one or more trips. When 
the trip is over the children should be quizzed so they will 
feel that they are held responsible for definite things. Trees, 
for instance, may be numbered with paper tags on the way 
home, and the children can be required to write on paper 
provided for the occasion the names of the trees, numbered 
consecutively, that they have learned on the way out. Or the 
nature-study period the next day may be used for a written 
description accompanied by a sketch of the one or two birds’ 
nests visited. 
Information Not the Desired End.—To impart informa- 
tion is not the chief end of the study of nature material. Do 
not tell the pupils facts regarding the objects in hand. Ask 
questions which will impel them to see for themselves. The 
successful nature-study teacher needs to be as adept at cross- 
questioning as an expert lawyer. We are trying to train 
accuracy of observation and scientific methods of thinking, 
and it is at this point that the average teacher fails. She 
has in all other work practically adopted the principle that 
the child’s mind is an empty receptacle which it is her task 
to fill; she has made instruction synonymous with cramming 
and imparts to the child what she knows. This has been her 
practice so long that it is difficult to refrain from the practice 
and adopt a new method of procedure in nature study. Every 
supervisor of nature study in handling practice teachers en- 
counters this difficulty repeatedly. No matter what the par- 
ticular topic to be taught, the beginner comes flying to the

supervisor with the demand, ‘‘Where can I find books that 
will tell me about dandelions or cats or rocks,”’ or whatever 
is to be used as subject matter. Unaccustomed to gain 
knowledge directly for herself, the beginner asks for that 
second-hand information found in books. From the time the 
pupil enters the first grade until he graduates, his nose is 
stuck between the covers of a book in his endeavor to absorb 
an education. I would not senselessly decry the use of books. 
One should know how to use them, but he should also know 
how to use his eyes and ears and fingers. Fortunately, a 
teacher may successfully teach nature study who has very 
little book knowledge of the subject. In fact, if she realizes 
her ignorance and will set herself to learn the characters of 
the objects about her school, their habits, seasonal changes, 
and significance, if she will lead her pupils in studying, sketch- 
ing, making notes upon, and interpreting the commonplace 
objects and phenomena about her, she may be an eminently 
successful teacher. That is what the successful teacher must 
do, anyway, no matter how much she may know, if she is 
going to succeed in imparting the right attitude of mind, the 
scientific attitude, and the enthusiasm that leads to ennobling 
companionships with nature. Agassiz’? motto was: “Study 
nature, not books.” 
Garden and Agricultural Material—Much valuable infor- 
mation may be acquired while the pupil is being drilled in 
the scientific method of thinking. Indeed, it should be ac- 
quired. The teacher should select subject matter that has 
large social and industrial value in her community for the 
nature-study work. Pupils may, for instance, learn for them- 
selves by direct observation the life history of the mosquito, 
they can watch the deposition of eggs, the habits of the 
larve and pupe, and can think out for themselves methods 
of extermination which they can test by experiment. So in 
a malarial region the school could be the centre of a cam- 
paign of mosquito extermination that would have large com- 
munity value, and the work could be so conducted as to
-P-A-G-E-416

have also superior nature-study value. Correlate with this 
the history of the clean-up of Cuba and the Canal Zone, with 
brief biographies of those heroic men who valiantly gave 
their lives in working out this problem of sanitation, and 
there is added that element of moral instruction looking 
toward the development of high moral ideals that can best 
be imparted in some such indirect way. 
So the garden offers unlimited nature-study material. 
But teaching a boy how to earn pocket-money by raising 
lettuce and radishes in his back yard is not nature study. 
It is valuable in teaching industry, self-reliance, and other 
virtues, and with proper methods it may afford good nature 
study, but it does not necessarily do so. Nor is it particu- 
larly valuable educationally to teach a farmer lad, by rule-of- 
thumb methods, how to grow more corn on his acre. It has 
its economic justification. The same project, or problem, 
may be given educational value if the boy is led to work out 
for himself by appropriate experiment the proper methods 
of procedure, and thinks out for himself by inductive meth- 
ods the reasons that lie back of his seed selection, corn breed- 
ing, soil treatment, and cultivation. It merely needs empha- 
sis here that practical projects of this sort may be carried 
on in the name of education with no very large returns edu- 
cationally unless the method of instruction is carefully ar- 
ranged so as to insure not merely manual labor and the appli- 
cation of modern methods, but also drill in the scientific 
method of thinking. 
The Project.—The practical project, or problem, is emi- 
nently worth while in all nature-study work. Indeed, it is 
difficult to see how the pupil is to be taught to think—and 
that is our major aim—unless he has an interesting project 
to think about. In the lower grades, where training in accu- 
racy of observation is the large aim, acquaintance with the 
animals, plants, and minerals of the region is project enough, 
especially if collections can be made of some of these things 
according to individual tastes. But in the upper grades

-P-A-G-E-419
  _ NATURE STUDY 351 
definite projects suited to the individual pupils are well worth 
while. The project may be connected with the farm or gar- 
den. A maximum crop of corn from an acre, a garden patch 
run as a commercial venture with accurate accounting of all 
expenses and receipts, a pen of chickens, a hive of bees, a 
corner of the orchard—these are suggestive of the kind of 
project that may be adopted by some or all of the pupils, to 
be worked to a successful conclusion through careful solution 
of difficulties, by patient observation, and by thinking out 
the various problems involved with the help of such informa- 
tion as books and pamphlets can give. In a Southern city 
one grade became enthusiastic in its study of a pen of chickens 
started by a setting of eggs and an old hen kept under the 
teacher’s desk during the period of incubation. Their nature 
work centered around this pen for a couple of years. Ina 
Western town it was an old orchard, abandoned by its owner, 
that served as the major interest for the nature work. The 
infested fruit, the scale, and other insect pests were collected, 
studied, and experimented upon in a small way, until enough 
information and confidence was acquired to undertake the 
task of pruning, burning the rubbish, spraying, etc., that 
brought the trees back into bearing. 
Beauty and Moral Significance.—The appreciation of 
beauty and the moral significance that poet and philosopher 
have seen in nature are difficult to impart, impossible, in 
fact, directly. The teacher cannot gush over the beauty of 
a flower with the avowed purpose of inspiring her pupils with 
its grace. Pupils may be asked to sketch familiar things. 
One who has attempted to draw an elm and who has kept at 
it through repeated failures, learning from each to see more 
accurately, will better appreciate Corot’s trees. Such repro- 
ductions of the masters (like Corot, Landseer, Bonheur, and 
others) as are readily obtained in the Brown pictures or the 
Perry prints may be hung about the schoolroom, so that 
children will come to know them, and so learn to see beauty 
in the commonplace as the artist has seen and expressed it.

-P-A-G-E-420
  352 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
It is worth while to correlate good nature literature with 
the direct study of the objects. A teacher could not give to 
seventh or eighth grade pupils the suggested significance of a 
butterfly’s life history which they will take from Mrs. Sigour- 
ney’s ode. Bryant’s ode, ‘‘To a Waterfowl,” Van Dyke’s 
“Song Sparrow,” and similar bits of nature poetry and prose 
are full of significant suggestion, well worth storing in mind 
against the day of moral stress and sore despair. 
Nature Literature——Much caution needs to be exercised 
in the choice of such reading-matter. It is well to place 
before the children only such as comes under the name of 
some literary personage of acknowledged reputation. There 
is a flood of books with alluring nature titles that are neither 
accurate in the information they purport to give nor of lit-. 
erary value. Above all, the teacher must recognize that 
time spent in reading ‘“‘nature readers” is not time devoted 
to nature study. It is an easy way to fill the nature-study 
period to devote it to reading about nature, but that is a 
reading lesson, and neither teacher nor pupils should be duped 
into believing that such an exercise has value as nature study. 
The Course of Study.—Finally, brief consideration may 
be given to the course of study in nature study. Few graded 
courses in nature study are yet available. The teacher is 
either left to her own devices to fill the nature-study period 
as she feels inclined, or an outline is provided that suggests 
many topics for each grade from which she is free to select. 
The result is what might be anticipated—haphazard work 
that soon falls into disrepute, or an attempt at organization 
by some teacher with a genius for the work. To assist in 
such organization these suggestions are offered: The work 
needs to have dependent continuity to have any large value 
in education. A series of disconnected lessons on various 
topics selected at the whim of the teacher has little or no 
value. Yet often it is the chance encounter of the teacher 
or some pupil on the way to school with a bit of stone, a 
strange flower, a fledgling from its nest, that directs the na-

ture lesson for the day. Each lesson needs to be built upon 
the foundation of preceding lessons, and children must get 
in the habit of holding in mind what is learned day by day 
for later use. Only as this is done and the days’ increments 
are built into a connected whole can we expect to teach pupils 
to think, for thinking must be cumulative and constructive. 
This is the chief value of “the project,” that it unifies 
the work and is bound to make it continuous. More than 
that, the work needs to grow in complexity and difficulty as 
the mind of the pupil increases in capacity. It is no light 
task, then, for the teacher to lay out a satisfactory course 
for a year, and still more difficult to arrange the work for all 
the grades. It is a task that must be done for each com- 
munity. The materials are different in various regions and 
the community interests will vary even in closely contiguous 
regions. Finally, whatever the subject-matter included in 
the course, it should be presented to the pupils, as far as 
possible, in problem form, as a task to be accomplished, not 
merely a problem to be thought out. It is the repeated solu- 
tion of minor problems according to the scientific method of 
procedure—observation of the facts bearing on the problem, 
their classification and analysis, and the final formation of a 
judgment based upon them—it is this that constitutes the best 
thing nature study has to offer. And as the minor problems 
are so solved the pupil learns to depend upon the method. 
He should be made aware of what the scientific method of 
thinking is in the upper grades, so he may not only blindly 
follow it as a habit, but consciously put it into practice in 
his attack upon the questions he must successfully solve in 
life if he is to succeed even measurably. 
SUMMARY 
The Arms of nature study are many: 
1. To habituate the child to healthful, stimulating companionship 
with nature. . 
2. To open his eyes to the truly wonderful significance of the homely 
environment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-424
    354 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
3. To impart the scientific attitude of mind as a conscious part of 
his mental equipment. This means the child needs to be taught 
(a) to see the problems in the things about him; (0) to clearly 
define such; (c) to devise methods of attack in solving them; 
(d) to think out the solutions, and (e) try them out by experi- 
ment until (f) he reaches a sound judgment on the particular 
problem attacked. 
MErtHODs: 
4. All the nature work is therefore best given in the form of problems 
or projects. 
5. These should be socially valuable when possible. 
6. Always dealing with commonplace materials, and 
7. Adapted to the local situation. 
OrcanizATion: The nature study 
8. Should be definite. 
9. Have dependent continuity, and 
to. Increase in difficulty with the growing capacity of the child. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
1. What changes in the contour of your region is accomplished by the 
creek, river, orlake? Do not read books to find out what streams 
do, and then go out merely to verify this, but go out to find out 
at first hand. 
2. Is the creek carrying sediment, and, if so, how much? Devise and 
try out experiments to find out. 
3. Divide the school garden or vacant lot into individual gardens, and 
assign one, by lot, to each child. See who can raise the largest 
crop of string-beans, peas, or other early crop. As the class 
faces this situation, what problems do they see? Can they get 
the information they need? 
4. As you look around, you see that houses are usually provided with 
chimneys. Can the children formulate a theory as to why this 
is so, and prove it for themselves, not consulting books, but sim- 
ply using their own ingenuity? 
5. Children each have in hand a piece of quartz and one of feldspar. 
Ask them to find out which is the harder. 
6. Gather the fruits of a number of weeds, or look at the numerous 
fruits in the grocer’s window. Do they suggest any problems? 
If so, could you devise some way to try to find the answers with- 
out consulting books? Can you prove your suggested answer 
to be either correct or wrong?
-P-A-G-E-425
  NATURE STUDY 355 
7. Ihave an aquarium with a few minnows in it and some water-plants; 
it has been covered quite air-tight’ for several months, yet plants 
and fish are healthy. Establish a similar aquarium and see if 
it suggests any problem. Can the pupils work out the answers? 
8. Do your children know what color a dog’s eyes are, and, if not, will 
they find out? Do the facts suggest any question? Can they 
answer it? You may need to let them use books for additional 
facts to try out their theories to account for the facts. 
9. Is there any real difference between nature study and the new 
“general science” of the high school, and cannot the latter be 
organized in a sequence from the seventh year on in the six-six 
plan? 
Note.—Teachers should read Dewey’s “ How We Think,” especially 
chapters 6, 11, 14 and 15, for valuable suggestions on methods of 
cultivating the scientific attitude and habit of mind through skilfully 
guided school work.—Ep.

CHAPTER XVI 
GEOGRAPHY 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
1. Is it necessary for any one to know all the places on the map? 
2. In what phases of world geography are little children most inter- 
ested ? 
3. What methods of instruction most nearly take the place of actual 
travel to the child? 
4. How would you define geography? . 
5. At what grade should home geography give way to more formal 
study of a text? 
6. How large should a text-book in geography be? What other helps 
than the text are useful? 
7. In how far are geographical facts dependent on each other? 
8. Why does map sketching by the pupil: fix position and form better 
than merely observing a printed map? 
9. To what extent can the so-called spiral method of instruction be 
applied to geography? 
to. How much knowledge of the rest of the universe is necessary in 
order to understand the earth? 
I. New anp Orp MeEtHops 
Geography Teaching.—In her recent book, ‘The Promised 
Land,” Mary Antin relates the marvellous effects wrought in 
her life by our American schools when she, a young Russian 
immigrant girl, came to this country. But of the instruction 
which she received in geography she makes an exception in 
the following words, which are very suggestive to geography 
teachers: “In the schoolroom, as far as the study of the map 
went, we began with the symbol and stuck to the symbol. 
No teacher of geography I ever had, except the master I 
referred to, took the pains to ascertain whether I had any 
sense of the facts for which the symbols stood. Outside the 
study of maps, geography consisted of statistics: Tables of 
357 
 
-P-A-G-E-428
    358 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
population, imports and exports, manufactures, and degrees 
of temperature; dimensions of rivers, mountains, and political 
states; with lists of minerals, plants, and plagues native to 
any given part of the globe. The only part of the whole 
subject that meant anything to me was the description of 
aspects of foreign lands, and the manners and customs of 
their peoples. The relation of physiography to human his- 
tory—what might be called the moral of geography—was 
not taught at all, or was touched upon in an unimpressive 
manner.” 
Undoubtedly within the last fifteen or twenty years there 
has been vast improvement, not only in the methods of 
teaching geography, but in the selection of geographical ma- 
terial worthy to receive the time and effort of pupils. But 
yet there is room for improvement. The “sailor geography” 
and the illogical methods of the past generation have not 
wholly been carried away by the rising tide of a better peda- 
gogy which has been produced by the work of such men as 
Parker, Geike, Redway, Davis, McMurry, Dodge, and others. 
Modern Improvements in Method.—Perhaps the most 
marked changes which have occurred within recent years in 
geography teaching may be classed under three heads as 
follows: (1) The introduction of home geography; (2) the 
, substitution of much descriptive matter in place of the 
memorizing of names which always remain names only; and 
‘(3) the constant recognition of cause and effect. 
By means of home geography the child’s mind is stored 
with concrete information with which he can afterward 
relate the new and otherwise unappreciated facts which he 
will learn of unknown places. With the aid of better text- 
books and a wealth of supplementary reading available to- 
day, the dry bones of geography have been clothed with flesh 
and blood. With the emphasis shifted from facts to the 
causal relation between facts, an exercise which once was a 
draft upon the memory alone, has now become a cultural 
force which trains the mind to habits of reasoning which
-P-A-G-E-429
  
  GEOGRAPHY 359 
will be of lifelong value. Much of what follows in this 
chapter must group itself about one or other of the above 
three phases of geography teaching. 
II. Home GrocrapHy 
Like its twin subject, nature study, home geography is 
a somewhat ill-defined branch in the school curriculum. Like 
nature study, also, it is difficult to teach. This arises from 
the fact that it is not a text-book subject, and, furthermore, 
that the local environment of each particular school makes 
uniformity impossible, so that each teacher must in a mea- 
sure pioneer his way through the subject. 
However, there are general principles which will help us 
not only to define the limits of home geography, but to pre- 
sent it to children in a logical manner. Scatter-brained 
effort here is of little avail. There should be running through 
the entire subject some thread of definite purpose. 
Meaning of the Term.—Perhaps the most important guid- 
ing thought is that everything given under this name should 
be truly geographical. But here we are met with some un- 
certainty as to just what constitutes geography. Some say 
that it is “A study of the earth as the home of man.” Others, 
putting the emphasis upon the human element, define it as 
“A study of man in his home, the earth.” 
A definition given by Mill will serve as a good basis for 
the selection and rejection of material both in home geogra- 
phy and in more advanced phases of the subject. He says: 
| “Geography is the study of the earth in its relation to man 
and life.” 
Many topics relating to man or to the earth would not, 
according to this definition, be geography. For example, a 
detailed study of the government of Germany jis an interest- 
ing study of man, but there is little relation between govern- 
ment and earth. Again, a study of geology is entertaining, 
but, excepting that phase of the subject which we call physi-
-P-A-G-E-430
  360 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ography, geology has little relationship to life upon the earth 
now and to man. 
Not every phase of life which the child sees about him 
can be regarded as geography, even in miniature or in em- 
bryo, and only that which will help to illuminate the pages 
of later geographical study should be admitted within the 
pale of ‘Home Geography.” 
Topics in Home Geography.—As in all geography, so here 
there are two classes of topics into which the subject matter 
may be grouped, the social topics and the physical topics— 
those in which life relations are the prominent features, and 
those in which earth knowledge is emphasized. Of course, 
as pointed out above, life topics to be geographical must be} 
“influenced by their relation to the earth, and earth topics 
‘must be shown to have an effect upon the life of man. 
The home is one of the simplest of social topics, which 
should be studied because it furnishes concrete illustration of 
‘many of the phases of geography. Each member of the home 
has duties to perform, ‘‘occupations,” and the purchase of 
food and clothing and other necessities of the family illus- 
trates the commerce of the world. Perhaps a garden in the 
back yard furnishes some of the ‘“‘products”’ upon which the 
family live or which they part with in exchange for things 
they cannot themselves produce. 
In all such study the teacher must keep clearly in mind 
what is in its nature geographical and what is not. 
The town, city or country community in which the family 
reside forms a second social topic which is productive of very 
much illustrative material. The social and commercial de- 
pendence of one family upon another; the organization among 
themselves for purpose of government or better social service; 
the need of easy communication, one family with another and 
with surrounding towns; the food materials which are brought 
into the community and the sources from which such supplies 
come, and why such things cannot as well be produced at 
home; what this community supplies to the outside world.
-P-A-G-E-431
  
GEOGRAPHY 361 
Such topics are purely geographical in their nature, and 
being within the range of the children’s experience are suit- 
able to prepare for them the way to a study of the geography 
of commerce and trade of the world. 
In all of this study the concrete and personal element 
should enter as much as possible. Otherwise the study of 
one’s own city might be as incomprehensible to children as a 
study of things farther removed by distance but perhaps 
nearer to the child’s experiences. For instance, in studying 
the government and business life. of the city the men who 
occupy official positions and who do the work of the city 
should be made the objects of study rather than the positions 
themselves. Some children may know a policeman or a fire- 
man or a member of the council and be able to tell what his 
duties are, thus bringing the class into more intimate contact 
with the subject of the lesson. 
Physical topics call for outdoor work. A river system 
made with a hoe and a garden hose is more true to nature 
than an indoor sand map of the same thing. Better still is a 
study of the river itself or even its counterpart, a streamlet 
with its branches, or a ravine and the smaller hollows tribu- 
tary to it. 
In the physical field, it is impossible to prescribe a home 
geography course suitable for all, for there is no such course 
possible. Those features should be studied which are present : 
in the local landscape. The weather leading, as it does, to 
climate, is a universal topic, but the prominence given to 
various surface features and to streams or bodies of still 
water, will have to depend upon the proximity to the school 
of such features. 
III. Wortp GrocRApHy 
Connecting the Known with the Unknown.—Growing out 
of home geography or, rather, as a part of it, should come 
to the child a comprehension of the world as a whole. This 
large conception may grow out of the child’s study of familiar 
 
-P-A-G-E-432
  362 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
things of the home and the community. The coffee we drink 
and the rubber of our automobile tires may be traced back 
to their source in South America. The wool in our clothing 
may have come from Australia and the rice and silk from 
Japan or China. 
Such things make connecting-links between the child’s 
mind and the distant unknown—serve as stepping-stones 
from the known to the unknown. After a discussion of the 
coffee-plantations and rubber-forests of South America, the 
sheep-ranches of Australia, and the rice-fields and silk fac- 
tories of Japan and China, should come descriptions of other 
features of these countries. 
The child life of distant lands is excellent material for a 
beginning in world geography. Stories of the Eskimos, the 
Arabs, the Chinese, the negroes of Africa, the people of In- 
dia, and the American Indians, may be told in such a way as 
to impress children with the spirit of these nations. The 
spirit, or atmosphere, of a geographical situation is worth 
more at this stage than any number of geographical facts. 
The countries selected about which to tell stories should 
be those of the simpler, more childlike, crude forms of civiliza- 
tion, and the life of the children of these peoples should re- 
ceive emphasis. 
In all of this work the globe should be in constant use. 
Small globes can be purchased very cheaply, and it is very 
desirable that each child have one on his desk while world 
lessons are being given. Unless the scene of our story be 
laid in a definite region the stories lose their force as geog- 
raphy and become little more than fairy-tales. Globes are 
much better than flat maps for young pupils, for they estab- 
lish in the children’s minds correct relationships of the places 
referred to, and a conception of the earth’s form. 
Prominence of Descriptive Geography.—If we compare 
the best geography teaching of to-day with a typical lesson 
of two decades ago, perhaps the most noticeable difference 
observed will be in the relatively larger amount of descrip- 
 
-P-A-G-E-433
  
GEOGRAPHY 363 
tive matter now given. The old text-books gave very mea- 
grely the descriptions which in the newer books are the life 
of the subject. Long lists of map questions were printed for 
study, the questions having little sequence or connection of 
any kind, one with another. These questions required a 
thorough study of the map, the details of which must be 
memorized instead of being organized into a causal relation- 
ship. Map study formed the backbone of the course, and 
there was comparatively little else. 
To-day our texts are replete with valuable information 
given in sufficient detail to render it interesting. The market 
is full (and so should the school library be) of books supple- 
mentary to the text, expanding what the limits of a single 
book are too narrow to do when dealing with so large a theme, 
every geographical phase of the regions studied. 
Supplementary Readers.—Formerly, if the geography 
teacher, realizing the meagreness of the text-book, wished to 
supplement it with assignments to be read by the pupil, he 
had to resort to a book of travel or adventure, the former 
often being uninteresting to children and the latter unreliable 
as to fact. A new class of literature has arisen to provide 
suitable instruction in an interesting form, the geographical 
readers. 
The style of the better class of such books is unique. 
While the composition is good, still there is no effort at liter- 
ary ornamentation. Long descriptions in which authors de- 
light, valuable chiefly for their beauty of diction, give way 
in these books to a more direct style, better suited to convey 
instruction. 
The success of these series of books has led some publish- 
ers recently to so extend their series that each volume deals 
with a very small geographical unit, thus practically defeat- 
ing the purpose of the reader, namely, to supplement the 
pupil’s text-book in so direct a form that he will be able to 
read the fuller account of all the countries of which his book 
treats. Ifa volume be devoted to a country which his text   
     
-P-A-G-E-434
  364 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
passes over with a paragraph or two he will manifestly be 
unable to do this. Balance as regards the relative impor- 
tance of countries is better preserved in the child’s mind if 
his supplementary reading-matter is sufficiently condensed so 
that it covers large regions of the earth, giving to each por- 
tion its due prominence. 
Reports on Supplementary Reading.—One of the finest 
cultural exercises in geography teaching consists in having 
pupils read sections of the supplementary books which the 
rest of the class have not read, and make oral reports upon 
their reading. The fact that they are giving to the class 
something which is new and interesting to them adds zest 
to the exercise. The recitation of a text-book lesson which 
every one else knows as well as the reciter himself, and which 
he is reciting merely to prove that he knows it, lacks an ele- 
ment of value which the “report” to the class group supplies. 
Current Literature.—Magazines and newspapers cannot be 
used in the same way that geographical readers can to am- 
plify each lesson, for current news is not usually pertinent 
to the lesson being studied at the time. However, every ad- 
vanced class in geography should devote a definite allotment 
of time each week to a consideration of current events. In 
this way the class will come to realize that geography is a 
dynamic, not a static subject. As in the preparation of re- 
ports mentioned above, so here the pupils acquire some facil- 
ity in selecting and organizing important facts from the mass 
of material under consideration. 
The Geographical Library.—There is no subject (except- 
ing literature) which so imperatively demands a well-stocked 
library as does geography. If they are well chosen, sufficient 
books may be secured for a comparatively small sum. There 
are few schools so poor as to be justified in spending nothing 
on a library of supplementary geographical readers. At the 
close of this chapter a short list of good supplementary liter- 
ature is recommended, the total cost amounting to a very 
modest sum. Preference should be given to books which are
-P-A-G-E-435
  GEOGRAPHY 365 
written especially for school use, such as the various series 
of readers. 
Sometimes town and city schools are so situated that 
they can make a special arrangement with the public library, 
so that the books there become practically a part of the 
school’s equipment. County libraries are beginning to carry 
to the child of the rural school the same pee which his 
city neighbor enjoys. 
Cause and Effect in Geography Teaching.—Recent empha- 
sis upon causal relations among facts has done very much to 
improve the teaching of geography. It has been to this sub- 
ject what the introduction of the philosophy of history into 
the bare record of past events has been to the teaching of 
history. 
The facts of geography should be gathered in clusters like 
grapes, not one by one. The circumstances which bind facts 
together are often more important than the facts themselves, 
and if the connecting thread be preserved, the memory is 
greatly assisted in retaining what has been learned. An 
illustration will make clearer the difference between the 
teaching of isolated facts and a discussion of trains of caus- 
ally related facts. The first of the two lists of questions 
below represents those found in earlier text-books, and has 
little to recommend it except that it is easy to make. The 
second list, covering much the same ground, is in line with 
more modern views of what geography teaching should con- 
sist of. It calls for thought, for solving definite problems, 
for comparison, for imagination, for reasoning from cause to 
effect—or from effect back to cause. The first list demands 
an exercise of memory only.

ates Alaska from Russia?

latitude which bound Alaska? Compare their climate with

that of Alaska. Why are the towns of Alaska near the coast? 
Tell some advantage each town has on account of its particu- 
lar situation. Would it be nearer to go by water or overland 
to the Klondike region? Which route would be easier? 
What time of year would the river trip have to be made? 
Find by the use of the scale of miles how far it is across the 
Behring Strait. What nation might enter America across 
this strait? 
Visualization.—Good teaching in geography keeps the 
child’s imaginative faculty constantly on the alert. Mental 
pictures are continually forming, and the nearer these pic- 
tures can approach to the clearness of the traveller’s actual 
perception the better. 
There are several aids to the formation of good mental 
pictures which the teacher should definitely make use of. 
First, a vivid word-picture, perhaps read to the class, but 
better given in the words of the teacher, while requiring some 
time and preparation, is worth all it costs. Teachers should 
cultivate a style which will approach the vividness of an 
eye-witness’s story. Second, what the child has seen and 
experienced, fortified by his course in home geography, helps 
him to picture unseen conditions. The imagination is help- 
less without some basis of experience. Even it cannot make 
bricks without straw. Third, the use of pictures in regional 
geography, and models and diagrams in astronomical geog- 
raphy are perhaps our best allies in securing adequate visuali- 
zation. The modern stereograph probably comes nearer than 
anything else to arousing the same thoughts and feelings 
which would be evoked in the traveller as he actually looks 
upon the scene. Fourth, maps serve as a stepping-stone to 
enable the mind to reach a position where it can comprehend 
relative position and size. A mental image of the maps is 
first formed and then this is used to help us perform the other- 
wise impossible task of picturing the continent or the world. 
Map-Drawing.—Map-drawing as an aid to correct visual- 
ization can scarcely be overestimated, and yet many teach-
-P-A-G-E-437
GEOGRAPHY - 367 
ers waste much time of their pupils in this exercise. The 
trouble lies in the use of the wrong kind of map-drawing. 
If we make the map an elaborate picture, a work of art, it 
is of doubtful value, considering the time spent. But if we 
make it a quick (but not careless) sketch of only those fea- 
tures which we wish to be remembered, its almost daily use 
will be time well spent. Drawing at the board a rapid 
sketch map from memory forces the pupil when preparing 
for the test to fix his attention on the general form and rela- 
tive position, to the neglect of details. This is exactly what 
we want. Daily exercises of this kind take but a few mo- 
ments’ time and accomplish wonders. Let the regions drawn 
be small, a single state, for example, and the exercise one of 
naming the surrounding regions and locating certain cities 
or rivers. Make the task definite, give a little time to pre- 
pare, have it executed rapidly, and finally dismiss it with a 
word of helpful criticism. A recent author says: “Twenty 
maps drawn in twenty minutes are worth more than one 
drawn in twenty minutes.” 
If a more elaborate map is desired occasionally it should 
be colored, as coloring takes but little additional time and 
adds to the pupil’s interest in his work. The simplest color 
to use is a solution of diamond dyes (a package in about half 
a gallon of cold water) applied with a brush or wisp of cotton 
wrapped on a match or toothpick. 
) The chief value of such a map is rather to stimulate inter- 
est than to teach. 
Another form of map which may profitably be drawn by 
the teacher and left permanently upon the blackboard is the 
chalk and charcoal map, a specimen of which is shown in 
figure facing following page. A raised map is scarcely better in 
showing contour, and it has the advantage of the sand map 
in that it can be more easily seen by all of the class at once. 
A lump or stick of charcoal and a piece of white chalk is all 
that is required in drawing it. First, the whole space is 
chalked in white. Then the mountains are drawn, using
-P-A-G-E-438
  
368 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
charcoal on the shady side. The rivers and lakes, etc., are 
_ also put in black. Too much regularity in lining should be 
avoided, and the mountains and plains should be made to 
blend by rubbing with the finger. 
IV. PuHysicAL AND COMMERCIAL GEOGRAPHY 
There is a very wide-spread demand for more physical 
and commercial geography than is incidentally included in 
the grade work in general geography. To meet this demand 
formal courses in these subjects are sometimes introduced 
into the eighth grade. Attention is entirely diverted from 
regional geography—to be fixed in turn upon the two sci- 
ences, commerce and physiography. 
Fallacy in Such a Course.—Two considerations may be 
urged against this policy. First, the pupils cannot well 
afford to drop regional geography; and, second, at this age 
children are not mature enough to study these subjects as 
sciences. They are not ready for the generalizations neces- 
sary when commerce and physiography are studied apart 
from the regions which exemplify them. 
A Better Policy—A method which is at once practicable 
and sufficient to meet the demand consists in reviewing in 
the last school year the geography of the world, with empha- 
sis upon two phases only of each country, namely, its physi- 
ography and industrial relations. - 
In this way a needed review is secured, but from such a 
different point of view that the work will seem new to the 
pupils; it will be a true exemplification of the oft-abused 
“spiral method.” Three books of reference are needed for 
this work, the pupils’ text, an elementary book on commercial 
geography, and another on physical geography. 
One by one the units which make up physical geography 
will be brought out. When the lesson is upon Norway, the 
character and origin of the fiords will naturally constitute 
the main topic. Likewise, a study of Italy will consist prin-

-P-A-G-E-441
  GEOGRAPHY 369 
cipally of a discussion of vulcanism, etc. In countries like 
Germany and Great Britain the stress will be laid upon in- 
dustry and commerce. 
Astronomical Geography.—A phase of geography which is 
probably more neglected than any other part of the subject is 
that which deals with the earth as 
a globe and its relations to the 
rest of the universe. The cause of 
day and night; the two factors 
which together produce the sea- 
sons; the reason for the limits of 
the zones; the cause of the mid- 
night sun; all these interesting 
topics can be made plain to chil- 
dren—but they seldom are. 
Illustrative Helps.—The first 
thought to get clearly into the 
child’s mind is a conception of the 
solar system. One of the most 
helpful models to demonstrate this 
relationship of earth, sun, moon, 
and planets is a simple home-made 
device seen in the accompanying 
figure. It consists of several balls 
of various sizes suspended from the 
ceiling, a larger (croquet) ball, S, 
representing the sun and smaller 
balls for the earth, Z, the moon, 
M, and a planet, P, as shown in 
the cut. A string, cd, at the ceil- 
ing will allow the whole system to be revolved about the 
centre, S. The moon, being on a short string, makes several 
revolutions (months) about the earth, while both together 
pass around S, the sun, making a year. With very little 
trouble or expense such a model could be given a permanent 
place in any schoolroom.      Wooden bar

To illustrate the cause of seasons a croquet-ball painted 
white, so that light and shadow will be more evident, may 
be carried about a lamp in a partially darkened room. A 
nail in each side represents poles. The axis from pole to 
pole must slant and always point in the same direction. — 
Show what would happen if it did not always point in the 
same direction (toward the north star) or if it were vertical 
with respect to its or- _ 
bit, or if it did not re- 
4% volve about the sun. 
% For a means of 
: gs demonstrating all 
phenomena connect- 
ed with day and night 
and the zones, noth- 
ing can excel the 
@ Continuous day globe used according 
b eesiGy endnigte to the following plan. d Continuous night We must imagine 
that the globe is really the earth and that we are located 
somewhere out in space looking down upon it. The globe 
must stand where the sun will shine upon it and we shall be 
able to see the regions of both day and night, light and 
shadow, as it is turned. 
Set the globe so that the light covers it from pole to pole. 
It is now falling perpendicularly upon the equator, as may 
be shown by standing a pencil or other object on the equator 
vertically, with respect to the globe. It casts no shadow. 
This is the condition September 23 and March 21. 
Now place two chalk spots upon the globe in different 
latitudes, but upon the same meridian. They represent two 
persons. Turn the globe and they will be seen to enter the 
shadow simultaneously and emerge simultaneously. This 
shows that with the sun over the equator the days are of 
equal length in all latitudes. The nights also are of equal 
length.    
-P-A-G-E-443
GEOGRAPHY 371 
Moreover, it will be seen that the path traversed by each 
of these points crosses twelve hour-circles in the light portion 
and the same in the dark. The days are equal to the nights. 
This is the season of the equinox. 
To show why winter days are short in northern latitudes, 
tilt the globe so that the sunshine falls 23% degrees short of 
the north pole. Show as before that the sun is now vertical 
at the tropic of Capricorn. This represents December 21. 
Leave the chalk spots placed as they were before. Now turn 
the globe, and the more northern one is seen to enter the 
shadow sooner than the one farther south. Sunset in that 
latitude comes earlier, the day is shorter. To determine by 
how much the day is shorter, count the hour-spaces as before. 
By similar demonstration the northern summer days can 
be shown to be long. The globe should now stand so that 
the sun shines 23% degrees past the north pole. See accom- 
panying figure. 
To show the reason for continuous day or night at certain 
seasons in the Arctic Circle: Place a chalk spot near the 
pole. On rotation of the globe, while in the summer posi- 
tion, the spot does not enter the shadow at all. During 
rotation of the globe, while in the winter position, the spot 
remains constantly in the shadow. 
The length of any day in the year in the observer’s lati- 
tude (or elsewhere) may easily be found as follows: 
By reference to the analemma, printed on most globes, 
ascertain the distance of the sun north or south of the equa- 
tor upon that day. (Or this information may be determined 
by the pupils, using a “sun-board.”) Having obtained the 
position of the sun, set the globe so that the sun’s rays shall 
fall vertically in that latitude and then proceed as above to 
find the length of day and night in the observer’s latitude. 
The apparent motion of the sun north and south during 
the course of a year should be observed by the pupils. The 
younger children may record the changing length of the 
shadow of the house or some other fixed object at noon. The
-P-A-G-E-444
  
  372 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
older ones can make and use a “sun-board. A nail driven 
at one corner of a square board casts a shadow at noon across 
an arc of a circle, thus showing the position of the sun rela- 
tive to the observer’s zenith any day in the year. 
V. A SuccEsTED CouRSE IN GEOGRAPHY 
Below the fourth grade there should be no book in the 
pupils’ hands. Home geography, stories of interesting people, 
and instruction in the use of maps and globes should com- 
prise the work. The children should learn how to draw a 
map and interpret it. Begin with maps of room and yard. 
Fourth Grade may use an elementary book. Study the 
large and interesting facts about all regions of the world. In 
spirit the method should still be that of the younger grades. 
Descriptive story-telling should form an important part of the 
work. Strive for “atmosphere” rather than for formal facts. 
Fifth Grade-—The southern hemisphere, South America, 
Africa, and Australia, is well adapted to appeal to the inter- 
ests of this grade. Also, being finished here, it leaves the 
upper grades free to devote time to more important regions. 
Sixth Grade—A thorough study of Europe and Asia. 
Seventh Grade.—The United States in detail, special atten- 
tion being given to the home state. 
Eighth Grade.—A study of the commercial and physical 
geography of all foreign countries, paying special attention to 
their commercial relations to the United States. 
SUMMARY 
1. Modern improvements in geography teaching have taken place 
along three main lines: (1) The introduction of home geography, 
(2) emphasis upon descriptive geography at the expense of so 
much ‘‘sailor geography,” (3) recognition of cause and effect. 
2. A course in geography should exclude all topics which do not 
have to do with both man and earth. 
3. Home geography topics are: (1) Social (based upon the home and 
the community), and (2) physical (dealing with natural fea~ 
tures of land and water, weather, etc.).

. Home geography should merge gradually into world geography. 
In teaching world geography, atmosphere should precede facts. 
. In addition to a text-book every school should make use of (1) 
the supplementary reader in geography, (2) books of travel, (3) 
current literature. 
. A jumble of unrelated geographical questions may be compared 
to a disjointed skeleton. A causal relationship among the 
questions articulates the skeleton, and some interesting de- 
scriptive matter relating to the places mentioned covers the 
dry bones with flesh and blood. 
. Visualization is secured (1) by good verbal description, (2) by 
reference to things the child has seen, (3) by means of pictures, 
diagrams, and models, and (4) by maps. 
. Daily work in rapid map-sketching is of more value than elab- 
orate, artistic productions. 
. Physiography and commerce should not be divorced from regional 
geography. 
Astronomical geography deserves more attention than it usually 
receives, when placed, as it often is, 1,28 2 brief introduction to

  I. Inrropuctrory 
In order to understand the proper ods of teaching 
agriculture in the public school it is necessary to have a clear 
conception of the objects sought and the results which may 
be reasonably expected to be obtained by the teaching of the 
subject, as well as the possibilities and limitations which it 
presents. 
Agriculture Defined for School Use.—In general usage, the 
term “agriculture” includes all forms of general farming, 
horticulture, forestry, and animal husbandry. As applied to 
the public schools, it indicates a study of the elementary 
principles of the science of agriculture and a training in the 
art of agriculture. In the lower grades it takes the form of 
school-gardening and that portion of nature study which deals 
with soils, insects, birds, and weather in their relation to 
plant growth and development. The chief aim of agricul- 
375
-P-A-G-E-448
  376 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tural instruction in the lower elementary grades is neither 
scientific nor commercial; it is designed rather to interest 
boys and girls in the general field of agriculture, to develop 
a love for plants and animals, to enable the children to see 
and to appreciate the beauties of nature—in other words, to 
foster a healthful attitude toward country life. In the up- 
per grades and in the high school it becomes, to a limited 
degree, both commercial and scientific, but in all cases it 
must be primarily educational to remain a permanent part 
of the public school curriculum. 
For convenience in discussion the work in agriculture in 
the elementary school will be considered in three groups, viz.: 
The primary grades, including grades one, two, and three; 
the intermediate grades, including grades four, five, and six; 
and the grammar grades, including the seventh and eighth 
grades (also grade nine, when it is a part of the elementary 
school system). 
II. THE PRIMARY GROUP 
Object Sought.—Since the agriculture suitable for pupils 
of the primary grades must necessarily be treated largely 
from the standpoint of nature study, little need be said in 
this chapter concerning this group. The chief object here is 
the cultivation of a love for living, growing things; and it 
matters little what is studied so long as it is something that 
appeals to the child, and the more senses through which the 
appeal is made the richer will be the experience acquired. 
For example, the smooth, shiny, red pop-corn, if followed to 
its predestined end, will appeal through five senses. 
Selection of Vegetables and Flowers.—In selecting the 
vegetables and flowers to grow in the primary gardens some 
with large seeds should be chosen for the children to plant 
and some with small seeds should be planted by the teacher 
or older pupils for children to enjoy—some for beauty of 
color, some for fragrance, and some to touch the appetite. 
Of course the seeds should be properly planted and well

tended, and some of the pupils will observe the methods 
used. Whatever the pupils can do they should be taught to 
do to the best of their ability, but the teacher should remem- 
ber that methods of planting and cultivation are incidental 
to the pupils in these grades and should not be emphasized. 
Children love to dig in the soil, to rake and to hoe, and with 
a little assistance they can lay out comparatively straight 
rows and drop the seeds with surprising accuracy, even in 
the kindergarten, but their minds are on the plant that is to 
grow and develop into a vegetable or a flower and should be 
allowed to remain there. The teacher must be responsible 
for the mechanical work, as well as the scientific planning. 
III. Tue INterMEepIATE GROUP 
In the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades the pupils should 
become familiar with and be taught the uses of the various 
agricultural crops, where they grow, how they are trans- 
ported, manufactured, and finally carried to the consumer. 
Much of this instruction should come through the reading of 
supplementary readers and state and Federal bulletins. Some 
instruction may be given as to the best methods of growing 
certain crops which the boys and girls choose to grow. 
Boys’ and Girls’ Clubs.—Pupils of this age should be 
encouraged to join one of the boys’ and girls’ agricultural 
clubs, and careful supervision should be given to their work 
throughout the summer. In the village and city schools the 
school garden will play an important part; but even here, as 
well as in the rural schools, the most important phase of the 
work in agriculture is that done in connection with the boys’ 
and girls’ clubs. Work of this nature has been successfully 
carried on in various parts of the United States during the 
last decade and now practically every state has a state leader 
in charge of boys’ and girls’ clubs, who is located at the agri- 
cultural college, co-operating with the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture at Washington. The following excerpts  
-P-A-G-E-452
  378 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
from government publications show the purpose scope, and 
value of this work: 
The future of American agriculture is largely dependent upon the 
boys and girls of to-day in our villages and rural communities, and it 
is essential that we should interest, instruct, and direct them in the 
possibilities of farming as a profitable and dignified profession. 
The boys’ and girls’ club movement is a definite effort by the 
United States Department of Agriculture, the state agricultural col- 
leges and other institutions to promote and encourage the increased 
production of farm crops at a reasonable cost on small areas and to 
offer a plan of vocational guidance by requiring the club members to 
master a complete crop operation. 
As a co-operative effort between the states and the United States 
Department of Agriculture this work began in Mississippi about nine 
years ago. Since that time there has been an increasing spirit of co- 
operation and a growing interest in better agriculture throughout the 
country, until now practically all the states have joined in this co- 
operative movement. 
Some OpjEcts OF THE CLUB WorK 
x. To secure an increased production of farm crops by encourag- 
ing more intensive farming and the best methods of soil-building, 
selection of seed, seed-testing, preparation of seed-bed, cultivation, etc. 
2. To encourage more economical use of products grown by the 
proper harvesting, storage, and feeding, and by canning the surplus 
of vegetables and fruits. 
3. To develop an interest in country life on the part of the boys 
and girls on the farm. 
4. To adapt the boy to his agricultural environment and to culti- 
vate self-expression within that environment. 
5. To teach the value of intellectual guidance, careful observation, 
and the need of a broader education for the farming population. 
6. To connect the work of the school with the work of the home. 
7. To furnish an easy approach, educationally, to all the interests 
of rural and village life. The club acre or plot should be the labora- 
tory for the club members and the demonstration plot for the farmer. 
The club work becomes the connecting-link between parent and 
teacher, farm and school, and forms a co-operative atmosphere in 
which rural pupils may be developed to the highest ideals of rural life. 
It is clearly the purpose of this organization to reach the boy and 
endeavor through instruction and direction in contests and friendly

tivalry to encourage a training which is “‘four-square,” viz.: the 
education of the head, heart, and hands, and the improvement of the 
health of the entire membership. 
THE ORGANIZATION 
Local clubs should be organized with officers such as president, 
vice-president, secretary, treasurer, supervisor, and program com- 
mittee. Arrangements should be made to hold one club meeting each 
month. A short and easily interpreted constitution and set of by- 
laws should be adopted. The program should be, first of all, in 
the interest of the particular club work. Debates may be held on 
the merits of different methods of cultivation, treatment for insects, 
diseases, etc., and as to the best kind of farm implements to be used. 
The secretary of the local club should send a report of the club meet- 
ing for each month to the state agent in charge of the club work. 
A complete enrolment of club members and their standing should 
be kept by the local club and a copy sent to the state agent, who will 
transmit a copy to the Federal Department of Agriculture at Wash- 
ington, D. C. 
RULES AND REQUIREMENTS 
The age requirement for the boys’ club work is from 10 to 18 
years, inclusive, and the club member must agree to follow instruc- 
tions, attend local and county meetings, make exhibits at the county 
fair or other institution convenient to the exhibitor, keep a record of 
expenses, income, observations, and work, and encourage others to 
enter the club work. At the close of the growing season he must also 
make out the regular crop report on the blank form furnished for this 
purpose by the Department of Agriculture, and transmit the same to 
the state agent in charge of the club work. 
There is no way in which the agricultural interest of pupils 
of the intermediate grades can be awakened and sustained to 
better effort than through the club work. For this reason 
it should form a large part of the course in agriculture for 
these grades.

Content.—The work in these grades begins to assume an 
economical and a scientific development. The club work 
should be continued and extended. Simple scientific princi- 
ples underlying successful methods of tillage may be taught 
and demonstrated in the laboratory and field. The econom- 
ical importance of good, pure seed, the loss due to impuri- 
ties, and the relation of seed vitality to high yields should be 
emphasized. 
The Laboratory Method.—The laboratory method ap- 
peals to pupils of this age, and should be freely used. The 
pupils should be encouraged to test their own and their neigh- 
bors’ seed-corn, to treat potatoes for scab, oats for smut, and 
to prepare spraying mixtures. Formulas and directions for 
this work can be secured from any state agricultural college 
or the United States Department of Agriculture. ” 
General Laboratory Rules.—Always perform the exercise 
before assigning it to pupils. 
Give simple, concise directions, avoiding technical terms 
with which they are not familiar. 
Use sketches for illustration, not for the mere purpose 
of making sketches. 
Require careful work and accurate systematic keeping of 
notes. 
Reports on exercises should contain the following points: 
Subject. 
Number of exercise. 
Subject of exercise. 
Materials and apparatus used. 
Manipulations. 
Results or conclusions. 
Name of person performing the exercise. 
Date.
-P-A-G-E-457
  AGRICULTURE ote 38 
It may also at times be advisable to require written com- 
positions in connection with the reports. 
After the exercises are completed questions should always 
be asked to bring out the important facts which should have 
been learned in performing the exercise. 
The application of these facts to present-day conditions 
should be discussed. 
These rules are general, and each person must make his 
own interpretations to suit existing conditions. No outline 
of work can be made to fit exactly more than one set of con- 
ditions. 
Suitable Exercises.—The following exercises are sugges- 
tive of some of the things that may be taught and the method 
of teaching. 
Exercise No. I

Per cent of air in soil. 
Materials: Glass tumblers, graduate, soil samples. 
Directions: Put 4 oz. (3% pint) of soil into the glass, using a differ- 
ent soil in each glass. Put an equal amount of water in the graduate 
and pour carefully into the glass until the water rises to the surface 
of the soil. Find how much water has been used, and do the same 
for all the soils. Record the results as follows:

tins published by the several agricultural colleges and state depart- 
ments of education. 
Rural and Urban Conditions.—Conditions obtaining in 
rural and urban communities are so very different that the 
same methods of teaching will not apply to both. Urban 
children are not acquainted with garden-vegetables and 
flowers, and their growth and development as well as the 
methods of planting and cultivation are at once both new and 
interesting, while rural children are familiar both with the 
plants themselves and the mechanical processes required in 
growing them. It is necessary, therefore, in the rural school 
to lay more stress upon the quality, use, and economic im- 
portance of the product. In fact, it may be well to push for- 
ward the work in the rural school, since the environment of 
the pupils furnishes much of the instruction which must be 
given in the urban school. It requires a greater knowledge 
of the subject and greater tact to teach agriculture success- 
fully in the rural than in the urban school.
-P-A-G-E-462
    
384 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
V. CORRELATION 
In the following discussion of the correlation of the dif- 
ferent subjects included in the common branches with agri- 
culture, teachers should bear in mind that we are not deal- 
ing with the methods of teaching the different subjects, 
but with how agriculture may be taught through these 
subjects. 
Reading.—For supplementary reading use nature and 
country-life poems and stories, newspaper and magazine 
articles, agricultural readers and government and state bulle- 
tins. These are all easily secured, and, while lending their aid 
in the teaching of agriculture, they will, if well chosen, furnish 
interesting subjects for reading and discussion, thus increas- 
ing the value of the reading lesson. This is true for all the 
grades, but particularly true of the intermediate and gram- 
mar grades where interest forms such an important factor in 
good reading. 
Many poems of James Whitcomb Riley, L. H. Bailey, 
John G. Whittier, and the prose compositions of Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, Louisa M. Alcott; and others, will help to in- 
crease the love of country life, dignify agricultural pursuits, 
and enrich the literary possession of each child. 
Writing.—So long as movement and form are the princi- 
pal objects sought and only exercises are used, writing, as a 
subject, or exercise, offers little opportunity for teaching 
agriculture. When the pupils have reached the word-and- 
sentence stage, however, a careful selection of words and sen- 
tences with reference to important underlying principles of 
agriculture is feasible. The following examples may prove 
suggestive: Agriculture, dairying, animal husbandry, horti- 
culture, pomology, entomology, etc. 
“The first farmer was the first man.” 
“Plow deep while sluggards sleep.”
-P-A-G-E-463
  AGRICULTURE 385 
“He that by the plow would thrive, 
Himself must either hold or drive.” 
“God Almighty first planted a garden.” 
“arth is here so kind, that just tickle her with a hoe. and she 
laughs with a harvest.” 
“When tillage begins, other arts follow.” 
Longer dictation or copying exercises may well be selected 
from country-life literature. 
Arithmetic.—No subject taught in the elementary school 
offers a richer field for correlation with agriculture than 
arithmetic, and this is equally true of all grades in the elemen- 
tary school. The laying out of the school-garden or home 
plot requires measurement, as well as the spacing of rows and 
planting in the row, and all offer practice in judging distances 
with the eye. The measuring of crops grown also brings in 
different forms of denominate numbers, etc. But this is 
using agriculture in the teaching of arithmetic rather than 
the teaching of agriculture through arithmetic. The latter 
can be done just as easily by making the arithmetic apply to 
home conditions. Suppose we have each pupil rule a sheet 
of paper and put in headings similar to the following, but fit- 
ting it to the particular community by omitting those that 
are not pertinent and including others that are of impor- 
tance. 
Have each pupil take home with him his sheet of ruled 
paper with the proper headings and, with the help of parents, 
fill in the first line after his own or his father’s name, similar 
to the example given. The next day have Johnny Jones read 
his data and all other pupils in the class fill in line one after 
Johnny Jones’s name; next Willie Smith may read his data 
and the class may write; and so on, until all have the com- 
plete data concerning the farms of the community, 7. ¢., ‘that 
portion of the community which is represented by the pupils.

    With these two sheets of paper in the hands of the pupils 
the teacher is ready to ask questions and frame problems. 
If these questions are well chosen the pupil will have the 
best sort of training in arithmetic, and at the same time ac- 
quire a great deal of valuable agricultural information which 
may lead to better practice in farming. 
Agricultural Arithmetic.—The following questions are sug- 
gested to show the possibilities in the use of this form of prac- 
tical arithmetic in teaching agriculture and at the same time 
the variety and number of problems it affords: 
1. What are the most productive crops of this community in order? 
2. Which crop yielded the greatest per cent on the investment on 
your own farm? In the community? 
3. If the grocer bought your tomato crop for (local price) per bushel 
and sold them at (- ) per quart, what would be his gain? 
4. For what price should you sell your potatoes in order to secure 
5 per cent interest on the investment, allowing regular farm 
prices for your labor? 
5. What was the labor income on your farm last year? 
6. If good seed-corn would increase the yield 10 bushels per acre, how 
many bushels would you have gained last year by using good 
seed? Upon this basis how much could you afford to pay for 
good, tested seed-corn? 
7. If depreciation in farm machinery amounts to 10 per cent, how 
much should you allow for machinery each year? 
8. If you sell one-third of your oats at market price, how much will 
they bring? If you receive a note in payment and discount 
it at the bank at regular local discount, what amount would 
you receive? 
g. At what expense can an old orchard of fifty trees be made to pro- 
duce apples that will compete with the best in the market?  
-P-A-G-E-469
AGRICULTURE 3 89 
Spelling—The use of names of seeds, plants, flowers, 
tools, etc., as they come into the experience of the pupil and 
will be used by farm folk in their business and personal letters, 
will help to familiarize them with agricultural terms and help 
them to spell words they will frequently use in writing. 
Geography.—Transportation of farm products calls for 
the use of bodies of water, as well as the building of railroads. 
Cities may be studied as centres of export and domestic 
trade. 
The study of population and races will account for cer- 
tain types of farming, as will also the study of mountains, 
valleys, and bodies of water. The pupil may also learn 
much in the formation of soils by the actions of glaciers, run- 
ning water, frost, etc. 
The study of geography should develop interesting discus- 
sion upon soil questions, as: Why is cattle-raising most prom- 
inent in the southwestern part of the United States? Why 
is market-gardening in New York and Massachusetts more 
profitable than in Arizona and New Mexico? Why are Ver- 
mont and Wisconsin great dairy states? Why does Maine 
grow potatoes instead of corn? Why are few sheep raised in 
the South? Why do not other states besides California and 
Florida grow oranges? 
History.—The history of any country should tell much of 
its agricultural accomplishments. The influence of important 
inventions and discoveries, the effect of war or pestilence, 
the change of political control, all these have a marked influ- 
ence upon agriculture. This is shown clearly in the follow- 
ing examples: The invention of the cotton-gin and the har- 
vester, the agricultural conditions existing in the Southern 
states after the Civil War, the changes in farming in the 
South due to the ravages of the cotton-boll weavil, the in- 
crease and decrease in wool-growing due to the changes in 
the tariff. These and many other facts in history will em- 
phasize the importance of agriculture, create greater interest, 
and explain some problems. 
 
-P-A-G-E-470
    
39° TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Grammar and Language Work.—Pupils will not only be- 
come interested in agriculture by writing about their farm 
experiences, but they learn the use of language most rapidly 
when discussing things with which they are familiar. All 
forms of written work in grammar and language offer excel- 
lent opportunities for increasing the knowledge of agricul- 
ture, from the letter requesting the sending of a seed cata- 
logue, the ordering of seed, the discussion on fertilization, 
cultivation, etc., to the completed story of “How I Grew 
My Crop.” 
Hygiene.—Hygiene in the elementary schools usually in- 
cludes more or less study of sanitation and hygiene. No 
problem on the farm is more important, and no subject offers 
greater opportunity for making the school work practical. 
Rural sanitation and personal hygiene need to be emphasized 
in all rural schools and if properly taught will help to solve 
the social and moral as well as the economic problems of the 
country. 
Why is typhoid more common in the country than in the 
city? Why is the average life of the farmer’s wife shorter 
than that of the business man’s wife? Why are epidemics 
more easily controlled in the city than in the country? . Why 
is tuberculosis increasing? What do the state boards of health 
reports say about the principal causes of death and illness of 
country people, and how may these evils be prevented? 
VI. PossrBILities AND LIMITATIONS 
The amount and the value of agriculture that may be 
taught will be determined almost entirely by the qualifica- 
tions of the teacher. Three things are necessary for the 
best results, viz.: 
1. Real interest in the subject and faith in its possibilities. 
2. Information on the subject matter to be taught. 
3. Ability to interest and instruct the pupils. 
A teacher cannot teach what he does not know, yet even 
more important than a knowledge of agriculture in the teach-

ing of that subject is a sympathetic attitude toward country 
life and its problems and an optimistic faith in its future. 
The teacher who thoroughly believes in the opportunities of 
the rural community and who desires to help mould its future 
may do much in his school to improve rural conditions, and 
by accepting opportunities can each year gain materially in 
his fund of agricultural information. Without this sympa- 
thetic attitude of mind and heart it were better to leave the 
teaching of agriculture to some one else. It is imperative 
that the teacher of agriculture realize his limitations. 
SUMMARY 
1. Agriculture is a fit subject for all grades, but the point of attack 
and the emphasis should depend upon the age and experience 
of the pupil. 
2. Agriculture forms a rational basis for the proper correlation of all 
school subjects. 
3- It offers direct means of connecting the home and the school. 
4. Its laboratory and field exercises create interest and teach accurate 
observation. 
5. It shows opportunities and establishes faith in rural life when 
taught by a sympathetic teacher who has the vision and who 
believes in it. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
1. Make a list of the bulletins from the U. S. Department of Agricul- 
ture and from the U. S. Bureau of Education that would be 
helpful in a school such as the one you are to teach in, either 
for pupils, teacher, or patrons. 
2. What other similar literature is available? 
3. What novels give high ideals of country life, similar to Herbert 
Quick’s “‘The Brown Mouse”? 
4. What is the best way to carry on and supervise club work in the 
summer? 
5. Is there a grange in your community? If so, learn what it does 
and could be made to do under skilful leadership ? 
6. What are some of the leading movements for the improvement of 
country life? 
7. Get up a harvest exhibit at your school and have judges and prizes 
for incentives.

PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
1. What subjects were most emphasized when you studied hygiene? 
2. What were the shortcomings of the course; what its strong points? 
3- From what ailments and defects do your pupils and your com- 
munity suffer most ? 
4. Are you familiar with the health statistics covering your com- 
munity or your state? 
5. How much teaching time has been lost in your schools per year 
on account of sickness of teachers? 
6. Have you ever examined your pupils, with a view of detecting 
and correcting serious physical defects? 
7. Are you identified with any of the health organizations in your 
community ? 
8. What health problems are at the front now in the attention of 
your health officers ? 
9. Do you make use of the large amount of current literature in mat- 
ters of health furnished, usually free, by state departments of 
public health and other public organizations and societies? 
to. Do you have books or magazines available that keep you in 
touch with the rapidly growing amount of knowledge in the 
field of diseases and their prevention? 
_I. Tue Ams AnD PROBLEMS 
The Subject.—In a strictly scientific sense, the field of 
physiology and hygiene is fairly well determined. In college 
and university courses, in spite of certain differences, the 
ground to be covered is a tolerably definite one. Advanced 
text-books for higher institutions or medical schools show a 
remarkable uniformity in the subject matter included. By 
this it is not meant that the science of hygiene is entirely 
separated from related fields of knowledge. Our divisions 
of knowledge into the several sciences, each with its own 
393 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
  394 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
name, is largely an arbitrary one, and is necessitated by the 
limitations of the human mind. The physiologist and hy- 
gienist, not unlike workers in other fields of investigation, 
must reach into related subjects at every turn, and the boun- 
daries of their special fields are often lost on the general map 
of scientific truths. 
But while the term hygiene, or physiology, has for the 
technical student of that subject a fairly definite connota- 
tion, the matter is entirely different with the same term when 
used to denote a subject of study, or a course in the curricu- 
lum of the average elementary and secondary schools. Here 
the term becomes so vague, is so wide in its application, that 
it is not far wrong to say there is not, to-day, among teachers 
in elementary and secondary schools any generally accepted 
consensus of opinion as to what this term should include. 
The organizing principle is not scientific classification, but 
life needs and learning abilities. Anatomy and morphology 
must be represented as needed, and if the teacher has had 
extended biological training, he will probably wish to supple- 
ment the bare anatomical details of human anatomy with 
brief and simple illustrations from the field of comparative 
animal morphology. Not infrequently the teacher who is 
familiar with microscopic technic emphasizes, as much as 
his time and equipment will permit him, the minute and his- 
tological structure of the tissues, and physiology is studied 
largely through the microscope. 
More recently, with the growing emphasis on matters of 
health, the elemental facts of bacteriology have been included. 
The nutrient plate for growing bacterial colonies and the 
tube culture for demonstration are finding their way even 
into the courses of our elementary schools. Teachers having 
in mind the more practical results of instruction in health, 
not infrequently take most of their subject matter from the 
field of preventive medicine itself, and discuss with some 
detail the causes and the methods of prevention of the com- 
mon diseases. Hygiene in the elementary and. secondary

  HYGIENE 395 
schools has come under the influence of the newer functional 
emphasis in education, and already voices have been raised 
in protest against much of the older content of the subject. 
The part given to anatomy and physiology has been abridged; 
the histological portion has been almost wholly eliminated, 
the purely physiological discussion of function much reduced, 
and the entire emphasis placed on strictly utilitarian ends, 
the promotion of health and normal physical development. 
Instruction is demanded in all matters of practical sanitation, 
and problems of health and disease are to be discussed to 
make for better physical efficiency. As the direct returns 
are not so evident with much of the purely physiological 
subject matter, such as circulation, excretion, etc., these 
topics are all to be greatly abridged. 
New Significance.—The topics of digestion and, nutrition 
are also to be treated with a new significance. One of the 
fundamental economic problems is that of food; and hunger 
is held by the modern school to be one of the few elemental 
social forces determining society. It is pointed out that to 
be well nourished is the larger part of being physically sound. 
To it much of disease is the result of improper distribution of 
food, resulting in want, or perhaps in waste, and brought 
about not only by poverty, but more frequently by ignorance 
of dietary matters. It is, therefore, demanded that the 
schools shall deal thoroughly with the composition of foods, 
their physiological value, their proper preparation, and their 
digestion and nutrition, in order that such foods may-yield 
their maximum nourishment to the body, and that the ex- 
pensive food-supply be intelligently conserved. Already 
“nutritional physiologies” are appearing in increased num- 
bers in the book market. 
Finally, there are those especially interested in sociological 
problems who desire that the teacher of hygiene shall not 
fail to show that the newer education and the newer sociology 
rest in no small part on biological foundations. Physical 
development and heredity figure largely, at present, in all 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
  396 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
discussions of human behavior. The treatment of the de- 
linquent and the criminal has greatly changed with the grow- 
ing notion that flesh and blood have something to do with 
their acts. In education the normal and the subnormal are 
no longer so generally forced through the same moulds. Ped- 
agogy, psychology, and sociology are more and more realizing 
the importance of the physiological antecedents that deter- 
mine human character. It is becoming clearer that many 
reactions supposed at one time to be purely “mental” or 
“normal” are in reality conditioned by physiological states 
entirely chemical or physical in their nature. Mental de- 
fects, criminality, and delinquency of all forms are, therefore, 
being studied more and more as forms of disease, and the 
correcting of such defects is not infrequently accomplished 
through hygienic methods. In fact, it is only very recently 
that science has really undertaken to study in a fundamental 
way the nature of human behavior. Surely some of the sim- 
pler but still far-reaching conclusions in this field will find an 
appropriate place in the teaching of hygiene, even in the 
elementary upper grades. 
II. Tue TEACHING oF HYGIENE 
Teaching vs. Hearing Lessons in Hygiene.—Whatever 
their shortcomings, the claims for hygiene as stated above 
have at least this in their favor: they are positive pro- 
grams advanced by teachers and writers having a dynamic 
interest in the subject. Unfortunately, there remains a class 
of teachers who have no objective point to reach in their in- 
struction in the subject. They follow the prescribed outline 
or adopted text-book with servile conformity. The recita- 
tion, although apparently in common English, is nevertheless ~ 
educationally in a foreign jargon of scientific terms and alien 
ideas. Sanitation is discussed in an insanitary school build- 
ing, without discovery of the inconsistency; and the bookish 
discussion of fresh air goes on in an ill-ventilated classroom. 
The children suffer from many preventable ailments and

HYGIENE 397 
defects before the unseeing eyes of such teachers. The truths 
they present have no pragmatic consequences. They do not 
affect conduct in thought or action when the course is over. 
Such have preached no gospel, launched no campaign, and 
given no new visions of things that ought to be, in matters of 
physical well-being, either individual or for the race. 
The many and divergent claims pressed upon the teacher 
of hygiene by experts in this field can obviously not all 
be well met. The program is too big. Neither the time 
allotted, the customary training of the teacher, nor the ma- 
turity of the pupils will permit such a varied emphasis. It is 
necessary that these matters be carefully sifted in order that 
we may know what is reasonable and proper in the way of 
health knowledge, habits, and ideals to put into the courses 
of elementary and secondary schools, assuming that the great 
majority of the pupils will get no formal instruction in this 
field after leaving these schools. In such a study, portions of 
the subject of physiology should not be excluded merely 
because they are old and have formed a part of the traditional 
content of instruction, nor should the multiplicity of the 
newer things in this and related sciences be included merely 
because they are new. Knowledge, habits, and ideals that 
are fundamental to health and normal physical development 
are the only minimal essentials which have a right to appear 
in the brief hurried course of the common schools. Other 
values, such as training in the scientific attitude and habit 
of mind, can also be developed, but will be kept contributory 
to the main purpose. 
The New and the Old.—It has just been stated that it is 
not a matter of oldness or newness that determines the value 
of a fact. It is of importance only that the thing be true 
and worth while. And yet there is a quality to newer ideas 
that gives them greater carrying power. A field of study, 
now under active investigation, engaging the interests of 
many minds, has a vitality, other things being equal, that is 
not so easily imparted to older settled facts from which cur-
-P-A-G-E-484
398 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
rent interest has more or less departed. The “‘firing-line” 
in any subject is the most inspiring part of that subject to 
teach, and, no doubt, to learn. The very fact that knowl- 
edge is not yet complete, that gaps still appear, that explana- 
tions are not yet always forthcoming, produce the very atmos- 
phere of the healthy, inquiring mind. There is no formal 
rubbish, dried and cut into educational bundles, that can for 
a moment compare with the stirring questions now at the 
front. This is the sport of hunting live game. This is the 
interest in to-day’s news rather than yesterday’s paper. This 
is also the heart of the scientific attitude of mind. 
The purpose of the instruction in hygiene is, no less than 
in other sciences, to awaken an intelligent interest in its 
problems, strong enough to carry their study beyond the 
period of formal instruction, and vital enough to command 
the will to translate this knowledge into appropriate actions. 
In few subjects is this freshness of knowledge so accessible as 
in this field. The great amount of research is bringing new 
facts to light almost daily, and the public interest in matters 
of health and disease soon makes these discoveries current 
information. 
Problems of sanitation are being concretely worked out 
by many cities, and movements for safeguarding the public 
health may be studied at first hand in practically every com- 
munity. A great amount of literature is now being sent out 
by various organizations to educate the public in matters of 
health. The health departments of the various states are 
becoming more and more aggressive in their campaigns for 
better things, and the teacher who will seize the opportunities 
of keeping in touch with these various agencies all at work in 
his line, can command an amount of dynamic educational 
energy that will save his course from slavish bookishness and 
empty results. 
What to Teach.—Remembering that hygiene is not yet, 
and probably never will be, a conventionalized subject, with 
static, accepted, and traditional content, it becomes neces- 
 
-P-A-G-E-485
HYGIENE 399 
sary for the teacher to review the possibilities before him, to 
examine critically the claims of experts or the programs of 
enthusiasts in some cause, and then with the limitations of 
his situation clearly in mind, to formulate a plan of work, 
which for him shall seem most promising in its results. What 
to teach and how to teach in this field of hygiene will, there- 
fore, remain a problem that each instructor must in part 
solve for himself. Too many factors enter into effective 
teaching to make it possible to anticipate all in any general 
plan. The teacher’s own interests soon outweigh other mat- 
ters, and facts and ideas that express convictions of the in- 
structor will soon displace the merely academic opinions 
which are a part of his physiological baggage. In education, 
as in warfare, the telling impact of a missile depends not only 
upon the quality of the metal hurled, but also upon the 
carrying momentum imparted to it. There is, therefore, 
much danger in singling out a series of facts as the facts to 
teach. There is no surer way of taking the life of a subject 
than by strangling it in this manner. No small part of the 
delight of the teacher of science comes from his appreciation 
that nature is infinite at every point, that there are no boun- 
daries to his subject save those imposed upon it by his own 
lack of knowledge, and that even with his limited vision he 
may look at facts from many angles and marshal them into 
innumerable new forms. 
The sciences in the past have suffered from overstandard- 
ization. There have been too many ready-formed outlines 
which have tended to rob the teacher of his initiative and the 
subject of its freshness. A science is entirely too large to 
make any pupil in the elementary or secondary school appre- 
ciate its logical coherence. That is for the scholar in the 
subject. The health, recreational, and physical development 
needs of pupils and parents set the problems for organizing 
the work. Minimal essentials here are desirable. 
The Problem and Service View-Point.—The undergrad- 
uate must approach the new subject with the attitude of the

explorer, the discoverer, and the solver of life’s principal prob- 
lems, such as health and the others mentioned in Chapter I. 
He will be helped most, not by learning the answers to formal 
questions imposed arbitrarily upon him, but by charting his 
unknown seas and continents and solving the problems him- 
self from the facts before him. He may have little interest 
in the prescribed syllabus, but he is quite willing to be an 
incipient sanitary engineer. To make a sanitary survey of a 
part of his neighborhood seems to him to be a real man’s 
work. To report on some epidemic of disease ravaging his 
own community is a real investigation to him. To study 
the milk-supply problem of his own city and to learn for him- 
self how he may detect unsatisfactory milk is the proper start 
to make of him later a citizen who will intelligently enforce 
the provisions of the pure-food laws. A very valuable ser- 
vice could be rendered not only to the individual pupils, but 
to the community behind them, by instructing them in the 
actual handling of disinfectants, to learn experimentally how 
to make the proper solutions, and how to apply them under 
varying conditions. The public very much needs such in- 
structions. Much of what goes for fumigation and disinfec- 
tion is worse than worthless; it gives a false sense of security, 
besides being a sheer waste of money. With our newer 
knowledge that contagion is largely a matter of direct contact 
with infected objects, mouth spray, milk, etc., disinfection 
becomes a more definite procedure. To have a few sterile 
plates put into his hands with which to examine the bacterial 
composition of the air of the open room and of the closed 
room, to measure even in his simple way the infectious na- 
ture of the breath of others we breathe when conditions are 
unfavorable, is not only to inform him, but it is to capture 
his will to use this information for valuable ends. 
The physiology of respiration and the problem of the 
“stuffy”? room lend themselves well to first-hand study.!

Two simple thermometers suffice for testing the whole matter 
of humidity and temperature. By keeping one bulb mois- 
tened and the other dry, we have a fine experiment to deter- 
mine what difference in temperature between the two ther- 
mometers makes the air most comfortable, and what the 
réles of humidity and temperature are in the problem of fresh 
air. The newly invented hair hygrometer with the thermom- 
eter attached gives both the temperature and the percentage 
of moisture by direct reading, the same as a clock. To have 
the pupil determine for himself, for instance, that with his 
body enclosed:in the stuffy atmosphere of a box, closet, or 
room, the discomfort remains even when he may breathe 
through a hole or tube furnishing fresh air, while with his 
body in fresh air he may continue to breathe the bad air of 
the enclosed room without discomfort—this is to have him 
learn with a new interest what the whole problem of ventila- 
tion is. If this experiment seems childish at first glance, let 
it be remembered that just such experiments in the hands © 
of physiologists have recently shown the fallacy that bad air 
is a problem of the chemical changes of respired air, “lack 
of oxygen and increase of carbon dioxide,” and have proved 
that the puzzle of the stuffy room is to be solved rather in 
the physical changes of the enclosed air and the bacterial 
infection of the room. Neither increase of carbon dioxide 
nor decrease of oxygen are influential in ordinary ventilation, 
but the essential factors seem to be relative humidity, tem- 
perature, and movement of the air. The amount of exercise 
of the occupants also determines real, or cell, ventilation. 
Here the teacher may experimentally lay the groundwork 
for a further very profitable discussion of the merits of vari- 
ous proposed systems of ventilation for homes, public build- 
ings, and public conveyances, and of exercise, than which 
there are few problems of greater hygienic importance to us 
all. In this field will be found the only effective campaign 
against consumption and kindred diseases.’

402 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
In the matter of foods and the process of their digestion, 
there is at the disposal of the informed teacher a series of 
experiments so simple in their manipulation and so free from 
technical chemical terminology that they are entirely in place 
in the elementary school. The digestive ferments may be 
bought for a nominal price at any drug-store, and the process 
from starch to final sugars, and from proteins to peptones, 
and even beyond to the aminoacid end-blocks, may be viewed 
step by step and demonstrated by the simplest confirmatory 
tests. The details for such a series of experiments may be 
found described in practically any modern text-book on phys- 
iology and would be out of place in this discussion.! 
TI. Virariry AND REALITY 
Reality vs. Technical Words.—The involved drawings 
purporting to show the anatomy of the nervous system or 
other organs should give way altogether in primary schools 
to actual demonstrations. Not infrequently the author of 
such an elementary text will include a drawing of the finer 
architecture of brain and cord paths that can be really in- 
telligible only to a trained biologist, and means nothing to a 
child save a curious puzzle of lines. A frog with the brain 
pithed will explain more about reflex actions and the relation- 
ship of cord and centre than innumerable drawings without 
some concrete verification. The pupil whose time is taken 
to study the brain or eye has a right to study them in the 
only way that ever yields educational returns—he has the 
right to study these as real things, and not as shadowy sym- 
bols in words. When for any reason the actual things them- 
selves may not be had, it would be better in many cases to 
omit such assignments altogether and proceed to other work 
with more substantial returns. The pupil interested in his 
camera, will be equally or more interested in its counterpart 
in the eye. To handle the crystalline lens of a beef’s eye,

HYGIENE 403 
to observe its elasticity and its manner of attachment to the 
muscles of accommodation, and to have a few simple experi- 
ments with improvised lenses, is to give the child a living 
knowledge of the laws of vision, that may lead to intelligent 
study of the care for his eyesight and that of those later 
dependent upon him. The defective vision among school- 
children, which not infrequently seriously handicaps them in 
their development, often remains uncorrected because of the 
indifference of parents or guardians whose knowledge of the 
delicate structure of the eye or of practical eye hygiene has 
never gone beyond the conventional drawing of the eyeball 
in the text. 
The possible experimental field in the study of the special 
senses is very great and admirably adapted to the elementary 
school. To test the acuteness of the sense of touch or pres- 
sure, to locate hot and cold spots on skin, to determine how 
judgments of size, distance, direction, color, perspective, and 
form arise, is to give to the pupil a chance to try the method 
of science as well as a background for hygienic and happy 
living. ; 
In thus emphasizing the value of the experimental method 
in the teaching of hygiene, it may be well to note clearly 
that the heart of an experiment is by no means merely the 
handling of concrete things. An elaborate experiment may 
be almost as valueless as a formal bookish discussion of its 
terminology. It may be so covered up with directions and 
recipes that it enslaves as much as any arbitrary outline to 
be memorized. The heart of an experiment is the problem- 
atic situation with the mental attitude which it calls out. If 
this attitude is one of independent discovery and exploration, 
motivated by a genuine interest to know the truth in the 
question, it is an experiment of a high educational order, no 
matter how simple the apparatus or how elementary the 
mechanical execution. A gilt frame does not make a picture 
a work of art, nor do glassware and costly apparatus make a 
scientific laboratory. As the elementary schools are now.
-P-A-G-E-494
404 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
organized and furnished, it would be asking of the teacher 
the impossible to give the instruction in hygiene under the 
conditions of a well-equipped high school laboratory. The 
concrete work must fit into the complex program of the 
day, with its many demands upon the teacher’s time and 
strength, and the experiments must be such that they may 
readily be at his fingers’ ends. 
Fortunately, the fundamental things in science are as a 
tule the very ones that react under simplest conditions. 
Then, too, it is by no means necessary that this concrete 
work should be a daily exercise. A telling experiment needs 
discussion and amplification; and, when possible, its obvious 
deductions should be made. At this point the text or other 
supplementary reference reading may be used to enrich the 
observation or verify the results. When all is done, a care- 
ful writing in good English of the entire procedure and its 
conclusions is most valuable, not only for the science directly 
concerned, but as a training in language expression. It will 
always remain true that the first requisite in using good 
English, as well as in teaching it, is to have something worth 
while to say. 
Knowledge of Great Discoveries in the Field of Hygiene. 
—Finally, there are the classic experiments, which have 
paved the way to discoveries. These, of course, cannot be 
duplicated in the elementary school, but they may be studied 
historically to great advantage. To show how the truths of a 
science became known and to follow some of its epoch-making 
chapters is in a way to participate in the original investiga- 
tion. Here the teacher of hygiene will find rich material. 
Only a few instances need be mentioned. The life and 
work of Pasteur show in almost dramatic form the discovery 
of the modern germ theory of disease. The problem of yel- 
low fever and the relation of the mosquito to it receive a new 
interest in the story of Doctor Reed and his associates, the 
American investigators who definitely proved the manner of 
the transmission of this disease, one of them sacrificing his own
-P-A-G-E-495
HYGIENE 405 
life in the course of the investigation. In a similar way the 
researches of Ross on the cause of malaria will certainly 
enlist the pupils’ interest in man’s struggle to conquer disease. 
The achievements in the Panama Canal Zone have attracted 
the favorable attention of the whole world, and have greatly 
strengthened the hope that our modern knowledge of disease 
and its carriers may soon reclaim for civilization much of the 
tropical lands, and so enlarge materially the habitable world. 
A simple account of the campaign, now nation-wide, against 
tuberculosis, by the agencies of the open-air schools for 
anemic and consumptive children, the fresh-air camps and 
sanatoria, the stricter tenement laws of our cities, and by 
many other means—all this would tend to give the instruc- 
tion dynamic qualities. 
We must, of course, remember that the advanced methods 
of instruction of the colleges and universities, through their 
journal clubs and seminaries, may not be imposed upon the 
immature pupils of the grades or even high school. Our 
lower schools have not infrequently suffered because some 
teacher, fresh from the higher institutions, has attempted to 
transplant the curriculum of the university and to graft 
the methods of the college upon the lower school. Such edu- 
cational mistakes cannot maintain themselves long. But it 
is equally wrong to go to the other extreme and deny the 
elementary school any participation in those methods which 
give to higher instruction its freshness and its vitality. The 
teacher of the upper grades and of the high school may, with 
the greatest profit to his class, report to his pupils the result 
of current investigations, and keep them informed, strictly 
within the limits of their immaturer powers of comprehension, 
of the status of some of the important problems, now so vig- 
orously attacked for their solution. To keep in touch with 
the world’s work in the field under discussion is for the 
younger pupil as truly an educational right as for the maturer 
college student, provided only that his touch be in terms that 
he can understand.
-P-A-G-E-496
  406 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
By this historical method the teacher may bring into his 
own schoolroom the very experiments and spirit of masters 
without the impossible task of performing them anew. When 
the experimental data of striking or important truths are too 
involved for the pupil, it is still good teaching to have him 
see some of the conclusions reached. Such interesting prob- 
lems now current as the influence of the internal secretions in 
chemically regulating our physiological processes, may be 
made sufficiently clear to any pupil who has been asked by 
his text-book to study secretions at all. The psychic influ- 
ence of gastric secretion, and the variability in the composi- 
tion of the digestive liquids to conform to the changes in the 
food—these may be touched upon with a reasonable assur- 
ance of interest and profit. 
IV. Experm™MentTaL HycreNnr 
Purpose of Study of Experimental Hygiene.—There has 
thus been sketched briefly, merely by way of illustration, 
what a wealth of subject matter above the narrow and 
formal limits of his conventional text-book, the teacher of 
physiology and hygiene may command, if he will. If it be 
argued that such excursions out of the beaten track will make 
it impossible to cover the traditional ground, then let a new 
valuation be made to determine the desirability of following 
that path. There may be much that had better be passed by 
altogether. May we as teachers not sometime discover what 
a heavy load of useless educational baggage we ask the pupil 
to carry in his march through the schools? Luckily, not 
much of it will stick on his shoulders, but drops off because 
it is not fastened to anything. It has been merely piled on. 
Herein lies many a helpless child’s protection against an 
overburdened course. As in the matter of food, so in the 
matter of knowledge, it is not what we gather, nor what we 
swallow, nor yet what we digest, it is only that which we 
assimilate that builds tissue. It is not the truths we hear 
nor those we remember merely, nay, nor those which we par-
-P-A-G-E-497
HYGIENE 407 
tially understand—it is those which having been heard, 
remembered, and understood, are mentally assimilated and 
vitalized into conduct and action energized by an aroused 
emotion behind them. 
The Teaching Aim.—This suggests a brief word about the 
aims which should motivate instruction in this field. There 
is no doubt that when physiology and hygiene was added to 
the school curriculum it was for the very definite purpose of 
safeguarding human life. Its aim was clear and unequivo- 
cal. The value of health as an asset needed no argument. 
Health is at the bottom of practically every human good. 
It is the great asset no less of an individual than of a people. 
It is the index of a thousand other virtues that follow in its 
train. -Like all perfectly obvious truths, this regard for the 
value of health and physical efficiency was always acknowl- 
edged, but it has only in recent years received the careful and 
critical attention that promises more concerted efforts for 
better things in this matter. 
Anything, therefore, that is calculated to promote correct 
physical living is proper subject matter for this branch of in- 
struction, provided only that it is fitted to the pupils’ power to 
comprehend intelligently and is more valuable than anything 
else that could be used in the time at our disposal. But such 
subject matter should not, in the upper grades at least, con- 
sist in the main of empirical rules to be followed unquestion- 
ingly. There is in all human nature a tendency to resist an 
arbitrary rule, but we all bow obediently to the consequences 
of facts once clearly discerned. ‘To understand, even in part, 
just what physicians or sanitarians are attempting to do, and 
what the methods are which they employ, is far more practi- 
cal in the long run than giving their formal conclusions only 
and attempting to reduce them to blind memory. It were 
well if physicians could more frequently instruct their pa- 
tients; and already there are signs that medical men of the 
future will not be so exclusively confined in their practice 
to the “curing” of this or that disease, but will be community

leaders in campaigns of education for a better public health, 
as well as an aid in time of trouble. In the meantime, the 
teacher is the most available agent to prepare the way even 
for the scientific physician himself. 
The patient who is advised to take the serum treatment 
for typhoid fever, for example, has a right to know what the 
point to this procedure is, and upon what scientific explana- 
tion it rests. Not only the patient but the community, too, 
should understand the physical reasons for such a course of 
treatment. In the case of hydrophobia there are innumer- 
able superstitions current in almost every neighborhood. 
Some of these superstitions are so formidable as to interfere 
with the methods of relief. The Pasteur treatment is prob- 
ably a complete mystery to the patient. He follows it, half 
hopeful, half sceptical. Has not the pupil in school the 
right to have this explained in the simplest of terms? The 
fundamental conceptions about acquired immunity are not 
too involved for the upper grades. They are in bold outline 
little more than the observations already familiar to him in 
a number of diseases, that one attack of a disease tends to 
make the person more or less immune to a second. It is not 
necessary to go into the minute and confusing details about 
the many kinds of antibodies. There is no necessity to 
talk about “side-chains” and “receptors” and ‘‘comple- 
ments.” The teacher who knows the child’s mind will not 
make this mistake. But the general conception of antibodies 
is no more difficult than the matter of pancreatic secretions. 
The boy or girl on whose farm the cattle have been offi- 
cially inspected and tested for tuberculosis should be told 
by his teacher of hygiene what it all means, without entering 
upon the technical theories about it. How the school physi- 
cian tests the throat for diphtheria, and how a positive test 
looks when incubated, are problems easily comprehended. 
When they learn that health officials may take a few droplets 
of blood to determine if the patient has typhoid fever, it must 
surely awaken in their minds a genuine curiosity as to how
-P-A-G-E-499
HYGIENE 409 
such a thing can be done. They know that it is done, for the 
local physician has perhaps made several such tests, but the 
procedure is entirely meaningless. 
And yet the test may be explained in a few minutes to 
any mature pupil, so that he will not only see its scientific 
reason but appreciate in a new way what cure and recovery 
really mean. The student should know what the antitoxin 
is, how, in a general way, it was produced, and what the in- © 
jection of it is meant to do. If the community of the future 
is to be saved from the follies of quack remedies, advertised 
“cures,” and ancient superstitions, it will be because it has 
learned what medicines can do, and what they cannot do. 
The modern treatment for disease, with vaccines, or sera, or 
bacterins, may be far from satisfactory and leave much to be 
desired, but a simple, popular understanding of them will 
forever make impossible the blind reasoning that, inasmuch 
as they do not know what causes a disease, there is no tell- 
ing what may cure it. Thus the absurdest vagaries receive 
a sympathetic hearing. Our popular vice in the indiscrimi- 
nate use of ‘‘sure cures” flourishes, in large part, because the 
scientific explanations of our achievements in preventive 
and curative medicine have been generally withheld from 
the public. The dry bones of anatomy and physiology have 
been studied instead of the science and art of health and 
hygiene. ‘ 
Health Data to be Utilized—The inexorable law of cause 
and effect in the field of disease may be frequently obscured 
in the individual case, but it may be shown in the composite 
picture of the vital statistics of a community or state. Such 
vital statistics, if accurately made and correctly interpreted, 
and then compared from time to time, give a moving pic- 
ture of the greatest significance. They show in what direc- 
tion things are moving and which forces are gaining. Such 
vital statistics may be a social chess-board on which the move- 
ments of cause and effect may be followed. It is a handicap 
to health officers that the public so generally is unable to see 
 
-P-A-G-E-500
410 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
in these statistics little more than the red tape of prescribed 
reports. To enable the maturer pupil to read beneath and 
between the numbers of such reports, and to sense the drift 
of society in the important matters shown by these official 
records, is to perform a service well worth place in the health 
instruction of any school. 
V. BROADENING THE SCOPE 
Scholarship and a Broader View.—In the foregoing it has 
been the aim to indicate to the teacher how rich and varied 
is the field from which he may draw his material. If it seems 
that these suggestions assume too much scholarship or train- 
ing on the part of the teacher, it still remains that to the 
growing instructor these suggestions may at least stimulate 
him toward further study on his own part. There are few 
things in education that so vitally affect for good the work 
of a school as an aggressive and growing scholarship pos- 
sessed by the teacher. For him who is inadequately trained 
and who is indifferent about it there is no help. It is believed 
that the examples here given are indicative of a class with 
which many, perhaps most, teachers are not entirely un- 
familiar. However, it remains true that these suggestions of 
how hygiene may perhaps be taught more effectively, are 
offered not because they will make the ascent easier for the 
instructor, but because it is hoped they will lead to lookout 
points, where the view is clearer and more commanding. 
Sex Hygiene and Sex Education.—There has recently 
come under increased discussion another phase of hygienic 
instruction not yet referred to here. This is instruction in 
so-called sex-hygiene. Of the necessity of safeguarding the 
young against evil influences, only too apparent almost every- 
where, there can be no question. Just how this may be best 
accomplished is the only thing in controversy. The public 
and formal teaching of sex-hygiene is unfortunately still an 
uncharted sea. Before we are fully informed about it, it will 
have to be tried out by wise and capable experimenters under
-P-A-G-E-501
HYGIENE 4IL 
conditions that will test its weakness and its strength. In 
the meantime the instructor genuinely concerned about the 
higher welfare of the pupils under his care, need not be pas- 
sive in this matter. In emergencies it is still possible for the 
teacher to extend a friendly but warning hand to some boy 
who seems to be losing his moorings, or to take the part of a 
bigger sister to the thoughtless girl ignorant of her directions. 
This individual counsel and the maintenance of a wholesome 
and moral tone in all the activities of the school will be found 
to accomplish much, and will be free from those possible dan- 
gers that lie in the formal public discussions of this theme, 
so easily ill-timed and so readily misunderstood. The purely 
biological facts may be presented in connection with the 
study of plants and lower animals, and the pupil himself be 
trusted to translate all this into higher terms. 
Scientific Temperance, Drugs, and Narcotics.—The prob- 
lem of teaching ‘‘scientific temperance” and the effects of 
drugs and narcotics also demands a wise caution on the part 
of the instructor. So much careful research work has been 
done recently in this field that the teacher should familiarize 
himself with the actual results obtained. These are suffi- 
ciently positive to permit a vigorous campaign against all 
forms of intemperance on the strictest physiological grounds. 
But this newer knowledge will save him from those loose 
statements, often lurid and exaggerated, which tend to bring 
into discredit the substantial facts themselves. Not only 
medicine, but business, factories, and shops have all spoken 
in unmistakable terms about the inefficiency of the user of 
alcohol, and indicated his gradual elimination from all fields 
of responsibility, and this not so much for sentimental or 
moral reasons as for the cold physiological and economic 
reason that a drinker’s services do not pay. 
Formal and Informal Health Instruction.—There still re- 
mains to the teacher the question how the instruction in 
hygiene shall be apportioned to the different grades of the 
elementary school. The customary plan to defer formal in-
-P-A-G-E-502
  412 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
struction in these subjects to the sixth, seventh, and eighth 
grades is probably a wise one. But much may be done in an 
incidental way in the lower grades. The simple lessons of 
cleanliness, the care of the mouth and teeth, the ordinary 
habits of correct living, the insistence on fresh air, all these 
should be demanded of the children, until obedience to them 
is naturally and cheerfully given. Learning to do by doing 
at home and at school, with incidental explanation, is the 
principle here—that of habit formation. With advancing 
grades the reasons or scientific principles underlying these 
demands may be more systematically presented. Correlated 
with other lines of work, hygienic or sanitary matters may be . 
introduced, and an open period now and then to present mat- 
ters of timely interest or necessity will enable the teacher to 
lay a basis for the formal instruction of the upper grades. In 
this the instructor cannot go far astray; if informed himself, 
he remembers that the minimum essentials are at least two. 
The pupils should have first such a knowledge of the location, 
structure, and function of the important organs as to appre- 
ciate that the body is an organism able to flourish only in 
obedience to definite and rational natural laws. The pupil 
is not to be a surgeon, he is not to be a physiologist; thou- 
sands of details may be spared him. But he is entitled to 
the vision even in his simple exercises in hygiene, that law 
and order prevail in living tissues, and so enable him later 
to sense the distinction between a fact of life, and the many 
current superstitions. In the second place, the pupil should 
learn enough of the problems of hygiene, sanitation, and the 
fight against disease to understand the value of efforts in this 
direction, and to give intelligent support to all worthy move- 
ments of society which have for their object the conservation 
of life. In the securing of these practical results the inspir- 
ing teacher will find that he has been dealing with subject 
matter capable of yielding not only valuable scientific train- 
ing, educative in broad and liberal ways, but he will be 
laying the foundations that will give us a new generation of
-P-A-G-E-503
HYGIENE 413 
better-informed men and women, who will in a more insistent 
and telling way carry forward a great social campaign for 
longer and more effective living. 
The New Campaign for. Longer and More Effective Liv- 
ing.—The hopes of a forward movement in matters of health 
test upon two things: In the first place we must wrest from 
nature a knowledge of the conditions of disease, their causes 
and their prevention. This is the function of investigation 
and research. It is the work that devolves upon universi- 
ties and scholars everywhere, who are attacking at first hand 
the unknown borderland before us. 
Surely no one can find fault with the achievements in this 
field. Few investigations, if any, have yielded such brilliant 
and such important returns as those which have to do with 
disease and preventive medicine. Liberal appropriations have 
been forthcoming to push our knowledge further and to gain 
new insight into problems still unsolved. Every person in- 
terested in better living conditions should regard with the 
greatest favor and concern every encouragement given to 
research and investigation. In spite of the achievements of 
the past, new light is sorely needed on many points. We are 
still largely in the dark about cancer. Even with diseases 
now partly understood there remain innumerable secondary 
questions which wait upon further study. 
In the second place, all hopes for a forward movement in 
matters of health rest upon the proper and intelligent dis- 
semination of this knowledge given us by the scholars. Sci- 
ence comes, but habits linger. Here our achievements have 
not had the success naturally following research and investi- 
gation. Our expert knowledge is many, many years ahead 
of the interpretation and appreciation of this knowledge by 
the general public. 
The gap between the research laboratory and the general 
public is at present too wide for the dynamic spark to leap. 
Our regrettable situation is due, not so much to the lack of 
expert knowledge of what should be done as to our inability 
 
-P-A-G-E-504
  4I4 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
to have this knowledge exert its full influence in the actual 
world of affairs. The real problem, then, before us is to find 
agencies that shall bridge this gap. We have many such 
agencies at hand. The magazines, the health departments of 
newspapers, the public health lecture, and so on, may all 
serve this valuable purpose, even though at present they 
often fail to do so. 
The most effective agent, however, is the teacher. . It is he 
who must in large part carry the program of the scholar to 
society. It is thus of the utmost importance that the teacher 
should understand the high function that is his. 
Since even the best systems of medical supervision, using 
both nurses and physicians for inspection, examination, and 
follow-up work, require a great deal of teacher supervision of 
pupils while nurses and physicians are not in the classrooms, 
it is necessary that teachers inform themselves on the prin- 
cipal symptoms of ailments and defects and be on the watch 
for them. The state of New York, through the State Educa- 
tion Department, helps teachers to meet this responsibility 
by furnishing each with the following chart of signs of ill- 
health and physical defects which teachers may well keep 
before them, and use in safeguarding the health of the chil- 
dren in their charge. Copies in the form of cards to lay on the 
teacher’s desk may be had by writing to the above depart- 
ment at Albany, N. Y. 
In matters of health there are certain things that are cry- 
ing for immediate attention. From one-seventh to one-tenth 
of the entire community dies from tuberculosis alone, and 
this a disease not only easily curable in its incipient stages, 
but readily preventable altogether, if we could only set the 
proper social machinery in operation to deal with this scourge. 
Typhoid fever, so generally prevalent, could not exist in a 
community thoroughly informed and aroused in matters of 
simple sanitation and sewage disposal. The frightful infant 
mortality could be greatly reduced if we could but im- 
press upon the public simple rules of health for little chil-

tional results. Thousands of school children sit through 
their years of study handicapped by physical defects which 
could be readily corrected if indifferent fathers or mothers 
could only be made, to understand in a convincing way their 
duty in the matter.) 
Homes and public buildings, street-cars and trains are 
still often superheated, ill-ventilated, and are prolific breeders 
and spreaders of disease, because people fail to understand
-P-A-G-E-506
  
416 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the simple physiology of respiration. Our cities tolerate 
dirty streets and dust-laden atmospheres because the average 
citizen does not know their final effects. Perhaps we cannot 
blame the ordinary man when he is not deeply sensitive to 
the possibilities of infection around him, when he has never 
seen a pathogenic germ, nor witnessed the simplest experiment 
with bacteriological cultures. To him too frequently the 
warnings of the health official seem little more than the at- 
tempts to frighten him with imaginary bogies. It is alto- 
gether different with the informed person who has seen these 
yagencies of infection in actual concrete outline before him. 
Disease and its consequences are such terrible realities, and 
the love of life and health is so strong and so universal, that 
we are assuredly correct in believing that society, once thor- 
oughly informed by the concrete facts presented to it, will 
not hesitate to put in operation the entire social machinery 
to achieve the desired results. To bring this fortunate day 
nearer is the high function of the teacher of hygiene.) 
How to adapt his instruction and training to his children 
and community will tax his best educational methods, and 
these methods may vary with different localities. His pur- 
pose, however, will rise above merely academic ends and 
have a genuine social and ethical value. It will be so to 
teach that those receiving instruction shall have life and 
“shall have it more abundantly.” 
SUMMARY 
Restated very briefly this article has tried to emphasize among 
others, the following points: 
1. The subject matter of hygiene for any teacher is that bit of knowl- 
edge or that training in conduct which will most effectively 
further the interests of healt This subject matter may vary 
in different places as sanitary and hygienic needs vary. But 
varied as the subject matter may be in details, it is everywhere 
unified by a definite and common purpose, that of increasing 
the physical efficiency of the pupils.

The teaching of hygiene must not be strangled in the meshes of a 
stereotyped discussion of a bookish text. The study must over- 
flow the confines of the classroom and touch life on the outside. 
It must open the eyes to neglected streets and alleys. it must 
find the open well and the sewage contamination. It must de- 
mand open windows and fresh air in home, school, shop, or 
church. It must view the milkman critically, and insist upon 
proper handling of all the food-supplies. 
It must invite medical inspection and give intelligent obedience to 
expert direction. It must learn the utter futility of quacks and 
nostrums, and see new curative properties in all things that con- 
tribute toward normal hygienic living. 
It must tend to make future citizens, who will give a generous sup- 
port to all public movements intended to combat disease, and a 
cheerful obedience to the rules formulated by the proper health 
officials. 
It will make clearer than heretofore what the scientific physician 
can do, and what he cannot do. 
And not least, it will forever change the blind hopes attached to 
the curing of a disease when it appears, to an intelligent apprecia- 
tion of that ever-widening field of knowledge, which is to play 
a new réle in the prevention of disease.

PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
1. What has been the effect on child experience of the modern ten- 
dency to do away with industries in the home? 
2. What has been the effect on the school of the tendency of the home 
to shift burdens to the school ? 
3- What is the danger of our dependence on highly complicated school 
ventilating systems? 
4. What are the dangers of confining children for long periods to 
school furniture ? 
5. Where no organized play exists, how do children pass their leisure 
time? 
6. What are the differences, as regards social unity, in the modern 
city community, compared with the New England community 
of fifty years ago? 
. What are the effects of lack of exercise on the body; on the mind? 
. What is the “gang,” and what are its tendencies and dangers? 
9. What questions could you ask children of an elementary school 
class daily which would tend to lead all to improve their habits 
of home hygiene? 
zo. What modern movements (e. g., the Boy Scouts) are tending to 
bring back to children opportunities for normal physical devel- 
opment ? 
on 
I. The Problem of Normal Physical Development and 
Health.—Changing social conditions, city life, with its lack 
of play space and play material, the loss of physical activities 
in the home, longer confinement in school, and country life 
which is not promoting health as it should, have given rise 
to physical conditions in the growing child which are to-day 
seriously detrimental to the child and to the race. The school 
is probably the best and at present the only public organiza- 
tion through which e defects may be corrected. There- 
fore, we must insist that teachers give their pupils active, 
body-building, physical exercises, games, dances, and other 
420
-P-A-G-E-511
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 421 
vitality-creating activities. The highly artificial character of 
the modern school and its life makes necessary more formal 
types of physical education than would be possible where a 
large part of each child’s school work and play would be 
motor activity and physical occupations such as Professor 
Dewey idealizes.! 
It is probably justly asserted that the children of to-day 
do not know how to think; but this is not entirely the teach- 
er’s fault; it is largely the fault of the home. The home has 
thrown more and:more of its responsibilities upon the teacher. 
She teaches the child his gymnastics; helps him organize his 
sports; directs his reading; arouses his love for the flag; guides 
his development toward citizenship; teaches the boy to carve 
and construct and the girl to cook, to sew, and to make up 
beds; she is also expected to keep watch and guard over the 
pupil’s eyes, his ears, his teeth, and his morals. 
In fact, the chief responsibility left for the home is to 
clothe and feed the child. If the truth were known we 
should find that the teacher even helps out frequently in the 
clothing. And if you chance to see the girls come into our 
high and even elementary school gymnasiums with stilts 
under their heels and corsets about their waists, expecting in 
that condition to do gymnastics, you will feel that the school 
should have something to say about the clothing. And when 
we discover that at least three per cent of all the children in 
our grades have anemia and about four per cent suffer from 
malnutrition due to faulty diet, all will believe that we must 
make some provisions for improving their feeding, as have 
already been made in many places, either in helping the home 
to improve the diet with little increase of cost or actually 
feeding all or certain children at school, or both. As social 
needs and conditions change so must the school make pro- 
gressive adaptations to human needs. 
II. Need of Physical Education.—The child should prop- 
erly be taught to think at home by practical problem-solving 
1“ Democracy and Education.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-512
  
422 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
methods; even Socrates himself could not have taught his 
pupils very successfully in files of eight and rows of five, with 
little time for contemplation. Physical education, including 
organized play, can be so directed as to teach pupils to think. 
Why? Because here they learn to do and work out things 
and meet problematic situations in play instead of merely 
receiving instruction about them. At its best the method is 
that of co-ordinated self-activity, both mental and muscular, 
not passive, sedentary absorption of the ideas of others. 
Probably never before has the public been so aroused to 
the needs and value of child welfare as at present. We see 
this evidenced all over the country, particularly in a multi- 
plicity of laws regarding child labor, working hours for women, 
compulsory school attendance, medical inspection in schools, 
tenement-house laws, playground agitation, and in the great 
revival and improvement that has taken place in the teach- 
ing of gymnastics and athletics. 
School systems are everywhere being enlarged to include 
physical education, and the physical-education departments 
are being increased to include more and more diversified 
branches of the art, until we have not only the directed class- 
room work, but games, athletics, folk and esthetic dancing, 
playgrounds, school gardens, recreation centres, and other 
forms. 
About ten per cent of our school children suffer from spinal 
curvature, due quite largely to confinement for long periods 
in unsuitable school furniture. This bad custom we must 
stop. Certain breaks in seat work are absolutely necessary 
to save the child’s nervous system from becoming unbalanced 
by the combined pressure of present-day school work and the 
excessive stimulation of modern complex civilization. These 
breaks must be as strong a contrast to the school work as is 
possible under school conditions, and to get this contrast 
we must do active physical work. The physical-training 
periods, therefore, must come at such intervals that practi- 
cally every two study or recitation periods are separated by

one of exercise; and the exercises given during these periods 
must be of such a nature as to stir the blood, invigorate the 
lungs, and contract and relax the large muscles of the thighs 
and body that have been stretched and wearied by sitting. 
Physiology of Exercise.—In addition to providing changes 
from the continued desk and blackboard work, these periods 
rest and build up the body. 
What are the objects of exercise? They are four: 
1. Restoration to a normal physical condition; that is, 
medical or corrective gymnastics. 
2. Preservation or development of physical vigor; that is, 
the upbuilding of muscular, nervous, respiratory, circulatory, 
and nutritive energy and growth, what might be called 
hygienic gymnastics. 
3. Development of skill and better control of the neuro- 
muscular mechanism for certain mental and moral effects. 
This we may call educational gymnastics. This group may 
assume special types, as military for warfare, esthetic for ex- 
pression, industrial, as manual training, and other construc- 
tive activities. 
4. Diversion and social enjoyment. This is largely recrea- 
tive, as games, athletics, dancing, etc., recreational gymnastics. 
Now, briefly, what are the effects of exercise? The mus- 
cles make up about forty to fifty per cent of the body weight. 
Under exercise they gain in efficiency and endurance and 
change in function and structure. Nerves change in form 
but not in number; the nerve-cells branch out, and the nerves 
themselves transmit impulses more readily. The bones be- 
come larger and firmer and the muscular attachments roughen 
and become stronger. The respiration becomes faster and 
deeper; the heart-beat is faster and stronger; the arteries dilate 
and perspiration increases. The heart-beats being more pow- 
erful, the big arteries are put on.the stretch; the elasticity of 
these forces the blood through the capillaries in a steady

on “The Hygiene of the School Child.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-514
  424 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
stream; the increased respiration draws the blood from the 
big veins and the contractions of the muscles force the blood 
from the small veins into the large, and the rate and volume 
of circulation is increased. 
If excess of work happens, we get increased blood-pres- 
sure; more blood is carried back to the heart than it can take 
care of; therefore arises breathlessness, a better name for 
which would probably be heartlessness. ‘Second wind”? is 
due to the adjustment of peripheral resistance to this in- 
creased return of flow. 
By this alternate pressure, by the muscular contraction 
on the lymph-channels, and by the release of muscles, the 
lymph is renewed and freshened. Exercise also improves 
digestion, both by increasing the blood flow and the amount 
of waste. There are many other effects which we have not 
time here to discuss. 
By stimulating the circulation, exercise not only builds 
up tissue but cleans waste products from the brain and 
nerve-cells, with the expected result that the learning process 
is improved. After suitable exercise children grasp prob- 
lems more quickly and with increased accuracy, and their 
general mental alertness is increased. 
Moreover, physical training is educational of and by itself. 
Learning to do new things increases the reserve power of the 
mind. The mere acquiring by the human race of the ability 
to separate the thumb from thé rest of the hand developed a 
whole new brain area. The child largely relives the history 
of his race, and this is particularly true of his motor acts and 
impulses. All of the arguments for motor activity as educa- 
tion, growing out of the modern study of educational psychol- 
ogy, apply to the manifold phases of physical education. 
Progression in Physical Education.—The baby at birth 
has sufficient grasping power in his hands to support his 
weight by holding to a cane, and brings with him into the 
world a strong instinct for general physical activity. At suc- 
cessive stages the child is impelled to do certain things and
-P-A-G-E-515
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 425 
to play certain games. At an early age he delights to run 
from mere love of running; later the interest lies not in the 
mere running, but in the race or competitive game of which 
the running is a part; that is, the instincts of the chase, and 
of competition and co-operation have come in. As he grows 
older the type of motor activity that appeals to him changes. 
For this reason, in any system of physical education worthy 
of the name, the exercises, games, etc., are graded to corre- 
spond roughly with the age. We strive to lead the pupil on 
in his motor development as rapidly as possible, thus securing 
increased mental power as well as building up a strong, devel- 
oped physique with and through which his mind may work. 
Ill. The Rich Past of Physical Education.—Probably no 
nation as a whole ever acquired such physical and mental 
perfection as the ancient Greeks. Their statues of both men 
and women have been recognized as the perfection and ideal 
of the human race. In the building of their cities the first 
municipal building established after the market-place was the 
gymnasium. 
The two almost distinct civilizations of Greece, those of 
Athens and of Sparta, differed considerably in their methods 
of getting this perfection. The Spartan idea, closely allied 
to certain national ideas of to-day, was to build up a perfect 
race for military purposes. The ruling class at Sparta con- 
sisted of a handful of militant conquerors surrounded by a 
horde of slaves. In order to maintain its supremacy, the 
dominant race must be kept physically perfect. Hence weak- 
ling infants were destroyed; and the child was taken at the 
age of seven and educated by the state for the purpose of be- 
coming a soldier, if a boy, or the mother of soldiers, if a girl. 
The Athenian idea closely simulated the present English 
idea that every gentleman owed it to himself and family as a 
matter of course to become as near physically perfect as pos- 
sible. As the modern Englishman takes his football, cricket, 
riding to hounds, and other athletics as a necessary and de- 
sirable phase of life, so the Athenian considered as highly 
 
-P-A-G-E-516
  426 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
important his gymnastics and bath as a part of his daily 
routine. It was here largely a case of physical training for 
its own sake as a part of a liberal education and a freeman’s 
mode of life rather than from any ulterior motive, although 
the exigencies of war were not forgotten. The Spartan system 
was put upon the people by the socialistic government, while 
the Athenian was more spontaneous. 
Rome was at first in much the same condition as Sparta— 
an armed camp in the midst of a conquered people. The 
training was in the arts of war for warlike purposes. As their 
civilization grew older and became more luxurious and corrupt, 
the Romans took their gymnastics vicariously, sitting on the 
bench at the circus, just as probably most American men 
take theirs at the ball game on the bleachers; only nowadays, 
instead of turning down thumbs for an unfortunate gladiator, 
they thirst for the blood of the umpire. 
After the fall of Rome, physical education, like other 
arts and sciences, went through its dark age. It was later 
revived for a few by the necessities of warlike training, and 
in the joust and tournament of the Middle Ages we see an 
approach in chivalric education to our modern athletic meets. 
However, up to about 1800 physical education was practically 
non-existent for most people, except as it came about in the 
daily duties of life. Soon after this time there came a revival 
in gymnastic interest in Germany, in which also the under- 
lying motive, inspired by Jahn, was patriotic and military, 
and the movement in Sweden of a more strictly educational 
character, led by Ling. 
In America the first efforts of any note were in 1820. 
Many schools and colleges adopted some gymnastic work 
during the next ten years, but the flickering flame soon died 
out. There came another small spurt, led by Dio Lewis, 
about the time of the Civil War. But the great impetus of the 
present movement started only about twenty-five years ago, 
although some of the colleges had built gymnasia before that 
time. In the last ten or twelve years, however, has come
-P-A-G-E-517
    
PHYSICAL EDUCATION 427 
the great playground movement, which is one of the popular 
outbursts of the age, a veritable “revival of the physical con- 
science of the race.” 
IV. Principles of Physical Education.—In planning a sys- 
tem of physical education for children, what must we con- 
sider? Whatever we do, we must keep firmly fixed in mind 
that we are educating as well as building physical tissue. 
The great aims of social efficiency, such as health, recreation, ° 
and vocational, moral, and civic ability must be kept ever 
in mind. Physical education can be justified and selected on. 
the basis of its relative contribution to these elements of the 
general aim. Any exercise, to secure the greatest possible 
value, must also be interesting to the individual, as well as 
vigorous or socializing. This is why one gets so much more 
benefit from a good gymnastic game than from pulling chest 
weights or taking any other form of solitary or artificial exer- 
cise. The whole problem of motivation comes in. Growth 
is rhythmical, and we must also utilize and develop the in- 
stinct and sense of rhythm for recreational and other ends. 
Then, too, a good system teaches the child to think along 
certain lines; it must not be wholly nor largely imitative. 
He must be taught, so to speak, to think in his feet, in his 
spine, in his shoulders, etc. Thus only do we get proper 
walking and proper poise and posture, with straight, flat back, 
erect head, and prominent chest. In time this thinking is 
replaced by habit and good carriage is fixed. 
This evolution is a moral as well as a physical training. 
It should inculcate immediate, unquestioning obedience to 
lawful orders, as well as initiative and spontaneity. As man 
has gained his erect attitude his civilization has improved, 
and as a child gains physical poise he gains mental and moral 
poise and thinks better of himself and of his position in the 
community. The physical slouch is frequently also the 
mental and moral shirker. 
The experiment of the Gary, Tuskeegee, and other 
schools where physical education is very definitely connected
-P-A-G-E-518
    
428 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
up with the ordinary physical work and recreation of pupils 
is very suggestive but not applicable to most school systems 
with formal class work, seats screwed to the floor, etc. 
Practice of Physical Education.—Such, in brief, is the 
theory upon which physical education is based. Now what 
must be our practice? First, the work must be so laid out 
that interest is kept alive and the child is continually learning. 
and looking forward to something new. Therefore the work 
is graded, whether it be formal exercises, games, rhythmic 
exercises, athletics, or higher gymnastics. Second, all the 
work, if in classroom, hall, or gymnasium, must be done in 
fresh, “unbaked” air, with windows open at top and bottom, 
or, better still, carried on when the weather is suitable in the 
open air of the school playground. It is only with plenty of 
cool, outdoor air that we can get satisfactory results. School 
ventilating systems are designed for seated children, and do 
not always give enough air even for these; and when children 
become physically active, they use at least four times the 
normal amount of air. There is often a fight to get the win- 
dows open, owing to the opposition of janitors and the fear of 
extra heating cost on the part of boards of education. In the 
Minneapolis schools the windows are open top and bottom 
at physical-training periods, and at recess, six times a day, 
by order of the board of education, and by the same author- 
ity the standard schoolroom temperature has been reduced 
from 70 degrees to 67 degrees. 
The various types of physical education mentioned above, 
such as formal exercises, games, rhythmic exercises, athletics, 
and higher gymnastics, while distinct, are all interdependent 
and closely related. The formal exercises, mass work, or 
calisthenics, whatever they may best be termed, are designed 
to be as vigorous as possible under classroom conditions, and 
also corrective. They provide for much stooping, bending, 
and general use of the big muscles, as well as for chest-ex- 
panding and spine-straightening, and are done mostly by 
command. 
 
-P-A-G-E-519
PHYSICAL EDUCATION 429 
It is necessary in such exercises to insist upon absolut; 
obedience to lawful command, as well as to the rules of a 
game or play. By every means we should foster the spirit of 
fair play. The most harmful factor in games and athletics is 
lax or non-enforcement of the rules. The child who breaks 
the rules of his games with impunity will probably, through 
habit, have a disregard for the rules of the community; he 
becomes “lawless.” 
Next to obedience and respect for the rules of the game 
comes attention. Muscular movement has little stimulative 
effect when it has become purely mechanical. The new is 
not mechanical; therefore a great variety of movements, 
games, plays, etc., is essential to the best results. It is de- 
sirable to use each play or game only a few days without 
change. 
Plays and games, too, tend to develop not only physical 
strength, health, endurance, bodily resistance, and certain 
skill, but also such moral qualities as courtesy, chivalry, and 
loyalty. Teach the children to play the best games possible. 
The play loafer probably tends to become the work shirker. 
V. Directions to Teachers.—In carrying out any course 
in physical education, the teacher should keep in mind the 
close relation it bears to the lessons in hygiene that are 
taught in the grades. 
During all recesses and physical-training periods, except 
when the weather is very inclement, the windows should be 
open to the widest extent, both top and bottom. Whenever 
possible, exercises should be held out of doors. In buildings 
having large, airy corridors, exercises should frequently be 
held there, so far as size of classes permits. When windows 
cannot be opened because of the violence of the wind, it is 
possible in buildings having fans to drive unheated air into 
the rooms at physical-exercise periods without creating drafts. 
The air-heaters may be shut off from the air at these periods. 
Teachers will strive especially for correct carriage. See 
to it that children at all times sit, walk, and stand correctly.
-P-A-G-E-520
430 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The attitude while sitting at the desk is very important, as 
many cases of lateral curvature of the spine in young children 
are most probably due to faulty attitudes. By developing 
the ideal of good posture, by holding up fine ideals of posture 
through literature, statuary, pictures, and examples of chil- 
dren and adults, this standard will best be attained. In the 
physical-training drill, special attention should also be given 
to correct form. No exercise is very beneficial if the child is 
allowed to stand with drooping head and flattened chest. 
Give commands sharply, cheerily, and vigorously. On 
the vim and spirit of the command largely depends the vigor 
of the reaction. 
Exercises calling into action large groups of muscles take 
more time than those using small groups of muscles. For 
instance, a body movement must be made more slowly than 
one of the arm or forearm. Body movements and respiratory 
movements may be made so rapidly as to be dangerous. Res- 
piratory exercises should be given slowly, with slight pause at 
the end of expiration, never at end of inspiration, since hold- 
ing the breath has a bad effect on the circulation. 
As every effort should be made to counteract the cramp- 
ing of the child which nearly all desk work causes, the win- 
dows should be opened widely at frequent intervals and the 
children exercised vigorously on their feet. This is best done 
by two-minute interrecitation periods of vigorous running 
or a fast game at about 9.30, at 11.30, and again at 2.00 P.M., 
in addition to a regular ten-minute exercise period at 10.00 
A.M. Many prefer a program that places the long period 
at 11.30, as this is probably nearer the time of greatest mental 
fatigue. Or one may use any vigorous game, preferably 
those with running and stooping in them. 
Children should be urged to wear the low, sensible, flexi- 
ble shoe, such as athletes wear, and to avoid those with 
pointed toes or high heels. They should also be taught to 
avoid tight clothing. The young girl in a tight gown is 
neither graceful nor attractive; she is merely silly.
-P-A-G-E-521
    
PHYSICAL EDUCATION 431 
There are two kinds of command: (1) The preparatory 
command, which tells what is to be done, and (2) the com- 
mand of execution which starts the action. There should be 
long enough pause between the preparatory command and the 
command of execution for the pupil to understand what he 
is to do. The tone of command must be distinct and ani- 
mated and its loudness regulated by the size of the class and 
the outside noises. Do not shout. Indifferent commands 
produce indifferent results. 
There should be some marching; and wherever possible 
one may amplify this to figure marching for the development 
not only of rhythm and co-operation, but of attention, since 
a child cannot march in wheels, circles, and figures, unless he 
is attending to his work. We should reasonably expect here, 
perhaps, some spread of the training in attending in figure 
marching to attending in other co-operative exercises of a 
similar character. 
VI. Methods of Physical-Education Exercises.—In the 
lower grades the exercises may be made occupational in type, 
z. €., imitative of occupational activities with which the chil- 
dren are already familiar. This is becoming a more and 
more difficult requirement to meet, for, as cities grow, chil- 
dren see less of occupations and then only a fragment here 
and there. Such exercises have a strong appeal to children 
of this age because the imitative instinct is then very strong. 
In the upper grades the occupational exercises may disap- 
pear and their place be taken (when children and teachers 
have been at the work long enough to enable them to accom- 
plish them in good form) by exercises selected from athletics, 
such as imitations of golf-club swinging, shot-putting, etc., 
and also heaving, body-bending, and vaulting exercises on 
and over the school seats and desks. 
Games and Play.—The second group we may call games. 
We should try to keep alive the spirit of play. Through lack 
of a desire or ability to play, whole communities are deteri- 
orating and have become grave national problems. I refer
-P-A-G-E-522
  
432 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
especially to England’s great-mill cities. For generations 
these people have been mill-workers. Not only the fathers 
and mothers but the children have spent practically all their 
waking hours in these great hives, with no pleasure and little 
hope. Several times during the past twenty years English 
military authorities have been obliged to lower their stand- 
ards as to height, weight, and chest measurements, in order 
to get the proper proportion of army and navy recruits from 
these localities. The recent war has revealed still greater 
physical deterioration. We are in great danger of having 
this happen in our large cities here, especially in cities hav- 
ing large industrial plants, and also in the country, where so 
often recreation is taboo and “‘all work and no play” is the 
tule of life. Rural recreation for young and old is for the 
future to develop. The best preventive of this menacing 
condition is play. 
While the tendency to play games is inherited through the 
generations, the games themselves are not. They must be 
taught. Games have always been taught children, but 
largely by other children, since most adults have forgotten 
them or are engrossed with other matters than the education 
of their children. In mixed cities the games are not trans- 
mitted, because of race prejudices, differences in religion, dif- 
ferences in social status, and because of the lack of a place 
to play. Mothers formerly played with the children, but 
under modern city conditions this has largely disappeared. 
There is little privacy, and mothers are frequently working 
outside, are at the club, or are otherwise engaged. There is 
too little sense of community unity, neighborliness, mutual 
confidence, and friendliness among the parents, in city or 
country. This unfortunate state of affairs has had a particu- 
larly bad effect upon the girls. In many communities they 
have been brought up to believe that any active game or 
sport is unladylike. 
Then, too, the mere fact that litt as a rule are dressed 
in finer clothes than they were fifty years ago acts as a brake
-P-A-G-E-523
  
PHYSICAL EDUCATION 433 
upon play. The continual “now don’t get dirty, Johnny,” 
has had its marked effect. When Johnny lived in the coun- 
try and hitched up his trousers with a nail, nobody worried 
about his keeping them clean. The fewer children in the 
isolated farm homes, the few children at the typical non- 
consolidated one-room school, the fewer picnics of the growing 
number of tenant farmers, and other features, make even the 
advantage of suitable clothes for play of little importance. 
The cities have plenty of children but little or no place to 
play; the country has plenty of place to play but too few 
children congregated in one place. The consolidated school 
helps solve this problem for the children. 
As a result of these conditions it has come to pass that, 
for the first time probably in the history of the world, it is 
necessary for adults to teach children how to play and to 
teach them games. These range all the way from dramatiza- 
tion of nursery rhymes, through the old folk-games, to the 
less highly organized modern games. In using games we 
must keep in mind the need of frequent change. Teach two 
‘or three games; let the children use them for two or three 
weeks; then teach some more. The child of six particularly 
enjoys games in which there is much repetition, as in most 
singing games, such as “Farmer in the Dell,” ‘“‘“Looby Loo,” 
“Jolly Miller,” ‘Round and Round the Village,” and those 
which require the impersonation of an animal or a person, as 
“Cat and Mouse,” and those games of simple chase requiring 
little demand on the powers of prolonged attention, of few 
rules, and quick climaxes, such as ‘‘Bean-Bag Passing Race,” 
“Crow Race,’ etc. 
The great value of these games is in their proper adapta- 
tion to the age of the pupil and in the intense interest which 
they arouse. At the age of admission to school the child is in 
the midst of his dramatization age; therefore the nursery- 
rhyme plays appeal to him very strongly. As he gets a little 
older the tag and catching games have their vogue; then 
come the racing games and the competitive games of the less 
 
-P-A-G-E-524
  
434 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
highly organized type, such as those where an entire group 
must be caught, as in “Pom Pom Pullaway,” ‘“Prisoner’s 
Base,” etc., group competitions, such as relay races, and 
mass athletic competitions. In these games we begin to get 
a start in building up the sense of loyalty and the subordina- 
tion of self to the interests of the team or “side,” although this 
probably does not reach its best stage until a later age, when 
we see it in such games as baseball, football, and basket-ball. 
Rhythmic Work and Dancing.—Closely related to the 
simplest games, and perhaps more closely related to the 
formal exercises, come the rhythmic exercises, such as fancy 
steps, folk-dances, and esthetic dancing. 
The more active forms of dancing secure in the highest 
degree the physiological effects of exercise. Probably, in 
addition, the most important function of dancing is in train- 
ing the sense of dynamic equilibration, the equilibrium of 
the body in motion, and in cultivating the sense of rhythm. 
These build up and accentuate the sense of rhythm, and in- 
culcate grace and co-ordination of movement, as well as tend, 
to break down and prevent the horrible self-consciousness of 
early adolescence. They are vigorous enough to be builders 
of the body and of lung power. Being oftentimes combina- 
tions of steps and body and arm movements, they are also 
corrective. They are also co-operative, social activities pos- 
sessing great recreational and social value. 
Rhythm is a fundamental instinct. The automatic foun- 
dation of the mind has the original tendency for rhythmic 
action continually increased by habits passed over from con- 
scious control. In mental growth the subconscious mind 
increases its content as the conscious mind increases its ac- 
commodation, and passes more and more acts over into 
habit. Thus this acquisition of the habit of grace and equi- 
librium builds up mental as well as physical poise. At any 
rate, the instinctive love of rhythm can be utilized for desir- 
able educational ends, such as habits of harmless enjoyment, 
sociability, co-operation, respect for the opposite sex, etc.

Those who have attended an old-fashioned religious re- 
vival know the supremely important part that rhythm in the 
form of music, poetry, the cadences and rhythmic flow of 
speech, and even the more or less conscious rhythmic motions 
play in swaying the emotions.!_ The effect of poetry is due 
largely to rhythm, whether it be doggerel, Virgil representing 
a cavalry charge, or Kipling’s majestic ‘‘Recessional.” The 
war-dances of savages, the occupation-dances of the peas- 
antry, the love-dances of the East, all show how fundamental 
is this sense of rhythm, and how early in race history it is 
translated into muscular activity. Dancing is undoubtedly 
next to the oldest form of gymnastics, the oldest being the 
practice of acts of war. Probably the rhythmical march of 
the processional is directly descendent from the old Greek 
dances, and these probably had the remotest of origins. 
Physical education is valuable, not merely because it 
helps preserve the health, nor because it enables the child to 
accomplish more storing up of educative experience in a given 
time, but because it is educational of and by itself. The 
mere learning to do new “stunts” or the learning of compli- 
cated exercises, such as wand or club drills, develops certain 
valuable mental habits, trains new nerve connections, adds 
to the general efficiency of the individual, and puts the will 
to energize in a stronger condition for the next “stunt,” 
whether it be on the flying rings or probably in such a remoter 
field as arithmetic; and finally builds up the basic neurologi- 
cal combinations on which the very intelligence itself rests. 
The best types of dancing require as much co-ordination as 
any form of gymnastics in existence. This is believed to be 
one of the reasons for the success of that education which 
was undoubtedly one of the main factors in producing that 
most brilliant epoch that the world has ever seen, ancient 
Greece in her glory. 
1 The movements of the Shakers or Quakers had the instinct for rhythm as 
their basis. Our universal love of music and periodic sentences is another 
example.
-P-A-G-E-528
  436 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
By the Greeks dancing was regarded as one of the funda- 
mentals in education. It was not merely that the strength, 
grace, and endurance of the body were trained by these 
dances, but that the nervous and mental bases for straight 
and wholesome thinking were thus laid—that neurological 
basis upon which co-operation of mind and body rests. 
One may ask whether it is not possible to get all these 
benefits with other forms of gymnastics? No, it isnot. To 
begin with, under the conditions of limited space which all 
physical instructors have to face, there is more all-round 
physical exercise in certain forms of dancing than in any 
known form of gymnastics, or probably than in any game. 
This makes it essential at times, even if we do not consider 
its appeal to fundamental social and psychological needs of 
the organism. 
Again, any one with any experience as a teacher, or any 
one who has tried to get exercise by himself, knows that 
nothing makes the same appeal or renders the same enjoy- 
ment that a game does, and folk-dancing is a game set to music. 
Exercise without enjoyment is like meat without salt. It 
may sustain life but who wishes merely to exist? 
Types of Dances.—Of course, there are any number of 
kinds of dances. They divide, however, into three main 
groups—esthetic dancing, closely allied to the old Greek dance, 
the folk-dance, and the social dance. There are transitional 
dances lying between these groups. The esthetic type is 
most beautiful, graceful, and beneficial, and also most diffi- 
cult; the folk-dance is occupational in type, often beautiful, 
most rhythmical, and most joyous; the social is anything 
that the performers make it. The first two are excellent 
from the physical standpoint, the last much less so, not in- 
cluding, of course, the good old contra or square dances, 
which are really folk-dances. 
Almost all countries have folk-dances that are peculiar to 
themselves. In the United States, I suppose, the only truly 
indigenous folk-dances are the Indian dances, which are occu-
-P-A-G-E-529
  
  PHYSICAL EDUCATION 437 
pational and symbolic, and in their original form were largely 
religious ceremonies. There have been some folk-dances 
brought here. The old contra-dance seen in rural New Eng- 
land and the other older parts of the country has practically 
become our folk-dance; and the moral distinction between it 
and the “round dance” is sharply drawn by some com- 
munities. 
For school work the most beneficial type is the folk- 
dances, both because they enable all to get exercise at the 
same time in a limited space, and because they are in them- 
selves a graded course, graded both as to the amount of exer- 
tion required and as to the difficulty of accomplishment. 
These folk-dances, more than any other type, rehearse the 
life history of the race: combat, the chase, sowing and reap- 
ing, and the trades. Representing, as they do, the racially 
old neurological co-ordinations, they will help to give the 
child the race inheritance upon which honest thinking and 
wholesome feeling rest. Properly taught, dancing will tend 
to develop not only clean, straight thinking, but wholesome, 
normal feeling. Being so fundamental, the original tenden- 
cies underlying dancing are bound to find expression. Why 
not guide this expression into definite educative channels? 
Dances should be taught not only as a part of the muscular 
education, but as a part of the emotional and cultural edu- 
cation. In schools a talking-machine and movable school 
desk-chairs, such as the Mouthrop and others, or even low 
tables and separate chairs, make possible a clearing of the 
classroom floor for group games and dancing. If the com- 
munity is prejudiced against the word dance, such terms as 
musical games, rhythmic exercises, rhythmic gymnastics, 
folk-games, etc., may be used. In such cases nothing ap- 
proximating the social dances to which the community is 
opposed should be introduced. 
Do not conclude that the writer believes that dancing is 
a complete system of physical education in itself. He does 
not. It has, for example, little corrective effect on the de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-530
    
438 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
formities caused by improper school seats and desks, but 
that it is a very valuable adjunct and that it is an essential 
part in any rational system of physical training is no longer 
open to question. 
Team-Games and Athletics.—The next step, and one in- 
creasing in importance with age, is the more highly organized 
games and athletics. These are competitive in their general 
appeal and have a most excellent effect, aside from their 
marked physical benefits, on the spirit of co-operation and 
loyalty. The boy who develops a large loyalty to his team 
will very probably tend to be loyal also to his school, to his 
family, and to his community. Such activities divert the 
“gang” spirit to some good purpose. They also tend to in- 
culcate courtesy, honor, and respect for law, and, owing to 
the self-restraint which a mild degree of training demands, 
are large builders of self-control and of clean living. 
The upbuilding of sportsmanship, which is a combination 
of self-control, honor, and courtesy, is a most important 
function of these games and of the student gatherings which 
accompany them. Too many of our school games are used 
merely as excuses for rowdyism, and it is an interesting fact 
that this rowdyism is rarely participated in by the players, 
but is led and incited by the cigarette-smoking good-for- 
nothings on the bleachers, who roll up their trousers instead 
of their sleeves, and go into hysteria instead of the game. 
These most highly organized games require lightning-like 
thinking and instant decision. Here, truly, “he who hesi- 
tates is lost,” and the playing of these undoubtedly makes 
to a certain degree and in certain directions for decision of 
character. 
Work on Apparatus.—The last group of which I shall 
speak is the purely gymnastic or “apparatus” work, which, 
combined with the other groups, is most advantageous in 
building up grace, co-ordination, power, and self-confidence. 
It is very essential to the building-up of the sense of equilib- 
rium of the body in motion. There is danger, however, of

PHYSICAL EDUCATION 439 
overdoing this branch with young pupils, as too great use of 
any one type of apparatus, especially the parallel bars, leads 
to overdevelopment of certain parts of the body at the ex- 
pense of the others, and may result in deformity. 
Time Allotment.—In high schools the usual method is to 
have two forty or fifty minute periods a week for every stu- 
dent. Gymnastics should be required of all, as it is in the 
grades, and credit should be given for the work. Only those 
who do good work in the gymnasium and in their studies 
should be allowed to represent their school in games and 
athletics. 
In those elementary schools having gymnasiums there 
should be at least two thirty-minute periods a week, and 
there should be a large preponderance of games, free-hand 
gymnastics, marching, etc., not more than one-fifth of the 
time being devoted to apparatus work. 
VII. Playgrounds and Gardens.—There should go with 
all this school work a well-thought-out system of equipped 
school playgrounds and school gardens. As a preliminary to 
fitting pupils for equipped playground work, the organized 
recess is a great help, and, in fact, in any large school with 
a crowded school yard it is essential if we are to get any real 
value out of the recess. At present most of the children 
merely stand about, collect in groups to malign the teacher, 
to tell stories of a vile or indifferent nature, to chase one 
another about and play uneducative games, or to fight. 
The organized recess, that is, the division of the yard into 
areas for each grade, the appointment of play leaders, and 
the detailing of a few teachers to supervise, does away with 
the undesirable features of the unsupervised recess. More- 
over, getting out of doors does the teacher as much good as 
it does the pupil. For her own health and happiness, if not 
for extending her educational services, all teachers should 
cultivate the habit of play participation and leadership at 
recess and other times. 
The discussion of playground and school-garden work is
-P-A-G-E-534
440 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
too long to take up here. I speak of it merely to insist that 
it should be under the same supervising head as is the other 
physical-training work. Rural teachers will get many valu- 
able suggestions in Curtis’s “Play and Recreation for the 
Open Country.” : 
Every teacher, principal, and superintendent should be 
promoters of such activities as the Boy Scouts and Camp- 
Fire Girls. Each of these promotes a type of preparedness 
which for the boys is as vitally educative for peace as for 
war, without being directed toward the latter, and for girls 
promotes the best ideals and capacities of American woman- 
hood. 
We must also remember that we cannot build the body 
without building the mind and that, other things being any- 
where near equal, the strong, well child is much more likely 
to become the good student and the clean-living, upright 
adult than is the weakling. It is our duty as educators, 
therefore, to see that we give training so diversified that, 
combined with their other mental and moral training, we 
may turn out complete, perfect products—true, efficient, and 
honorable American men and women. 
SUMMARY 
. Changing social conditions which have resulted in removing the 
probabilities of proper play and proper physical experiences 
have made it necessary to give these through the school. 
2. Long confinement in improper school furniture has made it doubly 
necessary to give active exercise to the big, fundamental mus- 
cles. 
3. At certain ages, fundamental instincts arising compel certain 
activities in the child, which make necessary a progression in 
physical education corresponding in time to these instincts. 
4. A knowledge of the rich past of physical education, extending 
from the days of Greece to our own time, is necessary for the 
proper teaching of it. 
5. The principles of physical education demand in its content inter- 
est, rhythm, thinking, and vigor, with resulting proper pos- 
ture; as well as many situations which cultivate obedience, n

honor, courtesy, and loyalty, which shall build up the moral 
side of the individual. 
. In practice the work must be graded; it must be handled where 
there is plenty of fresh air; it must have variety, including 
marching, formal gymnastics, apparatus work, folk-dancing, 
games, and athletics. 
. Marching is peculiarly adapted to teaching obedience, quick 
thinking, and proper carriage, although these may not be 
entirely general acquisitions. 
. Formal gymnastics should include not only calisthenics, use of 
dumb-bells, wands, etc., but should be made occupational in 
type whenever possible. 
. Because games and plays are being lost, it has become necessary 
for adults to teach children how to play. 
Folk-dances, because they are rhythmical, physiological, co- 
operative, recreational, and have progression, are one of the 
most important phases of physical education. 
Any well-designed system of physical education should include 
not only all the foregoing, but also playgrounds, manual train- 
ing, school gardens, and other motor occupations. 
The duty of the school to turn out complete, perfect products, 
may be fulfilled only by training the body and soul as well as 
the mind.

CHAPTER XX 
HISTORY 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
1. Find out what kind of historical facts the pupil most easily remem- 
bers. 
2. Does the pupil voluntarily use historical reasons for things now 
existing ? 
3. How does the pupil think of relationships implying lapse of time? 
4. Is the pupil able to see the other side when the United States is 
involved in a controversy? 
5. What American or European heroes or characters has the pupil 
become familiar with before the formal study of history? 
6. What is the pupil’s attitude toward Europe and the particular 
countries of Europe? 
7. Do the younger pupils.enjoy dramatizing famous historical scenes ? 
8. Does the pupil use a knowledge of geography in studying events 
in which the geographical situation is an important factor? 
9. Does the pupil know how to draw maps? 
to. Does the pupil voluntarily read historical accounts or stories? 
The Aim.—Good teaching of history should enable the 
pupil to understand more fully the community of which he 
is a member, and to appreciate with increasing clearness his 
relations to it. This constitutes the claim of the subject to 
an important place in the curriculum of the common schools. 
Such a claim could be based upon the fact that interest in the 
personages and events of the past is as ancient as human 
society, and that history is one of the most characteristic 
forms of all literatures. Nevertheless, the value of a subject 
for the instruction and satisfaction of men and women might 
be undoubted while its usefulness in the education of children 
remained obscure. The relish of the child for historical tales 
is hardly a sufficient reason. 
444
-P-A-G-E-539
  
  HISTORY , 445 
History as a Mode of Explanation.—Historical knowledge 
is often spoken of as if it were hardly more than a polite 
accomplishment, furnishing the means of recognizing refer- 
ences met in conversation or in reading. It is needless to 
argue that such a view is superficial. The best explanation 
of a law, an institution, a custom, or a belief is frequently 
its history. Nearly everything characteristic of the com- 
munity, be this large or small, city, state, or nation, is a 
growth, a structure. Each generation has added to the 
whole for better or worse. The result is incomprehensible 
without some account, that is, a history, of the changes, the 
reasons for them, and the way they were made. 
The service of history as a method of explanation is more 
obvious in some cases than in others. For example, an ac- 
count of elections which should say nothing of the reasons 
drawn from experience, that is, from history, for the change 
from nomination by convention to direct nominations would 
not be very enlightening. Again, who would venture to ex- 
plain without the aid of history the varieties of religious 
belief and practice in the United States? The same is true 
of industrial facts. Descriptive geography may explain par- 
tially the importance of a city like Chicago, but the explana- 
tion will become clearer and fuller when the history of the 
city is given, showing how it was affected by the building of 
railroads, the development of water-routes, the movement of 
population, and the changes in the methods of industry. 
Information.—In seeking to show that the study of his- 
tory is vital to any adequate comprehension of the essential 
features of our modern American life, it is not intended to 
ignore or belittle the value of mere historical information. 
There are many facts of which the intelligent man or woman 
is obliged sooner or later to take account that are purely his- 
torical and can be acquired only by a study or reading of 
history. Where but to history are we to turn for the facts 
which lie behind the race question in the South, for the mean- 
ing of the phrase “Solid South,” for the interpretation of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-540
  446 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Monroe Doctrine, the possession of the Philippine Islands 
and Porto Rico, the make-up of our population, the origin of 
trusts and labor organizations, and a host of other condi- 
tions? In some of these cases even a little knowledge of 
history would serve as a corrective of much superficial and 
prejudiced opinion, which at times becomes dangerous in a 
democracy with new direct and rapid modes of action. 
Moral Value of History.—From an understanding of the 
part others have taken in making the community what it is, 
the pupil inevitably comes to a clearer appreciation of his 
relation to it. Knowledge does not make every one wise or 
public-spirited or patriotic, but it quickens the sense of re- 
sponsibility in those who have the right disposition. If a 
boy once follows the history of a law providing for the com- 
pensation of workmen injured in accidents, for regulating the 
hours of labor, or for controlling the employment of women 
and children—laws which may affect vitally the members of 
his own family—he is likely to acquire a more intelligent 
sense of his future duties as a citizen in regard to legislation. 
The history of a city, rather than its statistics of population, 
trade, and wealth, will tend to awaken true civic pride and 
loyalty. The long story of industry, of invention, of the 
efforts to better the conditions under which work is done, of 
the increasing interdependence of industries, those of the 
nation and of the world, as well as those of a particular local- 
ity, should make work more interesting, quicken the spirit of 
co-operation, and render more reasonable the attitude of 
those on different sides of industrial questions. If we rise to 
higher conceptions still, we may ask: How can a boy or girl 
remain devoid of love of country when once taught the story 
of the adventurous spirits who discovered and explored it, . 
of the many sacrifices made to defend it, and of the great 
men and women whom it has produced? 
Mental Training.—Work in history has other values for 
the pupil. It trains the historical imagination. Using the 
materials made familiar by the child’s ordinary associations
-P-A-G-E-541
HISTORY 447 
of the home, the street, the church, and of civic life, history 
builds up pictures and images of many situations, political, 
social, or religious, giving the child power vividly to realize 
more and more what the world is and to see what it has been. 
Through stories of great men and women, history enriches 
the child’s conceptions of character. The social judgment is 
also trained. Contact, even in the brief paragraphs of the 
text-book or through the words of the teacher, with many 
actual problems of conduct or policy, leaves impressions or 
invites opinions. Such activities of the mind also have a 
moral value, for they prepare the growing youth to make 
wiser choices as the practical problems of his community con- 
front him. As an incident to the presentation of the many 
situations which make up the history of our own or other 
peoples, the pupil is necessarily taught to organize facts, to 
perceive their relative importance, to study them in a correct 
perspective. These statements suggest only a few of the 
ways in which historical study may serve in: training the 
child’s mind in valuable specific connections. 
A Formative Influence.—Success in teaching history is 
only partial until the pupil’s original interest in the varied 
experiences of the past becomes so strong that it will con- 
tinue to act as a formative influence in his intellectual growth. 
The realization of such an ideal will be more certain if he is 
taught some use of books and if his taste’ for reading is en- 
couraged to include historical books adapted to his years. 
The Course of Study.—The place of history in the cur- 
riculum is not finally determined. The present tendency is 
to have it represented in every grade. In the early grades 
the work commonly suggested is pictures from history or 
historical types rather than history; for the idea of sequence 
in time, or chronological development, which is essential to 
history, is necessarily absent. The use of historical mate- 
tial, however, enriches the beginner’s imagination and fur- 
nishes his mind with words and images which will become 
its tools in later work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-542
  
  448 | TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The debatable land in the course is found in the work for 
the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. The question for these 
grades is affected by the increasing demand for more atten- 
tion in programs to the European background of American 
history and civilization. Thoughtful persons are beginning 
to realize that the child who is taught only what has hap- 
pened on American soil will gain a very inadequate idea of 
American civilization, which is, in its origin, chiefly European. 
The older conception of American history was provincial, 
and was calculated to produce provincial minds. The prob- 
lem is how and where is this related European history to be 
inserted? The answer is rendered difficult by the fact that a 
great many school children leave school as soon as the laws 
permit them to work as regular employees. These children 
do not advance ordinarily beyond the fifth grade. If the 
thorough study of American history is reserved for the sev- 
enth and eighth grades—which is the usual and reasonable 
practice—it would seem necessary to insert a previous and 
simpler treatment for the sake of the pupils who leave early. 
The Committee of Eight of the American Historical Asso- 
ciation has attempted to solve the problem by devoting the 
fourth and fifth years to the study of leading characters and 
typical scenes taken from the Colonial and national periods. 
This is to be followed in the sixth grade by the study of 
events, arts, and customs, selected from Greek, Roman, and 
medieval life, which explain the civilization carried by the 
Colonial emigrants to America. To such material about 
two-thirds of the sixth year are to be devoted, while the 
remainder is to be reserved for topics from the history of dis- 
covery and exploration, with the attendant European rival- 
ries, as far as the year 1600. This plan has been criticised 
as overloading the sixth year, but the criticism has usually 
been based on the mistaken notion that the plan calls for 
the systematic treatment of ancient and medieval history, 
instead of the study of typical features of these periods. In 
Indiana the attempt has been made to avoid the danger of

HISTORY 449 
overloading the sixth grade by using in the third and fourth 
years many stories from the history of Greece and Rome. 
The Indiana course for the sixth grade is based upon English, 
instead of general European, history. In a curriculum pub- 
lished in 1908 by Teachers College, Columbia University, 
there is a fuller treatment of Greek, Roman, and medieval 
history, covering about a year and a half, placed between 
the study of American typical characters and the fuller con- 
sideration of American history at the close of the course. 
- Subject Matter: Grades 1 to 3.—The subject matter for 
the first two grades, and to some extent for the third grade, 
is drawn commonly from primitive life, especially from that 
of the American Indians. Certain plans take their guiding 
thought from the sequence in epochs of culture, giving to 
the pupils of the first grade problems of food and clothing, 
to those of the second grade pastoral and agricultural life, 
and to those of the third the beginnings of trade, travel, and 
discovery. In the Teachers College course this leads in turn 
to the study of local history, the discoveries of Henry Hud- 
son, and the Dutch settlement on Manhattan Island. The 
same idea is worked out in the course prepared for the Ele- 
.mentary School of the University of Chicago. 
The successful use of any of these plans calls for a right 
choice of material and skilful methods of presentation. It 
is evident that the work must be oral and that it should be 
supplemented by simple tasks of construction assigned to 
the pupils. The teacher’s first care is the selection of stories. 
Of these many lists exist. Ina ‘‘ Bibliography of History,” by 
Andrews, Gambrill, and Tall, published under the auspices 
of the Association of History Teachers of the Middle States 
and Maryland, many books are mentioned, and their useful- 
ness or adaptability to the needs of the several grades is 
stated. The opinions are based upon actual use by teachers. 
Other lists will be found in the “Report of the Committee of 
Eight,” in Talkington’s ‘How to Teach History and Civics 
in the Grades,” and in McMurry’s “Special Method in His-
-P-A-G-E-546
    45° TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tory.” The teacher’s next task is to learn how to tell such 
stories, unless she has already received the necessary training 
in normal schools or in the training-schools connected with 
the libraries of the larger cities. By study of the best printed 
stories and by practice, noting the methods which hold the 
attention of the children, the teacher may solve the problem 
for herself. Suggestions on method may be found in Mc- 
Murry, ‘Talkington, and especially in Sara Cone Bryant’s 
“How to Tell Stories to Children.” 
The story should be interrupted or supplemented by ques- 
tions framed in such a way that the pupils will be led to 
work out for themselves the problems which it presents. If, 
for example, they are studying pastoral life, they may be 
asked such questions as the following: “Will these men’ be 
likely to choose a warm or a cold country? A moist or a 
dry one? Will they need for their flocks forests or open land ? 
How’ long will they be likely to remain in one place? What 
kind of a house will it be wise for them to build, one like 
ours, or one like the nomadic hunter? How will they care 
for the sheep in stormy weather?’’! As the pupils are nat- 
urally active with their hands, their work may be accom- 
panied by tasks of construction. The Committee of Eight 
suggests the construction in the first grade of an Indian 
wigwam on a sand-table moulded to present the arrangements 
of Indian home life. 
In the third grade the Committee of Eight suggests as a 
part of the work, stories of the ‘Heroes of Other Times,” as 
Moses, Ulysses, Alexander, Cincinnatus, Tell, Alfred, and 
Joan of Arc. The Indiana course emphasizes tales from 
Hebrew life, reserving two-thirds of the time for tales from 
Greece. Other courses use Phoenician traders and discover- 
ers, or the vikings. 
Much use is made in these grades of national and local 
anniversaries—Thanksgiving Day, Washington’s Birthday, 
Memorial Day, Independence Day, Columbus Day, etc.

  HISTORY 451 
This offers the opportunity to make the children familiar 
with a few outstanding features of American history.!. Care 
should be taken, however, that as the anniversaries recur the 
same stories be not repeated too many times, for that is a 
sure method of wearying the pupils of the very names and 
ideas they should be taught to honor. 
Grades 4 and 5.—Whether typical scenes and persons 
from American history be given in the fourth and fifth grades 
or only in the fifth grade, the teacher should be cautioned 
not to attempt to cover too much ground. Many leading 
characters must be omitted, in order that those included 
may be treated with detail sufficient to leave upon the pupil’s 
mind a distinct and permanent impression. The list may 
well be varied according to the location of the school. For 
example, it would be impossible to omit Ponce de Leon in 
Florida, but his career is less important for the child of the 
Northwest. Coronado should be particularly interesting to 
children of the Southwest, but not so much to children of 
New England. The remote is difficult for the child to pic- 
ture, unless the remoteness is merely geographical. The story 
may be very close to the child’s interest because of his love 
of the marvellous. Ponce de Leon’s search for the Fountain 
of Youth may, accordingly, be of value to any child without 
regard to locality. Heroes of peac¢e and industry, like Frank- 
lin, Whitney, Fulton, Clinton, should be as prominent in the 
list as heroes of war on sea or land. In dealing with any 
character chosen the first effort should be to awaken in the 
child’s mind a sympathetic interest. Facts drawn from the 
boyhood of such persons will serve this purpose. The child 
finds it difficult to put himself in the place of a grown per- 
son, while he is powerfully affected by the experiences of one 
as young as himself. 
Part of the time in these grades should be devoted to 
typical scenes and situations from American history: An early 
1The much used book for teachers entitled ‘Jean Mitchell’s School” is 
largely made up of the story of how a teacher utilized special days of this kind.
-P-A-G-E-548
  
  452 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
settlement on the coast, a fur-trader’s station on the frontier, 
Colonial industry, a settlement beyond the mountains in 
Kentucky or Ohio, a plantation in the South, a mining-camp, 
a cattle-ranch, or a wheat farm in the West. The list, as in 
the case of persons, should depend somewhat on the locality. 
Persons and scenes should frequently be treated accord- 
ing to the method of the type lesson. This is a complete 
study of a single topic in a way adapted to the needs of the 
children of a particular grade. The impressions which the 
pupil receives from the vividness of these intensive and de- 
tailed studies of typical events, instead of from a vague treat- 
ment of the whole story, will be carried over to other similar 
topics in the list, which may then be treated more briefly. 
These type lessons should follow one another, so far as pos- 
sible, in chronological order, that the pupil may be led un- 
consciously to begin the construction of his framework of 
American history. His historical knowledge, elementary as 
it is, should not be merely a string of edifying anecdotes. 
Sixth Grade.—In planning the work of the sixth grade, if 
it is to include the European background, based either upon 
European history or mainly upon English history, topics and 
facts should be selected for their bearing upon the develop- 
ment of America, that is, upon the history of the United 
States. The advantage of choosing general European his- 
tory is that this plan makes possible a more just presentation 
of what the peoples of the Continent, as well as the English, 
have contributed to our growth. It facilitates also the ac- 
quisition of a view of the way in which the civilized world 
has been enlarged, or moved, from its ancient seats on the 
banks of the Nile, the Euphrates, and the Tigris, or on the 
shores of the Mediterranean. Two formative ideas are to 
be kept in mind: the rise of the arts and customs which con- 
stitute one essential element of our civilization and the direc- 
tion which the geographical extension of civilized mankind 
has taken. The latter idea permits close correlation between 
geographical and historical facts.

HISTORY 453 
In such a course there can be no attempt to teach the full: 
history of any people, either Greek, Roman, or English. The 
task is to explain how the Greeks or the Romans, the English, 
Germans, French, Spaniards, or the Italians became our 
teachers in arts, customs, beliefs, and in ways of government. 
The study of formal ancient, medieval, or English history 
should be preserved for the secondary school. 
The method of presenting the material for the sixth grade, 
and even for the fifth, should be based upon the use of the 
text-book. Care in the selection of topics is vital to success, 
and the average teacher, without the advantage of large col- 
lections of books or the leisure to use them, cannot be ex- 
pected to “‘get up” the topics. She may well plan to sup- 
plement the matter which is necessarily presented in very 
brief form in the text-book. 
Seventh and Eighth Grades: Principal Topics.—The selec- 
tion of matter for the final treatment of American history in 
the elementary school is not a closed question as soon as a 
particular text-book is chosen. Text-books were once made 
under the impression that the principal aim of the history 
course was to produce politicians, constitutional lawyers, or 
military commanders. The tradition still lingers in some 
quarters. The teacher who is in sympathy with the “New 
History,” which is at least as old as Guizot, should empha- 
size the sections on industrial and social history. This may 
be done both by giving needed explanations in detail, by add- 
ing such other material as she or her pupils can find in refer- 
ence books, and by laying little stress on, or omitting, less 
important topics, remembering that the aim is to help the 
children to an understanding and appreciation of the world 
to-day as they need to know it. The teacher’s desk or the 
school library should be provided with such books as Bogart’s 
or Coman’s ‘Industrial History of the United States,” Brig- 
ham’s or Semple’s books on “‘ Geographic Influences in Ameri- 
can History,” and Sparks’s “Expansion of the American 
People.”
-P-A-G-E-550
  454 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Characteristic Movements.—There are certain character- 
istic movements which should guide the teacher in placing the 
emphasis and in supplementing the material furnished by 
the text-book. One of the most important is emigration 
from Europe, both in the Colonial and in the national periods; 
its causes, ways and means, and results in settlement. From 
this study it will appear that even in the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries the American population had several 
important elements besides the English, namely, Scotch- 
Trish, German, Dutch, and French. Another great topic is 
the westward movement: Routes, location of settlements, 
occupations adopted, cities, and their spheres of influence, 
and development of means of communication. Still another 
topic is the change from household industries to the factory 
system. It is also necessary to follow carefully the develop- 
ment of the plantation system in its relation to slavery, espe- 
cially after the invention of the cotton-gin seemed to be 
making cotton “king.” The renewal of the South after the 
war and the rapid development of the Far West should be 
made prominent during the latter part of the course. These 
are not topics to be treated once or twice, but are to be kept 
constantly in mind as long-continued processes, furnishing 
points of view from which to organize much of the work. 
Relations of History and Geography.—Geography and 
chronology have been called the two eyes of history. Some 
theorists believe that history can dispense with one of them, 
declaring that “Freed from chronology, the near and the 
remote may become equally potent in the life of the child.” 
Teachers occasionally make the contrary mistake and resolve 
history into lists of names and dates. The commonest error, 
however, is to fail in appreciating the close relations between 
history and geography. It is not enough to require the 
pupils to locate on the map places mentioned in the text, or 
to see that they become familiar with changing boundary- 
lines and territorial extensions—they must be taught to view 
historical movements in their geographical setting. Two or 
three illustrations will show how this may be accomplished.
-P-A-G-E-551
HISTORY 455 
Geography and the Occupation of the Mississippi Valley. 
—In order to understand the struggle of the French and the 
English for the Mississippi Valley, the pupil must first study 
the Appalachian barrier and the passes by which it may be 
penetrated. He will then realize the advantage which the 
French gained by the founding of Quebec and Montreal and 
the discovery of the upper lakes. The consequence was that 
Father Marquette reached the Mississippi River within two 
years after the Virginians had with difficulty made their way 
over the Blue Ridge as far as the headwaters of the Kanawha. 
At the southern end of the Mississippi Valley the French 
occupation under Iberville barely anticipated the seizure of 
the country by Englishmen from the Carolinas. Meanwhile 
the English had begun their encroachments on the north from 
the Hudson Bay country and, more directly, at the mouth 
of the St. Lawrence. Such a struggle becomes far clearer in 
its geographical setting than if its chronology alone serves 
as a means of organizing details. 
Westward Movement.—The method is equally useful in 
presenting the westward movement in the nineteenth century, 
when natural features were being modified by the construc- 
tion of canals and the use of steamboats upon the waterways 
of the interior as well as later by the building of railroads. 
Study of Wars.—In teaching the history of the important 
wars the geographical setting should be used, treating chro- 
nology as secondary. For example, in the Revolutionary 
War the position of the Colonial armies between the coast 
and, the mountains, the possession of the sea as a base by the 
British, with incursions inland as characteristic incidents, are 
vital elements in the presentation, and if properly handled 
will make the struggle more intelligible to the pupils. The 
loss of the sea-base in the Yorktown campaign was fatal to 
the British cause. 
Civil War.—Soon after the Civil War opened the North 
had secure control of the sea as a base of operations against 
any part of the long coast-line of the Confederacy. On the 
land side there were two theatres of conflict, one east of the  
-P-A-G-E-552
  
456 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Appalachian barrier, the other west. A study of the early 
Confederate lines of defense in the West reveals the use made 
of the high bluffs on the Mississippi, of navigable waterways 
like the Tennessee and the Cumberland, of railroad centres 
like Bowling Green and Corinth, and of mountain gaps. 
Similar illustrations may be found in the geographical fea- 
tures of Virginia. It is far clearer to set the facts in such a 
geographical framework than to group them only by cam- 
paigns or by years. 
Management of Work: Plans.—The teacher should, be- 
fore the opening of the term, make out a detailed plan, with 
lesson assignments including the minor topics to be empha- 
sized during the lesson, and even the more important ques- 
tions which may be asked. The lessons may be grouped 
under the head of larger topics, as ‘‘Colonial Immigration,” 
or the ‘‘Westward Movement,” or the ‘Slavery Conflict.” 
Some teachers place in vertical columns the subject matter 
of a term’s work, divided horizontally into the approximate 
portions which are to be covered. When history and geog- 
raphy are placed together, evident correlations may be 
utilized. The aim is not to construct a rigid scheme, but 
only a working plan, subject to modifications as the lessons 
proceed. Without it the management of the work will fre- 
quently be left to the chance suggestions of overcrowded 
hours.* 
Graded Work.—As the work should include, besides the 
mastery of the text-book, other tasks: for example, type 
lessons, map-making, studies from pictures, readings, com- 
parisons, summaries of long-continued movements, reviews 
of periods, etc., these should appear in the plan in their ap- 
propriate position. Several of them imply training and 
should be graded from the more simple to the more complex 
and difficult. Their place in the plan should be studied care- 
fully, in order that the interest of the pupil may be stimu- 
lated and that he may become conscious that the study of 
1See also the plans given in Strayer’s “The Teaching Process.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-553
  HISTORY _ 457 
history will give him increase in intelligent skill as well as 
stores of information. For example, the exercises in the 
construction of maps should be graded, like lessons in draw- 
ing. The utilization of pictures is another illustration. A 
sufficient interval of time should separate one exercise from 
another of the same kind to avoid monotony. 
Lesson Assignments.—Some teachers spend a part, even 
half, of the recitation period in preparing the pupils to learn 
the next lesson. They give them an outline on leading ques- 
tions, or go over the paragraphs in detail in order to teach 
the pupils how to study. Here again a method which may 
be necessary in the early stages of the work must be modified 
later. The pupil should gain the power to organize and 
master material with which he is unfamiliar. He should not 
get the notion that the work is to be done for him. Probably 
at no time in the course can he be left solely to his own 
initiative, but the amount and nature of the suggestions 
should be changed as his capacity develops. The amount 
varies also with the nature of the material of the particular 
lesson. In some cases this material is all narrative or it is 
on the same topic and is of simple character, while in other 
cases the text seems to be a collection of names and places, 
set in unfamiliar circumstances, and the child’s imagination 
is pulled and hauled about until it is hopelessly bewildered. 
Text-Book.—The first care of the teacher is that the 
pupils understand how to read the text-book. She should 
be on the watch for words, phrases, and general statements 
above the mental level of the class. The pupils should be 
encouraged to discover these and point them out. Text- 
books often contain generalizations, dictated by the need of 
brevity, which are mere words to the pupil unacquainted 
with the details upon which the statement is based. More- 
over, the act of generalization is largely beyond his capacity 
in this field. The teacher must, accordingly, be ready to 
substitute simple, illustrative details. By constantly in- 
sisting that the text-book shall be understood and by help-
-P-A-G-E-554
  458 © TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
fully guiding his study, the teacher is assisting the pupil to 
form the habit of alert reading. The length of the text-book 
assignment cannot be fixed arbitrarily, for at a particular 
stage of the work a good plan may call for other tasks, a 
map, perhaps, or a type lesson.1 
Outlines.—The making of a lesson outline may have a 
double value; it gives the pupil a better understanding of the 
subject matter, and it trains his mind in the orderly arrange- 
ment of facts. It is a task which he must be taught, and 
one which, as he proceeds, may well call for greater skill in 
thoughtful analysis. The teacher may furnish the outlines 
at first, but soon she should require the pupils to assist her 
or to make them alone. If made by the pupil, they should 
be copied in his note-book, and the best one or two written 
on the blackboard. After the pupils have learned to make 
outlines some other task should be substituted, in order to 
avoid the danger that such work may become mechanical 
and dull. Pupils frequently save themselves the labor of 
real analysis by using in their outline the paragraph headings 
in the text-book. Instead of the outline, lists of questions or 
one or two problems may be assigned. The pupils may also 
be asked to suggest questions for which the statements in 
the text-book furnish no answer. The problem method of 
teaching history, or the large use of definite problems, aids in 
developing a thoughtful attitude toward social movements. 
Still other substitutes for the outline of the individual lesson 
are outlines of a movement which has been the leading topic 
for several lessons, or summaries of the characteristics of 
some party, or section of the country, or period. Variety 
and progress in the nature of the work are essential. 
Questioning.—The principal work of the recitation hour 
will be done through the question and answer. The teacher 
should not lecture to pupils in the elementary grades. Ex- 
planations may be given, facts may be added to those stated 
1See McMurry’s “How to Study, and Teaching Children How to Study,” 
and Dewey’s “How We Think.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-555
  HISTORY 459 
in the text-book, and illustrative incidents told, but these 
should play a subordinate part. The teacher should there- 
fore study thoughtfully the art of questioning. 
Two Cases.—The question may have one of two princi- 
pal aims. On the one hand, it may call for an answer pre- 
senting information contained in the text-book and in refer- 
ence reading, or, on the other hand, it may provoke thought 
upon the relation of one fact in the lesson to another. In 
the first case, the question should usually be so framed as to 
require a complete answer; it should not permit the pupil to 
give mere fragments of statement. It should therefore seize 
the heart of the matter. Pupils easily slip into the habit of 
answering with scraps of sentences, throwing upon the teacher 
the responsibility of drawing out other bits of information 
by further questioning. If the work in history is not to undo 
the work in English, such answers must not be tolerated. 
Sometimes the pupil is unable to organize the facts, because 
he has not learned how to study and to think. In such cases 
the teacher is justified in changing the form of the questions 
so that the power of orderly presentation may be developed. 
Undeveloped power should, however, not be confused with 
mental inertness. The teacher should remember that there 
are others in the class, and that by lingering too long over 
individual difficulties the life of the class may be destroyed: 
' It is better, for the most part, to deal with such cases 
privately. 
As questions, or problems, of the second kind call for 
thought in directions which the text-book does not always 
point out, the teacher should expect to guide the pupil’s 
mind, unless the relation of facts is simple or the problem 
readily solved. Suppose, for example, that the general topic 
is the Revolutionary War and the class is considering the cry 
of the colonists against ‘‘taxation without representation.” 
The teacher might ask the rather hard question: ‘““Why was 
the British retort that the colonists were represented as much 
as the people of Birmingham and Manchester not satisfac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-556
    
460 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tory?” The pupils would need guidance to see that they 
must first learn whether the colonists and the British officials 
had the same idea of representation, and that this could be 
found by comparing the system of representation in Massa- 
chusetts with that in England. Another problem which 
would have to be separated into its elements would be: ‘‘ Were 
the good people of New England justified in smuggling sugar 
and molasses from the French West Indies?” 
Maps.—The schoolroom should be furnished with a set 
of historical wall maps and with an historical atlas to supple- 
ment the maps contained in the text-book. All should be 
utilized as material for answers to simple problems in his- 
torical geography. In dealing with the discoveries and early 
explorations the maps made at that time should be utilized. 
Copies of these will be found in the text-book or in historical 
reference books and atlases. The difficulties of De Soto, 
Coronado, and La Salle are inconceivable from a modern map. 
The work should include the construction of maps, ordi- 
narily with the use of printed outlines of which many kinds 
exist. The pupils will not learn a map merely from looking 
at one, they will master its principal features only by repro- 
ducing them. Their most common task, however, should be 
working out special geographical situations. Historical maps 
are usually designed to illustrate the movements of a whole 
period, and are covered with names which have no bearing 
upon the situation under consideration. In studying the 
westward movement, for example, the pupil may be asked 
to mark on an outline map the principal roads and canals in 
existence in 1825, and, again, the earliest western railroads. 
The class should be taught both drawing in colors and draw- 
ing in black and white. Neatness, accuracy, and good taste 
should be required.: 
Pictures.—It is not enough to use pictures to stimulate 
the pupil’s interest in persons and places; they should, like 
maps, be treated as material for systematic study. This 
implies the existence of a collection sufficiently extensive to   
     
-P-A-G-E-557
    
HISTORY 401 
illustrate many phases of the subject. For example—to také 
the westward movement again—its understanding would be 
facilitated if the teacher could show photographs or postal- 
card reproductions of the St. Lawrence River, the Lachine 
Rapids, the Mohawk Valley, Wills Creek, the passes in the 
Blue Ridge, the upper Tennessee, and Cumberland Gap. 
In the same way, for the study of the modes of emigration, 
much use could be made of a set of pictures on the develop- 
ment of the ship from the time of the Venetians to the days 
of the Vaterland and the Aquitania, or later. Pictures are 
needed, also, as aids to a comprehension of the economic life 
of the country, its plantations, its western farms, its railroad 
centres and great canals. For the study of such topics, 
questions should be prepared the answers to which could be 
worked out from the pictures by the pupils. 
Reading.—In selecting books or passages in books for the 
pupils to read care should be taken that the descriptions or 
the narrative touch facts within the circle of the pupil’s in- 
terest and are presented in a simple form. In the case of 
books like Hart’s “Source Readers” this has been done al- 
ready by the editor. Books by able historians are not often 
adapted to the purpose, being addressed to mature men and 
women. The story must predominate. Biography is the 
most serviceable. It is not enough to find a book on a rec- 
ommended list; the teacher should personally see if it is 
adapted to the needs of her particular group. 
Note-Books.—In the elementary school the note-book 
should be used only as the collected form of the exercises as- 
signed to the children during the term. It should contain 
the assignment of lessons, the outlines given by the teacher 
or made under her direction, summaries, and maps. In it 
may well be kept the original of each examination-paper 
written by the pupil, with the teacher’s corrections. If the 
teacher gives from time to time important facts not con- 
1A list of firms publishing pictures and postal cards may be found in the 
History Teachers’ Magazine for June, 1913.
-P-A-G-E-558
  462 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tained in the text-book, these may be entered in the note- 
book from the teacher’s dictation. The pupils should not be 
expected to take notes from oral explanations given in any 
other way. Above all, no mere task work should appear in 
the note-books; indeed, no such work should be required. 
SUMMARY 
1. History enables the pupil to understand more fully the community 
of which he is a member. 
2. History quickens local pride and national patriotism, by showing 
that men and women of past generations have contributed to 
the growth both of the individual community and of the whole 
country. 
3- The course in history should be continuous and its parts should 
be carefully correlated. 
4. For the earlier grades the material should be concrete—facts within 
the range of the pupil’s experience and presented in the form 
of story or simple description. 
5. The work of the last three grades should open with stories, de- 
scriptions, and explanations chosen from the European back- 
ground, that is, from the beginnings in Europe of customs and 
ways of living which we use in America. 
6. Industrial and social facts should not be crowded out by the story 
of politics, wars, and governmental institutions. 
7. In presenting historical facts the geographical setting should be 
more frequently and intelligently used. 
8. The term’s work should be carefully planned, in order that the 
pupils may not merely accumulate facts but gain in ability to 
comprehend historical situations and to distinguish between 
the true and the false. : 
9. In the methods employed variety and progress are essential. 
to. The teacher should select collateral reading, with a view to the 
needs and capacity of the pupil. Only carefully sifted lists 
should be relied upon.

CIVICS 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
Whom do you regard as the most efficient citizens of your com- 
munity? How did they gain their civic power? What did 
schools contribute? 
. Is it true that in a democracy every intelligent ah able-bodied 
person has both public and private duties? Is this true for 
women as well as men? 
. In what ways is citizenship manifested? What are the marks 
of a good citizen? 
Is there any public co-operative work in the way of improving 
the schools, eliminating saloons, getting pure water, improved 
streets, better roads, abler public officials, or improved com- 
munity recreation, that is not being done in your community? 
Why isn’t it? 
. What is the proportion of young women to young men who are 
getting a high-school and college education in your state? Do 
educated women have more or less leisure for civic leadership 
than educated men to-day? 
What civic questions should be discussed by the people of your 
community? Where may they best meet for such discussion? 
Who should lead and suggest such public meetings? 
In what ways have you learned about civic opportunities and 
responsibilities? May a person know a great deal about civic 
needs and how to meet them and not do anything? Why? 
What stories or biographies can children read that will inspire 
them with right ideals of citizenship? 
How can we get children to act out, to live, and make habitual 
good citizenship ? 
What is the relative value of time spent on community civics and 
on apothecaries’ weight and other similar phases of arithmetic? 
I. Tue Propiem or Civic Epucation 
Civic Efficiency is one of the five great aims of education. 
The nation that grows weak and uninterested civically is 
465
-P-A-G-E-562
  
406 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
doomed to decay or revolution. The democracy which does 
not educate for vigorous and intelligent citizenship breaks 
down into a lower type of social organization. The indi- 
vidual who does not gain that education through participa- 
tion which a democracy affords can attain neither a high 
type of social efficiency nor self-realization and continued 
growth. As Aristotle long ago pointed out, a democracy is a 
highly complex and delicate type of social organization which 
can succeed only when its educational system trains for 
democracy. He could not vision the tremendously complex 
civilization in which we, in the hope of achieving thereby a 
larger measure and a finer type of individual and social hap- 
piness, are trying out the experiment of democratic living. 
He probably would have considered democracy under our 
conditions impossible. 
Lowell tells us in his lecture on democracy that after the 
American constitution had been adopted, and the govern- 
ment with its duly elected officers had been started, people 
quite generally thought they had at last constructed a per- 
petual-motion machine—a self-active automatism which 
would run forever without their thought or care. Instead, 
they had entered upon a new and fragile type of co-operative 
life in a great continent millions of times larger and more 
populous than the Greek city-state democracy of old, and in 
an age when constant change and invention would keep life 
in an increasing turmoil of complexity and readjustment. 
They had done away with the king and queen at the top and 
they had made every man a king and every woman a queen. 
They had added to the private duties, which every one must 
bear, a great host of public duties. They had vastly increased 
the opportunities and possibilities of human life, but they 
had also greatly increased its dangers and responsibilities. 
What if people refused to meet their new public duties and 
went on as before in their pursuit of private gain? What if 
the rich and powerful should gain control of the government, 
as in cases where democracy had been attempted in times

past, and should gradually usurp all rights and privileges and 
make peasants and serfs of the masses of the people as they 
did in ancient Rome? What if great immigrant hordes 
should come to our shores—as they have indeed come—and 
fail to take up in its fulness and richness the democratic life ? 
What if we should not be able to banish or avoid poverty, in- 
justice, criminality, exploitation of our natural and human 
resources, preventable death and disease, and the great fears 
and evils which those who sought these shores and framed 
our government so fondly hoped they might forever prevent 
in this virgin land? 
The wide-spread failure to realize these hopes Washington, 
Jefferson, Franklin, and others were kindly not permitted to 
forevision. Some of them lived to see that nothing less than 
a universal moulding of human nature along democratic lines 
would make possible the success of their great experiment. 
Some of them talked of general schooling of the masses or of 
special schooling of the leaders. Jefferson founded the Uni- 
versity of Virginia; Washington left a large sum, for those 
days, to found a national university at Washington; Franklin 
founded what later became the University of Pennsylvania. 
The Ordinance of the Northwest Territory treated specifically 
of education, although the Constitution contains no word on 
the subject, and set aside a section of land in every township 
with which to foster free schools. “The schools the hope of 
democracy’’ finally became a battle-cry and a fixed convic- 
tion of many people. From 1820 to 1850 the struggle for 
free schools was on. In 1828 a man was arrested on the 
court-house steps of Philadelphia for speaking publicly in 
favor of free tax-supported public schools. ‘Rank socialism 
and paternalism,” they said. 
“Why should I who have no children be taxed for the 
schooling of other men’s children?” asked one. ‘Why 
should I who am already paying for the education of my 
children in private and parochial schools have to pay still 
more for the education of those who cannot afford such
-P-A-G-E-566

schools!’ exclaimed another. In Pennsylvania in 1835, a 
year after the free-school law had been passed, hundreds of 
lengthy petitions were sent in to the governor and assembly 
to force the repeal of the obnoxious law; the governor who 
had helped pass it was thrown out of office at the next elec- 
tion, and it was only through the eloquence of Thaddeus 
Stevens, backed by many devotees of democracy, far-visioned 
and disinterested citizens, that the law remained intact. 
Such was the struggle and the outcome in other states! 
Full manhood suffrage in all states did not become a reality 
until about the same time, and woman suffrage is only to-day 
making every woman a queen in opportunity as well as in 
responsibility and giving her the education and happiness 
which can come only from a broad participation in our demo- 
cratic life. ‘Education through participation” is as true a 
motto for grown-ups as it is for children. 
The Civic Failure of Schooling——But the schools have\ 
lamentably failed to fulfil the civic functions expected of 
them by the forefathers. As suggested in our first chapter, 
the blind cannot well be leaders of the blind, and only civi- 
cally educated men and women can be expected to furnish, 
as teachers, the civic education anticipated by our fore- 
fathers. The people have largely forgotten this civic func- 
tion. They have not demanded and paid for men and women 
of maturity and professional training who would lead their 
children and their communities toward civic efficiency as an 
important goal of education. Our teachers, from the kinder- 
garten to the college, have had little direct training or par- 
ticipation in American citizenship; their knowledge of civic 
affairs is meagre and inadequate, since they have studied 
other matters; most of them are women, and as such have 
been denied the prime stimulus of participation and respon- 
sibility needed for developing a live interest in civic affairs; 
and, in general, the teaching body has not yet become effec- 
tive in promoting adequate American citizenship. 
Teachers have, of course, contributed much indirectly.
-P-A-G-E-567
  CIVICS 409 
The ability to read and write and a little knowledge of Ameri- 
can history is of value. Some schools have even given some 
knowledge of the framework of our government in the form 
of “civics,” usually taught in subordination to some other 
subject, such as history. But this instruction has been of 
the driest and most non-functioning kind, consisting mostly 
of the study of the legal powers, salaries, and terms of office 
of government officials, with next to nothing about what these 
officials really do for us or how we can help them in return. 
The subject, really one of civic hygiene, has been made one 
of civic anatomy instead. Formerly, the method of amend- 
ing the Federal Constitution, the qualifications of judges of 
the supreme court, and the details of the proceedings in im- 
peachment cases were regarded as fundamental knowledge. 
To-day, knowledge, habits, ideals, and appreciations closely 
related to promoting community welfare, and through these 
and out of these, state, national, and world welfare, are being 
emphasized. 
In the past the teacher has not even had good text-books 
with which to teach citizenship, the texts being largely man- 
uals of the Federal Constitution. No books were written on 
the methods of teaching citizenship to which the teacher 
could refer. Hardly any effective experimentation in civic 
education was carried on. Normal schools and colleges gave 
little help, and the high schools were busy teaching other less 
valuable things. General literature in books and magazines 
contained little that was instructive or stimulating in this 
direction, and what was published lacked a style that would 
encourage reading. The great civic stories of all ages had 
not been selected for school use, and pupil self-government 
had hardly been given a trial. 
“To-day the civic aim is beginning to be recognized. A 
great multitude of new agencies, public and private, have 
been established for promoting civic intelligence and civic 
welfare; while examples in participation in school and com- 
munity government and co-operation may be found on every
-P-A-G-E-568
  47° TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
hand. Moreover, an increasing number of good civics texts 
are available, and there is little excuse for the schools not 
helping the people to realize this great aim of civic efficiency. 
As a minimal essential in any program of democratic school- 
ing, effective training in citizenship ranks high. That it will 
be one of the few required courses in elementary, secondary, 
and higher schools before very long is already apparent. 
Our present need is adequate and scientific selection of sub- 
ject matter, methods, and administration of civic instruction. 
II. A Procram or Civic EpucATION 
The old course in civics having lamentably failed within 
recent years, whatever its success may have been in the “‘sev- 
enties” and “eighties” when it was being generally intro- 
duced into the schools, the question is put directly up to the 
educators: “Have you anything better to take its place?” 
Fortunately, this may be answered in the affirmative, and 
the remainder of this chapter will be devoted to a discus- 
sion of the new type of civics. 
Tueory oF THE New Crvics.—The object of teaching, generally, 
may be stated as twofold: First, cultural, to acquaint the child with 
his environment; second, practical, to train for citizenship. There 
are various sorts of environment, each with its corresponding field of 
study. Among others is that man-made, social environment which 
we term the community, and the study of which we call civics. The 
community has been well-defined as a group of people in a single 
locality, bound together by common interests and subject to common 
rules or laws. And the various types of community include the home, 
the school, the church, the shop, the state. A citizen is any one who 
participates in community action, sharing its privileges and properly 
subject to a share in its duties and responsibilities. The good citizen 
is one who manfully shoulders his obligations as a citizen and performs 
his part well as a member of his community. All are citizens, whether 
young or old, for all are members of one or more of these communities 
—always including the state. 
Civics, then, on its cultural side is the study of that social environ- 
ment we call the community; on its practical side it is a training for 
efficient community service and particularly in that type of commu-

-P-A-G-E-570

-P-A-G-E-571
cIVIcs 471 
nity which we term the state. And this leads us to the conclusion 
that civics as a school subject includes both a curriculum of studies 
and a curriculum of activities. How far away this leads us from the 
old-time book-memorizing endurance test can well be imagined. 
The steps in this newer sort of civic training would naturally be: 
first, to secure a fund of practical information about civic problems; 
second, to arouse interest in these problems; third, to stimulate to 
such co-operation with community agencies as the maturity and ex- 
perience of the pupil enables him (or her) to offer—for, be it remem- 
bered, the ‘“‘good citizen” must be good for something. Equally pat- 
ent, it would seem, but so long overlooked in the teaching of civics, 
is the method of approach. From the near to the remote, from the 
simple fo the complex, from the concrete to the abstract, from func- 
tion to structure, from the small problem to the greater, from local to 
state and national, from matters of current interest to those of origin 
and growth—how else than by this method—at once scientific and 
common-sense—can the live interest of boys and girls be roused and 
their wills and attitudes be trained to lend a hand wherever they 
can? And this making of good-for-something citizens—of city, state, 
and nation—is the final goal of the New Civics.' 
Ill. Te Inpranaporis PLAN 
Two main types of civic education for the elementary 
school are emerging from the various attempts to organize 
this. work along new lines, which may be termed the “In- 
dianapolis Plan” and the ‘Philadelphia Plan,” respectively. 
While one in aim and in point of view, these differ materially 
in method and in detail. Each has much to learn of the 
other, and in time the two methods will no doubt become 
substantially identical. 
The following brief description of the civics work in the 
Indianapolis schools is based on a careful analysis of it made 
by one of its promoters, Mr. Arthur W. Dunn, and given by 
him in Bulletin No. 17, 1915, U. S. Bureau of Education. 
Civics Correlated with Other Activities in First Seven 
Grades.—In Indianapolis civics is not taught as a separate 
subject till the eighth grade, though it permeates all the work 
1 Quotation from Professor Barnard’s article in The Annals for September, 
1916, a volume entitled ‘‘ New Possibilities in Education.”
-P-A-G-E-572
472 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of the school from the first year to the eighth. Mr. Dunn 
says of this that the aim is “to make of education, not a 
process of instruction in a variety of subjects, but a process 
of living, of growth, during which the various relations of 
life are unfolded—civic, geographical, historical, ethical, vo- 
cational, and so on,” following largely Professor Dewey’s 
ideas. Accordingly, the English, the mathematics, the geog- 
raphy, the history, the construction work, even the school 
gardening and the playground activities, are correlated and 
utilized as a part of the child’s civic education. 
Naturally, history and geography are the studies that 
lend themselves most easily to the “socializing” process. 
Throughout the fourth year geography serves as “the chief 
centre for the organization of historical and civic knowledge,” 
while the sixth year finds history sharing this honor. Wher- 
ever practicable, the work in English composition, both oral 
and written, “draws largely for its materials” on both the 
geography and the history, and “affords an opportunity for 
the discussion of civic questions.” 
What is more remarkable than the civic history and civic 
geography is the “community arithmetic.” This is nothing 
more nor less than the ordinary arithmetic getting its data 
from the life in which the children participate and “fixing 
important social and civic ideas” in their minds. But imag- 
ine a course in arithmetic that trains the pupil to calculate 
the cost of furnishing a real home, of lighting and heating it, 
of providing the food and other necessities for a day or a week, 
always having in mind the possible savings that may be 
effected by careful buying; and that then goes to work on 
some of the “‘actual operations or transactions in the indus- 
tries of Indianapolis.” And what is more, the business men 
of that city are helping to formulate these problems in “com- 
munity arithmetic.” From these the transition is easily 
made to problems relating to the various governmental agen- 
cies of the city, such as the fire department or the city hos- 
pital. Naturally, the problems “vary from school to school  
-P-A-G-E-573
cIvIcs 473 
and from time to time, in accordance with current interest 
and occasion.” 
Emphasis has been placed on the “community arithmetic” 
because it so well illustrates the method and the point of 
view of the Indianapolis plan of training boys and girls to 
be intelligent, effective citizens now. Citizenship is theirs al- 
ready; good citizenship must be achieved and made habitual. 
The Eighth Year.—The stated course in civics for the 
eighth year is a rapid survey of the various elements of civic 
welfare, such as the protection of life and property, the safe- 
guarding of health, the affording of means of education, of 
recreation, etc. Rightly, this is “not primarily an analysis 
of government.”’ It is intended, rather, ‘to give the pupil 
an organized conception of what his membership in the com- 
munity means. Government is discussed throughout the 
course as the supreme means by which the entire community 
may co-operate for the common welfare. At the end of the 
course the main features of governmental organization are 
discussed in the light of what has preceded. . . . Co-opera- 
tive activity for the common good is the key-note to the 
entire course.” 
Advantages and Disadvantages.—The great element of 
strength in this plan is at the same time its source of possible 
weakness, namely, the perfect co-ordination of all the work 
of all the teachers who must co-operate every day in the 
year to make the plan a success. One can see that, as new 
teachers are constantly coming into the school system, the 
most careful supervision is necessary. In order that the 
plan may succeed there must be unremitting vigilance, to- 
gether with unusual tact and sympathy in the supervisors. 
That Indianapolis believes it has succeeded with a plan so 
ideal is a great tribute to the organization and personnel of 
its school system. 
And now for a somewhat different method, that has iden- 
tically the same object in view—education for civic efficiency.

474 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
IV. THE PHILADELPHIA PLAN 
The Philadelphia Plan is based on the idea that the work 
in civics will gain in effectiveness if it is regularly scheduled, 
by name, in every year of the elementary school, for at least 
two periods each week. The civic training thus becomes as 
steady and as cumulative as that in English or in mathe- 
matics. Moreover, this arrangement enables the distinctively 
civic material that lies scattered throughout the various sub- 
jects of the elementary curriculum, much of which would 
ordinarily be lost, to be gathered up and combined with the 
more strictly governmental concepts that enter into any 
course in civics. For example, “public sanitation”’ is lifted 
bodily out of the course in physiology and hygiene and set 
down, gently but firmly, in the civics course. This results in 
confining hygiene to its individual application (personal hy- 
giene), while community hygiene is given its appropriate so- 
cial setting and application. 
In classes with the single class-teacher in charge the trans- 
ition from “individual” to “community” hygiene, for ex- 
ample, is made so easily and naturally, regardless of the 
“label” on each, as to be imperceptible to the pupil. Where 
the departmental system is in vogue this transition is more 
noticeable, but the pupil is not troubled by it, as it blends 
into the general characteristics of the system itself. In 
either case, the pupil runs no risk of having his civic educa- 
tion encroached upon and minimized by other studies in the 
curriculum, or by lack of co-operation among the teachers. 
Experience shows that in the ordinary school the indistinct 
subject gets lost in the school’s activities. The civic aim of 
education is too large to be lost because lesser subjects fill 
the program. 
If the following description of the Philadelphia course is 
in more detail than the account already given of the Indian- 
apolis course, this is due solely to the writer’s greater famil- 
jarity with the former, since he helped to formulate it. Mr.

-P-A-G-E-576

-P-A-G-E-577
CIVICS 475 
Dunn has given details on the Indianapolis plan in the bul- 
letin mentioned. 
Details of the Plan.—In the earlier grades the attempt is 
made to organize the teaching of the basic civic virtues, such 
as obedience, cleanliness, orderliness, courtesy, helpfulness, 
punctuality, truthfulness, thoroughness, honesty, and the 
like. Knowledge and ideals of these are inculcated through 
stories, poems, games, and dramatization of the stories told 
by the teacher.- Habits are encouraged by helping children 
to act out and to live the ideals. As stated elsewhere by 
the writer, the aim is threefold: “To establish right habits of 
thought and action in the children; to project these habits 
into the home and into their other relationships as well; to 
show the pupils how all community life is based on the em- 
bodiment of these virtues in each member of society.” 
Later, the pupils are made acquainted with that all- 
embracing community life round about them, wider than the 
home and school, which is constantly ministering to their 
needs and without which they would perish. They come to 
learn of the services rendered them and their families in a 
personal way by the milkman, the baker, the grocer, the 
plumber, the doctor, the dressmaker, and others. And from 
these the transition is easy to those equally personal services 
rendered by the policeman, the fireman, the street-sweeper, 
the ashes and garbage collectors; and then the pupils are 
ready to project their thinking to those who bring water and 
gas and electricity and the telephone into their homes, who 
transport them from one place to another, who make it pos- 
sible for them to communicate with their friends by letter. 
It is believed that through this process the young citizens 
may come to understand and appreciate what this great out- 
side world is doing for them and what they may do in return. 
What is more, they will discover that those who are doing 
the worth-while work of the world must embody those very 
civic virtues of punctuality, courtesy, thoroughness, and 
honesty that they themselves are being trained to practise.

476 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The day may not be far distant when all may learn that 
“good civics” and ‘good business” are synonymous terms. 
The Local Occupations.—For purposes more or less local, 
but believed to be of application in or near any industrial 
community, one whole year (the sixth) is devoted to the 
great industries that have made Philadelphia famous, and 
to the varied occupations of the city, many of which are open 
to boys and girls. While serving as a sort of vocational- 
guidance course, both for those who are to leave early and 
for those who are to remain longer, this “industrial-civics” 
year will fail of its purpose if it does not impress. the youngster 
with the essential equality of the workers and the marked 
inferiority of the drones. The “blind-alley” occupations, 
often more attractive at the start than those which lead 
somewhere, are carefully noted, as well as the ethics of get- 
ting and keeping a job. 
The Seventh and Eighth Years.—During the last two 
years the work is based on the idea of discovering how the 
various elements of civic welfare—namely, health, protec- 
tion of life and property, education, recreation, civic beauty, 
communication, transportation, wealth (the making of a liv- 
ing)—are secured to each pupil and his family through com- 
munity action. That is, in return for the specialized service 
rendered the community by the father or mother, the com- 
munity, through the medium of wages or salary, does all 
those things for the family in return. Unfortunately, there 
are some who either cannot or will not secure these elements 
of welfare for themselves except in a way which the com- 
munity regards as anti-social. These naturally become wards 
of the state, and must be aided by the community both for 
its own protection and for the possible reformation of the 
offender. These last are considered under the captions of 
“Charities” and “Correction.” 
Then follow two closing sections, entitled, ‘‘How our laws 
are made”’ and “Party government,” each of which is self- 
explanatory. It might be well to add, however, that the
-P-A-G-E-579
CIVICS 477 
latter includes a brief discussion of party organization and 
election machinery, so far as either would be of interest and 
value to the class. 
Methods.—Each general topic receives a threefold treat- 
ment: first, the approach, where the topic as a whole is pre- 
sented to the class in some vivid fashion that shall arouse 
the pupils’ interest and make them see its importance; sec- 
ond, the agencies, public and private, through which the 
community secures the end it is seeking; and third, the re- 
sponsibility of the young citizens of the class to co-operate 
to the best of their ability with the various civic agencies. 
Numerous trips—for example, to the fire-station, to a fil- 
tration plant, to a garbage-disposal plant, and to museums 
—help to make more real to the pupils both the services ren- 
dered and those who render them; and especially when these 
trips are followed by class reports and discussions. 
The progression is usually from city to state to nation, 
not forgetting to emphasize the part played by private or- 
ganizations. The latter is done for two reasons: first, be- 
cause the work of governmental departments, bureaus, etc., 
cannot be understood apart from the help they receive from 
private organizations; and second, because the young people 
must come to appreciate the fact that these voluntary asso- 
ciations are the principal means through which the ordinary 
citizens can unite most effectively for civic endeavor. 
Junior High School Civics.—It is altogether likely that 
should the complete junior high school (grades seven and 
eight and first-year high school) finally arrive, the last of 
these years will find room for at least a term of advanced 
vocational civics. This will continue the vocational infor- 
mation begun in the earlier grade, and give the boys and 
girls some notion of the larger industrial or professional op- 
portunities that lie ahead for those who go through the senior 
high school. Moreover, they must discover that the high- 
est type of good citizen is the one who “‘does not allow him- 
self to become so engrossed in the process of making a living  
-P-A-G-E-580
  478 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
as to lose sight of those other duties of good citizenship that 
he owes to family and friends, to society generally and, above 
all, to the state.” 
Knowing and Doing.—Naturally, as already indicated, the 
new civics includes both a curriculum of studies and a curric- 
ulum of activities. The latter must vary from time to time 
and from place to place, but might include the following 
collective activities: a certain measure of student self-gov- 
ernment; junior civic leagues; organized war on destructive 
insects; co-operation with civic organizations or even with 
governmental agencies for neighborhood improvement. 
Further Suggestions on Method.—While the following 
suggestions on method are based primarily on the Phila- 
delphia course, yet they are believed to be applicable to any 
civics course that is planned on substantially the same lines, 
whether for a large city or a small one. The only variation 
that might occur is in the discussion of industrial or voca- 
tional civics. 
As already stated, the early training in the basic civic 
virtues would be carried on through stories, poems, songs, 
games, and dramatization. These should be based, wherever 
possible, on situations that arise in the schoolroom or on 
the playground. Each of these is helpful in its own way, 
for each one helps to form the habit of right social action. 
No unusual literary or dramatic power is needed by the 
teacher. However, there is one ability that she must ac- 
quire, and that is the art of having a chat about the story 
or poem or whatever it may be, in the course of which, by 
skilful questioning, she gives the little folks themselves the 
chance to point the civic moral. This they will do with enthu- 
siasm and a sincerity that speaks well for the future. 
The Doing Side.—So much for the appreciative side of 
these lessons; now for the doing side; for it must be re- 
membered that the New Civics is both a curriculum of studies 
and a curriculum of activities. A certain fourth grade known 
to the writer has a “make-over club” which resulted from
-P-A-G-E-581
CIVICS 479 
the study of Thrift. Each member, to get in or to stay in, 
must do some thrifty act which is vouched for to the class. 
Careful cleaning and mending of the clothing so that it will 
last a little longer, saving of waste-paper and proper spend- 
ing of the money received for it, making simple repairs about 
the house—these are only a few of the many reports that 
are made to the class at any civics period when the club is 
holding a business meeting. This is all very real to the chil- 
dren, it is continuous and not spasmodic, and it helps to 
lay a secure foundation of economic independence and civic 
strength. Any one of the virtues will lend itself equally 
well to some form of civic activity. 
In the study of the services rendered each pupil and his 
family by the community round about him, and of how he 
may lend a hand, the progression of thought is: dependence, 
interdependence, service. And until the seventh grade is 
reached, the personal and human side must be kept in the 
foreground, to the practical exclusion of organization or 
legal powers. ‘Biographical Civics” might be a good name 
for it. The boys and girls are still in the idealizing, in the 
hero-worshipping stage. They are primarily interested in 
people that are doing things—in Mr. Policeman, Mr. Fire- 
man, Mr. Street-sweeper; and this personifying of com- 
munity activity is worth keeping even for the long-range 
personal services where those who render them are not or- 
dinarily visible to the children. 
No needless worry should be indulged in by the teacher 
that she is lacking in definite information about any one of 
these dignitaries. All the information needed—say about 
Mr. Plumber or Mr. Carpenter or Mr. Policeman—will be 
given-with a rush by the class. The teacher’s function is 
not to pour in a stream of facts, but to help the children 
organize their own fund of information along civic lines, so 
that they may rightly appreciate the services rendered by 
each of these community servants and at the same time 
store up a fund" of civic ideals that shall guide them later
-P-A-G-E-582
  
  480 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
as adult citizens. It must not be forgotten that throughout 
this course information is only a means to an end—a sort 
of by-product in the training process that is to turn out 
virile citizens. 
Any comprehensive survey of industrial life and of voca- 
tional opportunities, no matter how elementary it may be, 
can hardly be conducted without the use of popular but 
accurate write-ups of the various industries and occupations 
to be studied. The hearty co-operation of private organiza- 
tions—such as the local Chamber of Commerce or Board 
of Trade, the Consumers’ League, Women’s Clubs, etc.— 
can be enlisted in the preparation of the write-ups. These 
may be planned for use by the teachers or directly by the 
pupils themselves. 
More Mature Study.—Coming now to the more mature 
work of the seventh and eighth grades, based on a study of 
the elements of civic welfare, some of the suggestions already 
made call for further elaboration. 
The approach mentioned above, though it usuaily need 
take but one or two periods, is of vital importance to the 
success of the work; for it is here that the pupils come to 
see the importance of the topic as a whole both to the com- 
munity generally and to themselves in particular. If the 
topic is the protection of life and property, the class should 
discover in the approach that if it were not for the protect- 
ing arm the community throws around them, they and their 
parents and their neighbors would be in constant peril, from 
one day’s end to the other. This end may be reached by 
having the class enumerate the dangers that beset them on 
every hand; or, if preferred, the class may name the various 
safeguards they know of that the community has thrown 
up for their defense. In either case, the list would be long 
and impressive. The same sort of treatment would serve 
when discussing the topic of health. Various methods of 
approach to these and other topics will suggest themselves 
to the resourceful teacher. .
-P-A-G-E-583
  CIVICS 481 
In considering the various civic agencies, public and 
private, a beginning would naturally be made with those 
which touch the pupil or at least come within the range of 
his experience. This means that the order of progression is 
usually from local to state and then to national. Moreover, 
the order of interest is found to be from function to struc- 
ture, from the administrative department which does things 
to the legislative which plans the things to be done, and the 
judicial which interprets and helps to carry out what has 
already been planned—not the reverse. 
The importance of frequent class or other group trips 
to see the agencies under consideration, with the inevitable 
class report and discussion, can hardly be overemphasized. 
A larger part of a civics laboratory lies outside the school- 
room, and obviously the pupils can use this material only 
where it is to be found. This is better understood in Euro- 
pean than in American schools, and in some instances it 
may be necessary to do a little missionary work with the 
school authorities. 
Programs for junior civic leagues or other school organi- 
zations of a civic nature would be hard to outline in advance, 
as they would depend so entirely on the interests of the pu- 
pils and the needs of the community. Any program lacking 
this prime essential of direct touch with the environment 
would be a waste of precious time and energy, for it would 
neither develop civic initiative nor train the judgment in 
dealing with community problems. Worse still it would 
probably deaden any interest that had already been aroused, 
and tend to put the whole study of civics back into the realm 
of the so-called “informational” subjects, from which valley

Mr. Dunn has probably given us the best formulation of 
the tests we may fairly apply to a civics course. He declares 
that unless the young citizen’s interest shall have been aroused
-P-A-G-E-584
  482 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
in community matters, with corresponding motives for par- 
ticipation therein; and unless, in addition, a fair degree of 
civic initiative and civic judgment shall have been cultivated 
in the boy or girl, these years of civic training will have been 
largely wasted. However, it must be remembered that the 
gains from such a course cannot be measured with a yardstick 
or weighed with a pair of scales. They must be evaluated 
gradually, as they shall appear in the civic life of the young 
people who grow up under its influence—as is true with all 
the subtler things in education. Present-day civic problems 
at the school, the home, and in the community and larger 
group are serious enough to-day to warrant the most careful 
study, experimentation, and testing of results. If an objec- 
tive scale for measuring all or a considerable share of the 
product, civic efficiency, can be devised, as is probable, so 
much the better.

be obtained by writing to the Superintendent of Public Schools, Philadel- 
phia, Pa. : 
SUMMARY 
1. Civic efficiency is one of the great aims of education, and no coun- 
try ever had a greater need for such efficiency as our own de- 
mocracy. 
2. The New Civics has for its twofold object the acquainting of the 
child with his social environment, the community, and the 
fitting of the child for citizenship in that community. 
3. The Indianapolis plan for accomplishing this includes teaching 
civics by means of all the studies of the curriculum, especially 
geography, history, and arithmetic through the earlier grades, 
and then teaching it as a separate subject in the eighth grade. 
4. In the Philadelphia plan, civics is taught as a separate subject for 
at least two periods a week throughout the elementary grades. 
5. The children learn of the civic virtues, of the community round 
about them and how it ministers to their needs, and of the 
wider community of state and nation. 
6. The industrial life and opportunities of Philadelphia are studied, 
its private agencies for social betterment and citizen co-opera- 
tion are considered, and student activities of a civic nature 
are encouraged.

CIVICS 483 
. The young people trained in the New Civics, by whatever method, 
if it has been a success, will grow up with civic initiative and 
judgment backed by an awakened social conscience. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
. If you have children above the third grade, try putting the opening 
exercises partly into their hands. Have a president, a vice- 
president, a secretary-treasurer elected and have them suggest 
and make up programs at least once a week. Have children 
report on current events at these meetings as well as sing, 
speak, read, discuss community problems, act out little dramas, 
etc. There are many possibilities in such meetings. 
. What can your school or class do to improve your school building 
and grounds? How can the children get trees planted, waste 
picked up, fences repaired, mud-holes filled, turning poles, see- 
saws, swings, and sand-boxes provided? Will a parent-teacher 
association help? Can there be established a school orchestra, 
or a community orchestra, meeting at the school? What other 
services to the school community can be rendered ? 
. Try to get the people of the community to organize for entertain- 
ment, public discussions of public questions (local, state, na- 
tional, and international), for spelling bees using words only 
needed in correspondence, for ciphering matches, and for gen- 
eral development of the spirit and habit of community co- 
operation. 
. What local community problems may be discussed with profit in 
the school and in what grades? Which of these problems may 
be started toward solution by the school children? What diffi- 
culties will arise? 
. Examine the leading text-books on civics and pick out those which 
you consider best. In what ways do they excel? 
. How much time’ should. be given to regular teaching of civics in 
class-periods in the first six years? How much time should 
be given in the seyenth, eighth, and ninth years? What stands 
in the way of giving such time? 
. Do youknow of any schools that seem to overlook the civic aim of 
education entirely, and why? Can the effects of such omission 
be noticed in the community life? 
. If you teach in a rural or village school get a copy of Field and 
Nearing’s ‘Community Civics,” and see what it offers your 
children, i

These may be secured from Government departments, bureaus or 
commissions, or from private organizations, or be made up by the 
pupils themselves. Use of class bulletin-boards, of filing cabinets, and 
plenty of shelf room will be found indispensable for this laboratory. 
The accumulation of this material will preferably be a slow process, 
depending upon both teacher and pupils in successive years.

The Problem.—We who share with parents the privilege 
unfolding and socializing the child’s nature must feel 
keenly the sacredness of our responsibility. Can we be sat- 
isfied to measure our work merely by the tests of reading, 
writing, and arithmetic? Can we be satisfied to judge even 
the moral status of a pupil by the old standard of stillness 
and subserviency? Surely we must aspire to something 
more. We must strive to promote the growth of the moral 
life of the child as definitely and as positively as we develop 
any other phases. 
We need to foresee the length and nature of the process. 
487

  488 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
A skilled teacher never grows impatient if a beginner forgets 
that two times three are six. She knows it takes time for 
him to learn numbers. But too frequently, if she instructs a 
child to treat his playmates as he himself wishes to be treated, 
she feels that subsequent violation of that rule is the child’s 
wanton wickedness or perhaps a sign of wayward ancestry. 
One must understand that a child begins life as unmoral as 
he is illiterate. He has the inborn capacity, of course, for 
both literary skill and morality; but the development of 
either capacity takes time, patience, and insight. How much 
time and patience it takes will depend upon two fundamental 
limitations in each case—heredity and environment. The 
capacity for moral living varies among individuals just as 
other capacities vary. Some are naturally more capable 
than others. Environment also varies. If domestic life and 
outside experience harmonize with the work of the school, 
progress is rapid; but when these are counteractive, results 
are always in jeopardy. Our knowing the child’s initial lack 
of moral responsibility and the limitations which exist should 
make us patient and persistent in our efforts. 
The Goal.—We need also to view the goal of moral train- 
ing not only in synthesis but in analysis. It is not sufficient 
that we aim in general to develop moral character. Such a 
statement of our goal does not point the way. (We e must aim 
at things which constitute character, at things which will 
control the conduct of pupils when they are beyond our 
immediate influence.) If we aim at the development of cer- 
tain moral habits, for instance, our way is clear. We know 
the process of habit formation. Likewise, if we aim at im- 
parting certain facts or principles of moral living, we know 
the pedagogy of instruction; or if we wish to create certain 
ideals, we know the process. Since it is necessary, therefore, 
to view the goal of moral training analytically, let us inquire 
what the specific aims and processes are.

II. ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM 
Moral Habits.—Actions that have become habitual, judg- 
ments repeated until they have become established view- 
points, and emotional responses that tend to recur automati- 
cally, constitute very important factors in controlling conduct. 
(If a child forms specific habits of sharing with others, 
these help him to be unselfish. If he acquires the habitual 
judgment that time is lost when nothing worthy is done, this 
helps him to be industrious.) Cf he learns from many life ex- 
periences to abhor a lie and to love the truth, he is likely to 
be truthful) Early in life children have no habits of action, 
no established attitudes, and no moral prejudices. Their 
first responses are instinctive. Hence every moral situation 
which will recur often in life is a legitimate field for the culti- 
vation of automatic responses in action, thought, and feeling. 
Ideals.—But conduct is not controlled solely by auto- 
matic responses. Another control is ideals. A little boy to 
whom a policeman was the ideal man gave his mother no rest 
until she had dressed him in a uniform. His ideal was ac- 
tively influencing behavior. Just as evidently ideals influ- 
ence the conduct of adults. For example, one has an ideal 
with respect to church life, and according to this ideal one 
will be either aggressive or passive, zealous or indifferent, as 
a member. Influential likewise are the ideals which one has 
with respect to scholarship, dress, personal appearance, pro- 
fession, or occupation. Hence a large part of the school’s 
business in moral training is to create moral ideals. 
Knowledge.—Fully as important as habits or ideals is 
one’s knowledge of right and wrong. Whenever we put a 
child into a situation which leads him to learn a moral fact 
or principle, whenever we give him a better understanding of 
morality and social relations, whenever we help him to know 
what is right and what is wrong, we increase the probability 
of his doing the right. To say that moral knowledge is moral 
power states one phase of an ancient maxim. Knowledge,
-P-A-G-E-594
    
490 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ideals, and habits are not, of course, separate and indepen- 
dent factors of mind. The mind is a unity, and all of these 
elements are so interwoven that they work together in de- 
termining behavior. Knowledge alone will not suffice, nor 
will ideals, nor will habits; but these do represent different 
aspects of mental life, each to be developed by methods pecu- 
liar to its own nature. We think of habits as a result of drill, 
ideals as a result of inspiration, and knowledge as a result of 
instruction; and because these aspects of mind differ in na- 
ture and in process of development, we need to make this 
pedagogical analysis [1]. 
In carrying out these processes for the accomplishment 
of our teaching aims in moral training, educators cannot rely 
solely on a formal provision for the teaching of ethics; nor 
can they depend exclusively upon the personal influence of 
teachers nor the moral regulation of school life, nor the inci- 
dental influence of other studies. It would be desirable to 
so organize the school life that moral training grew naturally 
out of the group activities of the children engaged in worth- 
while play and work. An efficient procedure will, so far as 
possible, include all of these. Through the social life of the 
school, the modes of recitation, and the subject matter of 
the curriculum we have a combination of adequate means; 
and by properly manipulating these means, we should be 
able to secure intelligently the desired ends [8]. 
Ill. Tse Curtivation or AuToMATic Factors 
Conduct Habits.—Habit building requires intelligent and 
attentive repetition of a given act on every possible occasion 
until the act becomes an automatic response [20]. If a teacher 
desires to have her pupils cultivate the habit of prompt obedi- 
ence, she must fix their attention clearly upon each directed 
act, furnish sufficient motive for conscious compliance a num- 
ber of times, and guard as far as possible against any disobedi- 
ent response. Such work is obviously incidental to the other 
work of the school. A special drill period would be absurd.

  ETHICS 491 
The daily work of the school offers many recurring situations, 
calling for prompt, unquestioning obedience; and the school 
needs only to take advantage of them. In calling a class, in 
assigning a task, in directing practically every activity of the 
school, the teacher gives orders. If she makes these orders 
plain and fair and guards against wrong responses, the habit 
of obedience will surely develop. 
Another illustration is the habit of fair play at snowball- 
ing. The best drill-ground is the school yard. When the 
first snow falls children need to be instructed clearly that it 
is unfair to throw snowballs at people who are passing along 
the street or at children who wish to play fox and geese; that 
it is fair to throw snowballs only at those who are in the 
game. ‘The presence of many children who always want to 
be in the game and the existence of huge snow-drifts will 
insure plenty of practice. The chief difficulty here, as else- 
where, is the prevention of wrong responses; but the tempo- 
rary withdrawal of the privilege from those who fail to be 
fair, will usually suffice to keep the practice consciously 
uniform. 
Social Co-operation.—Consider as a final illustration the 
social habits of co-operation. These habits are essential to 
modern complex life in all its phases—the basis of both busi- 
ness and governmental efficiency, a prime necessity in phil- 
anthropic and religious work; and the school must train chil- 
dren early into such habits. Numerous situations recur in 
every day’s work to afford the practice. Some of them are 
so familiar to us that we scarcely think of their moral con- 
tribution. In school singing, for example, every child sings 
with a consciousness that he is contributing only a part of 
the total harmony. Likewise, dramatization is co-operative. 
The story requires several characters to present it adequately, 
and each performer is continually conscious of the fact that 
the success of the whole play depends upon his contribution. 
In nature study and geography there is always the oppor- 
tunity to make collections, mould maps, or give demonstra- 
 
-P-A-G-E-598
  492 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
tions, and the doing of these things easily involves co-opera- 
tion. Even in the solution of arithmetic problems children 
may sometimes co-operate. A teacher once sent her pupils 
to take measurements of the school yard, for example, and 
upon these data the total area of the yard was computed 
and the results given to the school officers as part of an argu- 
ment for a larger playground. Groups of children can work 
together at hundreds of well-motivated play and work activi- 
ties if they are given opportunity. Thus any teacher know- 
ing the value of these co-operative habits can provide amply 
for their development, at the same time increasing the effi- 
ciency of other work. 
Be it one mentioned above or any other moral habit that 
a teacher wishes to inculcate, the principles of procedure are 
constant. School life necessitates continual conduct, and it 
is the business of the teacher to direct this conduct into right 
channels. This in itself fulfils the first step of habit forma- 
tion. The fact that the responses must be made to a recur- 
rent situation insures the necessary drill, which fulfils the 
second step. The third requirement in habit-building, pre- 
venting exceptions in practice, is the most difficult. But (z) 
through removing stimuli to wrong responses, (2) through 
forewarning pupils of the recurring situation and of the right 
response, and (3) through making right responses agreeable 
and wrong ones disagreeable, a teacher can keep any pre- 
scribed act fairly uniform in practice. 
Judgment Habits.—The general method of establishing a 
view-point or developing an automatic judgment is also a 
combination of instruction and drill. Through instruction 
the teacher must lead the pupils either to form the right judg- 
ment for themselves or to accept it already formed; and 
through conscious repetition or drill she must make the judg- 
ment habitual. By stating a specific moral judgment and 
describing its development and cultivation through school 
activities, perhaps I can make the process clearer. 
Suppose we say: “Laws exist for our protection and in-
-P-A-G-E-599
ETHICS 493 
creased happiness; therefore, we should obey them.” Chil- 
dren cannot comprehend this point of view except by a long 
course of inductive teaching. The school begins when the 
teacher explains why we act according to a certain rule in 
school. For instance, pupils must walk, not run, down the 
stairway in order that no one may fall down and be trampled 
upon. Nearly every regulation of the school has a purpose 
which can be stated similarly in plain terms of mutual pro- 
tection and happiness. The school has only to make this 
its custom and eventually the desired attitude will be estab- 
lished inductively. Thus through the daily life of the school, 
through incidental instruction, through the discipline of in- 
dividual pupils, and through formal lessons, opportunities 
are ever present for teachers to introduce and cultivate cor- 
rect moral judgments; and if we are alert in the use of these 
opportunities, every output of our schools should be in the 
habit of viewing life from the proper moral angles. 
Prejudice.—The third automatic factor in moral control 
is prejudice. To abhor that which is evil and to love what is 
good are necessary mental processes for one who would live 
a good life. But merely commanding one to abhor evil and 
to love the good cannot accomplish the result. Love or hate, 
admiration or abhorrence, must be inspired and cultivated, and 
the pedagogy of this cultivation is essentially the pedagogy 
of habit-building. The work should go hand in hand with 
the development of automatic judgments; for when judgment 
is reinforced by concurrent feeling, the resultant action is 
much more positive. Two men are equally convinced, for 
instance, that military preparedness is a good thing. One 
of them goes on from day to day believing it, but wholly in- 
different as to the outcome. The other is anxious and en- 
thusiastic. Necessarily the latter becomes an active cam- 
paign worker. Thus every moral judgment which becomes 
automatic needs a corresponding automatism in the realm of 
emotional response in order to make it dynamic. 
Methods of initiating permanent likes and dislikes in the
-P-A-G-E-600
494 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
minds of children, consist principally in the art of suggestion 
rather than in the art of instruction. By the tone of voice, 
the manner, or the facial expression, a teacher who has the 
confidence of pupils will impart to them her own likes and 
dislikes. This type of social stimulation has to be real, how- 
ever, and not feigned. If we would give the young a love 
for our country, a respect for old age, or a reverence for 
things sacred, they must behold deep-seated in our lives the 
same feelings which we would inspire in them. Likewise, 
they must catch from the lives of their teachers and asso- 
ciates the spirit of indignation for things that are evil. 
A similar stimulation of such emotional responses comes 
through history and literature. Writers readily transmit 
their own feelings to their readers. Good literature, there- 
fore, stimulates in youthful minds the finest feelings of the 
race. At the same time a taste for good literature, as it pre- 
vents the reading of much that is unwholesome, builds a 
barrier against the possible evil stimulus of bad literature. 
In this way, whatever the school does in cultivating good 
taste, whether in literature, art, music, or other forms of 
enjoyment, will contribute to the moral welfare of pupils 
either directly by the creation of correct likes and dislikes or 
indirectly by the prevention of wrong ones. 
IV. Creatine IDEALs 
The ideals of little children are ordinarily concrete. Some 
personal acquaintance represents all that is worth being. 
Unfortunately, when the ideal is at this stage of development, 
it includes all of the eccentricities, the mannerisms, and the 
undesirable traits, just as well as those that are good. If a 
boy admires some man for his agility or his good humor, he 
desires to be like that man in every particular. If the man 
smokes, the boy desires to smoke; if the man is profane, the 
boy desires to use profanity. In the development of proper 
ideals, therefore, the educational problem is to abstract de- 
sirable qualities, to dissociate them from the undesirable,  
-P-A-G-E-601
  
    
    
Fife and drum corps. Out of such activities may come a larger spirit 
of citizenship and ethical living
-P-A-G-E-602

-P-A-G-E-603
  ETHICS 495 
and to organize them into a composite ideal of living. For 
example, a little boy whose father employed a number of 
wood-cutters, greatly admired one of them who excelled in 
strength. Naturally he wanted to be like that man, although 
the man was illiterate and immoral. The boy begged for a 
small axe until he got it; then for hours he worked to chop 
down a mere sapling, which finally fell, as he thought, like a 
huge oak. In all of this conduct the controlling factor was 
his personified ideal. Evidently the need in this typical 
case was some influence that would abstract the quality of 
strength for an abiding ideal, and dissociate it from an un- 
worthy man in whom it was then objectified. 
Vicarious Experience.—Naturally the widening experience 
of a child tends to separate desirable qualities from concrete 
personality; but the school can aid greatly in the process by 
supplying at the proper time such characters from history and 
literature as will best portray these qualities. A child who is 
admiring physical strength should come in contact through 
literature with such characters as Hercules and Samson. 
This will help him to dissociate the quality of strength from 
a particular personality and will tend to free him from the 
danger of imitating possible bad qualities in a single object 
of admiration. In assimilating these vicarious experiences, 
children are continually idealizing the good and looking with 
disfavor upon the bad. In fact, that which distinguishes 
good literature from bad is the power to produce this result. 
Even our school histories ordinarily present good qualities of 
characters in a way that commands respect, and the bad 
qualities they censure. Consequently, there is no more 
powerful means at our disposal for constructing moral ideas 
than this touch with great characters in literature and his- 
tory. 
Contribution of Skill—Psychologists have told us that 
specific skill tends also to develop an ideal. In other words, 
any response which becomes a habit of action in a specific 
field promotes an ideal of procedure that is applicable in other 
 
-P-A-G-E-604
496 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
fields. A child who arrives at school on time every morning 
will develop a specific habit of promptness; furthermore, he 
will develop an “‘on time” ideal applicable to meeting other 
engagements. The school habit, as such, is not applicable 
to meeting other engagements; but the ideal is broader. It 
is evident, therefore, that all the work which the school does 
in the cultivation of moral habits contributes also to one’s 
ideals. 
Contribution of Associates.—Still another large source of 
influence upon the development of ideals is the personality 
of associates. This influence may be either good or bad. It 
will help or hinder, according to the character of the one from 
whom it comes. So strong is the personal influence of the 
teacher that some educators have been tempted to rest their 
case solely on the personality of our teaching corps. This 
view, however, expresses only a part of the truth. The in- 
fluence of child upon child is equally as important as that of 
teacher upon child. Soon after the opening of school a cer- 
tain little girl began blinking her eyes in a very nervous and 
unusual manner. Upon investigation it was found that -she 
was trying simply to be like an older girl whom she admired. ° 
In a larger way it is true that all children whom the pupils 
accept as leaders contribute greatly to the development of 
ideals and the control of conduct in the school. Where the 
pupil leaders are bad, ideals will deteriorate; where the pupil 
leaders are good, ideals will improve. Consequently it is a 
part of the school’s business to select the leaders. 
Leadership.—Many teachers look upon pupil leaders as 
a matter of accident. Some pupils, they say, are leaders by 
nature; and if these happen to be bad, the leadership will be 
bad, in spite of any effort to the contrary. This analysis, 
however, is wrong. Natural capacity for leadership varies 
among individuals according to the law of individual differ- 
ences. When the worst pupil in a school stands highest in 
natural capacity for leadership, which would be a rare occur- 
rence, the school has only to suppress that leadership in favor 
 
-P-A-G-E-605
  ETHICS 497 
of some one else. Those who actually assume leadership 
usually do so because of a definite policy in the school’s 
management. Some teachers have the practice of putting 
their worst pupil in the position of highest honor on all spec- 
tacular occasions. The object is to redeem him by a weight 
of responsibility. This aim is honorable, but unfortunately 
the pupil cannot comprehend it. The policy not only en- 
courages the bad boy in his badness, giving him an erroneous 
impression of the way to secure positions of honor and trust, 
but it causes the other pupils to accept him as their own 
respected leader. The consequence is a school of low ideals. 
A reversal of such a policy will work in every case a remark- 
able transformation in the moral ideals of the children. 
Combination of Means.—No single means which the 
teacher employs for developing ideals is exclusive. It may 
be used with any or all of the other means. A certain primary 
teacher has remarkable success in developing ideals of cleanli- 
ness. Once she received a most neglected-looking child, a 
girl of nine. No sooner had she gained this child’s affections 
than she had her alone one evening in conversation. When 
their hands came close together, she tactfully told this un- 
kempt child how to bathe. Then they talked about clothing 
and about hair-dressing. The child, happy and inspired, ran 
home that night to tell her shiftless father of her new vision— 
a vision of herself clean and beautiful. Thereafter she was a 
different-looking child. Analyzing this teacher’s work, one 
finds at least four influences utilized. (1) The teacher, who is 
admired by her pupils, sets the example. Both in her per- 
sonal appearance and in the condition of the room, cleanliness 
is a prime characteristic. (2) She continually commends 
pupils for being clean and for keeping their books and papers 
clean. ‘How nice Mary looks this morning, and how clean!” 
“Look at John’s book—how clean it is!” These are typical 
comments, utilizing to its best advantage the influence of 
associates. (3) Even the fairies that children talk about are 
clean little fairies, and ‘‘Goldilocks” is a beautiful girl with
-P-A-G-E-606
  498 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
clean hands and curly hair. (4) And a of all, the children 
are given practice in certain habits of cleanliness. Every 
morning they clean their shoes; in the evening they clean their 
desks; during the day, if the hands become soiled, they wash. 
Similarly, in the development of any other ideal it is pos- 
sible to use all four of the principal means which this teacher 
used with respect to cleanliness. They are, in brief: (1) In- 
fluence of the teacher as an example, (2) influence of child 
upon child, (3) influence of examples from history and litera- 
ture, and (4) habits of acting according to the ideal in certain 
situations. 
V. Ineartinc Morar INstRucTION 
Schools in the past, ignoring their greater purpose, have 
doubtless esteemed too highly their function as bureaus of 
information. But the present reaction may be too great. 
Remembering that acquaintance with facts and principles 
involved in any situation is fully as important as skill in the 
psychology of response, there should be no objection to giv- 
ing children as much knowledge of morals and ethics as pos- 
sible, provided that knowledge be given in the right way and 
accompanied by the right ideals. 
In view of the increasing demand for personal-purity in- 
struction in schools, it is important to emphasize the need 
of correct ideals as the complement of knowledge. Since any 
fact may be applied immorally as well as morally, sex in- 
struction may be either harmful or helpful. For example, a 
debased boy was commercializing his knowledge at a certain 
school. Boys were trading him marbles and other valuables 
to instruct them in sex knowledge, obviously to their detri- 
ment. Ignorance in this field is safer than knowledge, unless 
knowledge be reinforced by pure and wholesome ideals. With 
these dynamic outcomes ennobled, however, purity instruc- 
tion will yield great power in controlling the sex life accord- 
ing to moral standards. And no agency is better qualified 
than the school to do this.

Indirect Instruction.—Regarding other phases of moral 
living, most instruction in the schools at present is indirect 
or incidental to other work of ‘the school. Recall, for in- 
stance, the story in many readers of the boy who called, 
“Wolf! Wolf!” when there was no wolf, showing in the end 
how deception harmed the deceiver. Memory gems are 
nearly always kernels of moral truth, selected on that ac- 
count. Also in history or geography lessons some moral fact 
usually appears. In history it may be the great principle 
of equal rights, the fact of universal brotherhood, or the 
greatness of unselfish service; in geography it may be the 
idea of our industrial interdependence. But in every case 
we should strive to find in each pupil’s experience the point 
of contact for the moral truth. A mere question or a sug- 
gestion, not sermonizing, will suffice. 
There is also considerable ethical instruction involved in 
school discipline. For instance, some children ran over a 
private lawn. The owner complained. In stopping this 
trespassing the teacher explained the difference between pri- 
vate and public property, and the treatment to be accorded 
each. Again, when a pupil does things obviously intolerable 
for all, he is asked to consider what would happen if all chil- 
dren would do as he has done. Thus a child begins to assim- 
ilate a profound proposition in ethical philosophy. Even 
pupil self-government, where it is successful, requires con- 
tinual instruction in conduct by a competent adviser. In 
fact, all school discipline is as rich in opportunities for moral 
instruction as the subject matter of the curriculum is; and 
the teacher who excels in management is the one who uses 
them. 
Formal Instruction.—Because of these abundant oppor- 
tunities for incidental ethics, the formal course ordinarily con- 
stitutes a relatively small portion of the curriculum. Some- 
times it is omitted altogether. Where it does exist, some 
teachers find the ethics lesson the most difficult of all lessons 
to teach; others find it among the easiest. It depends upon
-P-A-G-E-610
  500 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
the method of teaching. A teacher who knows how to re- 
late an ethical principle to juvenile experience, finds the in- 
struction easy; but one who fails to make this vital contact 
finds the instruction hard. Usually a single ethics lesson has 
a double purpose. It aims (z) to impart some important 
idea, fact, or principle of moral conduct, and (2) to stimulate 
the growth of a correlative ideal. The teacher who success- 
fully accomplishes this twofold purpose divides her teaching 
of the lesson into three parts: (x) Finding in the experience 
of every pupil a point of contact, (2) developing and applying 
the idea or principle chosen for the lesson, (3) getting a favor- 
able emotional response [12]. 
An Example.—By describing a particular lesson observed 
in a fourth grade I can best define these essential character- 
istics of ethics teaching. The lesson is not considered ideal 
according to the philosophy of Professor Dewey, but is judged 
excellent under the formal school conditions which ordinarily 
exist. The purpose of the lesson was (1) to teach pupils 
the meaning and significance of perseverance, and (2) to 
cause them to aspire to that quality of character. The 
teacher began by asking pupils what difficult thing they had 
ever accomplished after repeated trials. One boy had been 
able to ride his bicycle a given distance in thirty minutes 
after practising all summer; another had solved a problem 
in arithmetic after many unsuccessful attempts; a girl had 
learned to play Dvofak’s ‘“‘Humoreske”’ on the violin after 
much practice. Thus the teacher found the point of con- 
tact. After a number had related similar experiences, she 
defined perseverance as this very quality of sticking to a 
task until it is accomplished. The next thing was to pre- 
sent a few examples outside of the personal experience of the 
class. One child by previous appointment read the story 
of Bruce and the spider. The teacher told of a former pupil 
who tried again and again in the face of repeated failure to 
win a prize in reading. He won it the very last year he was 
in school. These vicarious experiences enriched the idea of
-P-A-G-E-611
  
ETHICS 50r 
perseverance which had partially developed in the children’s 
own experience, and strengthened the conviction that perse- 
verance is a winning quality in one’s character, thus com- 
pleting the second step. The fact that pupils were led to 
admire characters displaying this quality induced them to 
idealize perseverance, thereby fulfilling the third step. This 
lesson, therefore, meets the essential requirements of every 
formal lesson designed ultimately to modify conduct. 
Religion.—Religion, as ordinarily considered, has always 
been a powerful factor in the morality of any nation. It has 
not been given separate mention in our discussion of moral 
education because sectarian religious instruction is beyond 
the province of our public education. We need, however, 
to work in closest sympathy with those institutions which 
try to impart definite religious instruction. The intelligent 
and sympathetic co-operation of specialized religious institu- 
tions and specialized educational institutions is conducive 
to the best type of moral development. The school’s share 
in this co-operation is performed pedagogically when we lay 
the basis of ethical conduct and show the right reverence for 
things religious; and it is performed administratively when 
we recognize the worth of religious instruction. Certainly 
any careful scrutiny of the modern elementary school that is 
giving the children not only knowledge and habits but also 
worthy ideals and appreciations of an ethical character is 
superior to most Sunday-schools in the essentials of “true 
religion and undefiled.”” As a supplemental institution the 
elementary school is to-day energetically seeking to do its 
full share in developing moral and religious efficiency. More 
definite guidance of school activities toward this aim is more 
imperative than ever. We are in general agreement with the 
Gary plan of school and church co-operation, and with the 
general plan outlined by Professor Rugh [21] in his prize 
essay on ‘‘The Essential Place of Religion in Education.”

  502 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Io. SUMMARY 
. In brief, teachers need to view the work of moral training from 
the standpoint (1) of its importance, (2) of its length and limi- 
tations, and (3) of its analysis into specific aims suggesting the 
process. 
. Those specific aims are: (1) The development of (a) habits, (6) 
judgments, and (c) feelings, as automatic controls; (2) the 
creation of worthy ideals; and (3) the teaching of moral knowl- 
edge. 
. The means to be employed are found in the social life and man- 
agement of the school, in discipline, in methods of recitation, 
and in the content of the curriculum. 
. The automatic controls are initiated by instruction or suggestion, 
and cultivated by repeating the response on every possible 
occasion without any counteractive practice. 
. Ideals, at first concrete and personified, become abstract and 
composite by force of the child’s own widening experience and 
by the influence of vicarious experience in history and literature. 
. Ideals of procedure result from specific habits and are much 
broader than habits in their application. 
. All ideals are likely to be modified by the personal example of 
teacher and pupil leaders; consequently the teacher should 
not only guard her own example but should select and develop 
the right sort of leaders, systematically recognizing merit on 
all occasions. 
. The facts and principles of moral behavior should find a comple- 
ment in ideals to insure their right use. 
. Most of such facts and principles are taught incidentally (1) in 
connection with other subjects and (2) in connection with school 
discipline. 
Formal lessons in ethics and conduct should aim always (1) to 
instruct, and (2) to inspire. This will require (x1) finding a 
point of contact in the pupil’s personal experience, (2) develop- 
ing and applying the principles, and (3) idealizing their proper 
application. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
1. Enumerate several recurring situations in a child’s life for which he 
should be prepared with automatic responses, (1) in deed, (2) 
in judgment, (3) in feeling. 
2. State one right judgment and one wrong judgment concerning
-P-A-G-E-613
  
aA ETHICS 503 
work; and show how you could establish the right one in the 
minds of your pupils. 
. If you are cultivating habits of truthfulness in a child, what are 
some of the removable stimuli to wrong responses? How could 
you remove them? 
. Specify some ways in which you can render right responses agree- 
able and wrong responses disagreeable to the child in whom 
you are cultivating truth-telling habits. 
. Name one literary or historical character that will inspire children 
with right ideals, and one that will warn them against wrong 
ideals, in each of the following directions: (1) Perseverance, (2) 
truthfulness, (3) kindness to animals, (4) temperance, (5) 
altruism. 
. Make a list of specific school habits which should contribute to a 
pupil’s ideals of procedure in life at large. 
. Outline a plan for teaching a formal lesson on the subject of obedi- 
ence, politeness, or unselfish service to society, adapting it to 
a particular grade of pupils.

CHAPTER XXIII 
MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 
PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
1. What advantages were gained when men changed to a carefully 
standardized yard from the custom of having many different 
standards, and such standards as the distance from the end of 
the Queen’s nose to the end of the fingers of her right hand, with 
arms stretched on a piece of cloth? 
2. How do such primitive standards differ from the average examina- 
tion held in school? 
3. If a photographic copy of an elementary pupil’s examination paper 
in geography, history, arithmetic, composition, or other subject, 
is sent to five hundred teachers of the same grade as the pupil 
examined, to what extent will they agree in their marks if all 
do their work carefully? (High school teachers vary from forty 
to ninety per cent frequently.) 
4. What is the reliability of the teacher’s judgment as to the relative 
difficulty of spelling words? See Chapter on spelling. 
5. Of what advantage is it for a boy to have a photographic scale 
of samples of handwriting on the wall in his room with which 
he may compare his own handwriting? } 
6. What help can a specialist in educational measurements give 
teachers, principals, and superintendent as a regularly employed 
official of the schools with the rank of assistant superintendent ? 
What cities now have such specialists? : 
7. How have we determined in the past which method of teaching 
reading or which series of geographies or arithmetics gave the 
best results? 
8. Which of the following types of mental changes to be made in 
pupils can best be measured: (1) knowledge, (2) habits, (3) ideals, 
(4) appreciations (including under this heading attitudes, tastes, 
interests, prejudices, etc.) ? 
9. By what aims of education are we to determine what results of 
education are worth measuring? 
The Aim of the Chapter.—The aim of this chapter is to 
help in the solution of one of the most important problems 
505 
 
-P-A-G-E-616
  506 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
in teaching, namely, the measuring of results. The title of 
the chapter might well have been Tests Every Teacher Should 
Know. For there are now tests that practically every 
teacher should know and use. These tests are to the teacher 
what the thermometer is to the physician, what the foot is to 
the lumber dealer, what the yard is to the merchant, what 
the pound is to the grocer, what the bushel is to the farmer. 
In short, they furnish the teacher with standard units of 
measurement. 
Every teacher wishes to know whether she is succeeding, 
and to what degree, and most teachers realize how unsatis- 
factory are their present means of securing information on 
this point. Ordinarily, teachers are limited to one or both 
of two sources for knowledge of their success. The two 
sources are examinations and personal judgment, and it is 
now recognized that the unreliability of the one is only 
equalled by the uncertainty of the other. Doctor Kelly 
treats this matter fully and convincingly in his study of 
teachers’ marks [1°]. 
The use of standardized tests enables the teacher to know 
in a scientific way (1) definite grades for her teaching, (2) 
how far her pupils are from the goals, and (3) what progress 
her pupils are making toward the goals. 
Unfortunately, there are as yet comparatively few well- 
developed standardized tests, but marked progress has been 
made within the last few years, and still more marked prog- 
ress is promised for the near future. 
This chapter will deal mainly with such standardized 
tests and measuring-scales as are available for present use 
by teachers of limited training in psychology and statistical 
methods. Those who wish to go into the matter more fully 
will find help in the appended bibliography. The selected 
list at the end contains some of the best help for those who

are beginning to study this problem. Every teacher should 
study several of the typical references and then be alert to 
progress in this line as it is recorded in the better current 
educational journals and books. 
The Available Means of Measuring Results.—Chief 
among the means of measurement now available are the 
Courtis Tests [2], the Thorndike Handwriting Scale [17, 22], 
the Ayres’ Handwriting Scale [20], the Stone Reasoning 
Tests in Arithmetic [33], and the Hillegas Composition Scale 
[38]. All these have been sufficiently used to prove their 
value. Among others are the Thorndike Drawing Scale [54], 
the Buckingham Spelling Tests [44], the Harvard-Newton 
Composition Scale [36], the Courtis’s Standard Practice 
Tests [3], the Thorndike Reading Scales and Tests [16], the 
Gray, Kelly [16‘], and Fordyce [16/] Reading Scales, and the 
Health and Physical Education Scale by Rapeer [54°]. De- 
velopment along this line is very rapid, and doubtless before 
this book has appeared others will have been published. 
Contributions have been made in such high school subjects 
as Latin, geometry, algebra, physics, German, French, 
grammar, etc. 
In point of time Doctor Rice is the pioneer in testing. 
The publication of his extended researches in the results of 
teaching was the explosion of a veritable bomb in the edu- 
cational world [15”]. Mr. Riley, while principal in Spring- 
field, Massachusetts, also gave the cause a noteworthy im- 
petus by publishing the results of the famous Springfield 
tests, which showed that school children to-day could in gen- 
eral do better at tests given in 1845 than the children of that 
time [15’, 15°]. But the chief worker along this line has 
been and is Thorndike. It is to him more than to any other 
man that we owe our present progress toward the possibility 
of adequately measuring and evaluating the results of teach- 
ing. Thorndike is the father of educational measurement. 
What is a Standardized Test?—A standardized test is 
one that has been given to enough representative pupils   
     
-P-A-G-E-618
  
508 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
under controlled conditions to warrant the setting of certain 
achievements as standards which are reasonable of attain- 
ment by similar pupils under similar conditions. For exam- 
ple, the Courtis tests in arithmetic have been given under 
uniform conditions of time allowance, directions, etc., to 
thousands of pupils in representative school systems [25, 27]. 
These school systems include New York City, Boston, De- 
troit, and more than a thousand schools in many states, 
ranging from New Hampshire to Idaho, and Wisconsin to 
Tennessee. Mr. Courtis also gave his tests to adults in 
such representative business establishments as Wanamaker’s 
store; and on the basis of the results of these many tests he 
has been able to set certain standards which are reasonable 
and desirable attainments for pupils of the various school 
ages. This may be illustrated by the Courtis Practice Tests 
[3]. In Lesson 9 of the arithmetic tests, for example, ad- 
vanced sixth-grade pupils are expected to learn to do cor- 
rectly forty-six subtraction examples similar to the following, 
in four minutes: 
146 or 109 57 123 
96 44 35 18 60   
Cards are passed to pupils with the examples printed on 
them; all pupils are to begin at exactly the same time and to 
stop at exactly the end of four minutes. By using this test 
a teacher may know the degree to which her teaching has 
been effective in subtraction, and each pupil may know how 
much he ought to improve by practice, as compared with 
other teachers and pupils in many places. These same tests 
are made available for other grades by a graduated time 
allowance. One teacher’s experience in using this test is 
shown in Figures XIII and XIV, pages 528 and 529. 
What Is a Measuring-Scale?—A scale for measuring is a 
list of samples of known quality so arranged that they are 
graduated as to excellence. Such scales are derived by hav-

-P-A-G-E-621
  MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 509 
ing a very large number of samples graded by a large num- 
ber of competent judges. Jn order to secure a perfect scale 
it is essential that the samples include every known degree 
of excellence, varying from zero, or just less than any de- 
gree, to the highest degree of excellence. One of the best 
accounts of the derivation of a scale is found in Thorndike’s 
“Measurement of Achievement in Drawing” [54]. As a 
preliminary, Doctor Thorndike selected fifteen drawings of 
varying degrees of excellence and submitted them to compe- 
tent judges consisting of artists, supervisors and teachers of 
art, and students of education and psychology. These judges 
were requested to rate the drawings according to directions 
on the basis of their intrinsic merit as drawings. 
There were sent in 376 ratings of the fifteen drawings in order of 
merit, 60 from artists of sufficient distinction to be listed in “‘Who’s 
Who in America,’ 80 from supervisors of the teaching of art, and 
236 from students of education and psychology. 
The differences in merit between successive drawings in this graded 
series were defined in each case by the percentages of judges judging 
correctly. For example, 94.85 per cent of the judges rated } as having 
more merit than a, while only 84.5 per cent of them rated ¢ as having 
more merit than b. Hence the 6—<a difference is evidently greater than 
the c—b difference in the sense of being more often or more easily dis- 
tinguished [54]. 
On the basis of these judgments the scale was constructed. 
It is obvious that this scale is necessarily tentative, but Doc- 
tor Kelly has shown [1] that it is very much better than no 
scale for measuring the results of teaching drawing. 
How to Use Standard Tests.—Care in the use of standard 
tests is an essential factor in securing reliable results. The 
prescribed conditions and directions should be rigidly ad- 
hered to; otherwise the results cannot be properly interpreted 
by comparing them with the standards. Careful following 
of directions in scoring and tabulating is also important; but, 
unless one has a considerable number of classes to handle, it 
is not advisable to take time to learn the short-cut methods 
   
-P-A-G-E-622
510 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
of getting averages, or substituting the median for the aver- 
age, as directed by Courtis. Nor is it ordinarily worth while 
to take time to compute deviations or variability. These lat- 
ter measures are of value mainly to the educational expert 
in dealing with large numbers of classes. What is most in- 
dispensable to the teacher is the status of her class as a class, 
and of her pupils as individuals. 
How to Use Measuring-Scales.—Accurate matching of 
the matter to be measured with the various steps of the scale 
is the essential factor in the successful use of a measuring- 
scale. The accuracy of matching will be greatly increased 
by having a number of persons make the comparisons and 
taking the average of their judgments. Another method of 
increasing accuracy is for a single person to repeat his judg- 
ments and then use the average. 
In his monograph on “Measurement of Achievement in 
Drawing” [54], Doctor Thorndike says on this point: 
In measuring the merit of a single drawing by the scale, the draw- 
ing in question should be examined with the scale in view or well fixed 
in memory and a number assigned to it [3]. The number so assigned 
to a drawing by any single judge is, of course, far from infallible. If 
the same judge should so rate a thousand drawings, and then, putting 
these ratings aside, rate the thousand over again, he would vary, often 
by more than half a “merit” from his previous judgments. If ten 
judges should rate a drawing, each without any knowledge of the rat- 
ings assigned by the others, the ten ratings would vary. These facts 
are in no wise an argument against the use of the scale, but simply 
an illustration of the fact that people disagree more in measuring the 
merit of a drawing than they do in measuring the weight of a stone. 
Individuals disagree in all measurements whatsoever. Let a stone 
that weighs exactly 1,000 ounces be weighed independently by ten 
men using the ordinary scale found in a store, and probably no two 
of them will assign the same number of ounces as its measure. If 
they assign its weight as the number of “16 ounces”—i. e., pounds— 
to which it is nearest, more of them will assign identical numbers— 
62 or 63. Similarly, if ten teachers measure a drawing, say that of 
Fig. 20, to the nearest tenth of a “merit,” probably no two of them 
will agree, but if they measure it to the nearest “merit,” several of
-P-A-G-E-623
  
MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 511 
them will rate it alike as 2. If they should measure it as 0 or 2 or 4 
or 6 or 8, etc., probably nine of them would rate it 2. 
The sum and substance of all this is that any fact will be given 
varying measurements if the scale is made fine enough. When a 
teacher compares a boy’s stature successively with 61 inches, 62 inches, 
63 inches, and so on, in order to assign the proper number of inches 
for his stature, comparison is easy and fairly exact. Ten teachers so 
measuring the same boy to tenths of an inch gave ratings all between 
60.2 inches and 60.6 inches. The process was simple, and the varia- 
tion of their measurements was only a small frac- 
tion of the difference between the shortest and 
tallest human being in the world. Ten teachers 
measuring the merit of the drawing of Fig. 21 (to 
tenths of a “merit”’) gave ratings of from 7.8 to 
11.8. The process was not so simple; and the 
variation of their measurements was a large frac- 
tion of the difference between the worst and the 
best drawing in the world. But there was no 
fundamental logical difference in the nature or 
value of the two sets of measurements. And 
there would have been far more disagreement 
had they measured the drawings without the aid 
of our scale. Ten other teachers measuring the merit of _ drawing 
without the scale showed a range of from 2 to 17! In general, the 
amount of disagreement is over 50 per cent greater when the scale is 
not used. 
We must expect a wide variation in the ratings assigned to the 
same drawing by this scale. One “merit” is such a difference in 
merit as twenty-five out of a hundred artists, teachers of art, and 
other competent men judge wrongly. Hence necessarily it must be 
expected that, in comparing a new drawing with the scale so as to 
rate it, “errors” will be frequent and large. 
Just as men of science take the average of ten or twenty indepen- 
dent measurements of the weight of a body, if they desire to get an 
accurate measure of it, so we need ten or twenty independent ratings 
of a drawing to get an accurate measure of it. And since we are 
affected with eccentric notions, prejudices, and exaggerations of special 
details in the case of the merit of a drawing as we are not in the case 
of the length of a wire or the weight of a ball, it is better to have the 
ratings made by ten or twenty different judges, rather than by the 
same judge at different times. But, whether there is one rating or ten, 
one judge or twenty, the result will be more accurate with the scale than 
without it.

  512 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
With What Pupils Should Standardized Tests and Scales 
Be Used?—They should be used with all pupils as soon as the 
appropriate tests or scales are developed. At present little 
has been done to help measure the results of children’s work 
below Grade 3. A noteworthy exception is the work of Miss 
Pepper with kindergarten children [54’]. The Thorndike 
drawing-scale will doubtless prove of value for judging the 
drawings of primary as well as more advanced pupils. 
One of the advantages of the Courtis arithmetic tests is 
that they may properly be used with any number of different 
grades, from the third or fourth up, at the same time. This 
makes them especially adapted to use in one-room country 
schools. 
Measuring Results of Teaching Reading.—Considering 
the degree to which it is fundamental to all other school 
work, it is surprising that so little progress has been made 
in measuring the results of teaching reading. The explana- 
tion of this is found in the complexity of the reading process. 
At least several investigations are now under way, looking 
toward the standardizing and improvement of tests and scales: 
One by Courtis [2, 35], one by Brown [16°], one by Thorn- 
dike [16], one by Judd [r6*], one by Gray [r6], one by Kelly, 
as described by Doctor Coffman in an earlier chapter, and 
one by Fordyce. 
Courtis’s tests are part of his set on English (Series C), 
and Professor Thorndike’s work in this line is published in 
the September, 1914, Teachers College Record, and later issues. 
The main contribution of these studies is that they enable 
those who wish to co-operate in their perfection to do so. 
For those who wish to get a true evaluation of reading work, 
these scales and tests, though imperfect as yet, are well worth 
using. Doctor Thorndike opens his study with an analysis 
of the reading situation. He says in part: 
It is obvious that educational science and educational practice 
alike need more objective, more accurate and more convenient mea- 
sures of (1) a pupil’s ability to pronounce words and sentences seen;
-P-A-G-E-625
  s 
MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 513 
(2) a pupil’s ability to understand the meaning of words and sentences 
seen; (3) a pupil’s ability to appreciate and enjoy what we roughly 
call “good literature” and (4) a pupil’s ability to read orally, clearly, 
and effectively. 
In this investigation the preliminary scales and tests are 
classified as: 
1. Scale A—for visual vocabulary. 
2. A scale for measuring the understanding of sentences 
and paragraphs. 
3. Scale Alpha for measuring the understanding of sentences. 
4. A provisional scale for measuring ability to pronounce 
English sentences—the Gray tentative scale. 
Measuring Results in Writing—From the beginning of 
the measuring movement the emphasis has been placed on 
determining the progress in the proverbial three R’s, and, 
next to arithmetic, writing has received the most attention. 
There are now two scales, each of which is being rather 
widely used, one by Professor Thorndike [17, 22], and one 
by Doctor Ayres [20]. Professor Thorndike’s scale is the 
pioneer in this field. The way in which he derived it is 
described in the Teachers College Record, March, 1910. 
Which of these scales is the better has not yet been deter- 
mined. Mr. Courtis is making a thorough study of the 
question as part of his Series C [2], and he, as well as other 
irivestigators, is getting these scales standardized as to rapid- 
ity and the degrees of excellence to be expected from the 
respective grades of pupils. Professor Freeman has con- 
structed a scale by which to diagnose errors in handwriting. 
Professor Starch has devised a slide-rule arrangement for 
converting speed-marks into quality marks, and vice versa. 
Professor Gray of the University of Texas has devised a chart 
on which to record the many points of handwriting, and 
Doctor Ayres has worked out an adult scale, and has ere 
this, no doubt, a new children’s handwriting-scale. In their 
present form the scales are very valuable. Some of their 
uses are illustrated below. 
 
-P-A-G-E-626
514 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Illustrations of the Uses of Scales.—(a) In the Grades.— 
In all grades above the second a copy of the scale is kept 
posted in the schoolroom, and the children taught to read it 
as a means of determining the quality of their own hand- 
writing. Teachers frequently send children to the scale in- 
stead of pronouncing judgment themselves. This is evidently 
one of the great values of the scale in-that the teacher is 
relieved of the responsibility of personally pronouncing judg- 
ment and the danger of any personal feeling on the part of 
the child is removed to a large degree. Teacher and pupil 
work together in using an established objective standard. 
Thus the scale makes it possible to measure excellence of 
handwriting very much as the units of linear measure make 
it possible to measure distance. 
In the sixth grade of the Training School at Farmville, 
Virginia, the scale was applied to an entire set of dictation- 
papers during the last of September and to another set the 
last of October. In terms of the writing-scale, the gain was 
as follows: For H. H., 55 in September, 60 in October; for 
H. R., 50 in September, 70 in October; for J. F., 70 in Sep- 
tember, 75 in October; for L. W., 80 in September, 85 in 
October. Only two of the papers showed no gain, and these 
stood at 80 and 75 in September, which will be seen by the 
scale to be sufficiently good not to require gain. 
(0) Use of the Scale in a Normal School.—The use that is 
made of the Ayres’ scale in the Farmville, Virginia, Normal 
School illustrates the use of handwriting-scales in Normal 
schools, high schools, or any other school in which there is 
departmental teaching. A complete copy of the faculty 
agreement for getting and maintaining good handwriting 
may be secured by applying to the writer\)In brief, the 
plan provides that each member of the faculty have a copy 
of the Ayres’ Scale for Measuring Hand Writing; that there 
be a special writing class; that on being informed by as many 
as two teachers that a student is below standard, the teacher 
in charge shall call him or her to the special writing class;
-P-A-G-E-627
  MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 515 
that the minimum standards shall be 60 for test papers, and 
7o for work done out of class; that after being sent to the 
writing class the student can only be released by so raising and 
maintaining his or her standard that the teachers of his or 
her respective subjects recommend it. 
(c) Use of the Scale in School Surveys—Another of the 
noteworthy uses of these scales is found in the better school 
surveys. Figure I shows a graphic summary of such use in 
the Ohio State Survey [56].

  516 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
which comparisons of records can be shown makes graphs a common method 
of portrayal. 
After a little practice it will be seen at a glance that the Ohio rural-school 
pupils varied much more widely in their ability to write than did the pupils 
in the Iowa small city, i. e., the heavy black line shows that about 2 per cent 
of Ohio rural pupils stood only 20 in writing, 3 per cent of them stood 30, 18 
per cent of them 4o, etc., and x per cent of them stood 90; but in contrast to 
this wide variation from 20 to go, the Iowa small-city pupils, as represented 
by the broken line, varied only from 40 to 80, with very few at 40 and very few 
at 80. It is also seen that the Delaware City pupils varied only from 40 to 
90, with few at 4o and less at 90, and that the Delaware County varied almost 
as much as the Ohio rural as a whole. By using this graph the teachers and 
supervisors of Delaware County can compare the work of their schools in 
writing with (x) the work of Ohio rural schools as a whole, (2) the work of 
the schools of Delaware City, (3) that of the Iowa small city; e. g., the heavy 
black line shows that about 18 per cent of the Delaware County pupils stood 
only 40 or less, while only about 2 per cent of the Iowa small-city pupils stood 
as low as 4o. 
The survey investigators draw the following conclusion from the results of 
these measurements: 
“Some pupils in unsupervised rural districts did as well as any students in 
the supervised city system. There is no reason why, with supervision, all 
rural districts should not obtain as good results as any city districts.” 
Measuring Results of Teaching Arithmetic.—The stand- 
ardized means of measuring results of teaching arithmetic 
are the tests of Stone [33], Courtis [2, 25, 27], Studebaker 
[33°], and Thompson [9’]. The Courtis tests in fundamental 
operations have been most widely used and are most thor- 
oughly standardized. Their availability and the lucid direc- 
tions which accompany them are also qualities which: are 
attracting teachers to their use. Series A and B are designed 
mainly for measuring a given status and are known as re- 
search tests. They may be had from Mr. Courtis.' As is 
indicated in the name, the Courtis Practice Tests [3] are de- 
signed mainly for securing progress and are known as prac- 
tice tests. They are published by the World Book Com-~ 
pany [3]. Both Series A and B are printed in different forms, 
so that measurements can be repeated without the danger 
of the tests having been memorized. 
Series A has been largely discarded in favor of Series B. - 
1 Public Schools, Detroit, Michigan.
-P-A-G-E-629
  MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 517 
There is no doubt but that Series B is superior for most pur- 
poses in that it is more in accord with life demands. But as 
long as courses of study require teachers to use a large part 
of the arithmetic time during two or more primary grades on 
the isolated combinations, tests I to V, of Series A, ought 
to be used to measure progress in that work. 
The Thompson tests deal too exclusively with isolated 
combinations, and they do not appear to have been very 
widely standardized. 
The development of standardized tests in reasoning has 
been less rapid than in the fundamental processes. This is 
because of the greater complexity of the reasoning processes 
and the lack of accurate knowledge regarding reading ability. 
Of those available the Stone tests [33] in reasoning are re- 
garded as the most satisfactory. 
A recent book for elementary teachers by Chapman and 
Rush, entitled “The Scientific Measurement of Classroom 
Products,” and published by Silver, Burdett & Co., gives the 
principal scales up to 1917 for measuring arithmetic, hand- 
writing, reading, spelling, composition, and drawing, and 
shows how to use them. Its simplicity is commendable. 
The following graphs will illustrate some of the values of 
using tests. All but the last one are based on: results of 
measuring with the Courtis tests. Figures II to X are from 
Series A; Figures XI and XII from Series B; Figures XIII 
and XIV from “Standardized Practice Tests,” and Figure XV 
from the Stone Reasoning Tests.

This is one of the simplest forms of graphical representation. As is readily 
seen, it represents the respective standings of twenty fourth-grade pupils at 
mid-year and again a month later. The heavy black lines represent the prog- 
ress that had been made in division by the end of the first semester. The 
dotted lines show the progress that had been made a month later. During 
that month approximately ten minutes were given to weaknesses as found 
among all the various fundamental operations. Like gains were made in the 
other tables. Probably the most striking fact shown by this graph is that of 
individual differences. These children were carefully graded as they were 
promoted from Grade 3, but at the end of a half-year they differed in division 
to the extent of one pupil being able to do only two combinations, while an- 
other was able to do 28, and the gains during the months of special treatment 
are even more striking in their differences. Even though the seven lowest 
pupils were in a group by themselves and given special attention, two of them 
made absolutely no gain, while several others, with much less attention, made 
gains of six points. As the graph shows, three pupils made losses in the month. 
For the one that was above standard on February 1, the explanation is that 
he gave his time and energy entirely to something else. The others suffered 
from physical disability during the month. 
By having this graph before them, pupils and teacher were able to see just 
where they stood, first, with reference to each other, and, second, with reference 
to the standard to be attained by the end of the year, and they were also en- 
abled to see just what progress they were making.

This graph shows the progress from grade to grade. When these children 
left the third grade their ability in arithmetic was represented by the solid black 
line. As will be noted, the degree in which they as a class were at standard 
is indicated by the degree to which the line is perpendicular. If this graph 
had been before the teacher and supervisor of these children, it is doubtful if 
the record would have been as is shown above. The records were carefully 
kept, but in tabular rather than graphical form, with the result that the weak- 
nesses were not fully realized. For example, the graph shows emphatically 
that these children were very low in division when they left the fourth grade. 
This placed an undue load on the fifth-grade work, with the result that sub- 
traction was slighted and the children did not make standard progress in it; 
it also shows that the children were stronger in knowing how to add, subtract, 
etc., than in knowing when to perform these operations. (However, Mr. 
Courtis has since somewhat modified his standards in reasoning.)

This figure represents progress in arithmetic while the class was in the 
fifth grade. At the opening of the year they had only that ability which is 
shown by the solid black line. As is illustrated in Fig. V, however, this does 
not mean that they were as deficient as this when promoted into the fifth 
grade. By mid-year they had made the gains indicated by the dash Jine, and 
at the close of the year they were well up in everything, with the possible 
exception of speed reasoning. By having this record the teacher was helped 
to know where to stress the work; for example, more time and energy was 
needed on addition and subtraction than multiplication, and division was 
weakest of all. They also showed weakness in the copying of figures, which 
indicated lack of muscular control.

The above graph is a clear representation of what has frequently been felt, 
but rarely known with certainty, namely, that vacations are times of marked 
loss. Many measurements in different schools agree with this one. Whatever 
may be said in favor of vacations, they are hard on what the children go to 
school for. Such records as the above are of great value in that they show 
the teacher receiving the class two sets of facts: first, where the children stood 
when promoted to her; second, where they stand when she is to begin work 
with them. These facts make it entirely unnecessary for any one concerned 
to wonder how well these children were taught during the year preceding their 
promotion. They also show just where the preceding year’s work needs re- 
viewing.

The above record helped the teacher in that it showed clearly relative 
strengths and weaknesses. This class was found on January 22 to be well up 
in rights of both fundamentals and speed reasoning, but below standard in 
the combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and 
very low in copying figures. The natural conclusion of the teacher was that 
her pupils needed to improve in the combinations and she went to work with 
them on those lines. After five weeks the pupils had the ability represented 
by the broken line. This shows the surprising state of having gained in the 
combinations but lost in reasoning and the examples in fundamental opera- 
tions. That is, learning to add, multiply, etc., in isolated combinations, not 
only does not necessarily mean a corresponding gain in ability to work exam- 
ples in fundamental operations, but in this case it meant a very appreciable 
loss. This is only one of many similar cases that have developed from using 
Series A. As a result, Mr. Courtis is recommending that Series B, which con- 
tains no isolated combinations, be substituted for Series A. This point is fur- 
ther discussed later on. The question of how much time pupils should spend 
on the tables is still an open one; but the results of many measurements, similar 
to the above, make it certain that before teachers can be sure that their pupils 
know how to apply the tables, even in abstract examples, they must teach 
them and drill them in such examples. Though they are still comparatively 
untried, it seems clear that for grades above the fourth (and perhaps for all) 
the Courtis Standard Practice Tests meet this need the best of anything we 
now have. 
The error of the teacher whose work is represented in the above graph is 
that she did not recognize that her pupils were mainly deficient in speed.

This figure illustrates the help that measuring results is in locating a retarded 
pupil. In all his oral work and by all the usual tests of school and life, this 
boy was unusually bright; yet at the end of a half-year in Grade 3 he was 
hardly able to do second-grade work in writing these simple combination tests. 
Some suspicion of eye-trouble had been aroused by his behavior in reading, 
but not until the above representation of his lack of progress did his teacher 
and parent take the matter up and have his eyes treated by a specialist:

Every teacher would like to help every pupil do what is shown in Figure IX,

shown by the dash line, but with a very low time cost she became markedly 
regular in two weeks’ time.

This illustrates the use of the graph to record the progress of individual 
pupils. Pupils can be readily taught to make their own graphs and such 
records make a strong appeal to the pupils for work and self-drill on revealed 
weaknesses.

This figure shows one of the noteworthy values of the Courtis Practice 
Tests, viz., that they enable every pupil to work up to the full limit of his 
capacity and still remain a member of the class. All pupils work at the same 
time, but each on the particular piece of work for which he is ready. In the 
twenty-one days during which the above record was made the pupil completed 
the lessons as represented by the vertical lines, 7. e., while two pupils, P. P. 
and E. O., were conquering three lessons each, pupil G. McK. conquered four- 
teen lessons and pupil N. N. conquered sixteen, while the other pupils varied 
between these extremes. And all these pupils did all their class work on these 
lessons in the same ten minutes. Here is evidently a noteworthy means of 
\ economizing time. For a skilful teacher can handle a roomful of children at 
one time and have each pupil working at his maximum. Then as soon as the 
quicker ones have attained to the grade standard they can be promptly excused 
to use their time to better advantage along some other line.

The varying progress of three types of pupils in conquering Lesson Seven— 
17 addition examples—is here portrayed. R. G. was able to get all 17 exam- 
ples correct in six days, G. McK. in two days, and E. O. has worked five days 
and has not yet made a perfect score. R. G. located his difficulty—excess of 
rapidity—the first day, settled down, and made definite gains, which carried 
him steadily to success; G. McK. had no trouble with this lesson, and E. O. 
has worked five days apparently without locating her difficulty. This shows 
hers to be a case for careful study by the teacher.

This graph is reproduced here by permission of the school authorities of 
Butte, Montana. It is based on the results of using the Stone Reasoning 
Tests, and represents “the percentage of children making the given scores in 
reasoning problems. For, example, 19 per cent of the fifth-grade children 
made a score of 0; 19 per cent made a score of 1; etc. The lines representing 
the median scores for each grade tell about how many in each grade surpass 
the median scores for the grades above, and how many fall below the median 
scores for the grades below.” 
The dotted line was added by the writer. It indicates the median score 
(5.5) made by 152 advanced sixth-grade classes in twenty-six different rep- 
resentative school systems [33]. ‘The addition of this line makes it possible 
to compare the reasoning abilities of Butte pupils with those of other represen- 
tative school systems.

Measuring Results in Spelling.—At first thought, measur- 
ing results in spelling seems a simple, straightforward task, 
but Doctor Buckingham [44] has shown that there are words 
and words—even simple words and simple words—to spell. 
And instead of its being the apparently easy task to get 
accurate measures of spelling ability, it is really a very com- 
plex problem. For example, how much credit ought to be 
 
-P-A-G-E-644
  532 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
given for spelling such words as only and chicken as compared 
with such words as quarrel and guess ? Ordinarily, there is 
no recognition of difference in difficulty in grading spelling- 
tests and the same credit is given each word of the test. 
Doctor Buckingham shows that this practice is grossly in- 
accurate because of the wide differences in the difficulty of 
words, e. g., the four words quarrel, circus, carriage, and guess 
are approximately three times as hard as the four words 
only, even, smoke, and chicken, and ought therefore to be so 
weighted in scoring a test. 
The first extended measurements were made by inteeian 
Rice, and his article, “The Futility of the Spelling Grind” 
[z5”, 53], caused much improvement in the teaching of the 
subject. Cornman [52] and Pearson [47, 50] have also done 
measuring which has helped the teaching of the subject. 
Courtis includes spelling in his Series C [2]. - Ayres [43] has 
measured spelling by the demands of adult life, and Jones 
[45] by the demands of school life. 
For purposes of measuring progress from term to term, 
from year to year, etc., Doctor Buckingham’s scales [44] will 
doubtless be the best help for some time to come. Through 
a large amount of scientific experimentation and a tremen- 
dous amount of labor, Doctor Buckingham has determined 
the respective difficulty of some 550 words. Fifty of these 
words are embodied in the book “Spelling Ability” [44], and 
it is much to be desired that Doctor Buckingham put the 
other 500 in available form for the use of teachers and super- 
visors, with definite directions for their use. 
The words that are weighted by Doctor Buckingham in 
his book have been used under the direction of Miss Tall in 
the schools of Baltimore County, Maryland, and by Mr. 
Franklin in the Sul Ross School of Waco, Texas. The fol- 
lowing graph portrays the results of one plan of using these 
tests:

The writer is indebted to Mr. A. W. Franklin for permission to use the 
above graph. Of the conditions under which he secured the data he says: 
“These tests were given in October, 1914, and in January, 1915. 
“After the October tests the sentences and words were not referred to 
any more by any teacher, they not knowing or expecting the test to ever come 
up again. Of course, all the classes were being taught in their regular spelling, 
reading, writing, etc., during the three months between the first and second 
tests.” 
A better means of testing pupils would be to select from the words taught 
between the times of testing a set of words equivalent in difficulty to those of 
the first set. Equivalence in difficulty can be secured by using Doctor Buck- 
ingham’s method of weighting, and while this is difficult and laborious, it is 
the only way to get accurate measurements of improvement. 
But even the reuse of the same words under the conditions stated by 
 
-P-A-G-E-646
534 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Principal Franklin is much better than the ordinary use of lists of indiscrimi- 
nately selected words, and the preceding graph, Figure XVI, will help Mr. Frank- 
lin’s teachers in their spelling work incomparably more than the ordinary day- 
to-day hope-for-the-best teaching of spelling. 
Measuring Results in Language.—In spite of the com- 
plexity of the subject, considerable progress is being made 
in developing means of measuring results in teaching lan- 
guage. The chief contributions are those of Hillegas [38], 
Courtis [2, 35], Jenkins [34], Thompson [9°], Bliss [40], and 
Ballou [36]. And though as yet there is no scale that is fully 
standardized as to the work that may reasonably be expected 
of the respective grades, the results of any one of these in- 
vestigators is markedly better than the unaided personal 
judgment of teachers or supervisors. 
The graph on page 537 summarizes the use of the 
Hillegas scale in the survey of the schools of Butte, Mon- 
tana. 
The attitude of teachers whose work in language has been 
measured is indicative of the value of the use of such tests. 
After considerable experimentation in the use of tests, Miss 
Jenkins [34] (then of Decatur, Illinois) secured expressions 
from her teachers as to their value. The following extracts 
are typical expressions: 
From the teacher’s point of view I feel as if the tests are very 
beneficial. . . . 
These tests also enable the teacher to see in what ways the class 
needs help, or in what ways they are especially strong. In the last 
test given in my room, the majority of the class failed to have correct 
sentences because the comma, used in a series of words or phrases, 
was omitted, or because they misspelled ‘‘camel.” They had never 
studied this use of the comma, so I inferred at once that some lessons 
in the proper use of it were necessary, and I planned my English les- 
sons with this need in view. Some drill work in spelling the word 
“‘camel’’ was needed, so we added this word to our list of words for 
drill work. On the other hand, almost every one used the quo‘ation- 
marks, the apostrophes, interrogation-marks, etc., with a certain 
degree of proficiency, and the teacher had the satisfaction of knowing
-P-A-G-E-647
MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 535 
that her class had accomplished some things, and that her efforts had 
not been in vain. 
The results obtained from these tests are well worth the energy 
spent in correcting the papers. They are beneficial not only to the 
teacher, but to the pupil as well. For he, too, compares his result 
with that of his classmates, and tries to correct his mistakes so as to 
improve when the next test is given. 
Measuring Results in Drawing.—The one scale in this 
subject, that of Thorndike [54], has not been available long 
enough to get into extended use, but Kelly [1] found that the 
variability in judging drawings was much reduced by using 
the scale. This means that teachers will grade the work of 
pupils much better by using this scale than by depending en- 
tirely on their own judgment; and an added value of using the 
scale is that of being better able to detect and record progress. 
All art teachers recognize the need of this. It is compara- 
tively easy, and ordinarily comparatively ineffective, to say 
to a pupil, “That is good,” or ‘‘That is poor,” or “You are 
not doing well to-day.” It will be just as easy and much 
more effective to say to a pupil: ““How does that compare 
with the standard you reached yesterday? or last week? or 
last year?” Then, too, with the perfection of this and simi- 
lar scales there will come marked advance in the knowledge 
as to what are reasonable art attainments for typical pupils 
of the respective age groups. 
Doctor Thorndike’s discussion of how to use his scale is 
quoted at length, pages 510-11. 
Measuring the More Subtle Results of Character Devel- 
opment.—Objection is sometimes made to measuring results 
by the use of standardized tests and scales on the ground 
that the use of such tests and scales does not and cannot 
measure the most important of all results, viz.: the results 
of character development. It is true that at present there 
are no standardized tests or scales for measuring change in 
character; whether there can be such means of measurement 
is a question for the future to determine. Let it be granted

Permission was kindly granted by the school authorities of Butte, Montana, 
for the reproduction of this graph. It represents “the percentage of children 
in the several grades who make the given scores in composition. For example, 
1.7 per cent of the fourth-grade children wrote compositions scored at 0; 43.8 
per cent of the fourth-grade children were scored at 1; etc. By following the 
median lines the overlapping of ability from grade to grade is disclosed.” 
On the basis of the measurement as portrayed in this graph the survey 
commission made the following observations: 
“A study of the table giving the ratings upon compositions written by the 
children of Butte, along with an examination of the sample compositions repro- 
duced to illustrate the merit of each position on the scale, reveals four facts 
which are worthy of note: 
“First, the composition work is formal rather than free and imaginative. 
“Second, the marks fall low on the scale throughout the grades. While 
no standard of achievement has yet been established with which to compare 
the ratings of the several grades in Butte, certain fifth-grade classes in Mary- 
land have been found to average 5.15 as compared with 2.87 for the fifth grades 
in Butte. Also, certain seventh-grade classes in Maryland and New York City 
have been found to average 5.75 to more than 7.0 as compared with 3.75 for 
the seventh grade in Butte [1]. 
“Third, there is relatively little growth from one grade to the next, the 
median score being raised less than two points, from fourth to eighth grade. 
“Fourth, the wide variation in ability among the children in any one grade 
taises the question here which was suggested in connection with spelling, 
whether due attention is being given to the individual needs of the children, 
or whether the instruction is not being given to all members of the class alike, 
regardless of whether such instruction reaches the children’s individual needs.” 
The median scores given above, together with the averages from the Mary- 
land and New York measurements, are a start toward standards in composition 
for the respective grades.

  538 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
that the available objective tests and scales do not measure 
all the results of teaching. Why should this fact hinder 
their use? There can be but one valid answer, viz.: that the 
use of such tests will tend to obscure the more important 
duty of the teacher. The objection is variously stated, e. g.: 
“The giving of such tests will overemphasize that which is 
tested, and that which is tested is the more formal work of the 
school.” Another frequent form of the objection is: ‘The 
most important factor in teaching is the teacher’s personality, 
and no test can measure the results of personality.” Again it is 
said: “The benefits of school work come much more largely from 
the methods of work than from the knowledge acquired.” 
Each of these statements contains a certain amount of 
truth. It is true that the giving of tests calls attention to 
that which is tested, that the most important factor in the 
school is the personality of the teacher, and that the learning 
of methods of work is more important than the learning of 
facts. But it is also true that no tests need to overempha- 
size that which is tested, that no products of school work 
can be measured without measuring the influence of the per- 
sonality of the teacher, and that no methods of work can be 
learned without work. It therefore follows that with proper 
safeguards the results of any teaching may be properly 
measured. The danger of overemphasizing the formal is 
further discussed under noteworthy dangers, below. It 
ought also to be kept in mind that the use of standardized 
tests enables the teacher to know just what is expected of 
her and just how well she is fulfilling these expectations; 
hence, the competent teacher will be relieved of the anxiety 
of uncertainty, and her personality will be much more avail- 
able to work the more subtle changes of character develop- 
ment. 
It is also true that just to the degree that superintendents 
and other supervisory officers are furnished with authentic 
evidence of the results of the more objective phases of a 
given teacher’s work, just to that degree will these officers   
     
-P-A-G-E-651
  
MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 539 
be more free to study and evaluate the more subtle results 
of that teacher’s influence. The use of objective tests will 
help to secure an adequate evaluation of the results of per- 
sonality in another way, viz.: that of directing the attention 
of the supervisors to the changes actually made in the pupils. 
Too often at present supervisors base their judgment of 
teachers on their opinion of what teachers can do rather than 
on what they have done. It is often said: ‘Miss A. has a 
good personality; she must have a desirable influence on her 
pupils.” The influence of objective tests will tend to have 
such observations take the form: ‘‘Miss A. has changed her 
pupils in desirable directions; she must have a good person- 
ality.” 
Three Noteworthy Dangers.—Just as there are dangers in 
the use of every keen-cutting instrument or highly organized 
mechanism, so there are dangers in the use of standards of 
achievement. ‘These dangers will vary with the varying con- 
ditions and situations, and every teacher should be on the 
alert to guard against them. Three noteworthy dangers are: 
(t) That of overemphasizing the formal phases of education, 
(2) that of relying on the average, (3) that of relying on a 
single measurement of an individual. These are imminent 
in all situations and are therefore worthy of specific consid- 
eration. 
1. The Danger of Overemphasis—As noted on page 538, 
this danger is sometimes urged as an objection to measuring 
results, and it is a very real danger against which adequate 
precaution should be taken. As thus far constructed, tests 
and scales are largely limited to the formal as contrasted 
with the vital; to the tools of learning rather than the think- 
ing of learning; to the abstract rather than the concrete. 
And for teaching to become dominated by the content of 
these tests and scales would be a grave mistake. It would 
be to take many steps backward toward the days of the bare 
three R’s. 
The chief way to guard against the dangers of measure-
-P-A-G-E-652
540 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
ments, then, is to realize their limitations. For the present, 
they deal only with the formal or so-called fundamental ele- 
ments, and while proper control over these elements is essen- 
tial, school work on them could easily degenerate into mere 
cramming of facts if the “‘passing of the tests’? should come 
to be the main concern of teachers and pupils. The main 
concern in all school work should be the improvement of life 
situations, and the formal or tool side of learning should be 
conquered as a means by which this improvement can be 
brought about. Teachers and supervisors can effectually 
guard against this danger by having the subject matter so 
selected and arranged that pupils come to the study of the 
formal phases of education in their concrete, vital setting, 
and by having the teaching so conducted that pupils conquer 
these formal phases as a means of solving vital problems. 
So approached and so conquered the formal phases come to 
be looked upon as essential tools of learning, and there is lit- 
tle, if any, danger of overemphasizing them by measuring 
the progress pupils make in conquering them. 
A rigid limitation of the time to be devoted to specific 
drill on work to be tested is an effective practical means of 
avoiding this danger. 
2. The Danger of Relying on the Average.—As a general 
indication of how one’s pupils as a group stand with other 
similar groups, the average standing is worth while; but there 
is grave danger in relying on the average as a guide in judg- 
ing of the excellence of teaching. As was shown on page 531, 
one of the values of using tests is that they show so conclu- 
sively the wide variability among pupils of presumably equal 
or nearly equal ability. In spite of the convincing evidence 
of the facts of individual differences, some superintendents 
and some teachers continue to treat classes of children as if 
they all needed the same teaching, with the inevitable result 
that all the pupils are hindered because the work has to be 
made “average,” which means that it is too easy for the 
strong pupils, that it is too hard for the weak pupils, and
-P-A-G-E-653
  MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 541 
that the medium pupils are held back by the presence of 
both the strong and the weak. 
But a greater danger is found in the possible fallacy of 
the average as a measure of progress. It is a fact that a 
teacher can get her class up to the standard as shown by the 
average, and still not give the pupils good teaching. Figures 
XVII and XIX show this graphically.

The solid lines in these figures represent the abilities of a Grade 4 class at 
midyear in division combinations. By the end of the year they should have 
reached the standard as indicated by the horizontal line. If the teacher were 
willing to rely solely on the average as showing that her class had come up to 
standard she could have taught them as a single group and secured approxi- 
mately the gains as indicated by the dotted lines in Fig. XVIII, and the aver- 
age would have indicated “up to standard,” but if the teacher desired to help
-P-A-G-E-655
  
MEASURING RESULTS OF TEACHING 543 
each individual pupil according to his needs, she would teach them in three or 
more groups and secure approximately the gains as indicated by the dotted 
lines in Fig. XIX, and the average would also have indicated “up to 
standard.” 
The harm in following the wasteful way is that it wastes the time of all 
the pupils. The naturally competent respond readily and go beyond the 
standard, which means that they are using their time to learn something that 
they do not need and which the majority will therefore straightway forget. 
These quick pupils would much better be freed from most of the work in divi- 
sion and thus economize their time, and give the slower ones an opportunity 
to get the kind of teaching that would bring them up to standard. 
As is indicated in both these figures, it is probable that most classes will 
contain one or more pupils so weak in at least some abilities that they ought 
not to be brought up to standard. 
3. The Danger of Single Measurements.—As is shown in 
some detail above, it is of prime importance that teachers 
deal with the results of measurements in terms of individual 
standings rather than in terms of the average. The impor- 
tant fact is not the standing of the mythical average pupils, 
but that of the flesh-and-blood, deviating pupils. But there 
is need of caution in this, also, for there is danger of mis- 
judging some pupils if unguarded reliance is placed on single 
measurements; for a moment’s thought will convince one 
that any pupil is liable to have an “‘off day,” e. g., perhaps 
the test comes the day after a party, or the hour before a 
circus. In either event it is safe to say that few pupils will 
do themselves justice in the test. Of course, the teacher 
should guard against such distracting influences as the circus 
by her choice of time for giving the test; but do the best she 
can as to time, some pupils are liable not to be up to their 
ordinary capability. Hence the teacher must be careful and 
not misjudge a pupil by placing too much store by the results 
of a single measurement. If a pupil has been doing good 
work and falls low in a test it is always essential that he be 
given at least a second trial before passing judgment as to 
with what group he ought to have his further teaching. An 
illustration of the need for this precaution is shown in Figure 
XX.

This pupil did very poorly in this test in division on the first day and seemed 
to be a candidate for the lowest group, in that she tried only two out of ten 
examples and got only one right; bat on the second trial she came up markedly, 
doing eight out of ten, getting all correct; and on the third trial she did all ten 
and got all correct. 
The arrangement and general plan of the Courtis Practice Tests make them 
a noteworthy help in avoiding this danger. 
How to Begin Measuring.—The way to begin is to begin. 
Doubtless the best way is to see some one give a test or use 
a scale. But if this is not practicable, do not procrastinate; 
get a set of the more simple tests, read the directions and 
give them. Then read the directions for scoring and score 
the results. Do not be in a hurry to understand how to do 
all at once but take the work step by step. The Courtis 
tests are well adapted to making a beginning, both because 
they are comparatively well standardized and because of the 
clear, full directions which accompany them [2, 3]. Of the 
available scales, those on handwriting are probably best for 
beginners. Their use is very simple, and a little practice
-P-A-G-E-657

according to directions will enable any earnest, intelligent 
teacher to increase manyfold her ability to evaluate her 
work. This is a pioneer field for teachers, and it is therefore 
a rough, unbroken field, but it is a fruitful field, and it is a 
satisfactory field. It yields the joy of known achievement. 
*“ SUMMARY 
1. The introduction of standardized tests and scales into the work of 
teaching is similar to the introduction of such scientific instru- 
ments into other vocations. 
2. These scales are of the greatest value, even in their tentative stage, 
and teachers can learn to use them without special statistical 
or psychological training. 
3. At present, standardized tests are largely confined to the more 
formal phases of school work, “the thtee R’s,” although notable 
beginnings have been made in other phases, such as drawing, 
composition, ahd health and physical development. 
4. Developments and improvements in this line are very rapid, and 
progressive teachers and supervisors are alert to learn the latest 
improvements as they appear in the educational journals and 
elsewhere. 
5. In making use of the standard tests, directions must be carefully 
followed if results are to be compared with standardized scores. 
6. Certain dangers in wrong uses of the available tests are real, but 
with proper precautions most of the evils may be avoided. 
7. There is no real conflict between measuring the. results of teaching 
and the development of the subtler phases of social efficiency. 
In fact, the tests help to liberate teachers and pupils from much 
unnecessary drill. 
8. Initiative is necessary in making a beginning in the use of such 
tests, as in every other progressive movement, but, once in, the 
teacher has allied herself with a movement that promises more 
than any other for making teaching a profession. 
PROJECTS IN APPLICATION 
1. In the Elementary School Journal for September, 1916, Doctor W. 
S. Gray has made a list of standard tests and scales for the 
various subjects. Find this article and add to it any new stand- 
ard tests published since that time. 
2. Get a set of the best tests of the speed and comprehension of read- 
ing, and test either yourself and your class or some other group 
with it.
-P-A-G-E-658
  546 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
3. How fast is the typical (median) eighth-grade pupil able to read 
standard reading material for his grade, and with what degree 
of comprehension? What is a fair rate for adults? 
4. How early in a term do, say, ten per cent of the pupils of the sixth 
grade attain a reasonably desirable proficiency in certain stand- 
ard tests, such as those of arithmetic by S. H. Courtis, making 
it possible to excuse them from further drill and do other work ? 
5. If possible, test two different methods of drill in certain fundamental 
operations in arithmetic, and determine by the standard test 
which gives better results. 
6. What additions to your knowledge of educational measurement 
do you get from a reading of the chapter on this subject in Strayer 
and Norsworthy’s “How to Teach’? (Macmillan.) 
BIBLIOGRAPHY 
Note.—This list is numbered to correspond to the citations made 
in the body of the chapter. The references under each heading are 
arranged in the order of publication. Development is so rapid in this 
field that, other considerations being equivalent, the most recent dis- 
cussions are of most value. No attempt has been made to secure a 
complete list. Articles, books, and chapters in books are appearing 
very rapidly. The journals which are most active in publishing 
studies in measuring results are: The Journal of Educational Psychol- 
ogy (Warwick & York, Baltimore), Teachers College Record (Teachers 
College, New York City), and The Elementary School Journal (Uni- 
versity of Chicago). 
A selected list recommended for beginners will be found at the end.

PRELIMINARY PROBLEMS 
. When does the average adult read or think or study in his every- 
day life activities? For what types of purposes? 
. From chapter one and from your own experience what do you 
infer to be the immediate reason for studying and learning? 
. Do you learn more about how to make a back-yard garden by 
reading about it as a classroom subject or by making the 
garden and studying different problems as they come up? 
. Is it better to have a thorough course in the mechanics and methods 
of running an automobile, sewing-machine, lathe, or reaper be- 
fore trying to run one, ‘or to learn while and by running it? 
. If this is true for adults, is it more or less true for children? 
. What are the advantages of such schools as those of Gary and 
Tuskeegee over ordinary bookish schools? 
. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the home-project 
method of teaching agriculture or home economics? 
. What are the proper combination of study and motor activities 
for children of elementary school age? 
. Do you think it is possible or desirable to correlate, or subordinate, 
information getting with active, motor ‘‘occupations” ? 
What are the characteristics of the most natural and fruitful 
learning in children? 
I. Pragmatism and Intelligence.—According to the point 
view called pragmatism, intelligence, or the power of 
thought, is developed out of the struggles of organic beings 
to secure a successful exercise of their functions. The doc- 
trine may be compared with the theory of “economic inter- 
pretation of history,” taken in its broad sense. According to 
this theory, the main features of the structure of any par- 
ticular society are best understood by looking first into how 
1EprrortAL Note.—This chapter is reprinted from the first volume of The 
Progressive Journal of Education by permission.

  PROSPECTIVE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 553 
that society went at the problem of maintaining itself in 
existence—how it undertook the primary business of “making 
its living.” Similarly, the transformation and evolution of 
successive social states depend upon the introduction of new 
factors and forces into industrial production and exchange, 
so that men’s points of view—judgment of values—and the 
location of power—of control of nature and hence of others— 
are changed. Now, in a somewhat analogous way, pragma- 
tism holds that all the higher achievements of individual 
organic life result from the stress and strain of the problem 
of maintaining the functions of life. For life can be kept 
going only as the organism ‘“‘makes its living,” by proper 
manipulation of the environment and adjustment of the 
latter to its own vital ends. Reduced to their simplest terms, 
the biological problem of the individual and the economic 
problem of society are exactly the same. In each case the 
aim is to subordinate the materials and forces of the natural 
environment so that they shall be rendered tributary to life 
functions. 
Now, while this requires direct contact with things in 
seizing, digesting, etc., the limitations of the direct method 
of subjugation of materials to function are very great. The 
evolution of the nervous system represents the discovery of 
the advantages of indirect control by manipulation of the 
present environment on the basis of the past and future, of 
the felt and seen on the basis of the remote and foreseen. 
On this basis, it is not the business of thought to mirror 
with theoretical or speculative exactness an outside world. 
It is its business to select whatever is relevant to the most 
effective carrying on of life functions, and to arrange what 
is selected, not on the basis of some outside pattern, but 
with reference to facilitating the complete performance of all 
the activities possible to an organic being. Knowledge, ac- 
cordingly, is not an attempt to copy, after the fashion of an 
encyclopedia, all the facts of the universe. It is the expres- 
sion of man’s past most successful achievements in effecting 
   
-P-A-G-E-666
  554 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
adjustments and adaptations, put in a form so as best to 
help sustain and promote still greater control of the envi- 
ronment in the future. 
Former Theories.—This theory of the nature of intelli- 
gence and knowledge is contrasted with the two other theo- 
ries which have practically divided the field between them 
in the past. One, which may be called the transcendental 
theory of pure rationalism, is that the mind is an immaterial 
entity, temporarily housed in a material organism, having 
thought or reason as its own independent or a priori power, 
and creating knowledge by the exercise of its faculties, just 
because it.is the very nature of thought to produce knowledge. 
Knowledge, on this view, is an end complete in itself. It 
simply represents the deposit that results from the exercise 
of a purely theoretic faculty. It may possibly have some 
useful application in activity, but that is purely accidental 
—it is an afterthought. Knowledge is complete in itself just 
as soon as the purely theoretic capacity of reason has ex- 
pressed itself. 
The other contrasting view is that mind is a blank piece 
of paper, or a passive wax-like something on which objects 
impress themselves, and the accumulation of the records left 
behind constitutes knowledge. This view underlies, for ex- 
ample, Spencer’s theory of evolution, according to which 
mental forms and powers have been developed by the con- 
stant impact of environmental forces, the more transient 
features obliterating one another’s effects, while the more 
permanent have moulded intelligence into their own likeness. 
Knowledge, on this view, is a replica or duplicate edition 
within consciousness of what already exists ready-made 
without. 
Likenesses and Differences.—Now the pragmatic view of 
mind and knowledge agrees with this latter account in that 
it regards mind as a development and lays a great stress upon 
the relation between organism and the environment. But it 
regards the evolution of mind as a growth out of the constant
-P-A-G-E-667
  
PROSPECTIVE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 555 
tendency of life to sustain and fulfil its own functions through 
subordinating environment to itself rather than by passively 
accommodating itself to a coercion working from without. It 
does not regard intelligence, therefore, as merely a result of 
evolution, but as also a factor in guiding the evolutionary 
process; for it regards intelligence as an evolution of the func- 
tions of life to the point at which they can be performed most 
effectively. Similarly, knowledge, on this view, is not a copy 
whose truth is to be judged by its fidelity to an original; 
it is an instrument or organ of successful action. 
We do not judge the value of the hand or eye on the basis 
of their being copies of something previously existing in the 
environment, but on the basis of their worth as instrumen- 
talities of adjustments. On the pragmatic view, the case is 
the same with knowledge. What measures its value, its cor- 
rectness and truth, is the degree of its availability for con- 
ducting to a successful issue the activities of living beings. 
What we call “theory” and pure science are not then 
academic exercises of an isolated or transcendental reason, 
working according to its own a priori laws. They are simply 
the product of an unbiassed, wnprejudiced view of the condi- 
tions and consequences of the most efficient and fruitful action. 
For the success of an activity may be judged from either a 
narrow or a wide standpoint. When the individual views 
everything with reference to his ends and needs in isolation 
from the society of which he is a member, we do not get sci- 
entific knowledge, but knowledge in the form of opinion and 
dogma. When the individual considers the conditions and 
results of his activities from the standpoint of their bearing 
on the successful issue, or welfare, of the activities of the 
community, he gets the broadest, most general (or objective) 
point of view possible for human beings from which to know. 
The result of taking this social, instead of the purely personal, 
point of view is knowledge in its best sense—namely, science. 
And history shows that the advance of science represents the 
gradual victory of the more generic, or social, point of view 
 
-P-A-G-E-668
  
  5 56 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
over purely individual points of view, opinions, and merely 
class points of view—dogmas. Pure knowledge, in short, is 
knowledge on the basis of the widest and most effective appli- 
cation or service in social progress instead of individual advan- 
tage secured at the expense of others. It is therefore not 
properly opposed to applied or useful knowledge. 
Since one of the main offices of education is the training 
of mind—since, indeed, this is the only office of education 
when we consider mind in its organic connections with char- 
acter—a changed view of the nature and purpose of mind 
carries with it a very great change in educational ideas and 
practices. Education in the past has been dominated almost 
entirely by a combination of the two older views of mind 
which I have noted—that of a pure reason or of a purely pas- 
sive and receptive vessel. In general, the education of the 
“leisure class,” the prevalent idea of “culture,” is based on 
the notion of a mind separate, so far as possible, from mate- 
rial conditions and soiled by contact with them, a mind whose 
highest end is production of knowledge for. its own sake. On 
the other hand, education for the “‘masses” has been con- 
sidered a process by which certain features of their environ- 
ment were ground in upon them, till their minds were moulded 
into passive and obedient conformity to the existing type 
about them. 
Thus, to review, educational theory and practice in the 
past have been associated with two different theories of the 
nature of mind: 
1. One theory is that the highest faculty of mind is reason 
or pure thought, whose exercise results in knowledge. This 
view goes along with the notion that knowledge is an end in 
itself, apart from social uses and applications; it results in a 
theoretic type of education, one which its opponents con- 
demn as scholastic and academic, while its upholders always 
defend it on the ground of ‘‘culture” and a “liberal,” “hu- 
manistic” education. This type of education has prevailed 
almost entirely in the schools aiming to produce “gentlemen”
-P-A-G-E-669
  
PROSPECTIVE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 557 
in the English conventional sense—that is members of the 
ruling and leisure class. 
2. Another philosophy of mind has regarded mind as 
something purely passive, to be impressed from without by 
sensations and images which are then arranged to produce 
knowledge and beliefs. This notion has had its practical vogue 
mainly in education of the masses or “‘Jower classes,” with the 
effect, more or less consciously designed, of making them the 
passive and willing upholders of the existing order. For the 
things that were impressed upon the children of the lower 
schools were not, for the most part, natural objects and 
events; but the symbols of knowledge and of the art of calcu- 
lation—the written and printed forms of language and the 
rudiments of arithmetic. The effect was twofold. On the 
one hand, it developed mental dependency and submissive- 
ness. Docility, or obedient absorption of material presented 
by school-teacher and text-book, has been the traditional 
and conventional virtue of the schools. On the other hand, 
the social and economic conditions of elementary education 
have been such as to invite and to compel the great bulk of 
elementary school children to leave school at the point where 
they had enough reading, ’riting and ’rithmetic to make them 
more useful in subordinate economic positions, but not 
enough to encourage or enable them (save in rare instances) 
to rise to the point where they were masters of the direction 
of their own physical and mental powers. 
The New Theory of Mind.—Now, as was suggested above, 
the pragmatic theory of mind and of knowledge is adapted 
both to a different scheme of educational practice and to a 
different social aim for it. The pragmatic view of mind is 
that intelligence has developed primarily as an organ of 
readaptation and readjustment amid the needs of active 
functions that are continually increasing their complexity. 
The ameba has little need of mind and knowledge. Its func- 
tions are simple, largely undifferentiated, and exercised in a 
medium which is simple, mainly all of one kind. Man lives
-P-A-G-E-670
558 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
in a highly differentiated environment, a natural and social 
world in which there is an endless diversity of factors to be 
taken account of; and where the maintenance of life and the 
successful achievement of ends depends upon delicate and 
far-reaching combinations of various factors. Every advance 
in civilization, every progressive social change, increases the 
number of factors at work and also the difficulty of keeping 
them balanced up (or co-ordinated, as we say technically) 
with one another. The meal of the savage, his clothes, his 
shelter, bring into relation to one another only a scanty 
number of elements, existing at most over a short period of 
time, covering only a few square miles of space, and involv- 
ing the co-operation of but a few score of people at most. 
The corresponding satisfactions of a modern denizen of a 
city, even of the poorest, are syntheses or co-ordinations of 
factors that operate almost over the entire world, cover a 
period of some years of successive activities and require the 
coadjustments of thousands of people. 
Now this is only one illustration of a general law of devel- 
opment. The modern astronomer or chemist not only has 
thousands of facts to deal with where his ancestor had one, 
but he also has the problem of classifying, grouping each new 
fact; of fitting in with other facts, a process which perhaps 
requires the correction and reclassification of old facts as 
well as the interpretation of new ones. In this way, for 
example, the new facts discovered by Darwin were not merely 
added to old ones, but their discovery compelled a thorough 
re-examination and restatement of every previously known 
detail of botany and zoology. Wherever we look we find 
organic evolution both multiplying the number of details or 
elements that enter in, and also increasing the problem and 
the task of keeping these all properly balanced up with regard 
to one another. Otherwise, the mere increase in number and 
the unlikeness of parts would lead to utter confusion and a 
breakdown from dead weight. Because the human organism 
has so many more specialized parts or organs than the ameba
-P-A-G-E-671
PROSPECTIVE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 559 
or the oyster, it is exposed to the danger of thousands of mal- 
adjustments and failures of co-operative activities which do 
not confront the other animals. And the same is true in 
comparing modern societies with savage groups. 
The pragmatic theory points out that mind or intelligence 
is an accompaniment of just this process of organic growth 
in nature and in society. Mind is, so to speak, a device for 
keeping track of the increased differentiation and multipli- 
cation of conditions, and planning for, arranging for in ad- 
vance, ends and means of activity which will keep these 
various factors in proper adjustment to one another. This 
explains the fact that all intelligence involves a peculiar com- 
bination of the sensory and receptive factor (emphasized by 
the passive theory of education) with the active, intellectual 
factor—emphasized by the theory of pure rational activity. 
The function of sensation is to afford stimuli to properly 
directed behavior—i. e., to behavior which will keep the life 
functions properly adjusted. With respect to knowledge, 
sensations indicate the condition of things with respect to 
which the organism has to act. The object of sensations is 
not to mirror or even register the whole external world, but 
simply to make the individual agent aware of those things in 
the environment which threaten its welfare or which afford 
the resources needed at the given time in the life adjust- 
ments of the individual. If we regard sensations as intended 
to give knowledge of the external world in its entirety, they 
are ludicrously incompetent to the end. If we regard them 
as devices for warning an agent of threatening dangers and 
for calling out responses which will enable the agent to pro- 
tect himself and to avoid or destroy the obstacles, they are 
admirably fit for the purpose. 
Thinking.—When, however, situations are complicated, 
the reports that come to an organism of the state of things © 
that require attention if the organism is to hold its own are 
very diverse and incompatible. It would be impossible for 
the organism to react to them all at once; but it might be
-P-A-G-E-672
  
560 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
fatal for it arbitrarily to select one or a few, and ignore the 
others. A mistake in the selection must destroy the organ- 
ism. Thinking develops accordingly as a method of valuing 
the importance of the various stimuli that demand attention. 
Judgment, in the popular usage, is precisely power to esti- 
mate the relative value of things as claimants for notice and 
responsive behavior. A faint sound may be of more impor- 
tance in the long run than a loud one; a dim light more 
fraught with consequence upon the welfare of the organism 
than a bright one. Thought is required to discount their 
immediate strength, and to interpret them on the basis of 
their indirect and remote consequences. The power of imagi- 
nation weighs the various stimuli that are struggling to con- 
trol action up against one another; devises a method for dis- 
counting those which may be only momentarily more violent, 
and works up seemingly insignificant reports. Thus imagi- 
nation and thought are processes of estimating observed 
objects in the light of their possible future consequences. 
They are forecasts, tentative predictions or conjectures as 
to what present conditions indicate or prophesy regarding 
future developments. All ideas are of the nature of what 
the scientist calls ‘‘working hypotheses”; forecasts of what 
will happen under future conditions; forecasts employed, 
moreover, to guide and direct activities so that if possible 
the desirable conditions will be realized. Those ideas that 
really “‘work”’; the forecasts that future events verify when 
they arrive; the plans and methods of behavior which success- 
fully modify conditions in the direction desired, are true; and 
the term truth as applied to judgments and ideas has no 
other meaning than this. 
Il. Educational Bearings on Methods.—I now touch 
briefly upon the bearings of this conception of mind upon the 
question of educational method, reserving for a later section 
its bearings upon the subject matter of study, and upon the 
social or moral basis and aim of schools: 
1. Every educative process should begin with doing some-
-P-A-G-E-673
  
PROSPECTIVE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 5601 
thing, and the necessary training of sense-perception, memory, 
imagination, and judgment should grow out of the conditions 
and needs of what is being done. The something done should 
not be of the nature of an arbitrary task imposed by a task- 
master, but something inherently significant, and of such a 
nature that the pupil appreciates for himself its importance 
enough to take a vital interest in it. This is the way the 
child gets all the first training of his powers and all his first . 
knowledge of the world. In carrying out his instinctive ten- 
dency to reach, handle, throw, a baby learns to know his 
own limbs and their capacities, and becomes acquainted with 
the properties of things—their hardness, color, form, size, 
and a thousand and one properties. He did not start to 
know these things, nor did any teacher set him the lesson 
of finding out about them. He started to do something, 
and these results came necessarily. 
For a few years of his life, the first few, a child’s instinc- 
tive eagerness and the natural environment are so well 
adjusted that this educative training goes on at a very rapid 
rate and, relatively speaking, almost without oversight or 
guidance. There comes a time when a richer, fuller, and more 
carefully selected and arranged environment is required to 
afford the stimuli and conditions of the most educative activ- 
ity. An environment more varied than that of the ordinary 
home, and yet one not so varied, disorderly, overpowering, 
and overspecialized as that of social life in general. 
Conscious education begins at this point. If it were what 
it ought to be and what it may become, it would consist in 
the selection and arrangement of an environment of materials 
and tools, with models of the best artistic achievement of 
such a nature as to call out and exercise the child’s life func- 
tions—to suggest to him, in other words, things worth doing 
and to keep him engaged in doing them. Teachers would be 
present, more competent, more experienced members of a 
society; but they would be present as fellow workers and 
fellow players—comrades in carrying on the scheme of play
-P-A-G-E-674
  562 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
and work activities, and in building up, along with the chil- 
dren, a miniature world as the obvious result and reward of 
their joint activities. 
2. Sense training would inevitably result from engaging in 
these various activities. The boy who plays marbles and ball, 
the girl who dresses and undresses her doll and makes clothes 
for her, gets a training of the senses which is all the more 
effective because it is incidental to the carrying on of some 
line of action, and is not set up as a special task or end in 
itself. Clay modelling, gardening, shop work in wood or 
metal, cooking, weaving, etc.—these are the normal methods 
for cultivating power of observation and accurate interpreta- 
tion of sensations. The race did not acquire its original store 
of information for the sake of knowledge, nor yet by having 
natural objects impress themselves on the mind. It learned 
about plants, animals, stones, metals, weather, etc., because 
a knowledge of these things was required fo solve problems of 
food, shelter, clothing, social co-operation, and defense, and 
so on. 
3. The more intellectual side of education, the store of general 
ideas and principles, the requisition of habits of reflection and 
deliberation, should be placed on the same basis. All thinking 
at its outset is planning, forecasting, forming purposes, select- 
ing and arranging means for their most economical and 
successful realization. Comparatively little opportunity is af- 
forded in our present school systems for the practical activi- 
ties which are necessary to develop this type of thought. 
Opportunities for independent manipulation of materials, 
initiative, and responsibility for getting results, for detecting 
and correcting errors, are few and far between. As a result, 
the power of thinking remains comparatively undeveloped 
except in the few who are naturally adapted to more special- 
ized and purely theoretic interests—children and youth whose 
thinking clusters about the symbols for things, rather than 
things themselves. Such persons get specialized naturally 
into an academic class of investigators and speculators. The
-P-A-G-E-675
  
PROSPECTIVE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 563 
world doubtless owes a great deal to its pure ‘‘researchers” 
and scholars; but it would owe a great deal more still to them 
if they had been educated into habits of thinking out the 
bearings of their abstract ideas upon social matters. As it is, 
they have been largely shunted off into an isolated and re- 
mote class—isolated and remote socially, that is—where the 
results of their thinking are quite “safe,” because not trans- 
lated from symbols into the facts of action. 
Traits of Intellectual Instruction—In an educational 
scheme which should embody practically the pragmatic con- 
ception of thought, intellectual instruction would have, then, 
the following traits: (a) It would grow—all of it—out of the needs 
and opportunities of activities engaged in by the students them- 
selves. This principle would be universal. At present it is 
expressed sporadically; to some extent in the kindergarten 
at the lower end, in the scientific laboratories at the upper, 
and in the manual and occupational activities of shop work, 
cooking, etc., along the line. (6) Information would not be 
amassed and accumulated and driven into pupils as an end 
in itself, but would cluster about the development of activi- 
ties. Some information is immediately required in order to 
do anything successfully; a child cannot garden intelligently 
without learning about soils, seeds, measures, plants and 
their growth, the facts of rain, sunshine, etc. Interest in the 
continuous carrying on of such an activity would, however, 
generate curiosity and openness of mind about many things 
not directly related to the immediate needs. Methods of 
agriculture in this and other lands, the historic evolution of 
this occupation, the social and economic problems connected 
with it, have a natural interest and avenue to the mind of one 
who has developed personal interest in a similar activity, 
which they cannot have for one who merely hears or reads 
about them second hand. One great object, then, in having 
school work organized mainly about certain continuous lines 
of occupation is that these afford natural axes for the collec- 
tion and organization of all kinds of facts and ideas. (c)
-P-A-G-E-676
564 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Instruction carried on upon this basis would teach the mind 
that all ideas, truths, theories, etc., are of the nature of working 
hypotheses. One of the chief obstacles to the progress of the 
race has been the dogmatic habit of mind, the belief that some 
principles and ideas have such a final value and authority 
that they are to be accepted without question and without 
revision. The experimental habit of mind, that which re- 
gards ideas and principles as tentative methods of solving 
problems and organizing data, is very recent. An education 
based upon the pragmatic conception would inevitably turn 
out persons who were alive to the necessity of continually testing 
their ideas and beliefs by putting them into practical applica- 
tion, and of revising their beliefs on the basis of the results of 
such application. 
II. Educational Bearings on Subject Matter.—Having 
spoken of the pragmatic theory in general and of its special 
bearings upon educational method, I propose to speak briefly 
of its connection with educational subject matter, or the ma- 
terial of the course of study. For the last two or three cen- 
turies educational reformers have protested against the con- 
ventional scheme of studies on the ground of its artificiality 
and remoteness from life. At first they protested against its 
verbal and linguistic character, against the fact that it was 
devoted so exclusively to symbols of learning. This protest 
has been more or less effectual and material from nature (the 
sciences) and from the life of man (history) introduced into 
the schools. Then ‘there: was a protest against the exclu- 
sively informational character of these studies—against the 
emphasis upon memorizing and the accumulation of knowl- 
edge—and a demand for what would connect more directly 
and more usefully with contemporary social requirements. 
Industrial drawing, manual training, the rudiments of vari- 
ous arts have been introduced in response to this demand. 
If we add to the list of studies finally pursued in the schools 
the subjects of music and the other “fine” arts, we do not 
wonder that there has grown up an outcry against an over-
-P-A-G-E-677
  
PROSPECTIVE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 565 
loaded curriculum, lacking in unity and concentration, scat- 
tering and overstraining the activities of both teachers and 
children. There has even been a cry for a return to the sim- 
plicity of the meagre fare of the old-fashioned three R’s. 
But is there not some other way of securing organization of 
material and unity of purpose? 
Occupational Activities as a Centre.—The education of 
the human race, upon the whole, has been gained through 
the occupations which it has pursued and developed. The 
vocations, the professions, the lines of activity which have 
been socially evolved, have furnished the social stimuli to 
knowledge and the centres about which it has been organized. 
If occupations were made fundamental in education, school 
work would conform to the principles of social and mental 
development. The beginnings of this reform have already 
been introduced. Froebel got a glimpse of this conception 
in his scheme of education for infancy, though his policy was 
too romantic and symbolic to permit the idea to get adequate 
expression. Engineering and technical schools, in which the 
sciences are pursued in reference to their social uses, illus- 
trate, at the upper end of the school ladder, another aspect of 
the same principle. The increasing emphasis upon garden- 
ing, horticulture, cooking, weaving, shop work in wood and 
metal in the elementary and secondary schools is another 
symptom of the same movement. The ultimate value and 
(let us hope) destiny of the present movement toward indus- 
trial education will depend upon whether it becomes switched 
off into a method of class-education—in which case it would 
be better for it to perish immediately—or whether it recog- 
nizes the fundamenta: importance of training in typical and 
continuous lines of activity, which are of social value for 
everybody. 
Educational Values.—It is a serious error to think of 
occupational activities as if they were merely of prosaic and 
utilitarian, or even commercial, worth. Their primary value 
is educational. It consists in training the thinking of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-678
  566 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
boys and girls in connection with things that appeal to them 
as worth doing, instead of training thought-power by partly 
formal tasks and gymnastic exercises. It does not exclude, 
but includes a broad and liberal scheme of knowledge. All 
typical social occupations rest upon scientific insight and in- 
formation. One of the chief values of shop work, weaving, 
gardening, etc., even in elementary schools, is that they in- 
troduce the pupil to natural facts and forces and give him a 
motive for becoming thoroughly acquainted with the con- 
crete facts and laws of nature. The historic development of 
the occupations by which men have subjugated nature by 
learning its secrets, and have learned how to co-operate with 
another for common ends, gives the key to the study of his- 
tory; it indicates what is important and what is ‘trivial in 
the mass of facts that has come down from the past. An 
adequate mastery of typical occupations brings the pupil to 
a study of the social conditions and aims of the present; to 
facts which, when classified, form sociology, political econ- 
omy, civics, and politics. The fine arts are naturally in- 
cluded; for, as Morris and others have pointed out, all em- 
bodiment of ideas in external form, when done freely and 
with joy in the activity, tends to gain an artistic quality. In 
short, there is nothing of science, history, or art which the 
educational experience of the past has shown to be of worth 
which an occupational education would not include. Old 
values would be conserved, but would be centralized about a 
new principle and acquire the vitality of a new motive. 
Finally, such an education would change the morale of 
the school. Since the activities of the latter would be con- 
tinuous with the interests and activities of men and women 
at large, the school would lose the special code of ethics and 
moral training, which must characterize it as long as it is 
isolated. It would take up into itself the moral aims and 
forces of social sympathy, co-operation, and progress. Occu- 
pations bring people naturally together in groups, develop a 
group of consciousness and power to divide and yet co-operate 
 
-P-A-G-E-679
  PROSPECTIVE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 567 
harmoniously. Knowledge, scholastic attainments, esthetic 
culture, pursued, as at present, with only personal ends in 
view, tend to egoism, social stratifications, and antagonisms. 
SUMMARY 
1. The mind has been developed through variation and selection, 
like horns, tough skins, or great or microscopic bodily size, as a 
means of adjustment, as an aid in getting on well in the world, 
thus helping to satisfy the instincts and especially to aid in 
solving ever-pressing economic problems. 
2. Knowledge gained by psycho-physical pursuits in gaining a living 
and living a life is thus also an instrument of better adjustment. 
3. However, two commonly-held theories of much import for our 
schools are opposed to this view, namely, (1) knowledge is not 
a tool obtained for a purpose and for use in life, but is the results 
of the activity of the independent soul and thus an end in itself, 
and (2) that the mind is merely a recording device for receiving 
impressions from without. 
4. Several comparisons and contrasts between these two theories and 
that of the first, or so-called ‘‘pragmatic” theory are brought 
out. The first, emphasizing knowledge for its own sake, is a 
leisure-class theory which gives us no clew for determining 
relative values in subject matter or methods. The second is a 
view of what lower-class schooling should be, the drilling of 
passive individuals into the knowledges and habits, especially 
of a tool character, which make them most docile subjects of 
the ruling class. 
5. The new theory puts the emphasis on intelligence as a tool with 
which to attain purposes, on knowledge picked and modified 
to use for attaining the goal of living, on books, studies, subjects, 
and curricula as so many instruments for help in solving the 
problems of life, as suggested in chapter one. 
6. Thinking is a high type of adjustment in which life situations are 
met by means of tentative solutions held in mind long enough to 
examine them for relative advantages and disadvantages in 
meeting the issue and then coming to a conclusion. 
7. Three educational bearings appear from this pragmatic theory: 
(1) Every educative process should begin with doing something 
worth while to the individual and to society; (2) the senses would 
get a better training from such naturally motivated activities 
than from any formal sense-training exercises, and (3) desirable 
knowledge, habits, ideals, and appreciations in the direction of
-P-A-G-E-680
  568 TEACHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
social aims and individual needs should grow out of similar motor 
and social activities of school and community. 
8. By making act've occupations the correlating centre instead of 
book study as at present the following improvements in our 
elementary education would tend to come about, as they are now 
appearing in many of our best schools using such activities: 
rt"The school would become more life-like and interesting, thus pro- 
viding a happier life for the children which is their right. 
(6) Knowing and doing would be so connected in the situation-response 
manner that knowledge, habits, ideals, and appreciations 
would not be merely school acquisitions or inert lumber of the 
mind, but active forces in every-day adjustment within and 
without the school. 
(c) The habit of energizing, of executive competency, would be kept 
alive for dealing with the affairs of life. 
(d) More useful knowledge would be gained and retained in the con- 
nection with situations in which it must be used. 
(e) General discipline would be greater and formal discipline would 
not be relied on. 
+f}+The school would contribute more to the community and in turn 
be better supported by it.

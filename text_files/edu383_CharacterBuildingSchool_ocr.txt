  CHARACTER BUILDING 
IN SCHOOL 
* INTRODUCTION 
THE PERSONALITY OF THE TEACHER 
Fresu from their normal training two young 
women once became teachers in the same 
school. They had beenneighbors and friends 
from childhood. Throughout their school 
years they had been in the same classes ; at 
home they had lived amid similar condi- 
tions. Each came from a home where rigid 
economy was necessary. Out of parental 
love, as ever, grew the wish that the lives 
of these children might be easier and happier 
than had been the lives of their fathers and 
mothers ; sacrifice and self-denial, as ever, re- 
sulted. But the daughters of the two homes 
received this devotion in far different spirit. 
One was consumed with impatient ambi- 
tion, and fretted and chafed under the lim-

  itations imposed by a lack of this world’s 
goods. Filled with the vanity of self-love, 
she believed that only the lack of opportu- 
nity barred her from a social position in 
which she would shine. She saw her par- 
ents make sacrifices in order that she might 
have advantages denied to them; but this 
unselfishness called forth from her no return 
in tenderness or consideration ; she accepted 
all as her due. She saw her mother over- 
burdened with household cares, but excused 
herself from sharing them because there were 
lessons to be prepared ; yet she never failed 
to find time for pleasures. Self-support she 
faced as an unpleasant necessity, from which 
there was no escape. Teaching seemed to 
offer more opportunities for satisfying her 
ambition than did other occupations. A 
teacher, then, she decided to be. She pro- 
mised herself that she would attain the high- 
est position in her profession; that she 
would force the world to recognize her in- 
tellectual power; and that the greater ad- 
miration would result when the handicaps 
of her home were considered. 
2

  INTRODUCTION 
Fired by these hopes, she applied herself 
to her work with such diligence that ere 
long she stood at the head of her classes. 
The praise she received from her teachers, 
the admiration of some of her classmates, 
and the envy or jealousy of others, fed her 
vanity. Her parents’ pride in her increased ; 
they yielded more and more to her wishes, 
and by so doing unwittingly encouraged and 
developed her selfishness. Thus, quite nat- 
urally she came to have an exaggerated opin- 
ion of herself and her powers. She felt that 
the eyes of the world were already upon her, 
and that full success awaited her at the end 
of school days. In due time came the begin- 
ning of her work as a teacher. She accepted 
herappointment simply asa means to an end. 
Of love for her profession she had none. 
Her friend and companion became, by 
chance, a teacher in a neighboring school- 
room. Did she commence her work in a like 
spirit? Had she grown up with the same 
rebellious and selfish feelings? During the 
years of school life she had been quite as 
conscious as her classmate of the limitations 
3
-P-A-G-E-10

at home; she, however, had thought not of 
herself alone, but of her parents. As the 
years passed and she realized more and 
more the sacrifices they constantly made for 
her sake, she longed to make some substan- 
tial return for all their loving kindness. 
When discouragement threatened to over- 
come her, this desire spurred her on. Some- 
times, as she looked forward to her life asa 
teacher, her heart sank. From the tales of 
others, teaching seemed to be a discourag- 
ing occupation. But such thoughts she re- 
solutely dismissed, resolving to do the very 
best she could. It would be foolish, she 
reasoned, to waste timein forebodings. Self- 
support was a necessity ; it must be accepted 
hopefully and cheerfully. She must not dis- 
appoint her parents. And then would come 
to her happy, stimulating hopes of what she 
might be able to do forthem when she began 
to have an income of her own. 
Study she loved for its own sake, and for 
the sense of freedom and power that know- 
ledge brought; to her there was no vain 
delight simply in outstripping her fellow

  INTRODUCTION 
students; keen, though, was the pleasure of 
the race. The praise and encouragement of 
teachers were as sweet to her as to her friend, 
the leader of the class; yet how different was 
the effect! For, as this girl studied, she 
seemed to enter a new world ; daily her hori- 
zon enlarged ; daily she discovered new de- 
lights. She realized the truth, “‘ Knowledge 
is power” ;@n: gradually she began to see 
what joy it must be to know a thing well 
and to lead others toward the same know- 
ledge.: Surely this must lift teaching above 
the drudgery which it had been pictured to 
be! Perhaps failure had come to some be- 
cause they had not seen the greatness of 
their work. She saw that the true teacher is 
a leader, and felt a new ambition to be help- 
ful in a wider circle than her family. Slowly 
there came a consciousness of her true self, 
as separate from the body, a something that 
ruled the body, a something that could in- 
spire others. She grew to realize the powers 
she possessed in that great and marvelous 
gift of God to man—the power to think. 
She recognized the value of a trained mind. 
5

Looking about her at the things man 
makes— buildings, bridges, homes, pictures, 
books— she saw that each was the outer 
manifestation of man’s thought. Soon there 
came to her a new appreciation of a great 
truth,— that man not only manifests his 
thoughts in material things, but that he him- 
self is the product of his thoughts. An op- 
portunity to prove this for herself was at 
hand; for was she not fully conscious of a 
certain disagreeable trait in her own charac- 
ter? This she now recognized as the result 
of her own thoughts. Why not experiment 
with it? She put herself on her guard; when 
an unwholesome thought came, she banished 
it. In its place she sought to harbor a 
thought that would benefit. It proved no 
easy matter to overcome her former careless 
habit. At times she was tempted to make 
no further struggle ; for, might it not be too 
late? But finally to her great delight, her 
mother, knowing nothing of her experiment, 
commented upon the change in her. Here 
was proof that encouraged her! In others, 
too, she was able to trace the influence

-P-A-G-E-13
  INTRODUCTION 
and manifestation of their predominating 
thoughts. She saw enough to strengthen her 
belief. “As a man thinketh in his heart, so 
is he,” —became a mighty inspiration. To 
herself she said, over and over again, “I 
can be what I will to be!” But this meant 
effort — steady and persistent. Grooves in 
the brain quickly wear deep; it is not the 
work of a day to alter channels of thought. 
How much better if long ago she had built 
up a habit of controlling her thoughts. Here 
was another idea! As a child she had never 
been taught that a way of thinking molds 
a character. Suppose that years before she 
had discovered this for herself — or that 
someone, perhaps a teacher, had told her? 
Suppose that she, a teacher, guide her pu- 
pils toward this knowledge? Would teach- 
ing be worth while? In this spirit she com- 
menced her lifework. 
The other teacher, beginning with no love 
of her work, had no desire to help her pupils. 
With her, everything was superficial. Chil- 
dren she regarded as noisy, troublesome, or

  positively disagreeable; but ambition led her 
on. She resolved to make a success so bril- 
liant as to lead to her promotion to the high 
school where she would have more appre- 
ciative classes; while she remained in her 
present position she determined that she 
would have a perfect school: she would have 
a quiet room; she would have unquestion- 
ing obedience; and the children must do 
their work well. Nothing short of excellence 
in these matters would satisfy her, since she 
had her reputation as a teacher to make. 
Here, as in schooldays, habit asserted it- 
self; appearances and personal comfort stood 
for more than the opportunity to serve 
others. 
Fora few daysall passed pleasantly enough. 
The novelty of her situation was interesting, 
and the pupils maintained a quiet demeanor 
that was most gratifying. The new teacher 
did not see that she was being studied and 
that some of her pupils were measuring her 
strength, or weakness, to see how far they 
could safely venture. Soon there were petty 
misdemeanors ; though annoying, these were

  INTRODUCTION 
easily settled, but somehow they left in the 
teacher no sense of victory. To her the of- 
fender was an offender because she found 
him annoying and irritating. He interfered 
with the good order of the school, and so 
injured her reputation; he showed a lack of 
respect and appreciation of her to which she 
was wholly unaccustomed. Her pride was 
hurt; her sense of dignity was outraged. In 
the spirit aroused by such thoughts, the 
teacher meted out punishment which had 
no reforming effect. Thus her weakness 
was exposed. The disorders continued. Fre- 
quently the teacher lost control of her tem- 
per altogether; and this inevitably tended 
to lessen the respect of the pupils. From 
an indifference to children in the beginning, 
she grew positively to dislike them. This 
feeling, which she took no pains to conceal, 
the children were quick to discover and re- 
sent. And the effect?

Always ’t is by love that hatred ceases; only love.

With it all, this teacher experienced’ an un- 
comfortable sense of defeat, a thing quite new 
to her. Her self-love was hurt by the lack 
of respect and love on the part of the pupils, 
to whom she had given neither respect 
nor love. Finally a serious misdemeanor was 
committed, The culprit had been guilty of 
many slight offenses which his teacher had 
shown neither good judgment nor wisdom 
in correcting. She felt her inability to deal 
with the case, and referred it to the princi- 
pal. Later the matter was taken up by the 
superintendent, and the offender was dis- 
missed from school. Since he had beena 
leader in disorder, the teacher now felt that 
his removal would restore order, and her 
work would be comparatively easy. Shesoon 
learned her mistake. Several kindred spirits 
seemed to rise up to take the place of the 
onedismissed. The teacher’s trials increased, 
instead of diminishing. 
Thus, her first year of teaching proved a 
bitter experience, and she rejoiced when it 
came to a close and she was free from 
her uncongenial duties. The strain upon 
10

  INTRODUCTION 
her nerves had been severe, and her general 
health was impaired. She attached no blame 
to herself, however, but to her unruly pu- 
pils. Instead of the brilliant success she had 
expected, her first year of teaching had been 
a failure. The following year, profiting by 
her experience, she made a better record. 
As the years passed, she won the reputation 
of being a strict disciplinarian and a good 
teacher; but her stern and unloving disposi- 
tion repelled her pupils, and children looked 
forward with dread to entering her class. A 
sense of failure embittered her, but she con- 
tinued to blame conditions and other people 
rather than herself. In her zealous ambition 
she had exalted the brain over the heart; 
she had failed to develop the unselfishness, 
patience, and sympathy that would have won 
for her the love and respect of her pupils, 
and true success as her reward. 
Her more unselfish companion entered 
upon her new duties in a spirit altogether 
different. She had gained an understanding 
of herself that helped her to understand 
others and to sympathize with them. She 
Ir

  * CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
believed that the true purpose of life is the 
building of character, and she realized the 
value and the power of thought as the means 
of accomplishing it. She believed that her 
success as a teacher could be measured only 
by the extent to which she could impart these 
truths to her pupils, and make them a living 
force in the young lives. 
She was firmly convinced of one thing: 
that she, and not her pupils, was the domi- 
nating factor, and therefore responsible for 
the success or failure of the school. She real- 
ized that her personality was a subtle influ- 
ence that would be felt in the school and would 
result in happiness or unhappiness to her 
pupils. 
Being thus deeply impressed with the re- 
sponsibility of leadership in her new position, 
she mapped out for herself a definite plan 
of conduct. She saw herself as the repre- 
sentative of lawful authority in a position of 
grave responsibility. This her pupils must 
recognize. She realized that the ultimate 
purpose of the public school is training for 
good citizenship; and that a first step in 
12
-P-A-G-E-19
  INTRODUCTION 
good citizenship is respect for law and or- 
der, and obedience to that which makes for 
the good of all. This, too, her pupils must 
understand. But she felt that words would 
be of little avail to impress these truths, un- 
less back of them was the force of her own 
convictions. 
She must feel in herself the power to lead. 
By her conduct and bearing she must win 
the respect of her pupils. She felt that the. 
new life upon which she was about to enter 
demanded the cultivation of new feelings, 
out of which would grow new thoughts. Up 
to this time she had been guided; she must 
now guide. Ina sense she must stand alone. 
She must meet and solve the problems 
which her school would present; no one 
could solve them for her. She must expect, 
though seeking counsel, to rely upon herself. 
She came to realize that certain attitudes 
of mind were indispensable to successful 
teaching ; and that the most essential of these 
was love for the pupils. She felt quite sure 
that children thrive only i in an atmosphere 
of love, and that there is no place in any 
13
-P-A-G-E-20
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
school for an unloving teacher. Just as there 
is an atmosphere upon which the health and 
life of the body depend, she reasoned, so 
there must be an atmosphere for the soul, 
determined by thoughts. Just as the teacher 
must see that the air in the schoolroom is 
fresh and pure, so she should keep the 
moral atmosphere pure, stimulating, and 
uplifting through love. It seemed to her 
that a teacher whose thoughts were selfish, 
unloving, discontented, or depressed was 
exhaling a poison far more deadly than im- 
pure air breathed into the lungs; for the lat- 
ter would poison merely the body, but the 
other the soul of the child. Cheerfulness, 
too, so often the result of love, she must 
cultivate. She tried in imagination to put 
herself in the place of a child compelled to 
spend hours a day in the company of a dis- 
contented, depressed, unhappy teacher; and 
she resolved that, come what might in the 
way of personal trials or sorrow, she would 
not intrude them upon helpless little chil- 
dren by bringing to the schoolroom gloomy 
or discouraged thoughts. 
14
-P-A-G-E-21
INTRODUCTION 
Honesty, also, was enjoined upon her. — 
She was now a servant of the public, receiv- 
ing payment for her services. Shehad, there- 
fore, sold her time, so many hours a day, so 
many days a week, and so many weeks a 
year. This time no longer belonged to her ; 
it belonged to her pupils and must be spent 
in service for them. If she used any part of 
it in service for herself, was she honest? She 
could not leave the schoolroom bodily to 
go to her home, and engage in personal 
matters during the school session. Had she 
any more right to leave the schoolroom in 
thought, and become absorbed in personal 
or family matters? If she allowed her 
thoughts during school hours to dwell upon 
plans for her own pleasures, or upon her 
own cares, was she not using time that was 
no longer hers? If she did this, was she 
honest? She resolved that she would drop 
all thoughts of personal matters when she 
crossed the threshold of her schoolroom, 
and resolutely give herself to her work 
as honesty demanded. If she dismissed 
thoughts of an anticipated pleasure, that 
15 
 
-P-A-G-E-22

  pleasure when it came would be increased 
by the freedom and peace of mind which 
work well done always brings. If she dis- 
missed cares, she would become stronger to 
cope with them. These, then, were her reso- 
lutions :— 
To love her pupils. 
To be cheerful. 
To be honest. 
With her, as with her neighbor, there 
was at first good order, then there were 
petty offenses, and finally a case of willful 
disobedience. To the teacher, it was a new 
and most distressing experience; but habit 
came to her aid. She did not consider the 
offense from the standpoint of self, but 
from the standpoint of the offender. It 
never occurred to her to view the matter as 
_ an insult to her dignity or an outrage to 
her pride. What of the boy? What made 
him behave so? Was he ill? Was he prop- 
erly nourished, neither underfed nor over- 
fed? Was he fretted by something at home? 
Was he overindulged? neglected? His con- 
duct had not been that of a normal healthy 
16

  INTRODUCTION 
child. Back of the effect was the cause. It 
was evident that in this case something was 
wrong; therefore, she would act slowly. 
She would suspend judgment and withhold 
punishment until she had given herself 
time to think out a solution. It did not 
occur to her to refer the case to either the 
principal or the superintendent. This was 
her problem, and she felt that she must try 
mightily to solve it before calling in the aid 
of others. Neither did she desire to rid the 
school of a troublesome pupil. Turning a 
boy out into the streets cannot make a good 
citizen of him. Two things she felt sure of. 
First, that this boy, the real boy, could be 
reached and helped. Second, that she could 
do this, provided she were earnest and sin- 
cere in her desire to help him. It might 
take both time and patience, but she felt sure 
she could help him. And she did. 
Times of discouragement came when she 
felt she was accomplishing so little that she 
would gladly have given up the work and 
turned her back upon it forever. But this 
was not possible; so she summoned courage 
17

  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
to her aid, and went bravely on, doing the 
best she could, and slowly but surely win- 
ning not only a good reputation, but true 
success. She was loved by every child who 
came under her influence; pupils of hers 
grew into men and women a share in whose 
training she was proud to claim; her fellow 
teachers intuitively looked to her for inspir- 
ation and guidance. 
Do you recognize these two schoolrooms, 
each with its own atmosphere ?— these two 
teachers, each with her own habit of thought? 
Can you doubt the effect upon the two 
groups of pupils? One schoolroom is a 
prison, the teacher a warden; the other is a 
happy workroom, with a kind and cheer- 
ful foreman. 
Whose is the blame? Whose the credit? 
The pupils’?
-P-A-G-E-25
  PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS 
THE PURPOSE OF MORAL TRAINING 
building of character. This idea should con- 
stantly be kept uppermost in the mind of 
the teacher. What right thinking means, 
and how great a power in character building 
it is, should be fully appreciated. While the 
teaching of religion is debarred from the 
public schools, the door is not closed against 
the religious teacher. Usually only those 
applicants for school positions are accepted 
who possess a good moral character. The 
teaching of morality through example, at 
least, is thus encouraged; and it would be 
difficult to find a community in whose 
schools the teaching of morality through 
precept would be opposed. In giving such 
instruction the teacher is not only within 
the law, but upon unassailable ground. It 
can be given effectively, of course, only by 
a teacher who herself lives an exemplary life. 
19
-P-A-G-E-26
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
Just as the skilled workman must gain a 
thorough knowledge of his materials and 
how to shape them to desired ends, the 
teacher must understand the materials with 
which she works,— that is, the child, — 
and she must have a clear conception of the 
part in the child’s development which she 
controls, 
The child is a soul temporarily operating 
within a body. The body, inert and helpless 
in itself, is powerful through obedience to the 
commands of the soul. {he true purpose of 
education is the development of the soul, in 
order that it may use aright the instruments 
—body and mind — placed under its con- 
trol.’ The spiritual must rule the physical, 
or the true purpose of life will be unfulfilled 
and the aim of education thwarted. The 
soul’s development consists in an awakening 
to consciousness of self, and to conscious- 
ness of God. The aim is the soul’s realiza- 
tion of its divinely given powers and of its 
ability to use them. All teaching that fails 
to reach the true child, and to arouse in the 
soul a sense of responsibility for the care

PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS 
  and use of its instruments misses its true 
purpose, no matter how brilliant its attain- 
ments may outwardly appear. 
The development of the true child should 
“be commenced early in life. If left until 
later years there will be the opposition of 
habits of wrong thinking; and these will be 
difficult to overcome. It is possible to pre- 
sent great truths so simply that little chil- 
dren may comprehend them. They may be 
taught the meaning of character; that the 
purpose of life is character building; that 
this great work goes on slowly day by day; 
that the materials used are the daily hap- 
penings in home and in school; that the 
tools they use are the power to think, to 
reason, and to will; that if good use is made 
of materials and tools, the life of the indi- 
vidual cannot fail to be strong and useful 
and so lead to happiness for himself and for 
all with whom he is associated. 
THE METHOD OF INSTRUCTION 
In the process of development the child , / v 
must be led from the known to the unknown, 
21

He has a body which is very real to him be- 
cause he can see it and feel it. Here, then, 
is the starting-point for the builder of char- 
acter through thought power. In awakening 
the real child to an understanding of the 
body as an instrument, the instruction must 
be as carefully and tactfully adapted to his 
years as are other branches of school in- 
struction. 
For pupils in the advanced grades for- 
mal lessons in physiology furnish abundant 
subject material for talks and discussions. 
_The keynote should be: “Know ye not 
that your bodies are the temples of the living 
God?” First, attention should be called to 
the wonderful adaptation of each organ to the 
work that it is to perform, its perfect re- 
lation and adjustment to other organs, the 
marvelous mechanism of eye and of ear, 
and so on. If such instruction is given in 
a spirit of reverence by the teacher, it will 
develop reverence in the pupil — reverence 
for the body and for its Creator. To estab- 
lish more firmly in the mind the thought 
of the body as an instrument, attention may 
22
-P-A-G-E-29
  PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS 
be called to machines of different sorts, 
their uses and the care necessary to keep 
them ready for service. Who is the wise 
owner? Who the foolish? Who is the wise 
owner of this human machine, the body? 
Who the foolish one? The care necessary 
to maintain the body in good condition — 
care in regard to food, exercise, rest, work, 
recreation — furnish the subject matter for 
most profitable discussions. 
In the lower grades where formal instruc- 
tion in physiology is beyond the compre- 
_ hension of the children, the matter must be 
presented very differently. As a beginning 
the teacher should give a brief talk, referring 
to the body as a servant; but after an intro- 
duction of this sort the instruction should 
take the form of questions. Chapter I of 
this book outlines the method which the 
author has found most successful. It is most 
important that some such form of presenta- 
tion should be adopted, as otherwise the 
children’s interest is liable to be lost. 
This book is the outgrowth of eight years’ 
experience in the definite moral training of 
23
-P-A-G-E-30
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
children through instruction in the right use 
of their power to think. The subject-matter 
here presented, however, is designed to be 
suggestive only. Nothing is farther from the 
author’s intention than to suggest rigid ad- 
herence to either the order or the form of 
discussion. Each teacher is expected to work 
out her own details of method. This book, 
it is hoped, may point out the way to exer- 
cises helpful to the instructor and inspiring 
to the class. 
The writer does not hesitate to use the 
terms “ mind” and “soul” in their popular 
sense, which happens, also, to be their Bibli- 
cal sense, as she has found by experience that 
they convey more accurately to the minds 
of children the ideas which she wishes to 
convey than a strictly scientific terminology 
could do. In all teaching, the important mat- 
ter is not so much the accuracy of terms used, 
as the accuracy of ideas conveyed. Only a 
pedant could reverse this order. “An idea 
has not been taught untilit has been learned.” 
Aword of caution may not be amiss: the 
teacher’ should never introduce a subject 
24
-P-A-G-E-31
  PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS 
which she has not first fully and carefully 
thought out. The children and not the teacher 
should do the talking. The children should 
be encouraged to think and to express their 
thoughts on the subject under consideration, 
and the teacher should respect their attempts 
at expression, no matter how crude or feeble 
they may be. Let the pupils do the active 
work; do not force them into the negative 
attitude of listeners only. 
Haste should be avoided. Character is not \' 
built in a day, a month, or a year; it is the-¢ 
work of a lifetime, and must proceed slowly. / 
Each pupil builds for himself; the teacher 
merely instructs and guides. Two weeks or 
a month should be devoted to each subject; 
only one or two thoughts should be pre- 
sented at a time. 
As will be noticed, there is no attempt in 
this book to divide the various chapters into 
daily lessons, since this is a problem which 
each teacher must solve for herself after ex- 
periments. Five or ten minutes at the open- 
ing of the morning session will perhaps be 
found the most appropriate time for these

-P-A-G-E-32
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
exercises ; and this period will be sufficient, 
provided the teacher’s preparation has been 
carefully done. After a thought has once 
been presented, it should be alluded to as 
opportunity offers during the day in order 
“that its impression may be deepened. The 
brief morning thoughts may profitably be 
supplemented by a half-hour’s review on 
Friday afternoon. The pupils should be en- 
couraged to tell what has impressed them 
most in the presentation of a thought; to 
what use they have put the ideas given them; 
and what has been the result of their efforts 
to apply the new knowledge. With more 
advanced pupils the review may take the 
form of short impromptu debates, essays, or 
speeches. Finally, throughout the work based 
_upon this book, emphasize the value of 
thought power in the building of character. 
Let us see how this can be done.

CHAPTER I 
THE BODY A SERVANT 
Do you know that you are very rich chil- 
dren? You are rich because you each have 
a little servant, who is going to live with you 
and wait upon you and do just what you 
tell him to do as long as you live. If he 
is a servant to you, what are you to him? 
If you want him to be a good servant 
to you, what kind of master must you be to 
him ? 
Every morning for some time, we are 
going to talk about this little servant, so that 
you may learn how to become a good mas- 
ter, and train him to be a good servant. 
To begin, when your mother or your 
teacher wishes you to come to her, how does 
she let you know? 
She calls your name? That is right. Do 
you think your servant needs a name? He 
really does, and for the same reason that 
27 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
you need one. You will call him by name 
that he may listen to you and hear what 
you wish him to do. 
The name of your servant is Body. You 
must often call him by his name, talk to him, 
and try always to think of him as your serv- 
ant. You must love him, and take good 
care of him, or he will become ill and weak 
and be unable to wait upon you and obey 
your commands. You must never forget 
that he is your servant, that he belongs to you 
and to nobody else. While you are small, 
your mother takes the care of your servant. 
She bathes him, and feeds him, and dresses 
and undresses him, and sees that he is early 
in his bed because she understands that it is 
good for him to have a great deal of sleep. 
But little by little, as you grow, you begin 
to do these things for Body and are glad to 
take care of him yourself. 
Do you remember how proud you felt 
when you could use your spoon, your knife 
and fork, and feed yourself? when you could 
button your shoes yourself, and finally dress 
yourself all alone? 
28
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE BODY A SERVANT 
If you do these things for Body, and try 
to do them well, don’t you think he would 
like to do something for you? Can you tell 
some things he does for you? 
“ He brings us to school.” “ He carries 
our books.” “He writes for us.”* Don’t 
you think it is fine to have this servant to 
wait upon you all through your life? 
If you love Body and give him good care, 
don’t you believe he will feel it, and in re- 
turn will do all you tell him to do? Suppose 
you do not love him and take good care 
of him, can he wait upon you well? Think 
about this to-day, and to-morrow morning 
you may tell what you have thought. 
Which would you rather have, a good serv- 
ant ora bad one? Which makes a good serv- 
ant, a good master or a bad one? You see, 
then, that if you are to have a good servant 
you must be a good master, so we shall have 
to talk about ways of becoming good masters. 
Tell me one of the first things a servant 
1 Answers such as the children may be expected to give 
will be enclosed, thus, in quotation marks, 
29
-P-A-G-E-36
  , CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
must learn? Think carefully about this, for 
it is important. 
“ He must learn to do what his master 
tells him to do.” That is true. But who can 
tell me a word that means this? 
“Obey. He must learn to obey his mas- 
ter.” Suppose your mother has a servant 
who will not obey her orders, what can she 
do? “She can send that servant away and 
get another.” Suppose your servant, Body, 
refuses to obey you, can you send him away 
and get another? You never cansend Body 
away. He must live with you all your life. 
Suppose your mother loved her disobe- 
dient servant, and did not want to send her 
away, what might she do? “She could keep 
the servant and teach her to obey.” Do you 
think this would be easy to do? Would it 
probably take a long time? Who can think 
of something else it wouldtake? “ Patience.” 
That is right. Now, your mother would feel 
something that would make it possible for 
her to have patience with her servant and 
teach her obedience. Who can tell me what 
this feeling is? “Love.” That is the answer. 
30
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE BODY A SERVANT 
See what you can learn from this. Suppose 
your servant Body is disobedient, can you 
send him away? Whatis the only thing you 
can do? “ We must teach him to obey.” 
What did your mother give in order to 
change the ways of her servant? “She gave 
timeand patience.” Must yougivethesame? 
‘What enabled your mother to give this time 
and patience? “Love.” Must you love your 
servant? 
-Letus tell three things that are necessary in 
training each little servant, Body, to become 
a good and useful servant. “ Time, patience, 
and love.” Do you think everybody must 
use these three? ‘ Yes, because each little 
Body must be trained; he does not know.” 
Suppose your little servant is very willful 
and disobedient, and you grow tired of try- 
ing to make him obey you, and you let him 
have his own way. Who will be the master 
then? Do you think there are any grown 
people who did not learn when they were 
small to make Body obey them? How does 
Body show his disobedience? ‘“ He eats too 
31 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
much.” “ Heeats things thatare not good for 
him.” “He drinks things that hurt him.” 
Do you think people are happy with such 
disobedient servants? Don’t you think you 
ought to begin at once to train your serv- 
ant? What may you be sure of when you 
are grown, if you train your servant wisely? 
“We shall be happy.” Why? “ We shall 
be healthy.” Here is a wise saying for you 
to learn and to think a great deal about : — 
The body is a good servant, but a cruel 
master. 
  Training Body is not easy because he 
seems to like to have his own way; but if 
you just keep on trying, one day at a time, 
you will succeed. Here is something to 
think about each day :— 
Yesterday has gone. To-morrow has not 
come. To-day is all I have. I will do the 
best I can just to-day. 
If you work just one day at a time, train- 
ing Body will become easier and easier, and 
by and by he will do the right thing with- 
out waiting to be told. Making Body mind 
32
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE BODY A SERVANT 
you is somewhat like learning to read or to 
spell or to work examples. You know how 
hard all these are at first, and how some- 
times you are ready to cry and give up; but 
if you are brave and keep on trying, after a 
while these things become so easy you won- 
der how you could ever have thought them 
difficult. It will be just this way in your 
training of Body. He has lessons to learn, 
and you must be firm and compel him to 
learn them. He will complain and try to 
get out of doing what you want, but you 
must be on your guard. 
To begin with, he must be taught to sit 
and stand correctly. This he does not quite 
like to do. He likes to bend over the desk 
in school, and draw his shoulders together. 
This is very bad for him, because it cramps 
his lungs; and if he continues to sit that 
way, he will not draw into his lungs the 
good, deep breaths of fresh air which he 
needs, and the lungs will become weakened 
and diseased. He should keep his shoul- 
ders straight and bend at his waist. You, 
his master, must see that he does this. 
33
-P-A-G-E-40
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
  When he stands, he likes to bend his 
knees, and rest on one foot instead of on 
both. When he stands, he ought to stiffen the 
knees, rest on the balls of both feet, hold 
his shoulders straight and his head erect. 
You must have him take correct sitting and 
standing positions many times until he un- 
derstands perfectly what you want him to do. 
Then you must keep a careful watch over 
him, or he will take his old wrong positions 
even when he knows the correct ones. But 
you are teaching him, and you must remem- 
ber, it takes time and patience and love. 
Sometimes Body must run and jump and 
shout in order to grow, but sometimes he 
must keep perfectly still. And you, his mas- 
ter, must see that he does each of these 
things at the right time and in the right 
place, or he will surely tell that you are 
not a good master. Do you see how he can 
tell? Are there any Bodies in this school 
room that are telling that they have not a 
good master? Are there any that tell that 
they have a good master? What is your 
Body telling about you? 
5 34
-P-A-G-E-41

| THE BODY A SERVANT 
| If you find that your Body seems deter- 
| mined to have his own way, remind him 
that some day he will be a man. Ask him 
what kind of man he would like to be; a 
tall man with broad shoulders and straight, 
strong legs, and clear, steady eyes, or a lit- 
tle doubled-up man, with his head hanging 
down so that he looks no one squarely in 
the eye? Of course he will tell you that he 
wants to be big and strong and healthy ; 
then you can tell him that the only way to 
be so is to begin right now to do as you tell 
him. 
Here is something else that Body likes, 
and that is not good for him. He likes to sit 
up late. It is strange, but very often little 
masters encourage their servants in staying 
up, when they ought to be in bed, and this 
makes trouble for mothers. Mother knows 
that after little Body has worked and played 
all day, he is quite worn out, and should 
have a good long night’s rest to be ready 
for the next day’s work and play. So when 
eight o’clock comes, mother says it is bed- 
time. Now, you needn’t be told what 
35
-P-A-G-E-42
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
  Body is likely to do, for you all know. 
Does he not at once begin begging to 
stay up just a Zitt/e longer, and if he is re- 
fused, it is very probable that he will tease 
and cry until the poor mother is quite worn 
out. Now, this is the time for you to act. 
As he is your servant and not your mother’s, 
don’t you think you are the one who should 
put him to bed? People who know say there 
is nothing more harmful for children than 
being allowed to stay up late at night and, 
worse still, being allowed to run about the 
streets after dark. As a rule, every little 
boy or girl should be in bed at eight o’clock 
every night, except possibly Thanksgiving, 
Christmas, and a few other holidays. 
Don’t you think it might be great fun to 
make Body do what he ought to do? Sup- 
pose you tell your mother that she need 
not be vexed by him any longer, that you 
will put him to bed? You keep your eye,on 
the clock, and when the hand points to eight 
you tell him he must go to bed at once. At 
first he may tease you just as he did your 
mother, and you will then know how she 
36 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE BODY A SERVANT 
felt. Don’t listen to him, but walk him 
straight off to bed; and if you do this for a 
few nights he will understand that you are 
his master and that you mean what you say, 
and he will soon cease to grumble and com- 
plain. He will form the habit of going to 
bed early and will like it, and in the morn- 
ing when he wakens, he will feel so rested 
that he will arise happy and good-natured, 
instead of cross and peevish as he is when 
he has stayed up late. Of course you can- 
not know that this is true unless you prove 
it by trying it for yourself. That is the only 
way any of us can really know. Do you 
think it is worth trying? Suppose we all ex- 
periment to-night, and tell about it to-mor- 
row morning. 
~ Body may cause you agreat deal of trouble 
in another way: that is, by eating. He may 
want too much food, or food that is not 
good for him, and he is very likely to eat 
too fast. You will have to ask your mother’s 
help in training him in this regard, because 
she knows what is good for Body, and what 
37
-P-A-G-E-44
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
will injure him. Ask her or your teacher to 
explain to you why food should be eaten ~ 
very slowly. Learn all you can about the 
stomach, how large it is, where it is, what 
takes place in the stomach when food reaches 
it, if it works, if it can wear out, if it can 
be replaced by a new stomach. Ask your 
mother to tell you about some grown people, 
who have allowed Body to eat or drink any- 
thing he pleased and whenever he asked for 
it, and then decide whether or not you want 
to suffer as they do. When you have learned 
all these things, you will be a wiser master, 
and better prepared to control Body in re- 
gard to eating and drinking. 
Some little servants give their masters 
trouble in another way — they object to 
being bathed, do not even want their hands 
washed. They will declare they do not need 
it, when it is plain to be seen that they do. 
They will declare that they have washed, 
when they have only dipped the hands into 
water and dashed a little water on the face. 
Bathing is necessary for good health. You 
must learn why this is true. Later we shall 
38
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE BODY A SERVANT 
have some lessons on cleanliness that will 
teach us why it is so important to keep the 
skin clean. 
Who is the master of Body? “ Each per- 
son is the master of his own Body.” Sup- 
pose Body has no food, no water, no sleep, 
no air, what will happen? “ Body will die.” 
Who must see that Body has these things? 
“His own master.” Let us talk about this. 
Can your mother eat the food that your 
body needs? Suppose you were ill and could 
not eat, could your mother eat for you? 
Can your mother breathe for you the fresh 
air that your lungs must take? Can she sleep 
for you? Do you see that you and you alone 
can do these things for yourself, and that 
you must do them, if you want to live and 
be healthy? Do you see that you are re- 
sponsible for these things, and should begin 
now to think about them and take care of 
your body? 
Let each one tell something he has learned 
about the body. This will help us all to re- 
39 Ha Y

member. We have learned that Body is our 
servant. Weare his Master. We must teach 
him to obey, we must teach him how to 
stand, sit, breathe correctly, when to run 
and shout, and when to be perfectly quiet. 
We must not allow him to eat too much 
food, or eat too rapidly. He must bathe, 
he must go to bed early. 
We must be good masters or we cannot 
have good servants. Body must obey or he 
will be the master, and we have learned that 
the body is a good servant but a cruel mas- 
ter. We must begin to rule now when we 
are small; for Body can be more easily con- 
trolled now than when he is grown up and 
has formed bad habits. 
The poet Milton wrote: “ He who reigns 
within himself, and rules passions, desires, 
and fears, is more than a king.”
-P-A-G-E-47
  CHAPTER II 
THE MIND A SERVANT 
Herz is a bit of good news with which to 
begin this day: Each one of you is twice 
as rich in a certain way as you now think 
you are. You have two servants instead-of 
one. We have been talking about your serv- 
ant, Body, and how he should be trained 
that he may be useful and make you happy; 
now you are ready to learn about your other 
servant that needs care and training also. 
This other servant is very much like Body 
in many ways, and needs much the same 
kind of care. He, too, must be fed, exer- 
cised, rested, and kept clean, if he4s to grow 
strong and healthy and be a good servant. 
What did you first learn about Body? 
« Hie same” This other servant must have 
aname. His name is Intellect, or Mind. We 
will call him Mind because it is a shorter 
name. His work is to carry your commands 
41
-P-A-G-E-48
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
  to Body. Heisa messenger. This is the way 
he works:—You want something done: 
you tell Mind; Mind tells Body ; and Body 
does the work. 
Let us try to make this plain. You take 
your seat in the schoolroom some morning, 
put your hand into the desk to take your 
arithmetic, and discover that it is not there. 
You wonder where it is. You think about 
it. Then you remember that you took it 
home to work some examples and must have 
left it in the cloakroom, for you recall hav- 
ing it in your hand on your way to school. 
You rise, walk to the cloakroom, find the 
book, and return to your place with it. Sup- 
pose you had not thought about the book, 
would you ever have gone to the cloakroom 
to seek it? Suppose you had shoughr only, 
that is, had sat at your desk and thought 
that the book was in the cloakroom, would 
the book have come to you? Do you see 
how thought and action must go together?. 
How you must first think and then carry out, 
or express, your thought in work? You see 
now why you need two servants. Mind re- 
42.
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE MIND A SERVANT 
ceives your thought like a command and 
carries it to Body; Body obeys the com- 
mand. 
Let us have several examples until we un- 
derstand this very clearly. One of you may 
think about something, and express the 
thought in action ; then trace the thought to 
the completed act. Let some one else give 
an example. Another. Do yousee from these 
illustrations how the act follows the thought? 
We will now try something else. Each 
one has told us his thought and has then 
put his thought into action before us. We 
will reverse this. We will have something 
done, and see if we can trace back to the 
thought that prompted the act. Charles may 
think of something and act it out. All watch 
him closely. 
Now, tell what you saw in the order of 
, his actions. First, he put his hand into his 
\ desk and drew out something and exam- 
ined it. He then rose, went to Henry, 
touched him on the shoulder to attract his 
attention, and made a sign. Henry put his 
hand into his pocket, drew out something 
43
-P-A-G-E-50
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
and gaveit to Charles, who then went to the 
waste-basket. His back was toward us so that 
we could not see exactly what he was doing, 
but he bent over the basket, and his arms 
moved. He came back, stopping on his way 
at Henry’s desk and handed him something, 
then he went to his seat, and is now busy with 
paperand pencil. Who can trace the thought 
that led to these acts? Julia may tell us. 
“When he put his hand into his desk, he 
drew out his pencil, and discovered that the 
point was broken. He thought it must be 
sharpened before he could work his exam- 
ples. He borrowed Henry’s knife, went to 
the basket and sharpened his pencil, re- 
turned the knife, took his seat, and is now 
working examples with the pencil.” That is 
well told. Do you see how it is—first the 
thought, then the deed? 
During the next few days, try to think 
of some good illustrations of this kind; and 
on Friday afternoon, we will try this exer- 
cise again. We can make a game of it, and 
at the same time be learning something of 
great value. 
44
-P-A-G-E-51
  
THE MIND A SERVANT 
Suppose that Body were very strong 
and wanted to work, but Mind were weak 
and could not carry the commands, could 
anything be done? Did you ever hear of 
a case of a strong body and a weak mind? 
Suppose Mind were strong and could give 
the commands, but Body were too weak to 
obey them? Do you know of such a case? 
Have you strong bodies? How do you 
know? Have you strong minds? How can 
you tell? Don’t you think you ought to 
be grateful for these great blessings? How 
best can you express your gratitude? 
What do you think about this saying: 
Use and growth; disuse and decay? Does 
the body grow through use? Discuss this. 
The athlete. The acrobat. The professional 
dancer. The arms of the blacksmith. The 
eyes of the sailor and the hunter. / 
Suppose a man were to bind his right arm 
to his body and never use it, what would be 
the result? Who can give another example 
of this kind? Another? Do you see now 
that “ Use and growth; disuse and decay ” 
is a truth? 
45  
-P-A-G-E-52
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
Let us see if what is true of the body is 
equally true of the mind. Have you heard 
or read about a man or a woman, who spent 
his or her whole life in studying just one 
subject and learning things that helped all 
mankind? Would such a person have a 
strong mind? Why? Would it be a case 
of use and growth? How would you like to 
choose a committee of three or five pupils, to 
learn about persons of this kind and report 
to us thelast Friday afternoon of themonth? 
It will increase both interest and profit, if 
you will each be prepared to add something 
to the report. 
Could a person become so absorbed in 
developing the mind as to neglect the body? 
Give an example. Could one care so much 
for the body as to neglect the mind? Give 
an example of this, too. We see how im- 
portant it is that both servants, Body and 
Mind, should be strong and healthy through 
proper care and training. One should not be 
developed at the expense of the other. It is 
said that if one wishes to be successful in life 
he must have a sound mind in a sound body. 
46
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE MIND A SERVANT 
We have learned some things about the 
needs of the body, we must now learn 
about the needs of the mind. What does 
Body need to make him strong? Do you 
think Mind needs food? What does Body 
eat? Can Mind take these things? What 
feeds Mind? “Lessons.” Do you learn 
lessons from books alone? “Our parents and 
others teach us lessons.” Talk about these 
lessons. Can you learn lessons in any other 
way? Suppose some day you are very 
disobedient, have been unkind to your 
mother, and have caused her unhappiness. 
Later, you think about it and feel very sorry. 
Have you learned a lesson? Suppose you 
have told an untruth, and afterward see 
that it is wrong: have you learned a lesson? 
Can only people and books teach you 
lessons? What can you learn from the ant 
and the bee? from the birds? the horse? 
your dog? Can they teach you to be kind, 
gentle, and thoughtful toward them, and 
tender toward all the weak and the helpless? 
Now you see that not all the lessons we need 
to learn are found in books. We are learn- 
47
-P-A-G-E-54
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
ing lessons all the time, both in school and 
out of school; and if we are learning good 
things, our minds are being fed. 
Are only children learning lessons? Do 
you think your father, your mother, your 
teacher, your grandparents are learning les- 
sons each day? Ask them about this. Ask 
them if they have learned something this 
very day. What will this prove to you? 
Think about it. “It shows us that every 
person is learning lessons all through life.” 
Why must we learn lessons all our life? 
“Because lessons feed the mind.” If you 
stop giving the body food, what happens? 
What happens to a mind that is not fed? 
Are there people who starve the body? Are 
there people who starve the mind? Could a 
boy or girl in school appear to be starving 
the mind? 
Do you think there are boys and girls who 
give their minds improper or insufficient 
food, so that they are weak and cannot 
work well? Let us discuss these cases, for 
unfortunately there are such, Do you re- 
member learning that some kinds of food 
48
-P-A-G-E-55
THE MIND A SERVANT 
  are good for the body and nourish it, and 
some kinds bad and even poisonous? Do 
you think this is true of food for the mind? 
Tell some kinds that are good. Some that 
are not good. 
Where are most of your lessons learned 
in childhood? Do you see why you go to 
school? Are your parents kind or unkind 
when they compel you to attend school? 
Why? Did you ever hear of a Truancy Law? 
Whatisit? Isitagood law? Why? Should 
it be obeyed? 
In studying about the care of the body, 
we learned two important truths: first, each 
person must eat his own food; second, no 
one can eat for him even to save his life. 
Do you believe this is true of the mind? Is 
there any more reason for expecting your 
teacher to learn your lessons for you, than 
your mother to eat for you? Your mother 
prepares your food, places it invitingly upon 
the table, and asks you to eat. This is all 
she can do. Your teacher plans the lesson, 
shows you how to learn it, and asks you to 
49
-P-A-G-E-56
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
learn. This is all she can do. She teaches, 
you learn. If you refuse to eat the food 
your mother provides, whose body is weak 
and starved? If you refuse to learn the les- 
sons your teacher assigns, whose mind is 
weak and starved? 
Did you ever know a boy who talked 
somewhat like this: “I’m not going to eat 
any more than I can help. When my mother 
leaves the room, I’ll throw my food out of 
the window, and when she sees my empty 
plate she will think I have eaten the food. 
This is what I will do when I am small, 
but when I’m a man I'll eat good food 
and lots of it.’ Would you not think a boy 
who talked so was very foolish? 
What do you think of one who talks in 
this way: “I don’t see any sense in going 
to school and learning lessons. I’ll never 
use the lessons anyway, so what’s the good 
of learning them? Ill not go to school any 
more than I can help, and when teacher 
leaves the room I'll play instead of work- 
ing at my lessons. But just wait till I’m a 
man, and I’ll show what I can do. I’m

going to make money and have a good 
time.” 
Do you think a boy who refuses to learn, 
who disobeys his parents and his teacher 
and is a truant, is forming the kind of hab- 
its that will make him a successful business 
man? Did you ever hear of a man who 
could not keep a business position? Can 
you guess a reason for it? Can you see how 
the /earning, and not just the /essons learned, 
helps you? Can the school teach you any 
lessons not in the books? 
Do you think respect for authority, obe- 
dience, good manners, punctuality, regular- 
ity and ability and willingness to work are 
helpful in a business career? Are these qual- 
ifications necessary to success in business? 
Discuss their opposites. Would they be 
tolerated in business? Which is the better 
time to learn these things—in youth or old 
age? Can your school teach you these les- 
sons not in books? Are you glad to have such 
opportunities and advantages? How can 
you best express your appreciation of them?

CHAPTER III 
THE REAL CHILD, OR THE SOUL 
  Turovex these little morning talks, you 
have been learning about your two servants, 
Body and Mind. Now you are to learn 
about yourself, the real child, that lives in 
the body and has a Mind to tell Body what 
to do. It is you, the real child, that loves— 
loves father, loves mother and others; you 
feel the love: this feeling leads you to think 
loving thoughts; you express these loving 
thoughts in words and deeds. 
Do you see now the truth of what you 
have been learning? You, the real child, 
feel love for your mother. This loving feel- 
ing toward your mother leads to a loving 
thought which you wish to express to your 
mother. Mind carries your loving thought 
and wish to Body, and Body expresses it to 
your mother, by speaking loving words or 
performing some loving action. 
52
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE REAL CHILD, OR THE SOUL 
You must learn to think about yourself 
and your two servants, Body and Mind, as 
forming a household of which you are the 
Master. You are the one to say what kind 
of household yours shall be. 
It will be just what you are. The way 
you, the real child, feel, think, speak, and 
act, decides this. 
The way you fee/ may end in happiness 
or misery to your household. If you feel 
love, joy, kindness, good will, and helpful- 
ness, you will think about these things and 
will desire to express them. Mind will carry 
your thoughts and desires to Body; and 
Body will express in words and actions your 
feelings of love, joy, kindness, good will, and 
helpfulness ; and your household of Self will 
be happy. If you /e/ hate, unkindness, 
envy, jealousy, and selfishness, you will think 
about these things and will desire to express 
them. Mind will carry your thoughts to 
Body; and Body will express in words and 
actions your feelings of hate, unkindness, 
envy, jealousy, and selfishness; and your 
household of Self will be miserable. 
53
-P-A-G-E-60
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
Who decides whether the household shall 
be happy or miserable? Is it the master or 
the servants? Mind is the messenger. A 
messenger has nothing to do with the mes- 
sage, except to carry it swiftly and safely. 
Mind, then, is not responsible. Body simply 
obeys commands; he does not give them; 
so he is not responsible. The only one left 
in the household is the master, so he must 
be the responsible one. He it is who de- 
cides whether his household shall be happy 
or miserable, strong or weak, a help to 
others or a hindrance. 
What joy this knowledge should bring to 
each little master! God has given him the 
power to make himself, and leaves him free 
to choose the kind of person he would like 
to be. Since this is true, it is most important 
to haveaclear understanding of certain things. 
Wesee that if the master, the real child, feels 
love, he thinks love, and expresses love in 
words and actions. If the master feels hate, 
he thinks hate, and expresses hate in words 
and actions. 
What is the beginning of all actions? 
54
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE REAL CHILD, OR THE SOUL 
“ The beginning of all actions is feeling.” 
What then should we guard most carefully? 
“We should guard our feelings.” What fol- 
lows feelings? ‘“ Thoughts follow feelings.” 
If your thoughts are kind and loving, how do 
they report your feelings? “ As being good.” 
If your thoughts are hateful and unkind, 
what report do they give of the feelings 
back of them? “That the feelings are hate- 
ful and unkind.” How can you be sure of 
your feelings? “ By paying attention to our 
thoughts.” Ifthe thoughts are unkind, what 
then must be changed? “The feeling.” 
Do you think it is possible to change our 
feelings? Have you ever loved a friend very 
dearly, and afterwards ceased to love that 
friend? Have you ever had a feeling of dis- 
like for a person, and later grown very fond 
of him? All have had such changes of feel- 
ing. What does this prove, since it is the 
common experience of all? “It proves that 
our feelings change.”” Do you think thenthat 
we have the power to change feelings that are 
not good for us into feelings that are good? 
If the feelings change, what happens to the 
55
-P-A-G-E-62
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
thoughts? “The thoughts will change.” 
What follows thoughts? “Words and ac- 
tions follow thoughts.” If the thoughts 
change, what happens to words and actions? 
“The words and actions change.” Do you 
see how this all works, and how it shows the 
responsibility of the master of the house- 
hold? 
Let us suppose a case. A girl is very un- 
happy. She speaks unkind words that hurt 
the feelings of her playmates, she does un- 
kind things, until she is disliked and shunned. 
Something must be very wrong in herself to 
bring about such conditions. This girl loves 
beautiful things ‘and longs to possess them, 
but this is not possible because her parents 
are poor. She sees others in possession of 
the very things she longs for. What feelings 
might be aroused in her? “Feelings of envy, 
jealousy, and discontent.” Can such feelings 
ever bring happiness? Is it true that like 
produces like? What must this girl do if 
she wishes to be happy? ‘“ She must change 
her feelings.”” What is the cause of all her 
unhappiness? “ Her feelings.” What is the. 
56
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE REAL CHILD, OR THE SOUL 
only thing to be done to remove her unhap- 
piness? “The only thing to be done is to 
change the feelings that are the cause of the 
unhappiness.” Who can show how this is 
true? “It is true because thoughts, words, 
and actions follow feelings. If the feelings 
are right, the thoughts, words, and actions 
will be right: if the feelings are wrong, the 
thoughts, words, and actions will be wrong.” 
Who alone can change the feelings? “The 
girl, herself.” Do you think, since she has 
been indulging in such wrong feelings to the 
extent of making herself disliked, that it 
will be easy for her to change? “It will not 
be easy.” Are you sure it can be done? If 
she is patient and true day after day, she 
will succeed. She must remember that it has 
taken along time to cultivate wrong feelings; 
it will take a long time to root out the wrong 
feelings, and put good ones in their place. 
She must begin by thinking that her parents 
are giving her the best they are able, and she 
must think of them and not of herself, and 
try to show them in loving ways that she 
appreciates what they are trying to do for 
SY,
-P-A-G-E-64
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
her. Then she must try to be glad that others 
can have the good things. This is no easy 
task, but it can be accomplished by never 
giving up. It is like solving a puzzling prob- 
lem, or mastering any difficult task, but 
joy follows the hard work and a new strength 
is felt. If this girl does not yield to discour- 
agement, but just keeps on trying to drive 
out the wrong thoughts, in time they will 
die of starvation, and she will have her re- 
ward in seeing herself beloved instead of 
disliked. Show in this same way how to 
change unkindness into kindness, cruelty into 
tenderness, cowardice into courage, depres- 
sion into cheerfulness. 
| There is a great command expressed in 
two words: Know thyse/f. We should try to 
obey this command. We have considered 
each person to be a household consisting 
of a master and two servants. 
We have said that the master is the real 
child, who dwells in the body. We will give 
the name Soul to this master of the house- 
hold. We will talk about this Soul that 
58
-P-A-G-E-65
  
THE REAL CHILD, OR THE SOUL 
rules the household and should rule wisely 
that he may be happy. 
Each one in this room is a soul. Every 
person you meet isa soul. Weare all alike. 
Every human being, no matter to what race 
or country he belongs, és a soul, and has a 
body. Here is something beautiful for you 
to know: The soul never dies ; it only changes 
its body. 
A poet states this truth beautifully :— 
«« There is no death, 
What seems so is transition.’” 
Since the soul lives for ever, you readily 
see how important it is to learn all we can 
about it. We have learned how necessary it 
is to give mind and body proper training 
and care; does nat the real child, the soul, 
need care and training also? This is what 
we will try to learn now. And first, we will 
review some things we have learned con- 
cerning the mind and the body because the 
soul grows in much the same way. : 
What did we learn that both mind and 
body need? “They both need food.” Was 
their food the same? “No.” What was the 
59  
-P-A-G-E-66
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
food for the body? What for the mind? 
Did we learn that some kinds of food for the 
body are good and some poisonous? Is this 
true, also, of food for the mind? Do you 
think the soul needs food? This is true. 
And just as the food that nourishes the 
body differs from that which nourishes the 
mind, so the food that nourishes the soul 
differs from both these. 
The food of the soul is itsthoughts. Good 
thoughts nourish the soul: evil thoughts 
poison it. Just as the food you eat nourishes 
or poisons your body, the lessons you 
learn nourish or poison your mind; so the 
thoughts you think nourish or poison you, 
the real person, the soul. No one can eat 
your food for you. No one can learn your 
lessons for you. No one can think your 
thoughts for you. The thoughts you think 
make you the kind of boy or girl you now 
.. are, and the kind of man or woman you will 
oe. 
Do you see the importance of beginning 
right here and now to guard your thoughts, 
and still more to guard your feelings? 
~ 60
-P-A-G-E-67
THE REAL CHILD, OR THE SOUL 
The feelings may be looked upon as the 
root out of which grow thoughts, words, 
deeds. If the root is strong and healthy, 
what kind of tree may be looked for with 
its leaves, blossoms, and fruit? If the root 
is decayed through disease, what about the 
tree? What does self-responsibility mean? 
Because of the influence of thoughts upon 
the soul, we shall now have regular lessons 
to teach us the value and importance of our 
power to think and how to use it to insure 
our own happiness and the happiness of 
others. 
   
-P-A-G-E-68
  CHAPTER IV 
{ THOUGHT POWER 
Our morning talks have taught us that each 
person is like a household, consisting of 
three—a master and two servants; that this 
household will be just what the master is, 
and that the master is that which he thinks. 
The Bible tells us: As a man thinketh in 
his heart, so is he. 
A wise man states this same great truth 
thus: All that we are is the result of what 
we have thought; it is founded on our 
thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. 
Since thoughts make the real self, the 
soul, we can see the need of understanding 
just what thoughts are, and what thinking 
is. Do you know what it means to think, 
that is, to have thoughts? 
Let us try to learn from examples. We 
will take an imaginary case. Just as one of 
the boys in this room was leaving home this 
62
-P-A-G-E-69
  THOUGHT POWER 
morning, his father said to him, “I have a 
surprise for you. I am going to bring you 
something when I come from the office this 
evening.” How do you think the boy would 
feel? Would it be difficult for him to fix his 
mindonhislessons? Why? Yousay hewould 
wonder what his father was going to bring 
him; he would recall the things he had 
wanted, as a knife to replace the one he had 
lost, a pair of skates, a sled, or a new cap. 
The father’s remark set the boy to doing 
what? “It set him to thinking.” All these 
things he has been thinking are what? 
“They are his thoughts.” 
Now let us pretend something about a 
girl. This girl has received an invitation to 
a party to be given in a few days. As she 
bids her mother good-by in the morning, 
her mother says, “I saw a very pretty piece 
of goods in Smith’s window, and I’m going 
to buy a dress for you this morning for the 
party.” Do you think the little girl would 
have trouble in keeping her mind on her 
lessons? Tell some of the things that would 
be in her mind. Now we will put all these | 
63
-P-A-G-E-70
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL’ 
answers together. They will make quite a 
story. 
We believe the girl would feel very happy, 
and this feeling would lead to happy thoughts. 
She might look at the clock, and think that 
at just that time her mother would be leav- 
ing the house. Pictures would come into 
her mind, and she would seem actually to 
see her mother on her way to the store, see 
her enter, call for the cloth, and examine it; 
she would see the clerk measure off the 
quantity needed and fold it; she would see 
the money paid, and her mother returning 
home; and by that time, it would be difficult 
for this girl to wait until school closed, that 
she might see her mother’s purchase. 
What has the girl been doing? “She has 
been thinking.” What do you call these 
different things that have come into her 
mind? “They are thoughts.” While these 
thoughts have been passing through her 
mind, the teacher has been explaining a dif- 
ficult problem. She calls upon the girl to 
repeat the explanation, and she fails. Give 
~ the cause of her failure. “She has been 
64
-P-A-G-E-71
THOUGHT POWER 
thinking about the new dress and has not 
heard the explanation the teacher has given.” 
Do you think she knew the teacher was 
talking? Did she hear her voice? “Yes.” 
Why then could she not give the explana- 
tion? ‘‘ Because she was not paying atten- 
tion to what the teacher wassaying.”” Whatdo 
you mean by “not paying attention”? “It 
means that she was not thinking about what 
the teacher was saying, because she was think- 
ing about her new dress.”” Which interested 
her more, the explanation of the example or 
the new dress? “The new dress.” Is it eas- 
ier to think of things we are interested in? 
“Yes.” Can we force ourselves to think 
upon a subject that is not particularly inter- 
esting? “ Yes, we can control our thoughts.” 
Is it always easy to turn our thoughts away 
from the things we love to think about? Are 
there times when we should do this? “Yes.” 
Can you illustrate from the case of this girl? 
“The thoughts about her new dress and the 
party gave her happiness, and she loved to 
think them. But she was in school, and had 
lessons to learn. She should have thought 
65 
   
-P-A-G-E-72

about this, and put the other thoughts away 
until school closed, when it would beright for 
her to think them.” How many have had an 
experience somewhat like/these we have dis- 
cussed? We will listen to one or two of them. 
Let us now return to our first examples 
of the boy and the girl. They each had some- 
thing said to them. What did this cause them 
todo? “ It set them to thinking.” What do 
you call the things that came into their 
minds? “ They were thoughts.” What kind 
of thoughts did they have? “They had 
happy thoughts.” Why were their thoughts 
happy? “Because what they heard made 
them feel happy.” What follow feeling? 
“ Thoughts follow feeling.” If the feeling is 
happiness, what kind of thoughts will fol- 
low? “Happy thoughts.” If the feeling is 
unhappiness, what kind of thoughts will fol- 
low? “Unhappy thoughts will follow.” 
Whatis the order then? “ Feeling, thoughts.” 
And to what do thoughts lead? “ Thoughts 
lead to words and actions.” Will the words 
and actions be like the thoughts? “ Yes.” 
66
-P-A-G-E-73
  THOUGHT POWER 
Who can give the reason? “ Words and ac- 
tions are the signs of thoughts.” Older per- 
sons would say: Words and actions are the 
outward expression or manifestation of in- 
ward thinking. 
Do you think we can know something of 
what peopleare thinking by listening to their 
words, and watching their deeds? This is 
true but only toa degree, because people can 
speak and act differently from their thoughts, 
and for a time may deceive others. But one 
who tries always to think truthful, honorable, 
kind, cheerful, helpful thoughts, will express 
these in words and deeds, and will be known 
to others asa person who is truthful, honor- 
able, kind, cheerful and helpful. 
Why could not the girl repeat the teach- 
er’s explanation? “She had not heard it.” 
Why? “Her thoughts were not on what 
the teacher was saying.” Where were her 
thoughts? “ They were on what her mother 
was doing.” Was her mother in the school- 
room? “No,” Were the girl’s thoughts in 
the schoolroom? “No.” Where was her 
body? “It was inthe schoolroom.” Then it 
67
-P-A-G-E-74
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
is true that our body may be in one place 
and our thoughts in another. This is often 
expressed in this way : “ My thoughts went 
wandering.” Is it ever right to let our 
thoughts wander? “ Yes.” Is it sometimes 
right to call them back and hold them from 
wandering? “Yes.” The girl should have 
kept her thoughts on what the teacher was 
saying because she was at school to learn. 
Can we control our thoughts? Is it always 
easy? Is it always easy to solve problems? 
Do you give up becauseit is difficult ? “No.” 
What do youdo? “ We keep trying.” Does 
it then become easy? “ Yes.” Do you know 
this because you have proved it for yourself? 
“Yes.” Can we really know anything until 
we have proved it for ourselves? Because it 
is difficult, will you give up trying to control 
your thoughts? Remember, it can be done. 
Who can tell how? “ By trying day after 
day just as we learn our lessons.” That is a 
good answer and a true one. 
We will now try something else in con- 
nection with this subject of thoughts. Every

one stop thinking for one minute by the 
clock. What, all these hands raised, and not 
ahalf minute yet passed! You are laughing ! 
What is this you say — that you cannot stop 
thinking for even a half minute! You have 
proved for yourselves something that is true, 
that you cannot stop thinking. Every mo- 
ment of your waking hours, you are think- 
ing! You cannot stop thinking even when 
you try. Some grown-up people have prac- 
ticed until they say they can put every 
thought out of their mind; butit is very dif- 
ficult to do this, and few are able to make 
the mind a blank even for a very short 
time. 
It is true that you cannot stop thinking, 
but it is just as true that you can say what 
that thinking shall be. If thoughts come into 
your mind that you do not like, you have 
the power to put these thoughts out of your 
mind, and put others in their place. Later, 
when we talk about the different kinds of 
thoughts, you will see how this is done. 
You will see that there are some kinds of 
thoughts that help you, and other kinds that 
69 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
injure you, and you will feel glad and thank- 
ful that you have the power to change your 
thoughts. 
Some one hassaid: “ Thought gives things 
their form.” We will try to prove the truth 
of this. Let us all make a picture in our 
mind of a mother, sitting by a window in a 
pleasant room. She is sewing. Try to make 
a clear picture : see just how the room looks 
—how the mother looks. This is called 
making pictures in the mind — mental pic- 
tures. You make mental pictures of words 
when you spell. 
As the mother sews, she is thinking 
about her only child, a boy. In hermind she 
has a picture of him in the schoolroom, busy 
about his work. What is she doing? “She 
is thinking.” What are these things she 
thinks? “They are thoughts.” These 
thoughts lead to others. This is often ex- 
pressed as a “train of thinking.” Her boy 
will soon be coming home, and she smiles as 
she thinks how hungry he always is, and how 
he likes the cookies she makes for him. This 
reminds her that the jar is empty, and she 
7O
-P-A-G-E-77
  THOUGHT POWER 
decides to make some fresh cookies. Show 
how it takes thought for her to fold her work 
and put it away, to take from the shelf the 
particular bowl she needs, to get together 
flour, sugar, butter, eggs, milk, etc., to mix 
them, to prepare the pans, to test the heat 
of the oven, and to know when the cookies 
should be taken out. When the son comes 
home from school, he sees on the table the 
delicious fresh brown cookies, the outward 
manifestation or expression of his mother’s 
thoughts. Does he have any thoughts called 
up by the sight of the cookies? Does he 
think of his mother’s work? Does he think 
of her kindness? Does he express his 
thoughts in words of praise? Does he thank 
his mother? 
This evening each one of you may look 
around your home and try to see the result 
of some thinking on your mother’s part, 
trace her thought, and to-morrow morning 
we will listen to as many accounts as we 
have time to hear. Think whether it wea- 
ries your mother to work out her thoughts. 
Your thinking may bring to you thoughts 
71 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
of love for your mother that will express 
themselves in helpfulness in your home. 
We will now consider some very great 
things as manifestations of thought, and 
prove still further that, “Thought gives 
things their form.” 
We will imagine that we are driving along 
a beautiful country road. On the top of a 
high hill, we see a group of magnificent 
buildings. We inquire about them and are 
given the name of a well-known college. 
We also learn that all these buildings are 
the gift of one man. Let us prove that they 
are manifestations of thought. 
As we look at these buildings, what must 
we think about the giver? “We think he 
must have a great deal of money.” What 
else? “He is kind and generous.” Let us 
trace the thinking on his part that finally 
led to the erection of these buildings, Where 
shall we begin? He must have thought 
about his great wealth and its uses. He must 
have thought about using it to help others. 
He must have thought much about the best 
72
-P-A-G-E-79
  THOUGHT POWER 
way to help others, and have decided that 
the very best way is to help them to help 
themselves. He may have thought of the 
statement, “Knowledge is power”; and 
this may have led to the decision to found 
a college. He must have expressed his 
thoughts in words to those whose counsel 
and advice he valued; their counsel and ad- 
vice were the expression of their thoughts. 
Then he expressed his thoughts to an ar- 
chitect. This set the architect to thinking, 
and his thoughts expressed themselves out- 
wardly in a plan on paper that any one 
might see. The plan was given to a builder 
and this set the builder to thinking, and his 
thinking set all kinds of workers and dealers 
to thinking, and the result of this combined 
thinking of many people is manifested in 
these fine buildings, the outward forms of 
these thoughts. 
In this same way, trace the history of 
some of the things you see around you — 
as your desk, the clock, a piece of chalk. 
It would help you in many ways to write 
out your thoughts about these things.

Do you believe that the person who said: 
“Thought gives things their form,” spoke 
thetruth? Do you believe thought is power- 
ful? It is said to be the creative energy of 
the world, and the most powerful force in 
the universe. 
If thought shapes material substances, 
such as wood, stone, and iron, do you think 
it also shapes people? Let us see if we can 
prove that this is true. 
Suppose a man thinks a great deal about 
his work and tries always to do his best, 
what kind of thoughts is he thinking? “He 
is thinking honorable and honest thoughts.” 
If he thinks such thoughts, day after day, 
month after month, year after year, what 
kind of man will he be? What kind of 
words will he speak? What kind of deeds 
will he perform? Do you think such 
thoughts will mark his body? How will 
others judge him? 
Suppose boys and girls in school try 
each day to perform their tasks as well as 
they can, what kind of pupils are they?

‘What kind of thoughts are they thinking? 
Can others know this? 
Let us talk about persons holding un- 
selfish thoughts ; selfish thoughts; contented ; 
discontented; cheerful; gloomy. What do 
you now think about the statement: “Asa 
man thinketh in his heart, so is he’? What 
does “in his heart” mean? It means a 
thought that is held persistently, and not 
just an idle, passing thought. 
In former lessons, we learned that each 
person must eat the food that nourishes his | 
body ; that no one, under any circumstances, 7 
can eat it for him; that another may pre- 
pare the food and set it before him, he can 
do no more. Each individual eats his own 
food, and the amount and quality of the 
food has very much to do with the quality 
of his body. We learned that the same law 
holds good with the mind. Each person 
must learn the lessons that strengthen his 
mind. The teacher may instruct: it is all he 
can do. Each pupil must do the learning 
which cultivates and strengthens his own 
mind.

It is said and accepted as true : “ Thought 
in the mind has made us. What we are by 
thought was wrought and built. All that we 
are is what we have thought and willed; our 
thoughts shape us and frame.” ? It is the real 
person, the soul dwelling in the body, that 
is “wrought and built by thoughts.” The 
law that compels the individual to eat his 
own food, learn his own lessons, compels 
him to think his own thoughts; and as each 
reaps the results of his own eating and study- 
ing, so each reaps the harvest of his own 
thinking. There is no other way. 
A person, interested in a particular sub- 
ject, may talk with another, tell his thoughts, 
give his views, and by so doing, stimulate 
the thought of that other person. This is all 
he can do. He can no more think the 
thoughts of another for him than he can 
eat his food, breathe, sleep, or learn his les- 
sons for him. Each day, your teacher is 
presenting his thoughts and views upon a 
variety of subjects for the purpose of stim- 
ulating your thoughts. If you do not listen

and think, the loss is yours. Your teacher 
has done for you all that he has the power 
to do. 
Sometimes people say or do something 
for which they are afterward very sorry, and 
excuse themselves with, “I didn’t think.” 
This is not quite true. They did think, but 
they thought so quickly and paid so little 
heed to their thought, that they really be- | 
lieve they did not think at all. But back of = | 
the word and the deed is the thought, and | 
back of the thought is feeling. If, therefore, 
we try to cultivate right feelings, we will 
think right, speak right, do right. If we 
cultivate evil feelings, we will think evil 
thoughts, speak evil words, do evil deeds, 
What have we now learned about thought? 
We have learned that thought is a mighty 
force, which man uses in all he does and in 
all he makes; and what is even more won- 
derful, he uses this same force to make him- 
self the kind of person he is. 
‘We are now ready to talk about two 
words, the meaning of which we should un- 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
derstand. These words are “character” and 
“reputation.” 
We have spoken of the man who, day 
after day and year after year, thought hon- 
est, honorable, kind thoughts which he ex- 
pressed in words and deeds. We said that 
he would become an honest, honorable, kind 
man, and that he would be known as such 
to others. 
Let us think of another man, who began 
when a child to be untruthful, deceitful, and 
dishonest because he thought thoughts of 
that kind. As he did not change, he grew 
into a dishonest, deceitful, and untruthful 
man, and was known to others as such. 
The man who is honest and honorable 
in all his dealing, we call a man of good 
character, because character is what a man 
really is, and is the product of his thinking. 
The man who is dishonest and dishonor- 
able in his dealings with others, we speak of 
asa man of bad character, his character being 
the result of his thoughts. 
People are constantly observing and study- 
ing others. They listen to their words, watch 
78 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  THOUGHT POWER 
their actions and in this way judge them 
or form an opinion regarding their charac- 
ter. The opinion thus formed is called “ re- 
putation.” 
We can now put what we have learned 
into two simple definitions which should be 
learned and thought about by each one: — 
1. Your character is what you are. 
t Your reputation is what others think you 
are. 
Which is more to be desired —a good 
character or a good reputation? Why? 
Would it be possible for a person to have 
a good character and a bad reputation? Ex- 
plain. Is it possible for a man to have a 
good reputation and a bad character? Ex- 
plain. Have youever read or heard of cases 
of either of these? 
What decides the quality of a man’s char- 
acter? His thoughts. Who is responsible? 
The man himself is responsible. Why? Be- 
cause he can control his own thoughts. 
Can a man always decide his reputation? 
No. Why? Because his reputation is the 
result of the thinking of others in regard to 
79 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
him, and he cannot control the thoughts of 
others, We hear this expression sometimes, 
“ Living down his reputation.” What do 
you think it means? 
Is it possible for a good character to grow 
out of evil thinking? For an evil character 
to grow out of right thinking? Show the im- 
possibility. If a man commits a crime, what 
may we be sure of? That he first thought 
evil and criminal thoughts. May this wrong 
thinking be the result of ignorance? Dis- 
cuss. Of willfulness? Discuss. 
Do some people value character more 
than reputation? Do some value reputation 
more than character? Which are wiser? 
Why? Which is safer, a good character or 
a good reputation? In time, will not a man 
of integrity of character establish a good re- 
putation in the community in which he lives? 
Will not a bad character establish a bad re- 
putation? 
Is it easy to build a good character? Does 
it take time? What qualities are needed? 
“Patience and perseverance and courage.” 
Suppose a person fails often, makes mis-

takes, does wrong when he really wishes to 
do right, should he be discouraged? “ No.” 
Why? “ Because we learn from making mis- 
takes.” “Success does not consist in never 
making blunders, but in never making the 
same one twice,” says a writer. 
Are painful experiences that cause unhap- 
piness, necessarily evil? Are pleasant and 
unpleasant experiences necessary in build- 
ing character? Are different kinds of food 
necessary for the good health of the body? 
Are different kinds of lessons necessary to 
the growth of the mind? What if the les- 
sons were on one subject only? Suppose a 
person were to have only pleasant experi- 
ences all through his life, what kind of per- 
son might he become? “He might grow self- 
ish and unsympathetic.” Are these desirable 
traits of character? Would they endear him 
to others? Do we all need the love and 
friendship of others? 
Suppose a person had only unpleasant 
experiences? “ He might become sour, mo- 
rose, and unkind.” Do you see then why 
experiences of both kinds are necessary in 
81 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
lives, just as sunshine and shadow, sunny 
days and rainy days are both needed to 
make plants grow? The best way to meet an 
experience, either pleasant or unpleasant, is 
to try to learn the lesson it can teach us. 
Suppose a person always thinks first of 
his own comfort and strives to secure it 
even at the expense of the comfort or the 
happiness of others, of whom is he thinking 
most? “ Of himself.” Whom does he love 
most? “ Himself.” 
On Friday afternoon, we will discuss the 
effect of undue self-love upon character. 
We will take such topics as: How is self- 
love manifested? Should there be any self- 
love? To what extent should it rule the 
individual? Describe a person ruled by self- 
love,—a mother; a father; a boy or a 
girl in the home; a boy or a girl in school ; 
a teacher; a business man. 
Let us now talk about rewards and pun- 
ishments in connection with thoughts. If 
you put your hand on a hot stove, what 
follows? “Pain.” Why? “Because fire 
82 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
THOUGHT POWER 
burns.” What is the only way to avoid the 
pain? “Avoid touching the hot stove.” Sup- 
pose no pain attended the burning, what 
might happen to the hand? “It would be 
destroyed.” You may say then that the pain 
is a blessing in disguise, since it warns you. 
What caused the burning? “The placing 
of the hand on the hot stove.” Is the suf- 
fering in the act itself? Can it be separated 
from the act? What is the only way to avoid 
the pain? “To avoid contact with the hot 
stove.” Would you blame the stove or say 
it was punishing you? We express this by 
saying the suffering is inberent in the act; 
that is, it does not come from outside, and 
cannot be separated from the act itself. 
Show how the quality of sweetness is inber- 
ent in sugar; the quality of sourness inber- 
ent in vinegar. 
Let us apply this to thought and show 
how the result, happiness or misery, is in- 
herent in the thought itself and does not 
come as a reward or a punishment from 
outside. 
A person has a noble, unselfish thought 
83 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
which leads to great good for many people, 
but another receives the credit and praise. 
)Is there no reward for the thinker? “ His re- 
ward is a gain in nobility and unselfishness 
of character.” Can any one rob him of this? 
Who can give the reason? “The reason is 
that the reward of a noble thought is in- 
herent in itself, and since this was the per- 
son’s own thought, the result to himself ot 
his thought is his own and not another's, 
even though another may, in some way, rob 
him of the outward reward in the praise of 
others.” Suppose a person, under the con- 
trol of jealous, envious thoughts, does a 
great wrong to an innocent person, and es- 
capes detection and punishment. Is there 
no punishment for him? “ He suffers the in- 
tense pain which jealousy and envy always 
sause. This he cannot escape because it is 
inherent in the thinking, and cannot be 
separated from it. So if he escapes the pub- 
lic condemnation for his act, he cannot es-_ 
cape the penalty of his own wrong thinking.” 
“Ifa man’s mind have evil thoughts, pain 
comes on him as comes the wheel, the ox 
84
-P-A-G-E-91
   THOUGHT POWER 
behind.” “Let the wise man guard his 
thoughts; for they are difficult to perceive, 
very artful, and they rush wherever they list : 
thoughts well guarded bring happiness.” * 
This is a great lesson for boys and girls 
to learn, and if learned thoroughly may 
save much sorrow. Think much about this. 
truth: The reward in happiness of right 
thinking is inherent in the thinking; it is 
wrapped up in it and cannot be separated 
from it. The punishment in misery of 
wrong thinking is inherent in the thinking 
and cannot be separated from it. In 
neither case is the true reward or punish- 
ment from without, but it is from within 
the mind of the person himself. 
Many grown people, not having a clear 
understanding of this law of thought, blame 
others for results that can clearly be traced 
back to their own wrong thinking. This is 
cowardly, and may be due to self-love and 
vanity which do not permit self-blame. It is 
a high type of courage, moral courage, that 
causes an individual to face the result of his

own thinking and condemn himself and not 
others for his folly. 
Are the boys and girls in this school 
building character? Are they gaining a re- 
putation? Will they be brave or cowardly in 
facing the results of their own thinking? 
Are there schoolroom experiences? Are 
some pleasant? some unpleasant? Does 
the schoolboy have experiences out of which 
he builds character and reputation just as 
does the business man in his business? Does 
the schoolgirl have experiences out of which 
she builds character and reputation just as 
does the mother in her home or the woman 
earning her living? When is the best time 
to form habits of thought that will result 
in a noble and helpful character? 
From our talks on thought-power we 
have learned to understand thinking; what 
thoughts are; what character is; and what 
reputation is. Character is the outgrowth of 
our thoughts. We think our own thoughts 
and are therefore alone responsible for our 
character. Character is slow in growth; it is 
86
-P-A-G-E-93

always changing and growing, never fin- 
ished or grown. We can direct the forma- 
tion of our character by controlling our 
thoughts. It is wiser to form habits of right 
thinking in youth, than to indulge in wrong 
ones, expecting to change in old age, for 
then it will not be easy to break a habit. 
Good results from good thoughts; evil, 
from evil thoughts. It cannot be other- 
wise. It is in harmony with the law of cause 
and effect. 
The true reward for right thinking is in- 
herent in the thinking itself, and the thinker 
cannot be robbed of this reward. The true 
punishment for evil thinking is inherent in 
the thinking itself, and no one can save the 
thinker from the result. 
Undue self-love poisons and undermines 
character.

CHAPTER V 
CONSTRUCTIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE THINKING 
Since we know that thoughts are the ma- 
terial which we use in building character, 
we should study the different kinds of think- 
ing, to discover which are good building 
material, and which are poor. This will not 
be difficult because there are only two kinds, 
constructive and destructive. 
. What does the word constructive mean? 
Destructive? Constructive thinking, then, 
builds a strong character, because it is good 
material. Destructive thinking can only re- 
sult in a poor, weak character. 
To aid us in better understanding the 
difference between constructive and destruc- 
tive thinking, let us draw a vertical line, 
and call it our “fence.” At the top and to 
the left, we will write as a heading the word 
“ constructive,” and at the right, the word 
88
-P-A-G-E-95
  THINKING 
“destructive.” As a beginning, we will use 
the words, kindness and unkindness. We 
put kindness to the left under “ construc- 
tive,” because kind thoughts help to make 
a good character; we put unkindness op- 
posite, under “ destructive,” because unkind 
thoughts tend to tear down and destroy 
character. 
Are there many things that go in oppo- 
sites or pairs, as we may call them, as day 
and night, summer and winter, north and 
south? Name as many of such pairs as you 
can. 
Thoughts go in pairs in the same way: 
for example, love and hate, kindness and 
unkindness, courage and cowardice. 
Let us see which of you can pile up on 
each side of his “fence” the greatest num- 
ber of pairs of thoughts. Be careful to put 
each word on the side where it belongs. On 
Friday afternoon we will count up and see 
whose list makes the highest pile. 
It will help you, to keep this list where 
you can see it and refer to it. For example, 
it may be your habit, when things do not 
89
-P-A-G-E-96
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
please you at home or in school, to become 
impatient. Look on your list for impatience. 
You will find it under the heading, destruc- 
tive. It tells you that you are thinking de- 
structive thoughts, and these are weakening 
your character. They are poor building 
material; cast them out of your mind, just 
as the honest bricklayer throws aside a soft, 
crumbling brick because he knows that it 
will not bear its part in meeting the strain 
which will come upon the wall. Look at 
the “fence”: you are on the wrong side; 
climb over! 
Perhaps you have for so long a time 
yielded to impatient thoughts, that you 
have developed a quick temper. Look on 
your list for anger on the destructive side. 
Look across at its opposite —self-control, 
a most desirable trait of character ; strength 
and power come to those who possess it. 
You are on the wrong side of the fence. 
Climb over! Try to cultivate thoughts of 
self-control. Fill your mind with these 
thoughts, and there will be no room for 
anger. 
go
-P-A-G-E-97
  THINKING 
Perhaps you have thoughtlessly formed 
a habit of criticizing others, your class- 
mates, your teacher and neighbors. This is 
criticism—on the destructive side of the 
fence. That means destructive to yourself, 
not necessarily destructive to others. He 
who judges another or condemns another 
thereby condemns himself. The wrong side 
of the fence again. Climb over! On the 
opposite side is charity. 
Character is growth and slow growth, so 
there is no need to become discouraged if 
you cannot see much progress in a short 
time. Trace the growth of the old apple tree 
from the seed. It was slow and orderly. In 
just that way must the habit of right think- 
ing grow. 
Let us use again the words, self-control 
and anger. Suppose you, observe that trifles 
make you angry. What do you need to 
cultivate? ‘ Self-control.” Having decided 
to change your thought, try to stop think- 
ing about your temper, and instead let your 
mind dwell upon its opposite — self-control. 
Think about it until you realize what a 
gI
-P-A-G-E-98
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
desirable possession it is, and your desire 
to possess it will increase. Read about 
persons who controlled their temper, and 
you will see that it is an element of great- 
ness. Ifyou know any self-controlled person, 
observe that one. While you are trying to 
overcome this fault, do not dwell upon other 
faults you may have. Take only one at a 
time. It may help you to print on a card 
in large letters the word — SgLr-conTROL 
—and place it where you will see it on 
awakening in the morning. It will be a re- 
minder. : 
Be cheerful in this work of cultivating 
habits of right thinking. Do not let failures 
induce you to condemn yourself. 
Discouraging, self-condemning thoughts 
are destructive, therefore do not harbor 
them. “ Complaining and looking backward 
never open the way forward” is a good 
motto to keep in mind. Imagine that you 
have planted a seed, the seed of self-control, 
that you are giving it right conditions and 
proper care, and are watching the signs of 
its coming. If it does not manifest itself as 
g2
-P-A-G-E-99
     THINKING 
soon as you had hoped, do not lose heart. 
Remember, “That fruit is finest that fruits 
most slowly.” Then when the signs of 
growth begin to appear, when the things that 
used to annoy you are trifles to be laughed 
at, you will feel a joy similar to that of the 
gardener when his hopes for the seeds that 
he planted are realized in strong, healthy 
plants. 
Another caution is necessary. Do not let 
the mind dwell too long upon this work, or 
turn to it too often. If you do, you will 
form the habit of thinking too much about 
yourself, and in correcting one bad habit of 
thought, you will be in danger of forming 
another. When people think too much 
about themselves, study themselves, their 
feelings, their likes and dislikes, they will 
come to believe that what concerns them- 
selves is of far more importance than what 
concerns others: they become self-centered. | 
Is that not an expressive word? This in- 
duces selfishness, self-love, and vanity. Are 
these desirable traits of character? Will a 
93
-P-A-G-E-100
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
person who has cultivated these win and 
hold the love and friendship of others? 
Think of the opposites, unselfishness and 
love for others, and guard against becoming 
self-centered. Another reason is, that when a 
person allows his mind to dwell constantly 
upon some defect, either of mind or body, he 
becomes morbid. Look in the dictionary for 
the meaning of this word. Constantly dwell- 
ing upon one subject alone is as injurious to 
the mind as taking only one kind of food 
is to the body. Both need variety to nour- 
ish them properly. 
Attack your fault with courage, and in a 
cheerful, wholesome spirit. Your bad habit 
of thought is your enemy. You are going 
to put him to rout. The struggle may be 
fierce and long, but from the very first you 
know the end means victory to you. You 
are determined to conquer. So when a bad 
day comes, and the enemy seems to be gain- 
ing the mastery, you will not be discour- 
aged. It will only show you the need of 
greater watchfulness. Perhaps you were off 
guard, and the enemy slipped in. Be the 
94
-P-A-G-E-101
  THINKING 
brave soldier. Let defeat but spur you on 
to greater victory. 
If the body is denied food and water, 
what is the result? If a plant is denied 
proper soil, sunshine, and moisture, what 
follows? This same law holds in regard to 
your thoughts. Deny them nourishment 
and they die. Refuse to feed wrong thoughts 
by dwelling upon them, and they will die, 
and in their place you can plant your good, 
wholesome and useful thoughts. Look upon 
wrong thoughts as weeds, “cumberers of 
the ground.” 
Nothing worth while is ever gained with- 
out patient endeavor. What is the history 
of all great movements or reforms? Have 
men and women suffered and died for a 
cause in which they believed? Give exam- 
ples. Have there been persons who devoted 
their lives to helping humanity, thinking 
not of themselves but of others? Give ex- 
amples. What traits of character must such 
persons possess? “Courage, persistence, and 
a great love.” 
Suppose a person rushes into danger, and 
95 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
at great risk, even at the risk of his own 
life, saves the life of another, what is he 
called? “A hero.” What kind of courage 
has he displayed? “ Physical courage.” Sup- 
pose a man believes a thing to be right, 
and stands true to this belief, even though 
he is ridiculed, and even though it may 
mean the loss of his reputation, would 
you call him a brave man? What kind 
of courage does he show? “ Moral cour- 
age.” Are there ever occasions in school 
life that demand physical courage? moral 
courage? Have you ever seen either kind 
displayed? How did you feel toward the 
brave ones? 
What would you say of a boy or girl, 
man or woman, who attacks a bad habit, 
fights on, day after day, in spite of suffer- 
ing and gains the victory? What would you 
say of one who recognizes the bad habit, 
tries to overcome it, but when suffering 
comes, gives up? What of the former? 
“ He displays moral courage, and is a hero.” 
Does his victory concern himself only? 
“ He is able to help others, who may have 
96
-P-A-G-E-103
THINKING 
the same struggle to make. He can encour- 
age them, for by his victory he has proved 
that courage and persistence will win in the 
end.” What has the other shown by weakly 
giving up? “ He has displayed moral cow- 
ardice.”” What name has he gained? “Cow- 
ard.” Do you like the sound of that word? 
Have you ever heard the word coward ap- 
plied to a man? Give examples. What is 
the effect of such cowardice upon others? 
“It has the effect of discouraging their ef- 
forts.” So the coward not only injures or 
destroys himself, but his example is injurious 
in its influence upon others, especially those 
who are naturally inclined to be weak. We 
can never think of one alone—self— but 
always of self and others. “Man cannot 
live to himself alone.” 
Bring this home to yourself. You are one, 
a unit in the world, and the way in which 
you conduct your life is of great importance 
in its influence upon yourself and others. 
Do not belittle yourself. You are a part 
of this great humanity: determine to bea 
good part, to act your part well. You, just 
97 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
like every other human being, have faults 
as the result of wrong thinking. What are 
you going to do? Build courage into your 
character by attacking your fault, putting it 
torout by cultivating its opposite; or weakly 
yield to cowardice? There is no better found- 
ation stone upon which to erect a strong 
character than courage. And the best of it 
is —it is free to all. 
It costs nothing in money to cultivate it 
and only a little time each day. 
Two or three minutes on rising in the 
morning are quite sufficient to fix the good 
thought, the desired thought for the day; 
but this time must be spent daily. In un- 
wavering persistence lies success. The Bible 
says: “He that wavereth is like the wave 
of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. 
Let not that man think that he shall receive 
anything of the Lord.” 
You, the real child, must make the choice. 
No one can choose for you. You build your 
character through your God-given powers. 
No one can build for you. Take up your 
work with courage and a brave heart.

CHAPTER VI 
DAILY LIFE 
Character consists in little acts, well and honorably 
performed : daily life being the quarry from which we 
build it up, and rough-hew the habits which form it. 
Wo can tell the meaning of the word 
quarry in this quotation? How many ever 
saw a quarry? Describe what you saw. We 
will have the definition of quarry read, 
and also written on the blackboard. “The 
open excavation from which any useful stone 
is taken for building and engineering pur- 
poses is called a quarry.” 
We see that a certain kind of building is 
dependent upon the quarry: if there were 
no quarries, there could be no building of 
the kind which depends upon the materials 
that the quarries supply. Though the quarry 
has much to do with man’s physical needs 
and comfort, comparatively few persons are 
engaged either in the business of quarrying 
100
-P-A-G-E-107
   DAILY LIFE 
or in using the materials quarried. But there 
is a kind of building in which every person 
is engaged. He not only quarries his mate- 
rials, but shapes them and puts them to use. 
What is this building in which we are all 
engaged? “The building of character.” 
Are materials needed for this kind of build- 
ing as well as for the other? Character is 
built of what, according to our quotation? 
“Of little acts well and honorably per- 
formed.” Observe the word before “acts.” 
The two words before “ performed.” What 
is the quarry from which we obtain our build- 
ing materials? “Daily life is the quarry.” 
To assist us in our study, let us think of 
daily life as the quarry, and of the small 
happenings or experiences of each day as 
the materials we use in our building. The 
various effects of common experiences will 
be the subject for our consideration and dis- 
cussion. 
No one, old or young, rich or poor, 
strong or weak, can avoid experiences or 
escape from the results. These experiences, 
though common to all, are not the same in 
Tor
-P-A-G-E-108
Ls 
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
kind. Those that come to one person rarely, 
if ever, prove exactly like those of another 
person. Each individual has his own pecul- 
iar experiences, and must meet them him- 
self: no one can meet them for him, any 
more than another can do for him those 
things which are necessary for the well-being 
of his body and mind. These experiences 
are related to his soul or spiritual life, and 
this life is affected according to the wisdom 
or folly with which these experiences are met. 
We shall understand this better through 
illustrations. A most unexpected and un- 
pleasant experience comes into the life of 
aman. Heis shocked and almost paralyzed. 
At first he cannot collect his thoughts. But 
as he dwells upon the experience, he grows 
to see it only in the light of a great misfor- 
tune, which has unjustly fallen to his lot.

questions why he, more than others, should 
be so afflicted. What has he done to de- 
serve such a fate, when others, not so good 
as he, escape? From so thinking, he devel- 
ops self-pity, which blinds him and renders

him unfit to cope with the situation. He 
complains loudly of hard luck, blames others, 
and may even be guilty of some rash act. 
Another, more wise, may have an expe- 
rience, quite as unexpected and quite as dis- 
tressing. He, too, may be shocked and al- 
most paralyzed with grief. But knowing 
that experiences, pleasant and unpleasant, 
come to all, he determines to meet this with 
what courage he may call to his aid, and if 
possible find a way out of the difficulty pre- 
sented. This is not an easy matter. It takes 
patient and persistent effort. He wastes no 
time in weak complaining or in comparing 
his lot with that of others, apparently more 
fortunate. He faces the situation, seeks to 
know the cause and tries to find a way to 
destroy the trying effects. In time he is 
successful and overcomes the difficulty. He 
has gained strength through mastery. Can 
you give any cause for the opposite effects 
of these similar experiences? “The spirit 
in which the experience was met.” “One 
thought destructive thoughts; the other, 
constructive.”

CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
Two mothers pass through a similar and 
sad experience: each loses a child, dearer 
than life to her. The one becomes a de- 
spondent, complaining, self-centered woman, 
utterly indifferent to the fact that she is 
creating an unhappy atmosphere in her home, 
and destroying the comfort of the mem- 
bers of her household. The other mother, 
through suffering, grows more gentle, sym- 
pathetic and tender. Were the results of the 
experience in these cases the effects of the 
experience itself, or of the way in which it 
was met? 
Let us come nearer home and use, as an 
illustration, an experience common in school 
life. Two girls, taking the same examination, 
have resolved to do their very best, to ob- 
tain an excellent mark. Both papers are re- 
turned marked sixty percent. To each this 
is a bitter disappointment, an unpleasant 
experience. 
One glances at the mark and becomes 
very angry; her vanity and pride have re- 
ceived a severe blow; she does not care to 
know wherein she has failed; she tears the 
104
-P-A-G-E-111
  DAILY LIFE 
paper into bits, and throws them into the 
wastebasket; she even blames her teacher, 
accusing her of being unjust and partial. By 
indulging in anger, she has deepened a men- 
tal groove along which angry thoughts will 
flow more easily in the future, when occa- 
sion arises, The experience has harmed her. 
Why? 
The other girl is quite as bitterly disap- 
pointed, and for a moment, quite as angry. 
Then it occurs to her to examine her paper, 
and learn why it is marked so low. She 
looks up the correct answers and compares 
them with those which she gave, and is as- 
tonished at her own carelessness and lack 
of preparation. It does not occur to her to 
blame her teacher : it simply shows the need 
of greater care and more study. The experi- 
ence has helped her. Why? 
Two boys are candidates for the same 
office in the school. One is elected: the other 
defeated. Discuss the effect of victory upon 
one as helpful; as harmful. The gain or loss 
to the other through defeat. Give other 
illustrations. What do these illustrations 
105
-P-A-G-E-112
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
make plain to us? “It is not the kind of 
experience, but the spirit in which it is met, 
that counts.” 
You see that you do not wait until you 
are grown up to have experiences. You are 
having them now, every day, at home and 
at school. They are just the little happen- 
ings that make up your daily life. They are 
problems for you to solve each day, and are 
as difficult for you now as those will be 
which come to you when you are men and 
women. The way in which you solve pre- 
sent problems will have much to do with 
your solution of future ones. If you learn 
to use courage in facing your problems of 
to-day, and wisdom in solving them, you 
will form habits of thought which will be 
of untold value to you later on. 
The very best way to think of these ex- 
periences is as lessons, and learn them in 
the same way in which you learn other les- 
sons. Each one has something to teach you, 
and something of value, if you but study it 
and meet it in the right spirit. This is the 
106
-P-A-G-E-113
  DAILY LIFE 
part of wisdom since you cannot evade ex- 
periences, nor can you expect all to be pleas- 
ant. This you have learned already, whether 
you have given the subject thought or not. 
You know that some days things happen 
to you right here in the schoolroom that 
make you very happy, and some things hap- 
pen to disappoint you and make you un- 
happy. If you have not thought about this, do 
so now, and watch yourself to see how you 
seem inclined naturally to meet experience, 
whether you are impatient and easily dis- 
couraged or cheerful and courageous. If, 
from observation, your unpleasant experi- 
ences seem to outnumber your pleasant 
ones, seek for the cause. Look frst within 
yourself. Destroy any tendency to blame 
others for your unhappiness. If you find 
that the cause is within yourself, and cour- 
ageously face your weakness and try to over- 
come it, you will be interested and perhaps 
astonished to find happy experiences out- 
numbering former unhappy ones, as the 
days go by. But remember that effort of 
107 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
this kind always calls for courage, patience, 
and perseverance. 
There are people who go through life 
weak and crippled, because they have not 
learned to look upon experiences in the 
true light. To them, sad and unhappy ex- 
periences are punishments, and generally, 
unmerited punishments : this arouses a feel- 
ing of having been unjustly treated. This 
feeling is encouraged until self-pity is de- 
veloped. No feeling is more disastrous in 
its effects. No habit of thought is more 
dangerous to cultivate than a habit of weakly 
pitying one’s self: there is nothing more 
paralyzing in its influence upon effort and 
character. If these people had been taught 
in childhood that experiences are lessons to 
be faced with courage, and studied and 
learned, how different their lives would have 
been, and how different the influence upon 
other lives. 
If when a hard day comes, and such days 
do come to all, you find yourself indulging 
in self-pity, feeling that you have beenabused 
or injured, put all such feelings aside at once. 
108
-P-A-G-E-115
  DAILY LIFE 
To hold them means to cripple yourself 
mentally: it means misery to yourself and 
unhappiness to others. 
It must now be plain to you that it is both 
importantand desirable to learn early in life to 
look upon experiences as materials for char- 
acter building, and not rewards or punish- 
ments. They are your life problems and 
must be solved by you. 
Also, realize the truth, that it is not the 
kind of experience, but the spirit in which 
you meet it, that counts. 
May certain life experiences develop cow- 
ardice in an individual? Give examples and 
discuss. Show howthe same experiences, met 
in the right spirit, develop moral courage. 
May certain experiences in school or col- 
lege life develop cowardice in students? 
Give examples and discuss. Show how these 
same experiences may develop moral cour- 
age. There is one feeling quite common 
amongchildren: thatis, fear. Howmany have 
felt afraid? Tellsome things you have feared. 
Have you ever felt afraid, and learned later 
109
-P-A-G-E-116
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
you had nothing to fear? Are you ever afraid 
at school? What are you afraid of? “Of 
examinations.” Let us see if there is really 
anything to fear. 
What are the two purposes of a test? “To 
find out how much we know.” There is 
another: the teacher finds out whether she 
has taught you well or not. Is this good 
knowledge for pupils? for teacher? If your 
mark is a good one, what does it tell you? 
“Tt tells us that we have studied and learned 
our lessons well.” How does this make you 
feel? “It makes us feel happy.” Ifyou have 
indulged in fear before the examination, you 
have had your bad feelings for no purpose. 
Have you acted wisely or foolishly? Might 
your mark not have been even better, if you 
had indulged in no fear thoughts before the 
test? Suppose your mark is low, what have 
you learned? “That we have not studied 
hard enough or we’ve been careless.”” If this 
is the truth is it well to know it? Knowing 
it, what can you do? “Study harder and be 
more careful.”” Do you see any place for fear? 
Suppose you all fail on certain questions, what 
110
-P-A-G-E-117
  DAILY LIFE 
does your teacher learn? “She learns that 
she has not presented certain points clearly 
enough.” Is this good for the teacher? 
You see, then, that a test is really good and 
helpful, but you have made it seem evil 
through your way of looking at it. The 
wrong is not in the test, but in you. Show 
how this same experience, rightfully met, 
might have developed courage. Discuss sim- 
ilar school experiences that have caused you 
to fear. Learn to think and to reason about 
these things. Look upon a test as a mental 
race in which you match your strength with 
others to gain self-knowledge just as you do 
in a physical race. Do you enjoy a race? 
Learn to get the same kind of pleasure out 
of a mental race. 
Does fear affect the body? Discuss. Does 
fear affect the mind? Give examples and dis- 
cuss. Do you think it is well to harbor fear 
thoughts? If you have formed the habit, can 
you overcome it? Is it worth trying to do so? 
Think of other experiences that you have 
considered evil. Perhaps you may find that 
in reality they are good.

  CHAPTER VII 
KINDNESS 
Since the true character is the result of right 
thinking, we see how necessary it is to un- 
derstand what right thinking means, and 
how to learn to think in that way. And we 
are going to learn this just as we learn to 
read or to spell or to work examples, that 
is, through simple lessons, a little each day, 
to help us to master the subject. 
We shall take up, one by one, different 
subjects of thought, and talk about them every 
morning for five or ten minutes. We shall 
work very slowly. We shall consider only 
one or two thoughts during each lesson, and 
these we will try to put to practical use dur- 
ing the day in school, on the playground 
and at home. 
Suppose you listen to the teacher while 
she tells you about subtraction, and watch 
carefully as she works the examples on the 
112
-P-A-G-E-119
  KINDNESS 
blackboard, will you ever learn subtraction 
from these alone? What more is necessary? 
“We must work examples ourselves.” By 
working the examples yourselves, you are 
proving the truth of what your teacher tells 
you, and it is the only way you can prove 
its truth for yourselves. 
It is in exactly the same way that you 
must prove what you are toldin regard to this 
subject of right thinking. You must listen 
to what is said in the morning talks, think 
about it, and thus prove its truth by using 
it during the day*at school and at home. 
Our rule in these talks will be to dwell 
upon the constructive side, alluding to its 
opposite only when necessary. The construc- 
tive side is the side of the real, the true; the 
destructive is the unreal, the false, no matter 
how real it may seem. We will deal with real 
things and, as far as possible, ignore the op- 
posites. Real things remain; the unreal fade 
away. And so we shall hope that the seeming 
realities of wrong thinking will gradually fade 
until finally they disappear. 
We shall follow this plan for another rea- 
113
-P-A-G-E-120
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
son: we cannot hold both kinds, opposites, 
in the mind at the same time. We will look 
at the constructive side only. That is what 
is meant by the “single eye” as spoken of 
in the Bible. 
If a man is going to build a good house 
that will endure, what must he first con- 
sider? “The foundation.” Would he be 
wise to erect avery tall structure upon a 
shallow foundation? If his building is to be 
high, how must he dig the foundation? It 
is just as necessary to consider the founda- 
tion in character building. There must be a 
strong foundation. 
To begin, then, we must always think of 
ourself, the real self, the soul, as dwelling 
in the body. We must not think of the 
body as though it were our real self. We do 
not think of our clothing as ourself. We 
know that it is only the covering used to 
protect the body from the weather. In 
much the same way, the body is the cover- 
ing worn by the soul, during the time it 
lives on this earth. The body is most use~ 
114
-P-A-G-E-121
  KINDNESS 
ful, wonderful, and beautiful, and we should 
love it, reverence it, and care for it, but we 
should never forget that it is only the cov- 
ering and not the real self: it is a servant 
of the household, and not the master. We 
must try to get this firmly fixed in our 
minds, believe it and realize it, because it is 
one of the foundation truths upon which we 
are to build character. 
Some people go through life without 
thinking of themselves as anything but body. 
To feed and clothe the body, and to have 
a good time, as they call it, is all they care 
about. What are such people doing? “They 
are making the servant more important than 
the master.” “They are letting a servant 
rule the household instead of the master.” 
Why do you think they do this? “ Perhaps 
they were not taught about soul, mind, and 
body when they were children.” Could 
there be another reason? “They might 
know the truth, but think it easier to in- 
dulge Body than to train him.” Do you 
think such persons are wise? Will they 
gain happiness? You will remember that we 
115
-P-A-G-E-122
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
have read that the body is a good servant 
but acruel master. We will discuss this be- 
cause it is important. The next thing we 
need to realize is that we have free-will. 
Free-will and self-responsibility are two 
other foundation truths. 
Free-will means that we are free to do as 
we will to do. This does not mean that we 
can do whatever we may wish to do. It 
means that we are free to make a choice. 
Our lessons, day by day, will gradually 
make this clear, so we will only touch 
briefly upon the subject now. We may im- 
agine ourself, the real self, as having the 
good on one side, and the evil on the other 
side. If we think a good thought it turns 
us toward the good, unites us with it, and 
makes us stronger to do right. If we think 
an evil thought, it links us with evil, and 
weakens us toward the good. Who thinks 
our .thoughts? Who, then, decides which 
way we turn? Who makes the choice? 
This is what is meant by free-will. We are 
free to choose what kind of thoughts we 
will think, and in this way we decide what 
116 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  KINDNESS 
words we will speak and what deeds we will 
perform. What does self-responsibility 
mean? “Responsibility for self.” “We 
must take the praise or the blame, because 
we make the choice in thinking, which brings 
good results or their opposites.” Is the 
meaning of free-will clear? The meaning of 
self-responsibility? We must repeat some 
of these truths again and again because we 
want to lay a strong foundation. Why are 
reviews and tests necessary? 
It is important that you give thought to 
the subject of self-responsibility or respon- 
sibility for self, and learn the truth concern- 
ing it when you are young. Persons who 
have not received such instruction are liable 
to cause much unnecessary trouble for them- 
selves and for others, and in some cases 
seriously to interfere with the lives of those 
brought into relation with them. 
You must always think of yourself as a 
household consisting of the master and two 
servants. You are the master; you are re- 
sponsible for the welfare of your household. 
During the years of helpless childhood, your 
117
-P-A-G-E-124
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
parents take charge of your household: by 
so doing, they are teaching you and pre- 
paring you for your later duties. As the 
years pass and you grow in knowledge, you 
gradually assume the care yourself, until you 
arrive at the age of manhood or woman- 
hood, when in the eyes of the law you are 
responsible faiiyour own acts: your parents 
can no longer be held responsible for you; 
you are self-responsible. You should look 
forward to this time with joy, and should 
prepare to use your future freedom wisely 
by learning in the present all you can from 
your parents and your teachers. Should not 
the knowledge of this coming freedom and 
self-responsibility tend to make you more 
diligent and obedient? 
Is it wise for boys and girls to submit to 
parents and teachers? What do you think 
of those who refuse to be taught and 
guided? Are they preparing wisely for self- 
responsibility ? 
What would you think of a person who 
tries to dominate and rule another who has 
reached the age of self-responsibility ? Has 
118
-P-A-G-E-125
  KINDNESS 
a father such right? A mother? Any rela- 
tive or friend? What do you think of the 
person who allows himself to be so ruled? 
Yet it is always wise to listen to the counsel 
of those capable of giving it. 
Just as one person cannot eat for an- 
other, breathe for him or learn his lessons 
for him, so he cannot be responsible for 
him after he has attained the age of self- 
responsibility. One life cannot be respon- 
sible for another life: the one life is respon- 
sible only in relation to the other. Some 
parents, failing to grasp this truth, think 
they can live the lives of their children for 
them: some teachers try to assume respon- 
sibility that belongs to the pupils. All that 
any of us can do is so to live his or her own 
life as to exert a good influence over the 
lives that touch ours. 
Do you think it is possible for you to 
grasp this truth now, and try to practice it 
in your daily life in home and school? 
Our first subject for regular lessons is 
“ Kindness.” 
119

Love we are told is the greatest thing in 
the world, and kindness is love expressing 
itself. It is the real self, the soul, that feels 
love, and not the body or the mind. The 
feeling of love is followed by thoughts of love 
which are manifested outwardly in words and 
deeds of love; and for this manifestation the 
mind and the body are used. 
During this month, we are going to talk 
about kindness, and only a thought or two 
at a time. You know we are not going to 
hurry because character needs to be built 
slowly and carefully. We are going to plant 
our little seeds of kindness and give them 
time to grow. 
If we have a lesson each morning, how 
many lessons shall we have in the month? 
“ Twenty lessons.” At theend of the month 
do you not believe that you will think more 
and know more about kindness than you do 
now?

reason has not yet been given. “Because

they love us.”” How do you know that your 
parents love you? How do your parents 
know that you love them? “ We express our 
love for them in words and deeds.” How 
can you help your father? your mother? 
What do you think about children who tease 
and cry for what they want when they have 
been told they cannot have it? Are they 
kind? Are they proving their love? You 
have told about expressing your love for your 
parents in kind words and helpful deeds 
These are very good ways, but there is a 
way even better than these. “The best way 
is by obeying them.” When? “ As soon as 
they speak.” That is very true. Learn these 
lines: they will help you. 
«« All obedience worth the name 
Must be prompt and ready.’’

at being disturbed and refuse to go. What 
will this teach you about yourself? Suppose 
a boy and a girl know ways in which they 
can be very helpful totheir mother, but they 
shirk work whenever they can and run off to 
play. What are they telling about them- 
selves? “ They are telling that they are un- 
kind.” What else? “They are selfish.” — 
What else? “They are lazy.” Are these fine 
traits of character? Who is being hurt more, 
the children or their mother? Is it easy to be- 
lieve these children when they say they love 
their mother, their father, and their home? 
Will it do you any good to learn all these 
things about kindness in your home if you 
do not use them? How do you learn to add

kind in the schoolroom ? How can you be 
kind to your teacher? “ By attending school 
punctually and regularly, by learning our 
lessons as perfectly as we can, by being neat 
and clean, and by obeying promptly and 
cheerfully.” How can you be kind to each 
other? Is the pupil who tries to do his best 
each day, kind to his classmates? Why? 
Can a desk prove that its owner is kind ? 
Explain. “If the desk is neat, we think the 
owner of the desk must be neat.”’ Can hands, 
face, hair show consideration for the feelings 
of others? Explain. Is it kind to be consid- 
erate of the comfort of others? Do clothes 
make the boy or girl? Do poor clothes pre- 
vent a boy or girl from being kind? Do you 
love a person’s clothes, or the person him- 
self? Which is pleasanter to have near us — 
a person who is neat and clean, or the op- 
posite? How does the teacher feel about 
this? How do classmates feel? If one is 
careless and unclean and, therefore, unlov- 
able, can he blame his teacher or classmates? 
Ts it not caused by his own disregard for the 
feelings of others? What may he be yield-

ing to? “Laziness and selfishness.” Are 
these fine traits of character? Will they bring 
success? Do you see how we can show others 
that we are kind and considerate of their feel- 
ings, or unkind and inconsiderate,— without 
uttering a word? What are you telling your 
teacher and classmates? To which group do 
you belong? 
What happens if a drop of ink falls into 
a pail of clean water? Would you like to 
drink the water? Is it possible for one pu- 
pil in aschool to be something like the drop 
of ink in the pail of water? Explain. “If 
just one pupil is unkind, idle and disobedi- 
ent, the school cannot be a perfectly good 
school.” Whom does such a pupil hurt the 
more, himself or others? ‘ He hurts him- 
self.” Show this. “He is using poor ma- 
terial in building his character.” What kind 
of character is he forming? What reputation 
is he gaining? Is he wise or foolish? Is he 
to be pitied or condemned? Can he change? 
How? “By changing his thoughts.” Is there 
any other way? “ No.” Can any one change 
124
-P-A-G-E-131

his thoughts for him? “ No.” Why? “ Be- 
cause he thinks his own thoughts: no one 
can think them for him.” What is all that 
others can do? “Others can teach him 
what right thinking is, and its results, and 
what wrong thinking and its results are.” 
Suppose he changes his thoughts, to whom 
does the credit belong? Suppose he refuses 
to put into practice what he knows, who is 
to blame? Why should he feel self-sat- 
isfaction or self-condemnation? ‘ Because 
he is self-responsible.” What does self- 
responsible mean? “ Responsible for self.” 
Is he free to choose what thoughts he will 
think? “Yes.” Why? “Because he has 
free-will.” What do you understand free- 
will to mean? “It means freedom of choice 
as to the kind of character we desire to 
have, and not freedom to do as we please 
in all things.” Give two reasons for trying 
to do right, that is, trying to cultivate right 
thinking instead of wrong thinking. “It 
helps ourselves and it helps others.” Think 
about this: “Man cannot live to himself 
alone.”

We have talked about kindness in the 
home during one week, kindness in school 
during another ; this week we will talk about 
manifesting kindness outside of home and 
school. To whom can we show kindness? 
To our neighbors? Talk about this. Oth- 
ers? “We can be kind to strangers in public 
places, as in street cars, church, places of 
amusement, on the street.’’ Discuss each. 
It is nowthe fourth week. For three weeks 
we have talked about showing kindness to 
people; what subject can you suggest for 
this week? ‘‘ Kindness to animals and to all 
living things.’ Who can give one reason 
for being kind to animals? ‘We should be 
kind to them because they are dumb and 
helpless.” That is a very good reason. Do 
you believe a truly noble man or woman, 
boy or girl, would injure any creature weaker 
than himself or herself? Would such a one 
injure a helpless animal? If such is the case, 
what may we be sure of? “Such a one is lack- 
ing in true nobility of character.” What traits 
of character is he cultivating? “ Cruelty and 
cowardice.” Why is he acoward? Are these

your dog do anything for you? your cat? 
Can animals feel? Can they suffer? When 
you lose your temper, and speak harshly to 
your dog, or perhaps give him a blow or a 
kick, how does he act? At such times, can 
you feel proud of yourself? Are you mani- 
festing nobility of character? Do you believe 
that men and women, boys and girls, who 
are cruel to poor dumb animals, can be really 
kind to people? Since these creatures cannot 
speak and tell their sufferings, do you think 
- this should call forth greater kindness from 
us? Are there people who love animals so 
dearly that they are moved to pity when 
they see them abused? What have such 
people done? “They have formed societies 
for preventing cruelty to children and to

was and what he did that made his name 
known and honored? You may vote for a 
pupil to write a sketch of his life to be read 
on Friday afternoon. It will show us what 
one kind and loving person can accomplish 
in the world. Do children ever form hu- 
mane societies? How would you like tc 
form one? . 
When a boy or a girl is cruel to an aniv 
mal, which is hurt more, the boy or girl, or 
the animal ? “ The boy or girl suffers greater 
harm.” Explain this. “The boy or girl is 
| developing cruelty, and cruelty is one of the 
| worst things that can be built into charac- 
| ter.” Is the real hurt to the soul, the mind, 
or the body? “The hurt is really to the real 
boy or girl, the soul.” Prove this. “The 
boy or girl acted cruelly because cruel 
thoughts were held.” What caused the 
cruel thoughts? “The boy or girl must 
have felt cruel toward the poor animal.” 
What is it that feels emotions of love or 
hate? “The soul.” If a wrong feeling is 
held, instead of being crowded out by a 
right one, what follows? ‘“ The wrong feel- 
128
-P-A-G-E-135
  KINDNESS 
ing shows itself in wrong thoughts, and 
these in turn express themselves in wrong 
or evil words and deeds.” What is the effect 
upon the person indulging in evil thoughts? 
“The body is hurt, the mind is hurt, and 
the soul is hurt.” Is there any escape from 
this result of evil thinking? Which is most 
serious—a hurt to body, mind, or soul? 
“ A hurt to the soul.” Why? “ Because the 
soul is the ruler, or the master, of his house- 
hold. If he is injured or weakened, he can- 
not take good care of his servants. It is the 
soul or master that gives the commands; 
the servants, body and mind, obey the com- 
mands. If the master is a good master, his 
servants will be good servants; if the mas- 
ter is a bad master, his servants will be bad 
servants.” 
The beginning is what? “ The beginning 
is the feeling.”’ Repeat the order. “The 
order is: feeling, thought, word, deed.” 
What must we guard then? “We must 
guard our feeling.” Suppose you find your- 
self feeling angry toward an animal, what 
must you try todo? “ Change the feeling.”

  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
There is a little schoolhouse in the coun- 
try near New York City. Only a few years 
ago the children attending this school were 
cruel. They stoned animals, they robbed 
birds’ nests, they beat plants with sticks or 
uprooted them and left them lying in the 
hot sun to die, and they were rude and in- 
sulting to people they met driving along 
the road, until many disliked to pass the 
schoolhouse. 
There was a gentleman living in the 
neighborhood, who loved every living crea- 
ture. He loved them, because he believed 
that the life in them is the same life that is 
in us; that there is only One Source of Life, 
that is God, and that all living things are 
but varieties of the manifestations of this 
Life. This caused in him a feeling of love 
and reverence for everything that lives, not 
only people, but animals and plants. If you 
believe this, do you think it will have the 
same effect upon your character as it had 
upon the character of this gentleman? You 
know there is but one way for you to prove 
this for yourselves. 
130
-P-A-G-E-137
  . KINDNESS 
The gentleman felt sorry to see these 
children growing in cruelty, but he did not 
stop with just a feeling of sorrow. This feel- 
ing led him to think, and he saw what he 
could do. He visited the school and talked 
to the children about being kind to all liv- 
ing things. He made them see the effect of 
kindness upon themselves and their lives. 
What he said to them, set them to thinking. 
They changed their thoughts. To help them, 
he formed a little society, which they all 
joined. They studied the habits of the crea- 
tures around them, they realized the suffer- 
ing they had needlessly caused, and they 
learned how much these humble creatures 
added to their own comfort, happiness, and 
even to maintaining human life. The crea- 
tures in that part of the country now have 
nothing to fear from the children. They are 
changed from enemies into friends. They 
protect these manifestations or expressions 
of the One Life, instead of trying to de- 
stroy them. What is the effect upon the 
children themselves? “They are building 
kindness instead of cruelty into their charac- 
131
-P-A-G-E-138
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
ters.” When they see the One Life in all, 
what are they cultivating? “ They are cul- 
tivating reverence for God and His works.” 
What did the gentleman’s talks do for the 
children? “They changed their feeling 
toward animals, and all living creatures.” 
What followed this change of feeling? 
‘Change of thoughts.” What next followed ? 
“Their words and actions changed.” Do 
you see again, how the order is feeling, 
thought, word, and deed? Of what is this 
gentleman’s work another illustration? “Of 
what one person may do who is thought- 
ful and kind and has a spirit of helpfulness.” 
Here is another story. A gentleman had 
a garden which he loved. In the spring, he 
made his flower-beds, planted his seeds and 
set out his plants. Every morning, he rose 
early to work in his garden. He loved to 
see the growth his plants had made during 
the night, and he worked hard to keep out 
the weeds, and make the conditions right 
for the tender plants. He built no fence 
around his grounds, for he wanted every

passer-by to share his pleasure in his beau- 
tiful flowers. 
A short distance away was a large public 
school, and many children passed by the gar- 
den daily. These children had not been 
taught, all of them, to reverence Life in all 
its forms. One morning, the gentleman on 
visiting his garden, found his flower-beds 
covered with small footprints, his young 
plants trampled upon, and the flowering 
plants pulled out by the roots, many of 
them left withering and dying in the sun. 
Howdo you think the gentleman felt? How 
would you feel were you in his place? Who 
was guilty of this cruel work? Why did 
these children act so? “They were ignor- 
ant.” Who should have taught them? 
Who is more to blame, the children, or the 
parents and the teacher? Are there gardens 
that you may look at and enjoy on your 
way to school? Will you help the owner by 
loving and protecting his plants? If you do 
what will the effect be upon yourself? How 
will you influence others?

little lessons, convinced you that it is worth 
while to cultivate kindness as a trait of char- 
acter? Do you think a reputation for kind- 
ness is worth having? 
One who loved children wrote: — 
«« There ’s nothing so kingly as kindness: 
And nothing so royal as truth,’ 1 
Let us sum up what we have learned this 
month about kindness. We have learned the 
meaning of kindness: how to be kind at 
home; in school ; in public places ; to animals. 
We have learned the effect upon character 
of kindness, and also, the effect of its oppo- 
site, cruelty. We have learned the value of 
a reputation for kindness, Wesee that kind- 
ness and cruelty are each the expression of 
feeling, and we know that each feeling can be 
changed into its opposite. 
Wesee that changing feelings and thoughts 
must be done by each person for himself: 
another can no more do this for him than 
he can eat, breathe, or sleep for him. 
We see, also, that if we do not begin to

put into practice in our daily life the truth 
we have been learning, the lessons will be of 
little value to us. As one writer says, “Un- 
til made your own and translated into your 
own language, the thoughts of others are 
oftener an injury than a benefit.” 
From what we have heard, we believe it 
is easier to form habits of right thinking in 
youth than to change habits of wrong think- 
ing in age.

  CHAPTER VIII 
SELF-CONTROL 
We shall now have some lessons on a sub- 
ject that is not only beautiful, but most im- 
portant. It is — Self-control. 
Think about this subject. You see it is 
made up of two words. You know what 
“self” means. Who can tell the meaning of 
control? Now, what does the word mean? 
“Self-control means to make your own self 
obey.” That is a very good definition for a 
little boy to think out for himself! 
In the home, who give orders and control 
the household? ‘Our parents.” In the 
school? “ Our teacher.” Is it right that it 
should be so? Are leaders necessary in both 
these places which are so very important to 
you? Could you manage your home? Your 
school? Why not? “We are too young.” 
Should you realize this and be obedient to 
orders both in your home and your school? 
136
-P-A-G-E-143
         SELF-CONTROL 
Some day do you believe you will be able to 
make a home or to teach school? Will you 
like to have your orders obeyed? Even 
now youarea leader and give orders. Where? 
“In our own household.” Who is it that 
gives the orders? “ The real child, the soul.” 
Why does the soul give the orders? “ Be- 
cause the soul is the master.” To whom 
does he give the orders? “‘ He gives them 
to his servants, mind and body.” What de 
your parents and your teacher do when they 
have given orders to you? ‘“ They insist 
upon our obeying them.” Suppose you re- 
fuse to obey? “ They compel us to do so.” 
Is this right? “ Yes.” Suppose your serv- 
ants refuse to obey you, what will you do, 
if you are a good master? 
Where would you place self-control in 
the list of the kinds of thinking? “It be- 
longs under constructive thinking.” What 
would you place opposite? “ Self-indulg- 
ence.” 
How does a self-controlled person speak 
and act? “ Thoughtfully and slowly.” How 
does an uncontrolled person speak and act? 
137
-P-A-G-E-144
      
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
“ Hastily.” The Bible says: “He that is 
soon angry, dealeth foolishly.” 
Is self-control gained easily? Quickly? 
Do you believe it is more difficult for some 
people to gain self-control than others? 
Should this excuse any one from trying? 
What does every person need in cultivating 
self-control? “Patience and perseverance.” 
Should one who is trying to be self- 
controlled, be discouraged if he sometimes 
fails? What should such failures teach him? 
“They should teach him that he needs to 
watch more closely and to try harder.” 
In cultivating self-control, do you think it 
is a good plan totry just one day at a time; 
that is, not to think about yesterday, because 
it has gone; not to think about to-morrow, 
because it has not come? The truth is, that 
all the time any of us have is to-day, and for 
this reason we should try to do the best we 
can with our to-day. You have heard this 
before, but it is well to repeat it that it may 
impress the mind. 
Do you think it is wise to try to overcome 
only one fault at a time?

  SELF-CONTROL 
While it is better and more profitable to 
consider a subject of thought from the con- 
structive side, rather than from the destruct- 
ive, it is sometimes well to depart from this 
rule. We will do this with our present sub- 
ject, considering it first from the destructive 
side in its most common manifestation — 
anger. 
Anger is not only a very disagreeable emo- 
tion to the one that suffers it and to others, 
but a very dangerous one. When matters do 
not go ina way you would like, what feeling 
do you show? “A feeling of impatience.” 
If this feeling is not checked, what will it 
lead to? “ It will lead to anger.” How many 
at some time have been very angry? Every 
hand is raised! Try to recall how you felt 
after your anger had passed. “I felt ashamed 
of myself.” “I had a headache.” “I felt so 
weak, I trembled.” How many have had 
similar feelings? You know then, from your 
own experience, that a fit of anger can not 
only make you sorry and ashamed, but really 
makes you ill. Suppose you were never to 
control your temper, what might be the 
139
-P-A-G-E-146
  ‘CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
effect upon your health? Did you ever hear 
that this very thing has been proved; that 
anger is now known to have a destructive 
effect upon the body? Inquire about this. 
Gather all the information you can, and on 
Friday afternoon, we will hear what you have 
learned. This will be useful and valuable 
information, for you now see how anger has 
at some time made you ill. 
Do you think that anuncontrolled temper 
affects the mind as well as the body? Discuss 
this. What is the result of a lack of self-con- 
trol upon the character? Upon the life? Is 
an uncontrolled temper a menace to its pos- 
sessor? Has a person, in a moment of anger, 
committed an act which has ruined, not only 
his own life, but the lives of others? These 
are all questions to be discussed. 
The Bible says: “ He that is slow to anger 
is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth 
his spirit, than he that taketh a city.” Is it 
agreat thing to take a city? Suppose a gen- 
eral, with his army, captures a city, what is 
he called? “ He iscalled a great hero.” What 
kind of courage has been shown by him and 
140
-P-A-G-E-147
  SELF-CONTROL 
his soldiers? ‘Great_physical courage.” 
Could they at the same time show moral 
courage? “Yes, if they were fighting for a 
principle.” Suppose a person refuses to yield 
to anger, though he is sorely tried and hurt 
by another, what would you call him? “A 
hero.” What kind of courage has he shown? 
“ Moral courage.” You see the Bible con- 
siders moral courage to be greater than phy- 
sical courage. 
We will take some cases, known to be 
true, to show the wisdom of cultivating self- 
control, and the danger of yielding to anger. 
There was once a boy who had not been 
taught to control his temper. One day his 
sister teased him, and he became very angry. 
In his rage, he seized the thing nearest to 
him, the scissors, and flung them at her. As 
she ran from him, she turned, the sharp 
points entered one eye, and the sight was de- 
stroyed forever. The deed took only a few 
moments, but it changed and saddened two 
lives: the sister crippled in sight and disfig- 
ured, and the boy, grieving and unhappy 
141
-P-A-G-E-148
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
because he had injured one whom he loved 
dearly. Do you know any stories of this 
kind? 
It may interest you to hear how one boy 
solved his problem of controlling a quick 
temper. 
This little boy was very ambitious. Do 
you know what it means to be ambitious? 
He wanted to have all his school papers re- 
turned to him every day with perfect marks. 
This was a very good desire. But if a paper 
was returned with a low mark on account of 
mistakes, he always became very angry. His 
face turned red, his lips pouted, he slid down 
in his chair, scraped his feet noisily on the 
floor, and threw angry looks at his teacher 
as though it was her fault that his work was 
not correct. Did you ever see a boy or girl 
in your school act in some such way? Did 
you ever act so yourself? What do you think 
about this boy’s wanting to blame his teacher? 
How do you think teachers feel about such 
conduct? What was the true cause of his 
trouble? ‘“‘ His own carelessness.” 
One day his arithmetic paper was returned 
142 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  SELF-CONTROL 
with a very low mark, perhaps forty. He be- 
came so angry on seeing the mark that he 
used improper language in speaking to his 
teacher. She felt he needed a lesson, so she 
sent him home and told him not to return 
unless accompanied by his father or mother. 
The next morning, the boy returned with 
his father, who felt very sorry that his son 
had behaved so badly. He begged the teacher 
to forgive him and allow him to try again. 
This she was quite willing todo. The father 
then told the teacher the following. He said 
that when he was a very young child, his 
parents died, and he was adopted by relatives. 
He early displayed a violent temper which 
no one taught him to control. When he gave 
way to anger, he was severely punished, but 
he was not shown the evil effects of anger, 
or the danger, both to himself and others, of 
giving way to it. So he grew to be a man 
feeling that it was perfectly right and quite 
proper to be angry when things went wrong. 
He had not been in business very long, 
before he saw that it did not pay to yield to 
a bad temper in dealing with others, and he 
143 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  \ 
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
learned the truth of this through losing sev- 
eral good positions. Slowly he began to ob- 
serve that the man who was cool and self- 
possessed had the advantage over the angry 
man; that the man who could rule himself 
had the respect of others, while the angry 
man called forth only fear, pity, or contempt. 
So he decided that there was nothing for 
him to do but to learn self-control. 
This was no easy task, for there were the 
bad habits of years of wrong thinking to be 
overcome. Having thus suffered from ignor- 
ance, hewas very desirous that his son should 
learn in youth to control his temper, and so 
escape the bitter experiences of his father. 
The teacher was touched by this story 
and it set her to thinking. She loved the 
little boy and wanted to help him, and for 
these reasons she soon thought of a way. 
She recalled a little poem, —“ My Tem- 
per,” — and saw how it could be made to 
serve her purpose. 
When she and the boy were alone after 
school, she said to him, “ How would you 
like to own a beautiful pony?” Of course 
144
-P-A-G-E-151
SELF-CONTROL 
the boy said he would like it very much. 
“ What would you do with him?” “I’d 
drive him.” 
“ Suppose the pony liked to have his own 
way, and wanted to run very fast?” “I’d 
hold the reins tight and make him go the 
way I wanted him to.” “Would you ever 
throw the reins down on his back?”’ “Oh, 
no, I’d never do that!” “Why not?” 
“ He’drun away!” “ What difference would 
it make if he did?”” The boy was astonished 
at the question, and said: “He might run 
into a street car and throw me out and dash 
me against the curbstone and kill me!” 
“What else might happen?” “He might 
run into people and knock them down, and 
smash the carriage to pieces.” “Yes, all 
these dreadful things might happen and you 
would be to blame. Why?” “ Because I 
didn’t hold the reins tight.” The teacher 
continued : “I have often thought that our 
temper is something like a pony. If we con- 
trol it, we are happy ; if we do not control 
it, that is, hold the reins tight, it causes 
dreadful things to happen as in the case of 
145  
-P-A-G-E-152
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
the runaway pony. An uncontrolled temper 
can cause far more damage than an uncon- 
trolled pony. Don’t you think it will help 
you to treat your temper as if it were your 
fiery little pony? When he begins to kick 
and to plunge, and tries to run away, just 
take a good tight hold of the reins and pull 
him down. At first you will no doubt have 
a great deal of trouble with him because you 
have so often thrown the reins down, but if 
you keep on ¢rying, just one day at a time, 
you will conquer and you cannot imagine 
how happy that will make you.” 
The boy seemed pleased with the idea, 
and wisely acted upon his teacher’s advice. 
Often when things did not please him, his 
face would flush, showing that his temper 
was beginning to rise. Then his teacher 
would see his hands go into his desk, he 
would brace his feet, and pull back hard, and 
she knew he was pulling down his refractory 
pony. Soon a smile would appear on the 
flushed little face, and he would go quietly 
to work again. 
He remained five years longer in the 
146
-P-A-G-E-153
          SELF-CONTROL 
school, and the teacher had the pleasure of 
seeing him grow into a fine, manly, self-con- 
trolled pupil, respected by his teachers and 
his classmates. 
Do you think there are any ponies in this 
school that need a tight rein? Can all chil- 
dren cultivate self-control? Do they all need 
it? When is the very best time to learn it? 
“In childhood.” What are the best places? 
“ At home and at school.” 
Do you recall some morning, when on ris- 
ing, you felt cross and irritable? We will hear 
some descriptions of what followed. How 
many have acted in thissame way? Since so 
many have had a similar experience, let us 
trace it from beginning to end. Then if we 
know the cause and change it, the unpleasant 
results will be avoided. It is often stated in 
this way: Destroy the cause, and the effect 
will cease. Let us prove the truth of this. 
When you arose, you say you /fe/t cross: 
you did not try to change this cross feeling; 
then cross thoughts came, many of them, 
‘and you grew crosser and crosser; then some 
147
-P-A-G-E-154
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
one spoke to you, and out came the cross 
words (perhaps to your dear mother) and it 
may be that you were in such a bad temper 
that you struck your little brother or sister. 
How sorry and ashamed you must have felt 
when your anger had passed and you had 
time to think about it. You could not have 
felt really happy that day. 
All who can give the order from feeling 
to expression may raise their hands. Every 
hand is raised! “The order is feeling, 
thought, word, act.” 
In this case, what was the feeling? “It 
was a feeling of impatience and ill-nature.” 
If the feeling is not changed, what kind 
of thoughts always follow? “The thoughts 
are the same kind as the feeling.” In this 
case, what were the thoughts? “ They were 
cross and ill-natured.”” What followed these? 
“Cross words and blows.” Like produces 
like, does it not? You do not go to the 
apple tree to gather peaches. 
Where did your trouble begin? “It be- 
gan in keeping the cross feeling instead of 
driving it away.” 
148 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
SELF-CONTROL 
There. was a little girl who was greatly 
afflicted in this same way by cross feelings 
in the morning. There was some excuse for 
this because she had a weak, sick little body 
that tossed about in the night, and did not 
get the good, refreshing sleep it needed. Do 
you think it is any wonder that the little girl 
awakened in the morning feeling cross, pet- 
ulant and irritable? 
But her good mother knew that these 
cross feelings were not helping her little 
daughter, so she told her to try the follow- 
ing plan. When she awakened in the morn- 
ing, she was to look out of the window at 
the lovely sky, the beautiful old elm tree, 
at the birds that loved to build their nests 
in its branches, and seeing these all happy 
because the new day had come, she was 
to try to be glad, too. She was to turn 
her thoughts to her sweet, peaceful home, 
to her kind parents and friends, and to be 
glad like the birds because of the new day. 
What was her mother teaching her? 
“She was teaching her how to change 
wrong thinking into right thinking.” 
149  
-P-A-G-E-156
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
She was a wise child, and tried to do as 
she was told. She formed the habit of look- 
ing out of the window, instead of at herself. 
She learned to know the birds and to love 
them, she put out crumbs for them, so that 
soon it seemed to her that they knew her, 
and watched for her each morning. She had 
so many pleasant things to think about, 
that she quite forgot to think about herself 
and her ailments, and gradually grew to be a 
patient, cheerful, lovable little invalid until 
her health was finally restored. 
Suppose, when the cross feeling came to 
you, you had been on your guard, had re- 
cognized it and had crowded it out by good 
feelings, by thinking of some one you loved, 
or something pleasant that you wanted to 
have or todo. Suppose you, too, had looked 
out of the window at the birds, the trees, and 
the sky, and had remembered to be pleased, 
what effect do you think such pleasant 
thoughts would have had upon you? Is it 
possible for you to do just what the little 
girl did— that is, to change peevish, irritable 
thoughts into pleasant ones? Are you cross

in the mornings? Do you need to think 
about this? Suppose you are often ill-na- 
tured on rising and do not change, try to 
picture to yourself the kind of person you 
will be ten years from now. 
There was a lady who said she wanted no 
one to speak to her till ten o'clock in 
the morning. She was always silent and 
inclined to be sullen or irritable. She ex- 
cused herself by saying she had always 
been so. How had she formed this 
habit? “No one had taught her to over- 
come such feelings and change them.” Do 
you think this habit of weakly yielding to 
wrong thinking made the household happy? 
How was she reporting herself? “She cared 
more for herself than for others.” “ She was 
selfish.” “ She had not learned self-control.” 
“She did not have regard for the rights of 
others.” 
Would you like to be such a person? 
Need you be? How can you change? Do 
you think there is any reason for you to be 
on your guard? Will you try? When will 
you begin? “ To-morrow morning.” 
151
-P-A-G-E-158
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
You have now learned that it is possible 
to change destructive thinking into construc- 
tive; wrong thinking into right thinking, 
and you have been shown how this may be 
done. By trying to think right, do you be- 
lieve you can form the Aadit of thinking 
right? Will it then be easier to think right 
than wrong? A habit once formed of doing 
a certain task in a certain way makes it easy 
to perform the task in that same way. This 
is just as true of thinking: a habit of think- 
ing in a certain way makes it easy to think 
certain thoughts, and it is very difficult to 
think thoughts of an opposite kind. It is 
not easy to overcome a habit of thought, but 
it is possible. 
Here are some questions on this subject 
of self-control. Think about them, It will 
be most helpful to you in many respects to 
write out the answers. 
Which makes the happier home: the one 
in which all the members of the household

if the father has never learned to control 
his temper? the mother? a child? a serv- 
ant in the house? What do you think 
about your temper— do you rule or are you 
ruled? Are you helping to make your 
parents happy? Are you helping to make 
your home happy? Should it be your plea- 
sure, or your duty, or both, to do your part 
toward the making of a happy home? 
Does a happy home have any influence 
upon other homes in the neighborhood? 
Of what one thing are you all certain? 
“ That we can try.” 
Which pupils help to make a good and 
happy school, those who try to cultivate 
self-control, or those who lose their temper? 
Can you help to make a good school? Do 
you each have a share in the responsibility 
for a good school? Which helps you more, 
a good school or a poor one? Can the 
153

teacher alone make a good school? Can one 
pupil? many pupils? A good school is only 
possible when teacher and pupils work to- 
gether. This means codperation, that is, 
each working for the good of all, and all for 
the good of each. Who supplies the money 
which supports the school? “The public.” 
If the school is good, is public money well- 
spent? If the school is not good, is public 
money wasted? Is it ever right to waste 
money? Do you like to think of yourself as 
one who wastes public money? When you 
are grown and give money, for which you 
may have to labor hard, to support the 
schools, will you like to know that boys and 
girls are wasting it? If you are wasting pub- 
lic money what is the effect upon you, your 
character, your education? Think about 
these things. 
You will be asked frequently how you are 
using school opportunities, for it is import- 
ant to give thought to the matter. 
In a few years, you will be men and wo- 
men, and will be taking your part in public 
affairs, and sharing the responsibility. It is

well sometimes for you to look forward and 
consider what traits of character are desirable 
and what are undesirable. For this reason, 
we will talk about anger and self-control as 
influences in the lives of men and wo- 
men. 
Have men and women in anger destroyed 
the property of another? taken life? Have 
such persons offered, as a plea for mercy, 
the statement that they were so angry as to 
have no realization of what they were doing? 
Hasa guilty person been released from pay- 
ing the penalty attached to a crime on the 
ground that anger caused temporary insan- 
ity? Trace a great river back to its source, 
and what may you find? “A spring from 
which a tiny stream flows.” Trace the anger 
which led to the commission of a crime back 
to its source in childhood. 
Did you ever see a person under the in- 
fluence of great anger? How did that per- 
son look? We will call upon a boy anda 
girl, each to give a description of an angry 
person. How many think these descriptions 
are true? Would you like to look like that

on some occasion when you are grown up? 
Can one who yields to fits of anger, have 
true self-respect? 
Did you ever see your teacher lose her 
temper over a trifle that annoyed her? How 
did she look? Do you think if she had seen 
her reflection in a mirror, she would have 
been pleased? Did you feel like laughing at 
her ridiculous appearance? What did her 
anger tell her pupils? “That she had not 
yet gained self-control.” What else did it 
tell? “It told that the pupils had a poor 
leader.”” Is a person who cannot control 
himself, fit to lead or control others? What 
else did it tell? “She was not fully prepared 
for her work.” Anything more? “She was 
using poor material in the building of her 
character.” How did she speak when angry? 
Do you think she had reason to feel proud 
of her words when her anger had passed ? 
How did she act? Do you think the pun- 
ishment which she meted out in hasty an- 
ger was just? Is such punishment reforma- 
tory? Does it prevent a repetition of the 
156
-P-A-G-E-163
  SELF-CONTROL 
offense? In losing her temper over a trifle, 
did she lose anything else? ‘She lost the 
respect of her pupils.” Can she regain their 
respect? Is it easy? When she went home, 
do you think she felt happy and well after 
her day’s work? Do you think she may 
have complained of a headache, or of being 
very nervous? May she have been sorely 
tried by some unruly pupils? Is having pro- 
vocation an excuse for yielding to anger? 
Is there any temptation to become angry 
when there is no cause for being angry? 
If a teacher blames the pupils for the lack 
of self-control, is this the real cause? What 
is the true cause? “The teacher has been 
harboring angry feelings.” Trace this: Some- 
thing occurs in the schoolroom to annoy 
the teacher; an angry feeling rises within 
her; this feeling is not put out of her mind 
and the orderly procession follows from 
cause to effect: angry thoughts, angry words, 
unjust punishment. Then the real cause of 
the trouble is where? ‘“ Within the teacher 
herself, and not outside.” Show how the 
trouble might have been prevented. “ If the 
157
-P-A-G-E-164
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
teacher had been on her guard, had looked 
to herself instead of the offender, she would 
have recognized the feeling of anger, and 
have curbed it.” Would this have been good 
for her? Why? “She would have grown in 
self-control.” Would it have had a good 
effect upon the offender? What would the 
effect have been upon her character? upon 
her reputation? Would it have paid from a 
business standpoint? Show this. Which has 
the better chance of success, the self-con- 
trolled teacher or the self-indulgent? Can any 
one but the teacher win true success for her- 
self? Why? “It depends upon her charac- 
ter and reputation.” Who builds her charac- 
ter? Who gains her reputation? Do you 
believe a dignified, well-poised, self-con- 
trolled teacher is a power in a school? Do 
pupils respect such a one? Are they willing 
to follow a good leader? Will they yield 
obedience to such a leader? Will they feel 
respect for their leader? Will they be proud 
of their leader? 
Is it possible for a teacher to change a 
disagreeable, unloving and unlovable dis- 
158
-P-A-G-E-165
  SELF-CONTROL 
position into its opposite? “Yes.” What is 
the first step? The first step is to face the 
truth bravely, acknowledge the undesirable 
disposition, and cultivate an earnest desire to 
change it. Second, to guard the feelings, 
above all to cultivate feelings of love, love 
for all pupils, the unlovable as well as the 
lovable. Third, to change destructive think- 
ing into constructive by patient, unwaver- 
ing effort. 
Has a panic ever been averted by a self- 
controlled person? Relate instances. In time 
of great danger has a self-controlled person 
saved human lives? Relate instances. At 
such times, do you believe a person may 
feel well rewarded for all the effort it has 
cost him to develop self-control? Do you 
know of any great men and women, who 
have given evidence of self-control in a re- 
markable degree? Do you think that self- 
control is closely connected with true great- 
ness? 
Learn about as many of these truly great 
people as you can, and we will talk about 
them on Friday afternoon. Their example 
159

tivating self-control.

greater than he that taketh a city?”

    CHAPTER Ix 
OBEDIENCE 
A primary virtue for child or adult, for man or woman, 
is obedience. There is no danger of overestimating its 
importance ; the danger is on the other side. 
Obedience is the basis of all order in the family, in 
the school, in the state, in the church, on earth and in 
heaven. 
It is safety among dangers ; it is the basis of freedom ; 
it is the means of order and of a lovely and noble charac- 
ter. 
Disobedience is the cause of all shame and sorrow; 
obedience, of all honor and joy. — Cuauncy M. Gites, 
  Our subject for this month is a most im- 
portantone. Itis— Obedience. If you think 
of the things you learn in the morning talk, 
and try to put them into practice each day, 
when you have had twenty lessons, you 
will understand the meaning of this word, 
and the use and value of obedience in char- 
acter building. 
You have been practicing it already. You 
161 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
      
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
may have found it very difficult at times to 
do so, because you did not see either reason 
or necessity for obedience, But there is both 
a reason and a necessity, and the purpose of 
our talks will be to prove that this statement 
is true. 
Let us begin at the very beginning, that 
is, with the meaning of the word. Who can 
tell the meaning of obedience? “It means 
to obey.” What does “to obey” mean? 
“To obey means to do what you are told 
to do.” That is a very good definition for 
a little girl to think herself. 
How many have to obey every day, that 
is, have to do certain things which they feel 
they must do? Every one! How many 
find it always easy and pleasant to obey? 
No handsraised!- Does your father or your 
mother ever tell you to do things that you 
do not like to do? Every hand raised! 
How many are ever forbidden to do some- 
thing they want very much to do? Every 
hand raised again! Were you ever punished 
for disobeying when you knew perfectly well 
you were disobeying? Wewill havea few in- 
162
-P-A-G-E-169
         OBEDIENCE 
stances of this kind given and discuss them. 
From all these cases we learn that the pun- 
ishment was given for a certain purpose. 
Was it for the mother’s pleasure? For the 
child’s good? For the child’s safety? In 
all these cases, who caused the unhappiness? 
“The children.” How? “By disobeying.” 
Then, if the children had obeyed, both the 
mother and the children would have been 
happy. 
  Do you believe there are dangers sur- 
rounding children? You may tell some of 
the things you have been warned about. 
You now understand that you are really in 
danger of being injured or even killed, if 
you do not heed what you have been told 
and if you do not obey.- And this is the 
reason your parents have for forbidding cer- 
tain things that to you seem pleasant and 
harmless. 
Are your parents good parents when they 
insist upon your learning to obey? “ They 
are good parents.” What does this teaching 
prove? “It proves that they love us and 
163
-P-A-G-E-170
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
want to protect us from danger.” What do 
you think you ought to do since this is the 
case? ‘‘We should obey them.” Give as 
many reasons for obedience as you can. You 
have thought of many, but these two are 
the best given: “We should obey our 
parents because it makes them happy.” “ We 
should obey our parents for our own 
safety.” 
Let us suppose you are playing with a 
friend, or reading a good story, or are en- 
gaged in something else in which you are 
deeply interested, and your mother calls 
you to assist her, what may you do? “ We 
may obey her, or we may refuse to obey.” 
Suppose you obey, may you do so in two 
ways? Who can tell? That is true. You 
can go at once, cheerfully and pleasantly, 
or you can be sulky and disagreeable. 
Phcebe Cary has written two verses, 
which we will learn, because they are helpful. 
«« If you’re told to do a thing 
And mean to do it really, 
Never let it be by halves ; 
Do it fully, freely. 
164 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  OBEDIENCE 
«« Do not make a poor excuse, 
Waiting, weak, unsteady ; 
All obedience worth the name, 
Must be prompt and ready.’” 
So you see, you should not only obey 
your parents, but you should try always to 
obey promptly and cheerfully. Suppose 
you disobey. Can you feel happy in thus 
considering your own pleasure instead of 
your mother’s? What are you cultivating 
besides disobedience ? “ Selfishness.” Selfish- 
ness and disobedience ! Are these desirable 
traits of character? If your mother inflicts 
some punishment upon you for your diso- 
bedience to insure future obedience, is she 
kind or unkind to you? 
A small child persisted in playing in the 
street on the car tracks after the danger had 
been explained to her. She was punished. 
Was she justly treated? Was the punish- 
ment kind? Discuss this. 
A little boy was told why he was not to 
play with his mother’s sharp-pointed scis- 
sors, and was forbidden to do so. One day 
when his mother was away from home, he 
165
-P-A-G-E-172
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
disobeyed. The result was an accident which 
destroyed the sight of one eye. What does 
this story prove? “The danger of disobedi- 
ence.” Do you know any stories about dis- 
obedient children and what happened to 
them? Any stories about obedient children? 
What do these stories teach you? “They 
teach us that our parents know what is good 
for us, and that we ought to obey them.” 
A little girl once said to her teacher : “ My 
father and mother think that I am getting 
sick. I heard my mother tell my father I 
was getting so good she was afraid I wasn’t 
well.” Guess what kind of child she had 
been. How had she changed? “She was 
trying to obey her mother.” That is true, 
and it was because the teacher had been 
talking to her pupils about obeying their 
parents. It made the little girl think, and 
she realized that she was disobedient and 
selfish. Do you think what her mother said 
made her feel happy? Why? “She was try- 
ing, and it made her happy to know that 
she was succeeding.” Do you think it was 
easy to make the change? What did this 
166
-P-A-G-E-173
  OBEDIENCE 
child prove for herself? “She proved that 
she could change her habit from disobedi- 
ence to obedience.” Are any of you diso- 
bedient at home? Can you change? How? 
“By trying.” When should you begin? 
“To-day.” How will you change? “ By 
trying one day at a time.” 
When you are disobedient, on which side 
of the fence are you— the constructive or 
the destructive? What must you do? Who 
is helped by your climbing over? Will it 
make your parents happy to see you trying 
to change as the little girl did? 
Have you ever obeyed when it was very 
hard for you to do so? Wereyou glad after- 
ward? Did you see that it was better for 
you to have obeyed? Let us hear some ex- 
periences of this kind. Sometimes when you 
have disobeyed have you later seen that you 
were unwise in doing so? Let us have some 
stories of this kind. Since your parents have 
lived so many more years than you, and 
know so much more than you can possibly 
know, don’t you think you will be wise to 
167 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
be guided by them? Did you ever know a 
boy who acted as if he thought he knew 
more than his father or his mother? a girl 
of that kind? What do you think of such 
children? Have you ever had such ideas 
yourself? 
Here are some things in connection with 
this subject of obedience for you to think 
about. Which makes the happier home — 
obedient or disobedient children? Which 
kind of home would you rather have — 
a happy home, or an unhappy home? Can 
each child help to make a happy home? 
How? “ By trying to be obedient.” Is it 
your duty to help in this way? Do you 
love to have your relatives and friends visit 
in your home? Can you add to the pleasure 
of their visit by being obedient? Can dis- 
obedient children prevent the visits of -rel- 
atives and friends? Talk about this. Have 
you ever known such children? What kind 
are you? What are you building day by 
day? “Character.” Which is the better 
building material — obedience or disobedi- 
ence? What are you gaining day by day? 
168
-P-A-G-E-175
  OBEDIENCE 
“A reputation.” Which brings a better 
reputation — obedience or disobedience? 
Which makes you more lovable? Give two 
reasons why you should be obedient in your 
home. “We should be obedient for our 
own good and happiness and for the happi- 
ness of our parents and others.” 
If pupils have learned obedience at home, 
will it be easy for them to obey at school? 
Is it necessary for pupils to obey? We will 
try to prove that it is. 
Suppose each pupil were to whisper, 
laugh, talk out loud, run about the room 
and play whenever he felt inclined to do so, 
what kind of place would the schoolroom 
be? “It would be a place of noise and con- 
fusion.” If there were pupils who wished 
to study, would it be fair to them to permit 
this noise and confusion? What then is a 
necessary rule? “Pupils shall be quiet and 
orderly.” Is this a just rule? Is it made for 
the good of all? Should it be obeyed by all? 
Suppose a pupil feels inclined to whisper 
and to be noisy, but controls himself out 
169 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
of regard for others, what spirit is he culti- 
vating? “A spirit of unselfishness and re- 
gard for the rights of others.” Does an un- 
selfish person win friends? Will such an 
attitude toward others help toward making 
a good character? A good reputation ? 
Suppose a pupil does not care how much 
he annoys his teacher or his classmates, 
what is he cultivating? “ He is cultivating 
selfishness and a disregard for the rights of 
others.”” Whom is he injuring most? Does 
a selfish, self-centered person make and keep 
friends? If such a pupil finds himself un- 
popular, who is to blame? 
Suppose pupils were to come to school 
at any hour they pleased, what would the 
effect upon the school be? Is a rule en- 
suring punctuality necessary? Is it made 
for the good of all? Is it just? Should it 
be obeyed? Will the habit of punctuality 
formed in school days be useful in a business 
career? 
Suppose pupils attended school only when 
they felt inclined to do so, what would be 
the effect upon themselves? Upon the 
170

school? The teacher’s work? Is a rule re- 
quiring regularity in attendance necessary ? 
What do you know about the Truancy 
Law? Discuss it. Is it a just law? Should 
it be enforced ? 
Discuss any other school rules that you 
think are necessary. 
Who has the right to make and enforce 
such laws as are needed to maintain the or- 
der and efficiency of the school? “The 
teacher.” Is the teacher expected to do this? 
If a pupil refuses to yield obedience to just 
rules or laws, what is the duty of the 
teacher? If the teacher insists upon obe- 
dience to just laws made for the good of all, 
even inflicting some punishment to compel 
obedience, would you consider such a onea 
good or a poor teacher? “Such a one is a 
good teacher.” Why? “Because she has 
not only done her duty, but she has held 
the pupil to the performance of his also.” 
By so doing has she helped to train the 
pupil for good citizenship? Is such train- 
ing in harmony with the public school? 
Should such performance of duty increase 
171
-P-A-G-E-178
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
the respect of pupils for their teacher? 
When the word “ punishment” is used, do 
you understand it to mean corporal punish- 
ment? It is said that for every offense, there 
is a corresponding punishment that is re- 
formatory. Do you believe this may be 
true? Which do you think more likely to 
mete out the reformatory punishment, a 
controlled or an uncontrolled teacher? 
Suppose a teacher permits a pupil to be 
disorderly and disobedient to the extent of 
interfering with the good order of the school, 
what is she telling about herself? ‘She is 
telling that she is either weak or indifferent.” 
Can pupils respect such a teacher? If in- 
stead of compelling a disorderly pupil to 
obey just school laws, she succeeds in driv- 
ing him from school, what kind of citizen 
is she helping to make? What is the pur- 
pose of the public schools? “The purpose 
is preparation for good citizenship.” Has 
such a teacher helped or hindered the ful- 
fillment of this purpose? 
Are children alone required to obey?

There are laws of health. If these are 
understood and obeyed, the body is kept in 
a healthful condition: if these laws are not 
understood and obeyed, the body becomes 
diseased. The body requires nourishing 
food, fresh, pure air, exercise, rest and clean- 
liness. If through ignorance, willfulness, or 
inability, the body is poorly nourished, 
breathes foul air, is overtaxed and not kept 
clean, disease results, and at last the life of 
the body is ended. 
Must every one who desires a healthy 
body obey these laws of the body? Must 
your parents obey them? Your teacher? 
Are there laws governing the intellect, or 
mind? Must the mind have good food, be 
kept clean, have a pure mental atmosphere, 
be exercised and rested? Must these de-

eased body? Must every one obey these laws

are disobeyed? Do law-abiding citizens .

the law a terror? Must your parents obey 
these laws? Your teacher? 
Are there laws governing your state? Do 
you know any of these laws? Learn all you

laws. Do you think state laws are necessary? 
Must every citizen of the state obey these 
laws? If a citizen refuses to obey, what 
follows? Must your parents obey? your 
teachers? 
Are there laws governing the nation? Tell 
what you know about any of these. Do you 
believe these laws are necessary? Is disobe-

Above all, there are God’s laws. If we 
try to learn and obey these, it will be easy 
for us to obey all the others. If we disobey 
them, we must pay the penalty in suffering, 
exactly as we do if we disobey the laws of 
body or mind, or civil laws. 
«<2 The law of God is given in a few words: 
“ The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy 
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy 
mind and with all thy strength: this is the 
first commandment. And the second is like, 
namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor 
as thyself. There is none other command- 
ment greater than this. 
So the law of God is love. If one day at 
a time, we try to feel love for God and love 
for those around us, and build truth and 
honor and justice into our character through 
right thinking, we will be living in harmony 
with the law of God. 
What have you learned from our discus- 
sions of this subject of obedience? “We 
have learned that every one must obey or 
175
-P-A-G-E-182
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
pay the penalty in pain and suffering.” 
Haveyoulearnedanything else? “ Every one 
obeys as long as he lives.” This is true, and 
it has been expressed in this way : “ We obey 
from the cradle to the grave.” 
We have been using the word “ must” in 
our talks. Has a person no choice in the 
matter? May he not obey or disobey? “ He 
may choose to obey or to disobey.”’ What 
gives him the power to choose? “He has 
free-will.”” What does free-will mean? “ Free- 
will means the power to choose a course of 
action.” Can another person influence us in 
making a choice? Do you believe one per- 
sof’ can make the choice, the final decision 
for another, any more than he can eat or 
sleep for him? Weill discuss this, for there 
are cases when a person seems to have no 
choice. Can the person give another praise or 
blame for the outcome of his choice or final 
decision? “He cannot.” What prevents? 
“He is responsible for his own choice.”” Do 
“you think there are persons who try to 
attach blame to others for their own unwise 
final decision? Do you ever find yourself 
176 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  OBEDIENCE 
trying to do this—trying to blame your 
mother, or your teacher or your classmates 
for uncomfortable results? How can you 
prove that you make the final decision or 
choice? “ We can prove this by tracing ex- 
periences from the beginning to the end, from 
the cause to the effect or from the effect back 
to the cause.”’ Is it wise to do this? What 
will this develop? “A willingness to blame 
ourself when we are in the wrong, and this 
will develop reason and judgment.” What 
are you as pupils? “ We are young citizens 
preparing for good citizenship.” Can one 
who has never learned the meaning and need 
of obedience, respect and uphold good laws 
or try to change bad ones? Picture the state 
of an army that does not obey the commands 
of its general. What might be expected in 
battle? Try to think of your school as a 
small army, and let each one ask himself or 
herself these questions: Do I obey or diso- 
bey school commands? Am I a good soldier 
’ ora poor one? Am I a law-abiding young 
citizen or a lawless one? Am I helping my- 
self or injuring myself? Am Ia help or a 
177
-P-A-G-E-184
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
hindrance to my school? If I am traveling 
on the wrong path, is it necessary to con- 
tinue? 
Since you now understand that all your 
life you must obey somebody or something, 
do you not think it will be easier if you 
learn to obey when you are young? Must 
you obey everybody? “No.” Whom 
should you obey? “We should obey those 
whose authority over us is rightful author- 
ity.” Suppose one boy orders another boy 
to do what is wrong, should the boy so or- 
dered obey? “No, because the one order- 
ing has no right to command obedience.” 
Suppose the boy ordered obeys, trouble fol- 
lows, and he gives the excuse, “ He made 
me do it”? What do you think of the ex- 
cuse? “It is untrue and cowardly.” Why 
is it untrue? “ Because he himself made the 
final decision.” The boy who ordered him 
may have brought great pressure to bear; he 
may have threatened some physical injury 
for refusal, or to hold him up to the scorn 
of his classmates. ‘Even so, he makes a

choice. He may think it better to obey 
than to endure the threatened punishment 
for refusing.” Why would such an excuse 
be cowardly? “Because he would be trying 
to shirk self-responsibility, by blaming an- 
other.” Is the yielding to wrong-doing 
through the commands or persuasions of 
another, a trifling or a serious matter to the 
one who yields? “It is a serious matter.” 
Explain. “The one who yields in such 
ways is yielding to weakness instead of cul- 
tivating strength of character, is yielding to 
cowardice instead of cultivating the moral 
courage which enables him to say ‘No.’” 
Anything else? “By weakly yielding to 
wrong-doing, he makes it easier to yield 
another time.” Anything else? “He gives 
another power over him for evil.” It is in- 
deed a most serious matter fora boy ora 
girl to allow another boy or girl to rule him 
or her. Such assumed authority has no 
claim to obedience. 
There is one more important point that 
we should talk about. In yielding obe- 
dience, which should control us—the re- 
179
-P-A-G-E-186
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
cognition of the truth that obedience to 
rightful authority is good in itself and in its 
influence and results, or fear of the person 
who commands us? i 
Let us now sum up what we have learned 
from our morning talks this month. 
® We have learned the meaning of obe- 
dience, its necessity in the home; in the 
school. Every one must obey. Obedience 
is from “the cradle to the grave.” Obe- 
dience to rightful authority and to just laws 
brings happiness and true success: disobe- 
dience brings unhappiness and real failure. 
It is the duty of parents to teach and to ex- 
act obedience: those parents who do this are 
wise and kind; those who permit disobe- 
dience are unwise and unkind parents. 
© Each person is responsible for his own 
acts, obedient or disobedient, because he is 
self-responsible and has free-will. Itis cour- 
ageous to face and to bear the results of 
one’s own disobedience; it is cowardly to 
blame another. 
Obedience is excellent material to use in 
building character.

  CHAPTER X 
WORK 
How many know one person who works? 
Every hand raised! Sarah may tell of some 
one who works. “ My father works.” How 
many had the same thought? Name an- 
other. “ My mother works.” How many 
would have given this answer? Name an- 
other worker. “ Our teacher.” Any in this 
room beside your teacher? ‘ We all work.” 
Can you name still another worker in the 
school building? “The principal.” An- 
other? “ The janitor.” 
You have been naming workers in your 
home and your school: you may now name 
as many other workers as you can think of. 
You have done well to think of so many, 
and there are many more if we had time to 
name them. We will reserve this space on 
the blackboard, and make a list of those 
that have been named, and as any pupil 
181 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
thinks of another, let it be added to our 
list. 
What have we learned this morning? 
“We have learned that there are a great 
many workers.” 
For the next few days, you may all look 
around with wide open eyes and see what 
these busy people are doing. Begin with 
your own home: observe the work going 
on in the house, in the garden, etc. Next, 
what you can see in your father’s office, or 
store, or on the farm; next, in the school 
building and in your own schoolroom. 
Begin with the places you know best, 
and as you see a kind of work, write down 
its name, making a list. Ask no one toas- 
sist you in this. Do not compare your lists. 
This is an exercise in observation. What 
others see, will not help your own powers. 
The purpose is to train your eyes really to 
see the things you look at. 
As you walk to school, look about you 
and note what you see. As you walk about 
the city, keep your eyes open and add to 
your list. When you have made as com- 
182
-P-A-G-E-189
  WORK 
plete a list as possible, from what you have 
seen in your home, your school, and your 
city, increase it by learning all you can of 
* the different industries of your state, your 
country and foreign lands. You may refer 
to books or to people for this latter infor- 
mation, as you cannot observe these for your- 
self. The list will thus be the result of 
your own observation and the information 
which you yourself have gathered. 
A little hint may be needed to put you 
on your guard. In making this list, which 
servant will do most of the work? “The 
mind.” He may object, and such thoughts 
as these may come: “This is extra work.” 
“Tam not obliged to make thislist.” “I’ve 
done enough work to-day, and I’m tired.” 
“J’ll begin to-morrow or next day.” If 
these thoughts come to you, and you yield 
to them, will you be the master? 
Some Friday afternoon, we will compare. 
the lists to see who has the longest. Do you 
think these lists may vary greatly in length? 
What will this difference tell us? “It will 
tell us that some pupils have been more in- 
183
-P-A-G-E-190
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
terested in making the list and have worked 
harder.” “It will tell us that some have 
seen more than others.” Who can tell one 
word that means to look at an object very ~ 
closely and. thoughtfully? “To observe.” 
What is this power of observing called? 
“ Observation.” Can it be cultivated? Two 
persons see the same thing; one will tell 
much more of what he has seen than the 
other. Give the cause. ‘“ One has the power 
of observation developed more than an- 
other.” Will the making of this list develop 
observation? Is this power worth develop- 
ing? Wewill discuss this, for it is worthy of 
discussion. 
You are not forbidden to compare lists or 
to copy from each other’s list, you are only 
advised not to do so. If a pupil copies the 
entire list of another, is he doing wrong? 
“Not unless he hands it in as his own mak- 
ing.” Why are you advised not to copy a 
list belonging to another? “ Becauseit is not 
the list itself but the making of the list that 
develops observation.” The pupil who cop- 
ies denies himself a certain development. 
184

-P-A-G-E-191
  WORK 
Is it ever right for one pupil to assist an- 
other with his lessons? Can pupils sometimes 
make difficult points in a lesson clear, or ex- 
plain difficult problems more successfully to 
a classmate than the teacher? Why is this 
true? “ Because these same difficulties may 
have been met and overcome by a pupil, and 
the teacher may not have thought of them.” 
Is it right to give such assistance in an ex- 
amination? “ No, because the teacher is try- 
ing to learn from the pupils whether in- 
structions have been so clearly given that all 
understand, and copied answers are deceiv- 
ing.” Is there any other reason? “The ef- 
fect upon the pupil asking such help. He 
is practicing deception and making it easier 
to deceive another time.” Which is better 
—to be honest and to fail, or to be dishon- 
est and to succeed in deceiving the teacher 
and in securing an undeserved mark? Will 
such an act affect character? Reputation? 
Has one pupil the right to ask another to 
become party to a fraud? Do you see that 
little acts count ? 
In making the list, you are thinking a 
185 
   
-P-A-G-E-192
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
great deal about just one thing — work. 
You hold your mind to this subject. Do 
you find that when you are trying to think 
only about work other thoughts come into 
your mind? How many have had this ex- 
perience? Every hand is raised ! What does 
this teach you? “ That weall have the same 
trouble.” It shows the need of a certain 
kind of control. What kind is needed? 
“Mind control.” This is called, also, men- 
tal control. You have learned that doing the 
same thing many, many times forms what? 
“ Ahabit.” Do you believe that mental con- 
trol can become a habit? This habit can be 
formed, and in the same way as any other. 
There is a name for mind or mental control, 
that is, the power to fix the mind upon a 
certain subject and hold it there. Can any 
one tell us what it is called? It is a long 
word, but not a difficult one if you look at 
it by syllables —con-cen-tra-tion. Few gain 
concentration to a very high degree, because 
it is difficult to cultivate; but it is a most 
valuable mental power to possess, and well 
worthy of all the effort necessary to its attain- 
186
-P-A-G-E-193
  WORK 
ment. So do not be discouraged in your at- 
tempts. You are cultivating concentration 
when you hold your mind fixedly upon the 
lesson you are learning. You are succeeding, 
if you do not notice, or even hear what is 
going on around you. Are there times when 
you can concentrate better than at other 
times? Can some pupils concentrate bet- 
ter than others? Are there pupils whose at- 
tention is called from their lesson by any 
little noise in the schoolroom or outside? 
What are they telling about themselves? 
If you hold your mind to aconsideration 
of this subject, work, what two valuable men- 
tal powers are you developing? “ Observa- 
tion and concentration.” 
From your observation of the many kinds 
of work going on around you, do you think 
work is necessary? Let us try to prove that 
it is. 
What if every person in the world should 
say : “I'll never work again.” The farmer: 
“T’Ilnever plantanother seed.” The miller: 
I'll grind no more grain.” The manufac- 
187
-P-A-G-E-194
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
turer: “Ill make no more cloth.” If your 
father said: “I’ll not do another day’s 
work,” what would happen to the home? 
What if your mother said: “ No more cook- 
ing, sweeping, dusting, making beds, or 
washing dishes, or work of any kind shall be 
done in this house”? ‘ We would starve to 
death!” “We would freeze if we had no 
clothing!” “ The world would come to an 
end.” From these discussions do you real- 
ize that work is a necessity? What other 
very important fact have we learned? “ That 
many different kinds of work are neces- 
sary.” 
Having satisfied ourselves of the truth of 
two great facts concerning our subject, that 
work is necessary and that many kinds of 
work are needed to supply our wants and 
insure our comfort and happiness and even 
maintain our life, let us discuss another ques- 
tion in this connection: Is necessary work 
honorable ? 
Is the washing of dishes honorable work, 
because it is necessary? the cleaning of 
streets? digging sewers? working mines? 
188 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  WORK 
teaching children? preaching sermons? car- 
ing for sick people? 
Work divides itself into two general 
classes. Who can tell what the two are? 
* Work with the hands and work with the 
mind.” This is true, though the man who 
works with his hands uses his mind, also, 
and the one who works with the mind uses 
his hands; in one case the hands do more of 
the work, and in the other the mind. Can 
any one tell what work with the hands is 
called? “ Manual labor.” With the mind? 
“ Mental or intellectual labor.” 
Some people call manual labor degrading 
and are inclined to look down upon manual 
laborers with contempt. What do you think 
of such people? Do you believe they have 
ever concentrated or thought deeply upon 
this subject? Is their thinking either deep 
or true? You must learn to think better 
now, so that when you are grown you will 
not betray such folly and ignorance. 
Try to picture conditions if no dishes 
were washed, no streets cleaned, no sewers 
dug, no coal mined, no manual labor of any 
189
-P-A-G-E-196
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
kind performed. Picture conditions if there 
were no teachers, no doctors, no ministers, 
no lawyers, no authors or writers, no work 
done with the mind. Do the manual labor- 
ers need the mental workers? Do the men- 
tal workers need the manual? 
Try to look at these things wisely, and 
judge justly. Never be guilty of lack of 
respect toward any person on account of his 
or her occupation. It will help to cultivate 
a right attitude of mind, to think of the 
effect upon yourself and others if such work 
were undone. 
But if the kind of work the worker does 
makes no real difference, there is something 
that does count. 
We will discuss this statement: Not kind 
of work but quality counts. Consider this 
and tell what you think itmeans. “It means 
that the way a worker does his work is the 
thing that counts, and not whether he works 
with his hands or his mind.” 
This is true, and we will talk further along 
this line, for there is a great lesson here to 
be learned. © 
190
-P-A-G-E-197
  WORK 
Suppose dishes are to be washed. Think 
of two ways in which this very necessary 
work may be done. We will hear from three 
pupils. How many agree with what has been — 
said? The two ways we decide are these: 
one way is to use plenty of hot water and 
soap, rinse carefully in clear water, wipe 
until dry and shining, and return the dishes 
to their proper places on the pantry shelves. 
And that the work may be really well done, 
the worker must take interest in the work, 
and keep good-natured. 
Another, forced to do this kind of work, 
may indulge in discontented thoughts, com- 
plain of a hard lot, despise the work, use 
cold greasy dish water, unclean towels, and 
heap the dishes in disorder upon the shelves, 
thus making drudgery of necessary work, 
developing slovenliness, and cultivating at 
the same time an irritable and disagreeable 
disposition. Trace the work of two street 
cleaners. Two bookkeepers. Two sales peo- 
ple. Two teachers. 
In all these examples, we see two persons 
engaged in the same kind of work, but 
I9I
-P-A-G-E-198
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
doing their work in a wholly different way 
and in a totally different spirit. In the one 
case, the worker mastered his work; and in 
the other, the work mastered the worker. 
These workers, being engaged in similar 
work, no doubt met with similar expe- 
riences. These experiences were their mate- 
rial for character building. Which built 
wisely ? Which unwisely? Whose was the 
praise for results? Whose the blame? Can 
such unwise builders of character change and 
become wise ones, and that without a change 
of occupation? How can this be done? 
“They can change by changing their feel- 
ing toward their work.” “By cultivating 
love and respect for their work instead of 
hatred and contempt.” “ Filling the mind 
with constructive thinking, instead of de- 
structive.” 
These are all good answers and true ones. 
Is such a change of habit of thought easily 
made? Will it take time? What are always 
needed in changing bad habits of any kind 
into good ones? “Courage, patience, and 
perseverance.” 
192
-P-A-G-E-199
  WORK 
We have been considering work done by 
men and women. Are there other workers? 
“Children work.” Where do they work? 
“ They work in their home.” Tell some of 
the things children do in the home. We 
will take one minute to think, and will have 
each pupil tell one thing that he or she does 
at home that is really work. Try to be ready 
and say what you have to say in as few words 
as possible, that all may be heard from. 
What you have reported is fine and tells a 
story: you, also, get ideas from each other. 
If you are helping your parents in these 
ways, what kind of children are you? “We 
are helpful.”” That is true, but there is 
something more. What feeling prompts you 
to help your parents? “A feeling of love 
for them.” And doing the work about which 
you have told is one way of expressing your 
love. 
How many can remember even one time 
when they gave up their play to help father 
or mother? Every hand raised! That isa 
good report! Did you find it very easy to 
exchange play for work? When one person 
193
-P-A-G-E-200
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
gives up what he likes in order to help an- 
other, what would you decide in regard to 
him? “That he is unselfish.” 
You have been telling how you help your 
parents: does such helpfulness help you in 
any way? “It helps us to be kind, unselfish 
and helpful.” Has it taught you anything? 
“Tt has taught us to work and has shown 
us the right way of doing some things.” 
How did you learn to do this work? “ We 
learned by doing the work ourselves.” How 
do you learn to work your examples? “ By 
working them.” What is the best way to 
learn to do anything? “The best way to 
learn to do anything is to do it ourselves.” 
Suppose you are called upon to do some- 
thing, some kind of work perhaps, that you 
do not like. What should decide you in the 
matter— the dislike, or the feeling that you 
ought to do it? Should you say to yourself, 
“TJ will not do this thing because I do not 
like to do it,” or “I will do this unpleasant 
thing because I ought to do it”? Are you 
sometimes obliged to make this decision at 
home? at school? Which prepares you 
194 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  WORK 
better for business? In the future when you 
take a position, and are told by your em- 
ployer to do a certain piece of work, can 
you tell him that you will not do it because 
the doing of it is unpleasant to you? If you 
did, what might your employer do? Would 
he be justified in his action? In compelling 
yourself at times to give up play for work, 
are you preparing yourself for the future? 
Are other lessons preparing you for your 
future? By compelling yourself to do what 
is distasteful to you, because it is right, 
what are you cultivating? “Self-control.” 
Is this a gain? 
Who can sum up for us what this com- 
mon little everyday happening in home and 
in school can do for us if we meet it in 
the right spirit? “When we give up our 
own pleasure to help another, because we 
ought to do so, we are cultivating kindness, 
unselfishness, and self-control.” Where 
would you place these, under constructive 
or destructive thinking? Probably, you have 
never before thought how helpful a little 
experience of this kind may be. 
195 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
Is it necessary for you to think about 
these things every time you are helpful at 
home? How would it affect you? “We 
would think too much about ourselves.” 
What do we know about people who think 
only of themselves and their own comfort? 
“They are self-centered and become selfish.” 
Is such thinking wholesome? Are such per- 
sons beloved? Suppose in giving up, you 
thought too much about the good effect it 
would have upon you, would such thinking 
be wholesome for you? You see that while 
your conduct was good, your motive was 
selfish. Grown people sometimes perform 
deeds that outwardly seem very good and 
generous, but the motive underneath is self- 
ish. Can you form the habit of helpfulness, 
so that you will naturally do helpful things 
and think little about yourselves in connec- 
tion with them? This is the best way. Do 
not think too much about yourselves. It is 
not good for you to do so. A very little 
time each morning to think what you would 
like to do during the day, and a few minutes 
before you fall asleep in reviewing the day 
196
-P-A-G-E-203
  WORK 
to see how successful you have been, is suf- 
ficient. 
Let us talk about a time when you were 
not helpful, in some such way as follows. 
It is Saturday morning, and you and a 
friend have planned a good time. Your 
mother has planned something different: 
she has some work for you to do; but you 
manage to slip away to your play. How 
many have had an experience of this kind? 
Nearly every hand raised! Can you recall 
how you felt that day? Were you perfectly 
happy, or was there a little uncomfortable 
feeling underneath, when the thought came 
of your mother having to do your work? 
Was your pleasure all you thought it would 
be? 
There is acertain habit you can form which 
will help you to do the safe and right thing 
without thinking about it. How many know 
what this habit is? “The habit of obeying 
at home and at school.” That is a good an- 
swer, but two words added will make it bet- 
ter still. Who can give them? “ Promptly 
and cheerfully.” Now, let us have the 
197"
-P-A-G-E-204
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
complete answer. “The habit of obeying 
promptly and cheerfully.” In childhood, 
who are better judges of what is right and 
best for you, your parents or yourself? 
Have you ever seen children who act as 
if they thought they knew more than their 
parents? Do you admire such? Are you 
inclined to be that kind of child? If you 
are disobedient, what are you telling about 
yourself? Can you change the story? Be 
a brave soldier, make a good fight against 
your fault, and you will surely win. Remem- 
ber always, it is not the result, but the ¢ry- 
ing that is more important. If you try to 
get the one hundred mark in an examina- 
tion and fail, you lose the mark, but you 
cannot lose the strength you have gained 
by trying, and this is of far more value 
than the mark, which will soon be forgotten. 
Try to feel the truth of this. We will speak 
of it from time to time because it is im- 
portant. 
Is the work you are doing in school, ne- 
cessary work? Is it then honorable? Should 
you honor it? 
198
-P-A-G-E-205
  WORK 
In connection with the work of men and 
women, we have discussed this statement: 
Not kind of work, but quality counts. Is this 
true of your work in school? Discuss this. 
Another statement about which we talked: 
Work weil done brings happiness. Notice, it 
does not say work brings happiness, but 
work well done. Is this true of school tasks? 
How many can recall a day in school filled 
from opening to closing with hard work 
well done? Did you not go home, feeling 
happy and satisfied? Did you not have a 
feeling that you had earned your evening’s 
rest and recreation? 
Can you recall another day when you did 
not feel like working, yielded to self-indulg- 
ence, and shirked all your tasks? Did you 
have a sense of satisfaction that made your 
evening very pleasant? 
What are we all doing? “Trying.” Do 
you think there is any one who has only 
perfect days, only happy experiences? If a 
bad day comes, what should it teach us? “It 
should teach us that we need to try a little 
harder.” Is a bad day anything to become 
199 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
greatly excited over, or to grieve about? 
The day has not been as successful as we 
would have liked, so we will try to make to- 
morrow better. Trying is the important thing 
to think about, not accomplishing, though 
that is pleasant and encouraging. 
Is it wise to form the habit of doing our 
work well and not being satisfied with poor 
work? Is it unwise and foolish to form a 
habit of slighting our work? Which helps 
to develop a useful character? Which helps 
more in a business career? 
Can work be done honestly or dishon- 
estly? Do you know the meaning of “eye 
servant”? “ An eye servant is one who only 
works when he is watched.” Are you already 
a worker? Can you be, now, an honest 
worker? A dishonest one? Who decides? 
Which kind are you? Are you on the path 
that leads to business success or failure? If 
you areon the wrong path, can you change? 
Can any one make the change for you? 
We have been talking about children 
who have good parents and homes, and are 
called upon only to do work which they are

not only perfectly able to do, but the doing 
of which helps themselves. Have you ever 
heard older people talking about Child 
Labor? Inquire about this at home this 
evening, and to-morrow morning you may 
tell what you have learned. The informa- 
tion you gain may help you to appreciate 
your home and to be a willing worker there. 
What do you think of people who try 
to improve conditions for abused children? 
Are such people kind or unkind, unselfish 
or selfish? 
Do you think there will be wrong things 
needing to be made right when you are 
grown? Are you getting ready now? Are 
you doing your work at home and at school 
in away that prepares you for good citizen- 
ship? 
Which would you rather do when you are 
grown — help in a good cause or hinder it? 
If you are going to help, do you not believe 
you should begin now to think right and act 
right? Are you now a worker or an idler? 
Is your teacher a worker? Is she doing 
201
-P-A-G-E-208
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
her work well to set you an example? Does 
she make you feel that she loves her work, 
and is glad to teach you how to work? Or, 
does she make you feel that she has no love 
for her work, and is only teaching to earn 
the money she needs? Can you children feel 
your teacher’s thoughts? Do you believe she 
understands this and realizes it? 
Does she impress you as being an honest 
worker, or a dishonest one? If she is honest, 
will she be a great help to you? What if 
she is dishonest? Is she an “eye servant’? 
If so, what is the effect upon herself? 
Do you think she believes — “ Not kind 
of work, but quality counts”? and, “ Work 
well done brings happiness”? 
Can you tell from the way she works, 
whether she is thinking constructive thoughts 
or destructive? Is she a kind, cheerful, un- 
selfish, honest worker, or an unkind, gloomy, 
irritable and selfish worker? Doesshe make 
you happy in school, so that you love to at- 
tend? Does she make you unhappy, so that 
you dislike your school? Is your teacher, 
like yourselves, building character? Is she 
202
-P-A-G-E-209
  WORK 
using her daily experiences in the schoolroom 
for material with which to build, exactly as 
you are using yours? Who does the teach- 
er’s thinking? Who builds the teacher’s 
character? If she is building a fine charac- 
ter, can another claim the credit? If she is 
building a poor, weak character, can she 
really blame any one but herself? Has she 
some lessons to learn every day just as you 
have? 
What do you think of the teacher who 
blames the pupils for a poor school? Dis- 
cuss this. 
Doanimals work? Do they earn their liv- 
ing? We will talk about this and see if they 
can teach us any lessons in industry and fore- 
thought. 
Now, what do you think about this world 
in which you live? Is it not a busy place? 
Is there not a great deal of work to be done? 
Is not everybody dependent on workers? 
You could not be in school this morning 
but for workers. Workers planned and built 
the school building, furnished it, heated it, 
203
-P-A-G-E-210
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
wrote the books you use; workers made your 
clothing, supplied your food, a worker pre- 
pared your breakfast, and a worker teaches 
you. You see how we must all depend on 
each other, for no class of workers could do 
all this necessary work, nor can one worker 
do all the work necessary to supply his own 
needs. Should not this thought of our mu-

that when you have gained sufficient strength 
and knowledge, you will go out to join this 
great army of workers who are supplying 
the world’s needs, and adding to the world’s 
comforts and increasing the happiness of 
the world? Always remember that you are 
a unit in this great army, and to the extent 
and power of one individual, you will do 
your part in making conditions better or 
worse than you find them. 
This month our review will be conducted

you and about which you have thought. 
You may choose a committee to collect these 
papers, and from them make a report of the 
month’s work. 
From the papers collected, the committee 
makes the following report: We have learned 
the meaning of the word, work; the differ- 
ent kinds of work; the necessity for work ; 
we have discussed the following statements 
and believe them to be true: All necessary 
work is honorable; Not kind of work, but 
quality counts; Work well done brings hap- 
piness. We have considered the work of 
grown people; of children; of animals; we 
have discussed Child Labor ; we have learned 
to pity neglected children, and this has in- 
creased our gratitude for kind and intelligent 
parents, a good home and a good school ; we 
have talked about wrongs that have been 
righted by unselfish people; we have dis- 
cussed world’s workers; our part in the 
world’s work. Considering all these things, 
we decide that it is our duty and should be 
our pleasure now to prepare and fit our- 
selves to be world’s workers.

CLEANLINESS OF BODY 
Here is a small bottle. What is its use? 
“It is made to hold liquids.” As you see it 
now, may it be placed in any position? 
“Yes, because it is empty.” I fill it with 
water and turn it slowly downward. What 
do you see? “The water is running out.” 
I put a cork into the bottle, and again tip 
it up. What do you now see? “ The water 
is not running out.” Why does it not flow 
from the bottle? “Because the cork is in 
the bottle.” Who will tell us in a few words 
the two things we have talked about con- 
cerning the bottle? “If a bottle containing 
water is not corked, the water will flow out 
when the bottle is tipped.” “Ifa bottle con- 
taining water is corked, the water cannot 
flow out, no matter how the bottle is tipped.” 
Here is a magnifying-glass which will be 
placed on this table for your use. At any

time during the day that you have a few 
minutes to spare from your lessons, take 
the glass, and examine the skin covering the 
back of your hand and your arm. To-mor- 
row morning, we will hear what the glass 
has shown you. 
What were you asked to do yesterday? 
How many have examined their hands 
through the glass ? Everyone! We will see 
how many have been observing. What did 
you discover? “ The skin is filled with lit- 
tle holes,” How many agree with this an- 
swer? Do you believe that the skin cover- 
ing the entire body is filled with similar 
holes? This is true. These little holes or 
openings are all over the body. Are these 
holes very small? What did you use to en- 
able you to see them? Did they appear to 
be very close together ? 
Doctors and other learned men have made 
a study of the skin, and have written books 
about the things they have discovered ; thus 
people who have not time to give to this 
study may read the books and gain useful 
knowledge.

Do you think the writers of such books 
are workers? They want everybody to share 
the results of their work. Tell some kinds 
of thoughts such workers must have. 
“Thoughts of kindness.” ‘ Unselfish 
thoughts.” “Thoughts of helpfulness.” 
To begin our study of these little holes 
or openings in the skin, we must learn their 
name. We will write the name on the black- 
board and leave it here all day, so Mind will 
learn it, and never forget it. The name is — 
pores. You said the glass told you that the 
holes are very small and very close together. 
How many pores do you think there are in 
the skin covering the whole body? “ One 
hundred.” “One thousand.” “ Ten thou- 
sand.” You can only guess, so we will let 
the learned men tell us about it. They say 
that on some parts of the body, there are 
not far from three thousand of these open- 
ings to the square inch of skin, Of course 
that cannot mean much to you when it is so 
stated; we must try to get a clearer un- 
derstanding. 
Draw a square, measuring one inch on

each side: take a very sharp-pointed pencil, 
and fill the square with dots as close together 
as you can place them. Letthese dots repre- 
sent the pores of the skin. It will be a great 
task to fill a square inch with such dots and 
count them. Who can think of a way to 
shorten the work, and yet get the same an- 
swer? “We can fill only one half of the 
square, and double the number of dots.” 
That is true, and means only one half as 
much work. Can you reduce the work still 
more? How? 
Do you think it will be worth anything 
to you to do this work? “ If we work this 
out for ourselves, we will have to think so 
much about it that we will never forget.” 
“We will understand better how many 
pores there are in the skin.” 
Weare told that the pores are mouths or 
openings of fine tubes with globe-like coils 
at the end. If these tubes are uncoiled, they 
measure about one-tenth ofan inchin length, 
and in diameter about one three-hundredth 
of an inch. Measure an inch on paper and 
divide it into ten equal parts. See how small 
209
-P-A-G-E-216
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
one-tenth of an inch is: now try to imagine 
one three-hundredth of an inch. Do you 
begin to realize how very small these tubes 
are? 
As to the number of them, we are told 
that if all these fine tubes were uncoiled and 
laid end to end, they would measure more 
than three miles. Do you know any place 
that is a mile from the school building? 
Two miles? Three miles? Do you see what 
countless numbers of these tubes there must 
be to reach between two points three miles 
apart? 
‘What have we learned about the pores 
of the skin that we must try always to re- 
member? “ The pores are mouths or open- 
ings of fine tubes.” “The pores are very 
small.” “There are very great numbers of 
them.” “In some parts of the body there 
are more than three thousand to the square 
inch.” 
Why do you think the skin is filled with 
these pores? You do not know. We must 
go to the wise men again and let them tell us. 
210
-P-A-G-E-217
  CLEANLINESS OF BODY 
We have been calling the body a servant, 
and so it is; but it is also called an instru- 
ment, and sometimes it is spoken of asa 
machine. We will talk about it now as if it 
were a machine. 
What does our janitor put into the fur- 
nace to keep us warm? “ He puts in coal.” 
What does he take out of the furnace? 
“ He takes out ashes.” What does the jani- 
tor do with the ashes? ‘‘ He puts them into 
tin cans and they are carted away.” The 
ashes are useless so far as heating the build- 
ing is concerned, are they not? They have 
become waste or useless matter. Suppose 
the janitor kept putting fresh coal into the 
furnace without removing the ashes, the 
waste material? “The furnace would be 
choked with ashes, and the fresh coal would 
not burn.” Then if the ashes are not re- 
moved, the furnace may become useless. 
Now, in a way, the same thing is true of the 
body —the human machine or furnace. 
Waste matter is constantly accumulating in 
the body and must be removed. And one 
of the ways in which it is carried offis through 
211
-P-A-G-E-218
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
these countless millions of fine tubes in the 
skin. 
The pores of the skin are constantly send- 
ing out upon thesurface of the body, a fluid 
that looks like water. It looks like water be- 
cause it really is nearly all water. 1f we think 
about one hundred parts, ninety-eight of the 
parts of this fluid are water, and only two 
parts solid matter; this solid matter is poi- 
sonous matter that must be taken out of the 
body just as the ashes must be taken from 
the furnace. 
Sometimes this watery fluid that is con- 
stantly flowing out through the pores of the 
skin can be seen, and sometimes it cannot. 
When a person is in good health and not 
exercising, it cannot be seen, because as soon 
as it meets the air it is absorbed or evapo- 
rated. But when there is great activity as in 
playing ball, or running a race, or if one is 
overheated, this watery fluid forms in great 
abundance, and appears on the surface of 
the body in small drops. You have all seen 
this and felt it. Who knows what itis? “It 
is sweat.” Yes, but there is another name, 
212
-P-A-G-E-219
CLEANLINESS OF BODY 
Who can give it? “ Perspiration.” That is 
correct. You will find that this is the name 
used by the men who have studied and writ- 
ten about the skin. 
How many have ever heard the word — 
physiology? Do you know what physiology 
teaches? “It teaches all about our body.” 
Do you think it is important to know about 
the body? When you are older, you must 
study physiology, learn all you can about 
the body, and what you can do to keep it 
well and strong. But even now you can un- 
derstand a little of what physiology teaches. 
You know you havea heart. Can you put 
your hand upon your heart? Some put the 
hand over the heart, and others do not have 
it in exactly the right place. It lies toward 
the left side. Watch me, and then place 
your hand on your body just as I place 
mine. That is better. Every one is now 
touching the right place. Do you feel a beat- 
ing under your hand? That is your heart. 
What is it doing? I will tell you. It is 
pumping blood through the body. The 
213 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
heart is a machine. It never stops pump- 
ing; if it stopped we would die. It pumps 
away at night when we are asleep just as it 
does during the day when we can put our 
hand upon it and feel it. 
A writer gives this description of the 
heart: “It is the most wonderful little pump 
in the world. There is no steam engine half 
so clever at its work or so strong. There it 
is in every one of us, beat, beating all day 
and all night, year after year, never stopping, 
like a watch ticking: only it never needs to 
be wound up— God winds it up once for 
all.” * 
The blood is often called a carrier. This 
is because it carries nourishment to every 
part of the body, and also gathers up the 
impurities or waste matter that must be cast 
out. When it starts on its journey through 
the body, its color is a bright, beautiful scar- 
let, and it flows rapidly. On its return it is 
a dark blue color, and it moves slowly: this 
is because it is loaded with impurities on its 
return trip. 
t Dr. John Brown, author of Rab and his Friends. 
214
-P-A-G-E-221
  CLEANLINESS OF BODY 
Physiology describes the wonderful and 
beautiful way in which the blood circulates 
through the body, but we cannot spend 
more time upon the subject now. 
When the blood is returning, loaded with 
waste matter, the perspiration relieves it by 
sending some of the poisonous substances 
through these millions of fine tubes and out 
through the pores to the surface of the body. 
What do you learn from this? “We learn 
the use of the pores.” The perspiration has 
another use. As it evaporates, it passes off 
in a fine vapor which cools the surface of 
the body. 
In hot weather, the action of the perspir- 
ation is greater and the cooling is greater. 
Have you ever suffered from the heat on a 
summer day when the air felt very moist? 
This is because the air is so filled with 
moisture that it does not take up or absorb 
the perspiration forming on the body. 
Have you any idea of the average amount 
of perspiration that is collected in these tiny 
tubes and passed off through the poresin one 
day? 
215
-P-A-G-E-222
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
Of course the quantity varies greatly, ac- 
cording to the temperature, the work a per- 
son is engaged in and other circumstances, 
but in a grown person it averages about two 
pints daily. 
How many have a pint measure at home? 
Measure two pints of water. It will help you 
to realize the work of the pores in sending 
out this quantity of water in tiny drops. 
Try to think of each pore in the skin as 
the neck of a tiny bottle. If this pore is 
open, what follows? “ The perspiration can 
flow out.” What will be carried out of the 
body? “Impure and poisonous matter.” 
If ashes are not removed from the furnace, 
what happens? “ The furnace will become 
clogged and useless.” Suppose this impure 
matter is not removed, what will happen to 
the machine, the body? “It will become 
clogged.” What will this clogging, which 
holds the waste matter in the body, cause ? 
It will cause disease and even death. 
Do you think the necks of the tiny bot- 
tles in the skin can be corked? We will 
216
-P-A-G-E-223
  CLEANLINESS OF BODY 
talk about this, for it is a most important 
subject. 
Before going further with the work of 
the perspiration, it is necessary to learn 
some facts about the skin. 
When the skin is examined under the 
microscope, it is found to consist of two 
layers, an inner and an outer. The inner 
layer is the true skin ; the outer is called the 
scarf-skin. This outer layer or scarf-skin 
is constantly wearing out and rubbing off, 
and new skin is always forming and rising 
up to the surface to take its place. 
The worn-out skin falls from the body 
in the form of very fine scales. Generally 
we do not notice these dead particles, though 
they may be seen on the scalp in the form 
of dandruff. 
If these scales are not removed and the 
perspiration flows out upon them, they are 
moistened and a coatingis formed that covers 
the body. 
Now what happens to the necks of the 
little bottles? “They are corked.” What 
does this closing of the pores mean? “It 
217
-P-A-G-E-224
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
means that the waste and poisonous matter 
cannot be carried off.” What have we said 
about the furnace? “If the ashes are not 
removed, it will become clogged and use- 
less.” Suppose the impure matter is not 
removed from the machine, the body? “It 
will become clogged.” What effect will this 
clogging have upon the body? “It will 
poison it, and it will become diseased.” You 
have undoubtedly heard your parents or the 
family doctor say how necessary it is to 
avoid clogging the pores. A healthy, active 
skin is one of the best safeguards against 
sickness. 
Do you think death could ever result from 
the closing of the pores? Here is a story that 
is often told because it is a remarkable proof 
of death being caused by the closing of the 
pores: “At a celebration in an Italian city, 
some three hundred years ago, a beautiful 
little boy was selected to act the part of an 
angel. To make his appearance as dazzling 
as possible, his entire body, from head to 
foot, was covered with a coating of gold-leaf. 
A few hours after the pageant, the boy be- 
218
-P-A-G-E-225
  CLEANLINESS OF BODY 
came feverish and, in spite of everything 
done to relieve him, rapidly became worse, 
and died in the night. Had it been possible 
to scrub off the layer of gold that closed his 
pores, his life would without doubt have 
been saved. 
We have now learned some very import- 
ant truths about the pores of the skin. Re- 
peat these facts —“‘ The porescan be closed.” 
“ Theclosing of the pores seals the poisons in 
the body, just as a cork seals a bottle.” “The 
closing of the pores causes disease, and even 
death.” 
Naturally now, two questions should be 
asked. Can the pores be kept open? How 
may this be done? 
We will try to find the answers. 
We have learned that if the dead scales 
of the outer skin are not removed, the per- 
spiration flows upon them and a coating is 
formed, which closes the pores. Who can 
suggest something to remove the scales that 
the perspiration may flow freely? “ Water.” 
“Water and soap.” ‘ Hot water and soap.” 
A warm bath with soap is the very best way 
219 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
     
   
                                
            
    
           
      CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
of removing the scales. The water alone is 
not sufficient, for this reason: there are little 
oil-producing glands in the skin, and a por- 
tion of this oily matter passes out upon the 
surface. Water alone will not remove these 
greasy impurities: soap unites with such 
substances, and forms a chemical mixture, 
which is readily taken up by the water, and 
removed from the body. 
There has been one purpose in all these 
talks. How many now see the purpose? 
Every hand is raised. Let us hear what it 
is. “The purpose of the talks is to teach 
us why we should bathe.”” How many agree 
with this answer? That is true: it gives you 
a reason, and it is so much easier to do a 
thing when we see a reason; that is why your 
teacher always gives you a reason for what 
she wishes you to do. She knows it makes 
obedience so much easier for you. 
   How many understand as they never did 
before, the reason and necessity for bathing? 
Since this is true, we must learn all we can 
about bathing. 
220
-P-A-G-E-227
  CLEANLINESS OF BODY 
Dr. Woods Hutchinson says: “ You can 
readily see how necessary for us washing is, 
when you remember the quarts of perspira- 
tion which are poured out upon our skins 
every day, and the oily and other waste mat- 
ters, some of them poisons, which the per- 
spiration leaves upon our skins. Especially 
is some means of washing necessary when 
the free evaporation of perspiration and the 
free breathing of theskin has been interfered 
with by clothing which is water-tight or 
too thick. 
But bathing is of much greater value than 
simply as a means of cleansing. Splashing the 
body with water is the most valuable means 
that we have of toning up and hardening the 
skin, and protecting us against the effects of 
cold. . . . If, by means of daily baths, you 
keep the mesh of blood vessels in your skin 
toned up, vigorous, and elastic, and full of red 
blood, it will do more to keep you in perfect 
health and vigor than almost any other one 
thing, except an abundance of food and 
plenty of fresh air and exercise.” 
Some people can bathe oftener than others: 
221 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
   
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
some are benefited most by cold baths, oth- 
ers by warm baths, and some are so weak 
as to be able seldom to bathe. 
You must each study yourself and try to 
learn just what kind of bath is best for you. 
If you are very strong and vigorous, and 
feel a warm glow after taking a cold bath 
on rising, the cold bath is good for you; if 
you feel chilled, or have a sense of weakness, 
the cold bath is not good for you: you will 
find a warm bath better. The warm or hot 
bath cannot be continued so long or repeated 
so often as the cold bath, because of the 
weakening effect of the unusual heat ap- 
plied to the body. For persons who are 
not very strong, a warm bath, once a week 
is sufficient. 
Some strong persons, who have not the 
luxury of a bath-room, on rising in the morn- 
ing, wring a towel out of cold water, pass it 
rapidly over the surface of the body, and 
then rub vigorously with a coarse dry towel 
until the skin is pink and a warm glow is felt. 
If one is not strong, rubbing with a coarse, 
dry towel will remove the dead scales ; when 
222   
-P-A-G-E-229
  CLEANLINESS OF BODY 
a dry rub is used, only parts of the body 
should be exposed at a time. 
We have learned that the scales are being 
constantly rubbed off the skin. Do you know 
what rubs them off? “ Our clothing.” What 
becomes of these dead scales? “ They remain 
on the clothing.” What does this teach? 
“Our clothing must be changed often.” 
There is something which we will consider 
now, that is quite as necessary to good health 
as bathing: it is exercising the body. 
There is a saying: Use and growth; dis- 
use and decay. 
If you were to have your right arm bound 
tightly to your side and never use it, what 
kind of arm would you have? 
What would you think of a boy or girl 
who never played? 
Do you think it is natural for children to 
want to move about, and to love to play? 
Do you think recess is a good thing? 
When you have had a brisk romp in the 
open air, how do you feel when you return 
to the schoolroom ? 
“We feel warm.” “We perspire.” What 
223
-P-A-G-E-230
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
does this tell? “The pores are open and the 
impurities can flow out.” How is your heart 
affected? “It beats harder.” “It pumps 
faster.” “ The blood circulates more rapidly.” 
What are your lungs filled with? “With 
fresh air.” Is all this good for you? Should 
you study better after playing in the open 
air? 
Is there any danger connected with exer- 
cise? “We can play too hard.” Have you 
ever heard cases of young girls skipping 
rope until the heart was so overtaxed that it 
stopped beating and they dropped dead? 
Here is a rule for exercising. Do not 
walk, run, leap, or play at any games after 
you begin to feel exhausted. 
Immediately after violent exercise, as skat- 
ing, should you sit down to rest and cool 
off? What may happen? “ The perspiration 
is suddenly checked.” You know what that 
means. You may suffer aches and pains 
and say you have taken cold, or there may 
be more serious trouble still. When over- 
heated from violent exercise you should 
cool off gradually.

You see the abuse of a good thing may 
cause it to become an evil. 
Do you know any reasons for a person 
not being cleanly? “He may never have 
learned the danger of allowing the pores to 
become clogged.” “ He may be too lazy to 
bathe.” “ He may not care what other people 
think about him.” 
How can we apply the knowledge we 
have gained to ourselves? Is there any boy 
or girl who now has a reasonable excuse for 
being uncleanly? If one should be so, since 
he does not lack knowledge, what must we 
decide? ‘“ Heiseither lazy or hedoes not care 
what we think of him.” Can we learn this 
without his speakingaword? What will tell? 
“His hands.” “His face.” ‘His teeth.” 
“ His hair.” How will they tell? “They will 
be unclean.”’ Will his clothes tell anything? 
“If they are wrinkled and untidy-looking, we 
know that he steps out of them at night and 
leaves them lying in a heap on the floor, 
instead of shaking out each garment, and 
either hanging it up or laying it neatly over 
225 
 
-P-A-G-E-232

the back of a chair.” What do you think of 
children who make fun of the clothing worn 
by other children? Let us discuss the ques- 
tion, so that children who have done this 
may learn the effect upon themselves and 
upon others. 
Which is a pleasanter companion—a 
person who bathes or one who does not? 
Is there an odor from an unclean body? Is 
this not another way by which Body reports 
that he has a careless and unkind master? 
Which do you think teacher likes to 
have near her—the pupil who is neat and 
clean or the one who is not? Again you see 
how we must always consider others. 
Did you ever know a boy or a girl who 
fairly hated to take a bath? Are you that 
kind? Did you ever know a boy who dashed 
a little water over his hands and face, and 
declared he had washed? Have you ever 
heard a boy insisting that “the dirt would 
not come off” his hands? 
If you have beencarelessin regard to clean- 
liness of body, and care of clothing, do you 
think our morning talks will help to change

-P-A-G-E-233
CLEANLINESS OF BODY 
you? When will you begin? Can all know 
that you are changing? 
If you are very clean and neat, will your 
desk be untidy? Will there be papers lying 
on the floor around your seat? How can 
you help your classmates in this regard? 
“ By setting a good example.” What repu- 
tation will you be gaining? “A reputation 
for cleanliness and neatness.” 
Let us try to picture a person who is the 
opposite—that is, who is unclean and un- 
tidy. How many can make such a mental 
picture? Would you like to be like such a 
person? Who decides what kind you shall 
be? Who makes you the one kind or the 
other? Who deserves the praise if you are 
clean and neat? Who is to blame if you are 
unclean and untidy? 
Here are two sayings which each should 
commit to memory: “ Cleanliness is next to 
godliness,” and “He who keeps his skin 
ruddy and soft, shuts many gates against 
disease.” 
It will be interesting to read, in connection 
with this subject of cleanliness, about the 
227,

Therme, as the baths of Rome were called, 
and their influence upon the nation. Also, 
to read about the epidemics of the middle 
ages —the spotted plague, the black death, 
the sweating sickness, and their cause. 
All the information of this kind that we 
can gain will help to impress us with the 
beauty of cleanliness and the desirability of 
forming the habits of cleanliness in childhood.

CHAPTER XII 
CLEANLINESS OF MIND 
We have spent much time in considering 
the cleanliness of the body because of its 
value and importance and its influence on 
health. We have learned the disastrous ef- 
fects of neglect of the body in respect to 
cleanliness, and the blessings that follow its 
care. We are now to consider cleanliness 
of mind. 
Do you think the minds of some people 
are clean? some unclean? some healthy? 
some unhealthy? This is true. We must 
learn what causes this difference in minds. 
We know that before an act, either good 
or evil, can take place, there must be 
thought; and back of thought is feeling. 
Suppose a person makes up his mind to 
lead a clean, upright honest life, what is 
the first step to be taken? “‘ He must culti- 
vate a love for all that is clean, upright and 
229 
   
-P-A-G-E-236
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
honest.” How can this be done? “By

“ By reading.” “By studying the charac-

Suppose such a person particularly ad- 
mires purity in a character, and longs to 
possess such atrait himself, what is the first 
step? “He must cultivate a love for all that 
is pure and uplifting in its influence.” What 
kind of thoughts will follow? “Pure and 
clean thoughts.” What kind of words? 
“Pure and clean words.” What will his 
acts be? “Clean, upright and honorable.” 
And what character will he possess? “A 
character of purity, honesty and upright- 
ness.” What of his reputation? ‘It will be 
good.” 
Suppose a person allows himself to de- 
velop a love for that which is low and im- 
moral. What kind of thoughts will such a 
one have? “He will have low, immoral and 
therefore unclean thoughts.” What will he 
enjoy talking about? “ Vulgar subjects.” 
Would anything restrain him? “The pre- 
sence of those before whom he would be

What habits would he form? What charac- 
ter would he build? Do you think he would 
always be able to hide his true character? 
In spite of his care, what kind of reputation 
would he win? 
Considering the two persons just de- 
scribed, is the first entitled to the reward of 
a good character? Why? “He earned it.” 
How? “By controlling his mind.” What 
is this an example of? “ Self-control.” Do 
you think his work was easy? 
To whom does the second owe his low, 
vulgar character, and bad reputation? “He 
owes them to himself.” How did he gain 
them? “ He allowed low, unclean, vulgar 
thoughts to remain in his mind instead of 
driving them out.” Can you think of any 
excuse he may have had? “ Perhaps he was 
never taught about right and wrong think- 
ing.” Ifthat is true, should he not be pitied? 
Do you believe that strangers meeting 
these two men for the first time could tell 
pretty nearly by looking at them, what kind

thoughts mark the body. Here is some- 
thing worth committing to memory :— 
“ Thought in the mind has made us.” 
“What we are, by thought was wrought 
and built.” 
Did you ever, when in school, think of a 
promised good time? Did it make it hard 
to sit still and study ? Did you feel as if you 
must run and jump and shout? Happy 
thoughts caused these feelings. 
Did thoughts of a coming examination 
ever make you tremble and feel chilly? Have 
you ever been so frightened that your heart 
seemed to stop beating and you felt ill? 
You may have passed a fine examination, 
and have been frightened by a false alarm. 
Sometimes certain thoughts may so ab- 
sorb the mind, that injury to the body may 
be unnoticed. Such cases are not uncommon 
on battle-fields. Soldiers have been known 
to be seriously injured while engaged in bat- 
tle, and unconscious of the fact until the 
conflict was over. Have you heard or read 
of such cases? Relate them. We frequently

see accounts of similar experiencesamong the 
~ brave firemen or police officers. 
A change of thought, having the mind 
diverted, often causes unconsciousness of 
pain, particularly with children. 
A little girl was once suffering from a se- 
vere toothache. She said it felt as though a 
tiny man were dancing on her tooth, and she 
cried for hours with the pain. After school 
some little friends called to see her, and they 
told her so many interesting things that had 
happened in school, that she was unconscious 
of the pain. Has any one here had such an 
experience? Tell us about it. 
Sometimes sick people are greatly helped 
by acertain medicine because they believe it 
cancure. A doctor, having lost faith in medi- 
cines, gave one of his patients ginger-bread 
pills, and the sick man was helped because 
he thought he was taking his usual remedies. 
Such stories as this help you to realize 
how thoughts affect the body. 
Being convinced that thoughts do mark 
the body, we will talk about the disastrous 
effect of unclean or impure thinking. 
 
-P-A-G-E-240

On which side shall we place clean, pure 
thinking in our list? “On the constructive 
side.” Constructive thinking builds up, so 
we may expect clean thinking to help to 
make a healthy body. 
Ifa person thinks clean, pure thoughts 
how would he be likely to stand? to walk? 
to carry his head? Would his eyes have a 
frank, straightforward expression? What 
kind of voice would he probably have? 
Suppose a person were in the habit of 
thinking unclean and impure thoughts, how 
do youthink he would carry his body ? What 
about his eyes? his voice? 
You must think about this. 
You must not be deceived in this matter, 
for nothing leaves its marks more plainly 
upon the body than wrong thinking. No 
kind of thinking is more destructive to the 
body than the low and ignoble. 
It may help you to know that if you are 
harboring destructive thoughts, thoughtful 
people will knowit. They can read it in the 
expression of your eyes, in the color of your 
skin, in certain marks it puts upon your face 
234 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
CLEANLINESS OF MIND 
and in the movements of your body. Should 
not this make you think? Do you wish to 
build an immoral character, to earn a repu- 
tation for immorality? 
As you do yourown thinking, as you have 
free-will, that is, the power of choice in re- 
gard to your thinking, the matter rests en- 
tirely with you. 
If an unclean thought comes into your 
mind, the only safe thing for you to do is 
to use your will-power and drive it out. 
Think of something beautiful, repeat some- 
thing beautiful that you have learned, think 
of your mother. The unclean thought may 
return, no doubt it will, for sometimes it is 
very hard to get rid of such thoughts ; but if 
you persist in driving them out by filling 
your mind with good thoughts, they will die 
away and so cease to trouble you. 
How can you detect an unclean, harmful 
thought? There is something within each 
person that tells him when he is doing 
right by making him feel happy, and when 
he does wrong by making him feel unhappy. 
235 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
This inner something is called conscience. 
Sometimes we seem to hear it speaking 
within, so it is often spoken of as the “ voice 
of God.” 
In children the conscience is said to be 
tender, that is, it makes itself felt, it is active. 
In older people, who have not listened to 
the promptings of conscience in youth, the 
ear becomes dulled to the voice of this in- 
ner monitor; to such persons wrong seems 
to be right, evil desires seem good. Their 
reason is perverted ; they cannot judge justly. 
Can you give any reason for their state of 
mind? Are they not to be pitied? 
So if an unclean thought comes to you, 
your conscience will tell you, if you listen, 
that such a thought is wrong. Obey con- 
science and rid your mind of it atonce. But 
if you are not perfectly sure, test the thought 
by asking these questions: “‘ Would it make 
my mother happy to know that I am think- 
ing such thoughts?” ‘“ Would my teacher 
enjoy hearing about them?” 
Besides poisoning the mind, unclean 
thoughts weaken it. The more that thoughts 
236 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  CLEANLINESS OF MIND 
of that kind are indulged in the more diffi- 
cult it becomes to fix the mind upon a subject 
and hold it: there is a loss of mental control. 
This reveals itself to the teacher through 
a loss on the part of the pupil of the power 
to prepare lessons. 
Cultivate mental control. 
It will be far easier to do this while you 
are young than to wait till you are grown, 
and perhaps in bitter sorrow learn what 
harm you have done to yourself. 
Many an unhappy person has wished 
that some one had taught him in childhood 
the disastrous consequences of wrong think- 
ing, so that the bad habit need never have 
been formed. 
If you have a companion who tells you 
vulgar stories, or says things to you that 
suggest evil thoughts, shun him, if you can- 
not influence him to change his thinking. 
He will harm you. You cannot afford to 
keep him for a companion and friend. 
We will now sum up what we have 
learned about cleanliness. 
We have learned much about the care of 
237 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
the body: we have learned the importance 
and value of cleanliness in its relation to 
good health; how thoughts affect the mind; 
the good effects of clean thinking; we have 
learned to understand and to value still more 
the power to think; we are glad that we can 
choose how we will think, that is, that we 
have free-will; we see more clearly our 
self-responsibility for right thinking both in 
regard to ourselves and to others.

pain comes on him as comes the wheel the

        CHAPTER XIII 
TRUTHFULNESS 
A crear building is to be erected in a city. 
When completed it will be twenty stories 
high. The principal materials used in its 
construction are stone, iron, and steel. To 
what must the architect and builder give 
much thought? “To the foundation.” 
What kind of foundation does such a 
building require? “A very strong founda- 
tion.” 
Suppose the architect is honest and plans 
well, but the builder is dishonest, uses poor 
materials and does his work badly, what 
may happen? Suppose the builder builds 
well, but the architect has not planned well? 
Suppose both architect and builder are 
dishonest? Suppose architect and builder 
are honest and conscientious in their work? 
Each one of you is both an architect and 
a builder. You plan your own character, 
239
-P-A-G-E-246
   
    CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
that is, you decide what kind of person you 
want to be, and you work out your plan 
by your thinking. Suppose you plan well, 
but build badly: that is, you have a desire 
to become the right sort of person, but you 
do not guard your thinking? You harbor 
wrong thoughts of various kinds, which are 
poor building materials. What will your 
character structure be? Suppose your plan 
is not well and clearly drawn: that is, you 
never have thought much about building 
character, but your thoughts are, in the main, 
good thoughts? Suppose you care neither 
about your thoughts nor their result in char- 
acter? Suppose you know a man ora woman 
whom you admire greatly, and you deter- 
mine to be such a person yourself: to this 
end, you guard your thinking, day by day, 
and try to make it right. What may you 
hope? 
In building character, to what must you 
give thought? “To the foundation.” What 
material would you use for strength? You 
have named many good ones, but not the 
best, which is —truthfulness. A strong and 
240 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  TRUTHFULNESS 
noble character can rest on no other founda- 
tion than truthfulness ; a character resting on 
the weak foundation of untruthfulness must 
go down when a strain is put upon it. 
We will now consider this most important 
subject. 
When children are very young, they often 
tell what seem untruths, but these should 
not be so considered. They are simply mis- 
statements of facts, and the children should 
not be condemned or punished ; they should 
be taught the truth and how to state it cor- 
rectly. 
They have not been long in the world, 
and everything is new and strange to them. 
They have not yet developed reason and 
judgment, and things do not look to them as 
to older people. Sometimes children are so 
intimidated by threats of punishment that 
they will report falsely to escape unpleasant- 
ness ; and sometimes a desire to conciliate or 
to please will lead them into that which in 
older children would be called willful mis- 
representation. 
But you are older, and know well when 
241
-P-A-G-E-248
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
you are telling what is not true. Please be 
frank and truthful now. How many can re- 
call telling an untruth? Every hand is raised! 
This is not surprising; this is an experience 
common to childhood, for you know all 
must learn through living and acting. Try 
to recall the untruth, and tell what led to it. 
““I did something my mother had told me 
not to do,and I was afraid I’d be punished.” 
How many have had a somewhat similar ex- 
perience? Another? “ Once J ran away from 
school, and I told a lie to my teacher.” 
‘What was it that led to the untruth in these 
/ cases? “Fear.” What name is given to a 
person who is afraid? ‘* He is called a cow- 
ard.” Which would you rather be, a brave 
person or a coward? If you want to be brave, 
what is one of the things you must develop? 
“Truthfulness.” What must you avoid? 
“Untruthfulness.” Do you believe courage 
marks the body? Does cowardice leave any 
trace? 
A man tells the following about himself. 
When he was a child, he lived ona farm, and 
242 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
     TRUTHFULNESS 
life was very hard for him. But always, even 
as avery small boy, he hated a lie and would 
not be induced to tell one. He could not 
explain his dislike of lying or account for it. 
His father had a violent temper which he 
had never been taught to control,and when 
the children offended him, he punished them 
unreasonably and cruelly. A younger bro- 
ther was very timid and stood in great fear 
of his father. When the two boys had done 
something mischievous, the younger would 
beg his brother to deny it, in the hope that 
they might escape punishment. This the 
older boy could never be induced to do. 
His hatred of a lie was greater than his fear 
of punishment. This feeling continued with 
him, and increased in strength with the pass- 
ing years. 
He was filled with a great desire to see 
the world, and as his father’s temper did not 
improve, he decided to leave the home made 
so unhappy, and seek his fortune in his own 
way. He wandered far, endured many hard- 
ships but finally located in one of the colo- 
nies and engaged in business. 
243
-P-A-G-E-250
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
He soon learned that it was the custom 
for the merchants to name first to a cus- 
tomer a price higher than they expected to 
receive; of course the customer objected; 
after much dickering a smaller price would 
be agreed upon and the customer would go 
away feeling that he had drivena good bar- 
gain; while the merchant would be equally 
satisfied because he had obtained the price 
he had originally intended to get. To the 
newcomer, this method seemed not only 
foolish and a waste of time, but not straight- 
forward: his love of truth prevented his 
adopting this custom. He resolved to fix 
prices that would yield a fair profit on his 
goods and then to refuse to lower them. 
Business came slowly, but gradually he won 
a reputation for truthfulness and honesty 
that brought him success. It was said of him 
that his word was as good as his note. In 
appearance this man is very erect, looks every 
one frankly in the face, and his whole bear- 
ing is that of a man who respects himself 
and fears no one. 
Contrast this man with the man who has 
244
-P-A-G-E-251
  TRUTHFULNESS 
never valued truth and honesty. Which 
kind would you rather be? You must never 
forget that this is a matter of choice and rests 
with you. There is no better time to lay a 
foundation of truthfulness than the present 
and no better place than this schoolroom. 
Make an earnest effort in this direction. 
You are only children and have much to 
learn; it is to be expected that you will make 
mistakes, and your mistakes may cause an- 
noyance or even serious trouble. If a mat- 
ter is investigated and you are guilty, try to 
show moral courage ; confess, and if a pun- 
ishment is meted out to you, take it bravely. 
Do not forget that you bring to yourself 
your own truerewards or punishments. Gain 
from the experience by letting it serve as a 
lesson. “Success” says a writer, “does not 
consist in never making blunders, but in 
never making the same one twice.” It is 
helpful to believe this. 
Some pupils will find it more difficult than 
others to confess their misconduct, because 
they are more timid, and more sensitive to 
245
-P-A-G-E-252
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
blame. It requires moral courage to confess 
a fault and take the consequences ; but it is 
better to try than not to try. If one fails, 
let us not criticize him; that would be bad 
for all : for the guilty, because such criticism 
would make him angry and resentful, and 
for those criticizing, because criticism is de- 
structive and reacts always upon the one who 
criticizes. Then, too, a critical person, that 
is a person who talks about the failings of 
others, is apt to be so busy with the faults 
of his neighbor that he fails to see the weeds 
in his own garden. The Bible says : “ Judge 
not that ye be not judged. For with what 
judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and 
with what measure ye mete, it shall be meas- 
ured to you again.” This means that to the 
one judging, a return will be made in a weak- 
ening of his own character, What spirit is 
such a one cultivating? “A spirit of fault- 
finding.” Whatkind of thoughtsdevelop this 
spirit? “ Criticizing, fault-finding thoughts.” 
What kind of thinking is it? “ Destructive.” 
Destructive to whom? “ Destructive to the 
thinker.” What is the opposite of fault-find- 
246
-P-A-G-E-253
  TRUTHFULNESS 
ing? “Charity.” Give two reasons why it is 
better to cultivate a spirit of charity than a 
spirit of criticism. “It is good for the thinker 
himself, and helpful to the one thought 
about.” Is not criticism of some sorts a good 
thing? Does your mother ever criticise you? 
your teacher? Compare this with backbiting 
as it is sometimes called. 
Suppose a pupil has formed a habit of 
telling untruths, perhaps through fear, but 
resolves to change. Occasionally, his old 
habit overcomes him, and he resorts to an 
untruth to escape punishment. What should 
be the attitude of others toward him? “We 
should remember that he is trying to change 
a bad habit into a good one. We should not 
criticize him.” Is it easy to do this? Should 
we desire to encourage and help him, rather 
than discourage him ? Suppose you were the 
one trying to overcome a fault, how would 
you like to be treated? Let us speak a little 
further about the tendency to criticize, since 
it is quite a common fault. Do boys and 
girls indulge in critical talk ? Whom do they 
247
-P-A-G-E-254
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
criticize? “Each other.” “The teacher.” 
“Other people.” What do they criticize? 
“ Each other’s clothes.” “ What they say.” 
“The way they walk.” “The way they talk.” 
“The way they look.” Do some make fun 
of others to entertain or amuse their com- 
panions? Would you like to think of your- 
self being used in such a way? Are you 
doing this? Are you forming a habit of crit- 
icizing? If this is true, what is the wise 
thing for you to do? “ Break up the habit 
now.” How can you do this? “ By think- 
_ ing thoughts of charity.” Charity is often 
‘ spoken of as love. Do you see how love 
would help you? “ We do not make fun of 
those we love.” Would you like some one 
to ridicule your parents or your friends, or 
yourself? Here is something else that will 
help you to correct this bad habit if you have 
formed it —The Golden Rule: Do unto 
others as you would that they should do 
unto you. Let us each try, one day ata 
time, to be truthful ourselves and to be 
charitable toward failures in this regard. 
Let us not forget in all this work of

character building that it is well from time 
to time to takea look fifteen or twenty years 
ahead and try to picture ourselves as men 
and women. 
If you form the habit of speaking the 
truth now, will it be easier for you to speak 
the truth to your employer? Will it pay for 
the trouble it costs now? If you cultivate 
charity, will it make you more lovable and 
win friends for you? Will it pay you for pre- 
sent effort? 
In order to be most successful along this 
line what do you think we should first cul- 
tivate? “A love for truth.” How can this 
be done? “By observing truthful people.” 
“By reading about great men and women 
who have lived truthful, honest and honor- 
able lives.” “By contrasting these with the 
lives of noted criminals.” “ Hearing honest 
people spoken of with respect will help us.” 
May not a man be proud to have this re- 
putation: “That man’s word is as good 
as his note”? If you love truth, what kind 
of thoughts will you think? “ Truthful 
thoughts.” What will your words be? your

acts? Do you think your body will give an 
account of you that you will like? Will your 
eyes tell a story? Who.alone can make you 
truthful? 
We will now trace the life of a boy who 
in childhood was not taught the beauty 
and value of truth. This boy, when a mere 
child, begins to tell what is not true. He 
soon learns that by so doing he can escape 
punishment. His parents, through either 
ignorance or indifference, do not correct him 
and teach him. 
Heenters school. Though he is occasion- 
ally detected, in the main, he is able to de- 
ceive, so the habit grows and strengthens. 
He leaves school and obtains a position. 
He pursues the same policy in business as 
at home and in school, and prides himself 
upon the ease with which he can deceive his 
employer and fellow workers. 
His successes embolden him. His em- 
ployer detects him in some flagrant decep- 
tion, and this recalls Jesser offenses of the 
same nature, which he had allowed to pass 
250
-P-A-G-E-257
TRUTHFULNESS 
  unnoticed. He decides that the boy is un- 
reliable and untrustworthy and discharges 
him. The boy cannot ask for a recommen- 
dation, and has difficulty in securing another 
position. He is finally successful in finding 
a place ; but since he sees no need of correct- 
ing himself, he pursues the same course and 
it is attended by the same result. This con- 
tinues, until he has established a reputation 
that makes it impossible for him to secure 
a position. He tries a change of place, but 
as there is no change in himself, his experi- 
ences are repeated. And so he drifts. He 
talks loudly about hard luck. He contrasts 
his failure with the success of others, and 
blames his parents, his employers — every- 
body but himself. 
Would you call it luck, or the action of 
the law of cause and effect? Could the habit 
have easily been corrected in childhood? 
Could it have been broken in manhood? 
How? Would this have been easy? Is such 
a one as we have described to be pitied or 
condemned? Do you think if he had been 
taught what habits are, how they are formed,

-P-A-G-E-258
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
what character is, that his life might have 
been wholly different? You are being taught. 
Do you feel the importance of putting into 
practice now what you are learning? 
  Is it possible to be untruthful without 
speaking? 
A test is given in some study. A pupil 
receives assistance from a classmate. His 
paper is returned marked perfect. Has he 
been truthful with his teacher? What is the 
true reward of the test? What was the na- 
ture of his act? What habit did his act help 
to form? Will it be easier for such a pupil 
to deceive again? Does it pay? There are 
pupils who think lightly of such deceptions, 
They call it shrewdness and feel proud of 
their success in deceiving. It is evident they 
have not considered the question from the 
true standpoint, which is character, and they 
do not realize that the true purpose of life 
with its varied experiences is the building 
of character. 
If a person tells a lie and is not detected, 
can any harm cometo him? “ The real harm

an untruthful person to deceive in a way 
that will enable him to pass for an honest, 
upright man? Will such a reputation en- 
dure? Ifa truthful person is falsely accused 
and doubted, do you think his good char- 
acter will in time restore to him his good 
reputation? 
Do you think your teacher loves truth? 
How does her body report? Are her eyes 
frank and honest in expression? Has she 
ever told youan untruth? In order to teach 
you to love and respect and cultivate truth- 
fulness what must she possess? “Love, re- 
spect and reverence for truth.” Is it possi- 
ble for her to teach you without such love 
and respect? Would it not be hypocrisy, 
which is one kind of deception? Would 
you not in time feel this falseness in her? 
Can pupils respect such a teacher? Whom 
is she injuring more — herself or her pupils? 
Which has the greater influence over pupils, 
a teacher’s truthful words, or the life of 
truthfulness she is living day by day?

Do teachers and parents ever tell children 
what is not true? How are the children af- 
fected? Here are two true stories. 
A teacher once told an untruth to the 
principal in the presence of a few pupils, 
who had been detained after school. The 
principal knew that the thing told was un- 
true, and the pupils knew it also. They all 
looked greatly shocked at their teacher’s 
statement, some even turned pale. Do you 
think the teacher received her reward right 
there? What was it? “It was the loss of 
the respect and confidence of her pupils.” 
Who was to blame? Later, this teacher was 
dismissed. She blamed everybody but her- 
self. Do you believe she was right in this? 
One morning a kindergarten teacher 
observed that one of her little pupils seemed 
greatly distressed. On inquiring as to the 
cause, the child said his mother was going 
to the fair, and she had told him that she 
would be gone two days; but that if he 
teased his little sister, which he was in the 
habit of doing, she would not come back in two 
days: she would never come back. Just as 
254
-P-A-G-E-261
  TRUTHFULNESS 
his mother was leaving the house, he forgot 
and teased his sister and made her cry, and 
he said, “She’s gone and she’ll never come 
back.” 
His teacher tried to console him, but he 
refused to be comforted. He kept saying, 
“But she said she would never come back,” 
showing hisabsolute confidence in his mother. 
He would not enter into the games with 
the other children, and wasa sad little figure 
in the schoolroom for two days. The third 
morning he appeared with a hard look on 
his little face, and in answer to his teacher’s 
inquiry as to his mother’s return he said, 
“Oh, she came back last night all right. You 
see, she lied.” 
Balzac, a great writer and one who under- 
stood human nature, says: “ One single lie 
destroys the confidence which to some souls 
is the very foundation of happiness.” 
Another writer says: “No pleasure is 
comparable to the standing on the vantage 
ground of truth.” And Abraham Lincoln 
says: “I am not bound to win, but I am 
bound to be true.”

We will write these sayings on the black- 
board ; all think about them, and on Friday 
afternoon we will exchange our thoughts 
about them. 
When great and good men express a re- 
verence for truth, may we not safely be in- 
fluenced by their words, and the example 
of their lives? 
Suppose you had a friend in whom you 
had the greatest confidence and he told you 
a lie, how would it affect you? Reverse it. 
Suppose your friend had perfect confidence 
in you, and you deceived him? Is the loss 
of a true friend a great los? 
Count the cost always. Which will pay 
you better in character and in reputation, 
to cultivate a love of truth and develop 
moral courage, or to develop untruthfulness ? 
Can any one do this for you? Which do 
you choose? Decide now and begin to work 
now.

CHAPTER XIV 
LOYALTY: PATRIOTISM 
  Can any one tell what it means to be loyal? 
“Tt means to be true.” What does it mean 
to be disloyal? “It means to be untrue, or 
false.” Can you be loyal to your parents? 
How? “ When we love them, we are loyal.” 
“When we respect and obey them.” Will 
* loyalty make you think well of your parents? 
speak well of them? Will you permit any 
one to speak disrespectfully of your parents? 
When you see all they are trying to do 
for you, often denying themselves for your 
sake, can you help loving them, and being 
true and therefore loyal to them? How can 
you prove your loyalty to your home? “ By 
loving and respecting it.” Suppose that it 
is a very humble home, but the best your 
parents can provide: should you love it and 
respect it the same as if it were a costly man- 
sion? Inwhat other way can you prove your 
257
-P-A-G-E-264
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
  loyalty to your home? “ If we are loyal, we 
will do our part to make it a good and true 
home.” “ We will not permit any one to be- 
little it or to speak ill of it.” 
How will you show your loyalty to your 
friends? ‘ By loving and respecting them.” 
“We will not allow others to speak falsely 
of them in our presence.” “ We will not talk 
about their faults to others.” What would 
that be doing? “It would be criticizing.” 
Can you be loyal to your school? How? 
“ By loving and respecting it for the advan- 
tages it offers us.” “ We will prove our loy- 
alty to our school if, in every way we can, we 
help to make it a good school.” “We will 
defend it if it is unjustly criticized.” 
Can you be loyal to your teachers? to 
your city? to your country? How? “We 
will love our country.” “We will wish 
ours to be the best and the greatest nation 
on earth.” “We will do our very best to 
help.” How? “Wewill begin now to build 
a true and noble character that we may be 
true and good citizens.” “We will defend 
our nation when there is a need for defense.” 
258 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
LOYALTY: PATRIOTISM 
  “ Weill not permit any one to speak slight- 
ingly or unjustly of our nation, without our- 
selves speaking in defense of it.” 
How can you be loyal to your creator 
God? ‘‘ We can love and reverence Him 
for all His goodness to us.” “ We can prove 
our loyalty by making good use of what He 
has given us.”” How can you prove this here 
in the schoolroom ? “ By doing all we can to 
take good care of our minds and bodies, that 
they may be healthy and strong.” “ We 
will permit no one to speak irreverently of 
God in our presence.” 
Do you think loyalty is good material to 
use in character building ? Do you know of 
any great men and women who have been 
loyal to their country ? 
How would you like to select a commit- 
tee of four, two boys and two girls, to pre- 
_ pare a little program, for Friday afternoon ? 
The main part of the program will consist 
of stories of the lives of four great men and 
women, living or dead, who proved or are 
proving their loyalty and devotion to their 
country. The committee may add music and 
259
-P-A-G-E-266
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
a recitation or two. Don’t you think it will 
increase our pleasure to share it? How 
would you like to invite our neighbors across 
the hall? You may select a pupil to see the 
principal and gain permission to extend the 
invitation. It will be having a party in our 
school home, and each will be a host or host- 
ess and must see that our guests enjoy them- 
selves. 
What is the opposite of loyalty ? “ Dis- 
loyalty.” Can a boy or a girl be disloyal 
to parents? How? “By not loving and 
respecting them.” Do you know any chil- 
dren who are impudent and insolent to their 
parents ? Many hands raised. What do you 
think of such children? Do you admire 
them? It is to be hoped we have none of 
that kind in our school. 
How can children be disloyal to their 
home? to their school? to their teacher? 
Are children sometimes disloyal to the friends 
whom they profess to love? How? “They 
listen to unkind or false remarks about their 
friends and do not speak in their defense. 
They themselves will even talk about the 
260
-P-A-G-E-267
        LOYALTY: PATRIOTISM 
faults of their friends.’ What have we 
learned to call talk of this kind? “It is crit- 
icism.” If the one talked about is true and 
noble, can unjust criticism do him great or 
lasting injury? Disloyalty and unjust criti- 
cism are close friends. The-person who in- 
dulges in the one, invites the other. 
Can a person be disloyal to his country? 
How many know what name is given to 
such a person? “ He is called a traitor.” 
Have you heard of such a character in his- 
tory? Is the word traitor a term of great re- 
proach in the estimation of people? Should 
one who has earned the title be more pitied 
than condemned ? 
Is the real child helped by cultivating loy- 
alty? Does this react with good effect upon 
mind and body? Is it a trait of character 
worthy of love, admiration and effort? Will 
you each try to be loyal to parents, home, 
school, country, and God? 
Is the real child hurt by disloyalty? Is 
it a trait of character to be shunned and 
despised? If you observe in yourself a dis- 
position to find fault with your parents, 
261 
     
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
home, teacher, or friends, of what is it the 
sign? “It is the sign of disloyalty.” On 
which side of the fence are you? What must 
you do? How can you do this? “ By chang- 
ing feelings and thoughts from disloyal to 
loyal ones.” May this be difficult? Will 
that be a reason for giving up? How can 
you conquer ? “ By persistence and determ- 
ination to succeed.” Say to yourself with 
great emphasis, not once, but many times: 
I can and I will, Will it be easier to break 
up the habit now or when you are grown? 
Again, look forward twenty years. Which 
pleases you more, to see yourself a loyal 
man or woman, ora disloyal one? Remem- 
ber you decide this ; you can make yourself 
what you wish to be by your power to think. 
Can a teacher be loyal? disloyal? If a 
teacher talks unkindly about her pupils to 
others, is she loyal? If she helps her pupils 
to grow in right ways by setting them a good 
example is she loyal and true to the school? 
If a teacher,on promoting a class, gives a 
bad report of some pupils to the receiving 
262 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
LOYALTY: PATRIOTISM 
  teacher, and so prejudices her against these 
pupils, what would you think about her? 
What might be the effect if the pupils had 
resolved to try todo better? Woulda teacher 
who was disloyal to her pupils, be loyal to 
others? to her fellow teachers? her princi- 
pal? her superintendent? If a teacher is 
loyal, what kind of thoughts is she holding? 
“She is holding kind and helpful thoughts 
toward all.” What kind of thinking is this? 
“Tt is constructive thinking.” Whom is she 
helping most? “She is helping herself 
most.” How? “She is using good building 
materials.” 
Our study of loyalty prepares us to con- 
sider another subject closely related to it: 
that is Patriotism. 
What do we mean by patriotism? “ Pa- 
triotism is love of country.”’ Who is a pa-' 
triot? “A patriot is a man or woman, boy 
or girl, who loves his country.” Is a patriot 
a good citizen? Isa good citizen a patriot? 
Can the two be separated ? If you are try- 
ing now to be good young citizens of the 
263
-P-A-G-E-270
CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
  United States, what are you at the same 
time cultivating? “We are cultivating pa- 
triotism.” 
In the beautiful flag salute: “I give my 
head and my heart to God and my coun- 
try; one country, one language, and one 
flag,” what is meant by “I give my head”? 
“I give my heart”? What is meant by 
“one country, one language, one flag”? 
Are there patriots in the country to-day? 
Ask your parents to tell you about some 
citizens, men and women, who are proving 
their loyalty to their country. Do you be- 
lieve there are any traitors? 
Do you know the cost of the ground 
upon which this school building stands? 
Inquire at home. Do you know the cost 
of the school building? Inquire. Try to 
gain information in regard to the following: 
amount paid in salaries; cost of books and 
_school supplies ; cost of fuel. This will give 
us some idea of the money expended in 
building, equipping, and maintaining our 
school. Multiply this by the number of 
schools in the city. Then think about the 
264
-P-A-G-E-271
LOYALTY: PATRIOTISM 
  schools throughout the country, and you 
will have some understanding of the vast 
sums of money expended for public instruc- 
tion. 
How is this money obtained? “From 
the Board of Education.” “Rich men build 
the schools.” You are guessing. “From 
taxes.” That is the correct answer. Who 
pays taxes? “The owners of property.” 
Do they pay taxes because they choose to 
pay them or because they are compelled by 
Jaw? Ifa citizen refuses to obey, is he pun- 
ished in any way? Do you think such a law 
is just? 
Why are owners of property compelled 
by law to contribute toward the support of 
the public schools? ‘So all the children 
may have an education.” Why are thought- 
ful people willing to support public schools? 
Tell what you think about this. Do not 
be afraid to express your opinions. “If 
people are ignorant, it is hard for them to 
earn a living.” ‘If they can’t earn their 
living, they will beg, or steal, or even kill 
people to get their money.” “If they steal 
265
-P-A-G-E-272
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
and kill, they must be locked up in jails and 
penitentiaries.” “It costs a great deal of 
money to build jails and penitentiaries.” 
This is all very true and proves that you 
are thinking. Something like this is said: 
It costs less to build schools and teach chil- 
dren how to take care of themselves, than 
to neglect them and be forced to build jails 
and penitentiaries. 
You may now tell the purpose of the 
public schools. ‘To educate the children.” 
Are they for all children, the rich and the 
pooralike? If there were no public schools, 
would many children be deprived of the 
opportunity of gaining an education? Do 
you think there are places where this is the 
case? ‘This is true and the children are 
growing up in ignorance. 
What is the purpose of this public in- 
struction, which is often spoken of as pop- 
ular education? These are good answers, 
but not the true one. “The purpose of 
the public schools is the making of good 
citizens.” 
Who is a good citizen? Should a good 
266
-P-A-G-E-273
LOYALTY: PATRIOTISM 
  citizen be strong and healthy? Should a 
good citizen have a healthy, well-trained 
mind? Should he be developed morally 
and spiritually? What do you think of 
this summing up: The purpose of popu- 
lar education is the training for good citi- 
zenship ; a good citizen is one who is trained 
and developed in his whole being — body, 
mind, soul? 
Are children expected to make any return 
for the educational advantages offered them? 
They cannot earn money and pay taxes, 
but what can they do? “They can learn 
to be good citizens.’ How can they do 
this? ‘By trying to do the best they can 
each day.” Ifa pupil is idle and disobe- 
dient, is he making a fair return? What 
about the industrious and obedient pupil ? 
‘When you are grown up, and are paying 
taxes, will you like to think the money you 
work hard to earn is being wasted by pupils 
who are shirking their tasks at school? How 
do you think those who are now paying 
taxes feel about this? 
Do you think there are grown people 
267
-P-A-G-E-274
  CHARACTER BUILDING IN SCHOOL 
who ‘had opportunities for obtaining an 
education, but who did not appreciate the 
advantages offered them? Do you think 
they see their mistake and regret it? There 
are such; and if you are inclined to be idle 
and indifferent, you may well learn a lesson 
from these unwise persons. 
Be loyal, be patriotic. Be appreciative of 
what your country offers you. Take advan- 
tage of your opportunities. Make of your- 
selves good citizens, that you may help to 
make your country the best and greatest 
nation on earth.

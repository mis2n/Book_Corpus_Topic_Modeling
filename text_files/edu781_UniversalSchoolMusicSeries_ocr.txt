FOREWORD 
Tus editors of these books realize that very few children become 
professional musicians. For the great majority, music study is to be 
justified primarily as an important factor in making human life more 
satisfying. Music is taught for the sake of the joy and satisfaction 
which it brings into the lives of the many; not merely as a means of 
enabling the few to receive professional training. A series of books 
to be used by all the children of all the people must therefore stress that 
side of music which results immediately in esthetic pleasure rather than 
that which concerns itself only with elaborate technical training in 
preparation for future achievements and enjoyments. In short, we 
must give the children, abundantly, while they are still in school, the 
joyful experience of hearing and sharing in the rendition of beautiful 
music. Accordingly we have emphasized, throughout the series, song- 
singing and listening lessons, with “music appreciation” as the general 
objective. The abundance of music of high quality which these books 
contain is perhaps their most: distinctive feature, and we hope that 
through singing this music our children will come to love music 
because it is beautiful, satisfying, and exalting. In thus learning to 
appreciate and to love beautiful music, we believe that our boys and 
girls will be inclined to observe and to acquire a taste for all beauty. 
Such stimulation of the children’s esthetic instincts will in turn tend to 
enrich, refine, and ennoble their entire lives, thus amply justifying the 
time devoted to music.

TO THE TEACHER 
Tur editors believe that they have provided in this series the means by which 
music-teaching in the schools may fulfil its proper function. But to make success 
certain it will be necessary that you, the teacher, read, digest, and put into practice 
all the directions and suggestions given in this book. The entire procedure follows a 
definite plan built upon a basis composed of the following fundamental principles 
and suggestions. 
1. The most valuable activity in school music is the singing of many beautiful 
songs, with good tone, and in an attitude of thoughtfulness toward the words. A well- 
played accompaniment adds greatly to the interest of such singing. An easily erect 
posture is an aid in securing good tone quality. 
2. Sight-singing and its allied activities are important because they give the pupil 
a tool by means of which he is able to get at music from which he would otherwise be 
shut out. And yet these things are not so important as song-singing; therefore they 
should not be given so large a proportion of time that song-singing is crowded out. 
The thing which counts for most in sight-singing is intense concentration, and without 
this very little will be accomplished. To acquire skill in singing music at sight, one 
must (1) drill on intervals “by sight and by sound” (do-mi-so; do-so-mi, etc.); (2) be- 
come familiar with the effect and the notation of the rhythmic figures most commonly 
encountered (Fa, d. é J. 3 ITs ete.) ; (8) be given actual practice in singing a 
— 
great deal of comparatively easy music, without too much stopping and too much inter- 
ruption from the teacher, and without any help from either the teacher’s voice or the 
piano; (4) form the habit of constantly looking ahead, thus training the eye to take 
in groups of notes instead of individual notes. 
3. Theoretical facts are of value only as they apply to sight-singing or to general 
musical intelligence. Any fact about music that does not clearly come under one or the 
other of these classes is not necessary so far as school music is concerned. We emphasize 
this not because we regard theory as unimportant, but because in so many instances 
theory-teaching and sight-singing have together taken so large a proportion of the 
time allotted to music that the more important song-singing has actually been relegated 
to third place, and skimped accordingly. 
4. Listening lessons constitute an indispensable element in musical education, 
and are not to be considered a waste of time nor simply as another kind of amusement. 
Always use good music for the listening lesson, have it as well rendered as possible, and 
see to it that both teacher and children listen quietly, attentively, and thoughtfully.

  THE UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES 
PART I 
GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS 
I. Music as A Scuoou SupsEctT 
Music is one of the most valuable subjects in the school curriculum, and the influence 
of music in the lives of both children and adults is more potent than that of almost any 
other educational activity. Music affects human beings favorably, both in their intel- 
- lectual and emotional lives. Because of its power to “tone up” both mind and body, 
> its beneficial effect in causing increased quickness of perception, its potency to socialize, 
| its possibilities in preparing one for a worthy use of leisure time, and, above all, because 
of its influence in causing an immeasurable increase in human happiness—for all these 
reasons, music has come to be more and more commonly regarded as an indispensable 
subject in all types of schools; and a larger and larger place is being accorded it. 
In the individual schoolroom the teacher is to approach the children’s musical 
activities from two standpoints: 
1. The work lesson, during which certain ground is to be covered, certain problems 
mastered, certain musical effects listened to; and during which both teacher and pupil 
shall bring to bear upon the task the keenest concentration of which they are capable. 
2. The recreational music period, during which everyone will sing favorite songs, 
hear phonograph selections, or listen to vocal or instrumental solos. 
During the first-named type of musical activity—the work lesson—the pupil is to 
acquire the technique which will make the second type—the recreational—more and 
more enjoyable as he goes on through the grades. Such is the primary function of the 
work lesson, but be it noted that such an exercise has a valuable by-product in the 
form of mental training. Indeed, music is as valuable for mental training as any 
other subject in the curriculum. The teacher will find that the prosecution of musical 
activity in this manner requires application as intensive as any other work that the 
pupil will do in all his life; and the formal music period should, therefore, be placed on 
the day’s program at an hour when the pupils’ minds are alert. 
The recreational music period is usually short, and properly follows a peried of 
intense work on arithmetic or some other taxing.subject. It is informal and friendly, 
and one of its chief values is that it makes the entire school happier and therefore affects
-P-A-G-E-11
2 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
the discipline favorably; it also unifies the sentiment of the room and intensifies group 
feeling; and it relaxes both mind and body, besides making easier for both teacher and 
children a zestful attack upon the next job in the day’s work. The wise teacher knows 
that both time and nerves are conserved by a few minutes of recreational music two or 
three times daily, entirely apart from the formal music period. 
II. Poms Apriyine to Att Grapes 
1. Community Songs. One of the most noticeable shortcomings of our American 
social life has been our inability to engage in satisfactory song-singing at social or other | 
gatherings. Perhaps the chief reason for this deficiency is that few of us know the 
words of our songs. It is our aim to meet this need at least partially, by suggesting 
that all children in the public schools commit to memory each year the words of two 
or three well-known songs. The words of these songs are then to be reviewed each 
succeeding year and sung at frequent intervals, so that by the end of the eighth year 
each pupil should be able to sing from memory fifteen or twenty songs suitable for 
group-singing. In order to distinguish this material from the rest these songs will 
be referred to in this series as “patriotic and home songs,” and every’ grade teacher is © 
urged not only to see that each child shall learn the words of the songs designated 
for the current grade (this, in general, to be done as part of the required language work, 
and outside of the formal music period), but also to see that the songs taught in preceding 
years shall be reviewed from time to time throughout the year, and thus kept in 
repertoire. 
Because of the adult character of these songs, this work is naturally less important 
in the lower than in the higher grades; but it is cumulative in value in the pupils’ 
progress from grade to grade, and if the plan of reviewing all previously learned songs 
is consistently carried out from year to year, this activity may be made one of far- 
reaching results. There is no one selection of songs that is more valuable than some 
other one; and each supervisor of music may make out his own list for the particular 
community in which he chances to be. To make as concrete as possible the directions 
concerning learning and re-learning these “patriotic and home songs,” a suggested list 
which has been found fairly satisfactory is here appended. These songs will be found 
in the books planned respectively for these grades: 
GRADE L. “America” (1 stanza). 
Grave IT. “America” (4 stanzas). 
Grape III. “America the Beautiful” (1st, 2d, and 4th stanzas). 
“Old Folks at Home” (1 stanza). 
Grave IV. “Dixie” (1 stanza). 
“The Star Spangled Banner” (1st and 3d stanzas). 
“All Through the Night.”
-P-A-G-E-12
GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS 8 
GRADE V. “Annie Laurie.” 
“Long, Long Ago.” 
Grape VI. “Love’s Old Sweet Song (1 stanza). 
“Round—Row, Row.” 
“Battle Hymn of the Republic” (1st, 2d, 4th, and 5th stanzas). 
“Believe Me if All Those Endearing Young Charms.” 
Grade VII. “Auld Lang Syne.” 
“Last Rose of Summer.” 
Gravn VIII. “Flow Gently, Sweet Afton.” 
“Lead, Kindly Light.” 
2. The posture of pupils while singing is very important. The body should be held 
“easily erect,” the chest up—all the time, not merely when the teacher calls attention 
to position. Have the class stand part of the time, especially when singing songs. 
The “easily erect” posture is equally important in much of the other school work. 
By emphasizing its necessity, the teacher may do the pupil a lasting service by helping 
him to develop a sound body, quite apart from conditions which also will make for the 
most effective singing. 
3. Make much of song-singing in all the grades. Have the best songs learned in 
preceding years sung from time to time. If really good music is chosen, this constant 
repetition will not become wearisome. 
By “song-singing” is meant the singing of beautiful songs after they have been’ 
learned, expressly for the enjoyment of the activity, not merely that singing of new 
songs which goes with the study of them. Song-singing is thus to be thought of as a 
“play activity,” although this does not imply careless, slovenly singing. Baseball is 
a game, but to play it successfully, thought and skill are required. 
4. Try to arouse personal responsibility by constantly having individual work. 
Every child in every class (Grades I to VI) should sing alone at least once a week. 
There is no other single thing that will tend so much as this to improve the music in our 
schools. -We teach the class too much of the time, and the individual child too little. 
Individual work is required in other subjects, and because its necessity is taken as a 
matter of course no objection is ever made to it by the pupils. 
Do not introduce a lesson that is to include individual singing by saying, “Now, 
children, we are going to have individual singing.” In many cases individual recitation 
can be worked into the class lesson in some perfectly natural way by having several 
children sing all or a part of the song on which the class have been working, then by 
going on with further unison work, etc. Usually it is better to have not more than a 
fourth of the class sing alone in any one period because of the difficulty of keeping the 
others occupied meanwhile. It helps, on occasion, to ask the rest to be teachers and 
to be ready to correct the mistakes of the solo singers. Never allow the others to laugh
-P-A-G-E-13
4 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
ata child who makes a mistake; and as for yourself, the teacher, always encourage, never 
scold. 
5. Know your songs so well that while teaching them your eyes may be upon the 
children instead of on the book. You cannot be enthusiastic in your work unless you 
know the material at least fairly well, and if you do not enthuse, neither will your pupils. 
Make a plan for every music period and study the material of each lesson carefully in 
advance. Look at the class, not at the book! 
If some song is prescribed which you do not like, confer with the supervisor about 
omitting it. It is never possible to stir others to enthusiastic effort with material 
which we ourselves do not love. On the other hand, the beauty of a song is not always 
instantly obvious, and one does well not to condemn any given song too early. 
6. Speak often to the children concerning the beauty of the songs that they are 
singing, and try to inculcate the ideal of singing them beautifully as well as correctly. 
Good expression in singing comes most often as the result of a correct understanding 
of the word-text. See to it therefore that the words present a clear image. To this end 
have some individual child occasionally read the text aloud to the others before the 
words are sung. : 
7. The teacher must not do all the work herself, but must so arrange matters that 
the children will.do most of it. They need the practice, the teacher needs to conserve 
her strength. The secret of successful teaching is to get the pupils to take the respon-— 
sibility of doing their own work; in other words, to learn by doing. 
8. Accompaniments are extremely valuable in giving the children additional 
pleasure in music and an enlarged musical experience. The piano accompaniment 
has its dangers, however, and must not be overworked. There are two reasons for this: 
(1) in the lower grades. the piano is apt to cover up all sorts of faults in the singing, 
and often causes the pupils to sing too loudly; (2) in grades where sight-singing 
is the order of the day, the piano often interferes with independence. The latter dif- 
ficulty will be avoided if the accompaniment is never played until the song can be sung 
perfectly without it. 
For a similar reason the teacher usually must not sing with the class. 
II. Sone-sineine 
The most important musical activity carried on in the public schools is without a. 
doubt the singing of many beautiful songs, this statement applying to the professional 
musician of the future as well as to all others. Good singing during childho-7 -- 
stitutes the best possible foundation for any future music study in which et: 
amateur or-the professional musician may engage. As already noted, song 
means singing a song after it has been correctly learned, merely for the sak: 
esthetic satisfaction that attaches to taking part in the re-creation of beauty. 
. such an esthetic reaction actually ensues in the case of a reasonable number ©. wuss. 
lessons—i.e., unless the children feel a warm inward glow as they sing their songs, the 
teaching of music as an art must be judged ‘to have been a failure. : 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS . 6 
In order to have singing of such quality that it will not only be a delight to those 
taking part in it, but also to those who may happen to be listening, the following points 
must be kept in mind: 
1. Legato and Phrasing. Legato means connected, and good singing involves joining 
or blending the tones in such a way that the effect of the whole will be smooth and 
connected, rather than jerky and detached. On the other hand, the phrasing of the 
words must be as clear as in reading and speaking, this involving the taking of breath 
and the insertion of such natural breaks as are dictated by the meaning and punctuation 
of the text. Correct bodily posture, and steady, quiet breathing will help to insure 
good legato. Reading the text of the song aloud will usually insure correct phrasing. 
Do not waste any time on abstract breathing exercises. 
2. Voice Quality. Beauty of tone is an indispensable adjunct to what is called 
good singing, and the children’s voices will be found to sound indescribably charming 
if treated correctly. In order to achieve this result in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, 
where the beauty of the child’s voice culminates, the singing during the first three 
years at school must be consistently soft and sweet; and the compass of the songs used 
in these lower grades must be high, rather than low. It will be necessary also to direct 
the children’s attention often to listening to their own voices to see whether they are 
sounding (1) in tune and (2) light and sweet. Few people seem to listen to the sound 
of their own voices, an indifference which may account largely for the prevalence of 
ugly and out-of-tune singing. 
3. Attack, Release, and Rhythm.. Good ensemble singing involves (among other 
things) starting exactly together, keeping exactly together, and stopping exactly 
together. In the first and second grades, such precision is perhaps not to be expected; 
but from Grade III on there is little reason why one should not both expect and secure 
as fine attacks and releases, as steady tempo, and as firm rhythms, as are obtained with 
the finest choral organizations. For such unity, the teacher, as leader, is to be held 
largely responsible. In order to obtain it, the teacher is to beat time as much as may 
- be necessary, but no more; is sometimes to sing for the class, but not with them.* 
She is to give the pitch clearly, and will have the class sound it definitely every time; 
and she is to see to it that both teacher and children form the habit of holding the 
body erect and keeping the mind alert. 
4. Words. Good singing cannot be expected if the singer does not understand and 
think about the text. It is the teacher’s business to see that all words of all songs are 
as well understood as are the words in a properly taught language-reading lesson. The 
only exceptions to this principle are certain patriotic and home songs which custom 
and necessity prescribe for children even though they are essentially adult songs. 
It sometimes happens that after singing a song a few times both the teacher and- 
the children exhibit a tendency to go through it in a perfunctory way, without getting 
into its mood. This is not good song-singing. The remedy is (1) not to”sing the 
* The teacher cannot listen well while singing. Besides, the children will depend upon her if she sings; and, worst 
of all, her adult voice, not blending with the children’s, will result in a bad vocal effect. .
-P-A-G-E-15
6 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK — 
same song too often; (2) to see to it that both teacher and children take thought of the 
text, and get into its essential mood or spirit every time the song is sung. 
Listeners at concerts and church services are frequently heard complaining that they 
cannot understand the words. This is often due either to the complexity of the music 
(as in part-singing) or to the mistaken notion on the singer’s part that a fine legato is 
incompatible with clear articulation. Whatever may be true of adult choruses, chil- 
dren’s singing ought never to merit criticism of this sort, for clear enunciation can readily 
be acquired even by large groups. In order to bring about good enunciation, three 
things are necessary: (1) A good model for imitation. (Therefore let the teacher form 
the habit of enunciating carefully.) (2) Sensing the meaning of the words every time 
the song is sung. (3) Practice in singing to a real or an imaginary audience, expressly 
to convey to them the meaning of every word. A visitor in the room is an excellent 
stimulus to clear enunciation; or, if other visitors are few, a pupil from an upper grade 
may be called in to listen, and to appraise the quality of the enunciation. 
It will be noted that when the teacher calls for clearer enunciation, the result will 
almost invariably be merely an increase in loudness. The idea that clear enunciation. 
depends upon the use of tongue and lips rather than upon loudness of tone should be 
stressed emphatically. 
To encourage song-singing, this series includes in each succeeding book a repertoire 
of the best songs learned in previous grades. The editors believe that (1) if a song is 
good music it will bear repetition from year to year, and need not be discarded after 
having been sung once or twice; and (2) that any given class should be able at any time, 
on demand, to sing correctly, beautifully, and with expression, any one of a compara-— 
tively large number of previously learned songs, not all of these, however, necessarily 
from memory. 
IV. Tue Sicut-sincine Process 
In reading music the eye takes in groups of variously formed notes printed on the 
lines and spaces of the staff. The “highness and lowness” of the notes gives one a 
general idea of the pitches of the tones; the shape of the note conveys to the mind 
the relative duration the tone is to have; so that without knowing much about music, 
a person with “a good natural ear” will in a short time learn to “read” music, when 
singing together with other voices, and with someone at an instrument playing an 
accompaniment. This of course is not really reading music, although such ability is 
valuable as far as it goes. However, in singing without accompaniment, in part work, 
and especially in individual singing, a much more detailed and accurate knowledge of 
the notation of both pitch and rhythm is necessary. This knowledge consists in ability 
to interpret definitely what each line and space of the staff stands for in any key, and. 
involves skill in translating groups of notes into groups of tones after being given the 
key-tone or tonic (do). It involves also the interpretation of accents as indicated by 
bar lines, and of the various combinations of rhythmic figures as expressed by variously 
formed notes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS : 7 
Tn the process of translating notes into tones, the thing that is called tonality helps 
immensely. “Tonality” refers to an instinctive feeling that a certain tone is the 
center of a group of tones (such as the major or the minor scale) and that in. going on 
melodic “excursions” involving these other tones one must frequently come back to 
this “home tone” as a resting point, and must usually close the melody with it in order 
that the ear may be completely satisfied. 
This feeling of tonality is of utmost value in reading vocal music, particularly if 
the music is of the tonality type (non-chromatic and of course non-whole-tone); and 
because most of the vocal music which the majority of children will ever have occasion 
t6 use is of this type, the teaching of sight-singing in the schools has usually been done 
upon a tonality basis rather than upon a purely “interval relationship” one. It. is 
because the so-fa syllables make full use of this inborn instinct for tonality that they 
have been so useful in connection with the teaching of elementary vocal music. 
These syllables will not enable one to sing all music at sight, and compositions 
that have a decided trend toward the use of chromaticism or the whole-step scale should 
probably not be attempted by syllable, but will of necessity have to be taught by imita- 
tion. The syllables are of comparatively little use in difficult modulatory passages, 
aud music of these various types, if taught in the schools at all, will have to be taught 
in most instances by rote, an instrument being employed to play the passage a suffi- 
cient number of times to enable the pupils to repeat as heard. 
On the other hand, it must be admitted that a very large percentage of all vocal 
music, and particularly of such music as is apt to be used by the non-professional 
musician, is diatonic in character; that is, it is constructed upon a tonality basis; and 
in reading such music the use of the syllables will be found to simplify greatly the 
reading process, because these furnish an easily acquired association between groups 
of notes and the pitches they represent. An extraordinarily keen musical mind does 
not need this supplementary type of association but connects notes and tones directly 
together, so that when the notes appear to the eye, the correct pitches are at once 
brought up; and vice versa, when tones are heard, the corresponding notes appear 
to the mind as a visual image. Such ability is sometimes called having “absolute 
pitch” and involves an extraordinary type of pitch memory which has either been 
inherited or has been consistently developed during early childhood. Its possession 
is naturally of considerable advantage to the professional musician, but it is not in 
itself an indication of significant musical ability unless accompanied by certain other — 
evidences of talent. 
The majority of people, on the other hand, are not able to associate tones and 
notes in this direct fashion, and for them some artificial or supplementary association 
must be established if they are to learn to read music at all accurately. It should be 
noted that in the public schools this must usually be done without the aid of a keyboard 
instrument, since the great majority of schoolrooms are not as yet provided with pianos. 
Various plans for accomplishing this end have been devised, but the so-fa syllables 
originally applied to the first six notes of the scale by the Benedictine monk, Guido 
d’Arezzo, and later used as the basis of the “ tonic-so-fa” system of notation in
-P-A-G-E-17

England, have come into wider use than any other system; and because they are 
already in such widespread use, and because they are fairly adequate, they have been 
employed throughout this series. It is recommended that all children learn to use them- 
After having sung by syllable for some time, a great many find it possible to learn. 
. to read simple music without using the syllables. This is often done by thinking the 
syllable names and thus getting the correct pitches, but singing the words. In other 
cases, some characteristic group of notes (like.do-mi-so) has been read so many times 
that the tones are associated with the notes as a matter of habit, even on the part of 
a person who has no extraordinary musical talent. Learning to sing by syllable fre- 
quently results therefore in learning how to sing without using the syllables. The 
syllables must be kept in practice, however, in dealing with the non-talented individuals 
who comprise the average public school class; and if at any time, in singing a new 
melody, the correct pitch is not forthcoming, then the syllables are to be sung as a 
means of finding it. If this is not insisted upon, the whole sight-reading process is 
likely to deteriorate into mere guessing. Singing the simpler songs without using the 
syllables at all may begin in the fourth grade, and in the sixth grade a great deal of 
the new material should be read in this way. 
Do not use a keyboard instrument during the sight-singing, and do not sing with 
the class, if you wish the children to become independent sight-readers. Constant 
individual practice in sight-singing is the surest way of assuring an attitude of inde- 
pendence in reading music.

in reading music. Some of these have been successful, but many have |

intervals, but have not given him skill in reading both intervals and 1

will be discovered to be absolutely indispensable. The slogan, “The thing before

   ign,” applies nowhere more forcibly than in teaching music; and the edict, “From the 
arger to the smaller,” is equally important. For these reasons the first two years of 
school music should consist largely. of rote-songs sung by imitation, and of carefully 
lanned listening lessons. In this way the mind registers whole series of experiences 
involving pitch, tone, rhythm, ete.; and although all these things are not analyzed or 
ven consciously observed by the child, they nevertheless form a background of musical 
xperience which is not only desirable, but absolutely indispensable, if the pupil is to 
ecome interested in his later work and intelligent in doing it. 
In the second grade the child has been introduced to notation by being shown 
“pictures” of a number of the songs that he has previously learned, the entire song 
being shown (compare teaching language-reading by the “‘sentence method”); he 
has learned that higher notes on the staff stand for higher tones, and lower notes for 
lower tones; that notes appear both on the lines and the spaces of the staff; that the 
upper figure of the measure-sign indicates how many beats there are in a measure; 
that a whole note has four beats, a dotted half-note, three beats, a half-note, two, and a 
quarter-note only one. He knows nothing about key signatures (the tonic being either 
marked for him or pointed out by the teacher), but he knows the names of the com- 
moner symbols, such as staff, clef, sharp, flat, and bar. He has learned a few typical 
groups of tones like do-mi-so, do-re-mi, etc., so as to be able to sing them from notation 
or to recognize them when played or sung to him, and he has begun to experience a 
definite feeling of tonality in connection with the use of the so-fa syllables. He has 
J read a few very simple melodies from notation, but this has been incidental, most of 
-] the time in these two grades having been devoted to ear-training of various sorts, in 
«| going from the song itself to its notation. 
In the third grade real work upon the problem of reading music begins. The 
two principal points involved in this process are (1) to get the correct pitches in their 
relation to the tonic, after this has been sounded; and (2).to get the rhythm as indicated 
by the various kinds of notes and the bar lines—rhythm including both tone-length 
and accent. In this Series it has been thought best to keep the rhythm comparatively 
simple in the third grade, the major emphasis being placed upon reading pitch notation. 
| Tones are usually arranged in groups, as in the case of words, and our first large 
problem (after the general introduction to sight-singing) is to familiarize the child 
with a comparatively large number of the most commonly used of these tone-groups 
“so that he will be able to recognize them in any key as they occur in his songs. Three 
forms of drill, or steps, are advised in learning these tone-groups: (1) The tone-group is 
played by the teacher (or sung with “‘loo”) and the children respond by singing the 
same tones with syllables. If the syllables are correct, the teacher goes on to the next 
group, but if not, then the teacher sings the group with the correct syllables, the children 
imitating. (2) The syllables are dictated verbally, thus: “This is do” (sounding the 
pitch); “Now, sing do-mi-so,” (or some other group), the children responding by sing- 
ing the syllables, and of course the correct pitches. If the pitches are wrong, the 
teacher corrects as before, without scolding. (3) The notes for the various groups are 
shown on “flash cards,” each card being displayed for just an instant, and the children
-P-A-G-E-19
10 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
singing the syllables with, of course, their appropriate pitches. If the syllables 
wrong, show the card for a longer time, or try to get better concentration. If 
syllables are right but the pitches are wrong, put away the cards until further work 
been done on steps one and two as directed above. 
The test of this drill work consists in placing before the children music books havi 
melodies containing these tone-groups combined into connected phrases, the child. 
singing the correct pitches and “pointing” the pulse as they sing, as an aid to the © 
in keeping the place, and as an aid to the sense of rhythm in giving each tone its co: 
length. (Pointing helps also in keeping the tempo steady.) If the pupil cannot m. 
this test of singing a new melody containing the tone-groups that he has previous 
studied, the work must be considered to have been a failure and the time taken 
wasted. Such failure is practically always due to lack of concentration. This 
of concentration in turn usually reflects back on the teacher’s lack of ‘skill in m: 
the lessons interesting. 
In the fourth grade the same kind of tone drill is continued, for our : 
work is facility on the part of all children—including the musically slow as 
talented. Besides aiming at greater facility in tone work, we shall now 
second large problem—namely, reading the notation of the more complicate: 
figures. There are comparatively few of these, the most common types being as 10110 
(the quarter note is regarded as the beat unit):    
Q) Jo divided beat 
2) d. #  beat-and-a-half note 
(3) d- 3 dotted eighth and sixteenth 
(4) mn triplet 
(5) F553 — quadruplet 
(=) dd beat syncopation 
In addition to these it is necessary to learn to read music in 6/8 measure, the 
figures being as follows: 
OLTUIT «© TR OS 
Ol Sls OLA F 
Ol Tn © TT Ty 
In moderate and rapid tempos 6/8 is usually thought of as merely another way o 
writing triplets. 
Practically all of these figures have been sung again and again as they have « 
in the rote-songs from Grade I on, so the background of rhythmic experience is | 
present. In the more formal work that is now to be done, each figure to be stuuscu as

introduced ‘in a new rote-song, its characteristic effect there being carefully noted. 
It is then isolated and drilled upon in various ways, including examples shown in simple 
phrases on drill cards. The use of these cards will familiarize the pupils with the 
different rhythmic figures, and in most cases they will sing the rhythm correctly the 
first time they see its notation, provided, of course, that the interval relationships are 
not too difficult to grasp simultaneously. 
The pupils’ knowledge of the various rhythmic figures is now tested and confirmed 
by singing at sight many examples of the various rhythms, as these occur in the sight- 
singing material, both in the reader, and, if this is not sufficient, in “Supplementary 
Sight-Singing Exercises,” which will be found to contain hundreds of melodies utilizing 
all of the various rhythmic figures. Pointing is now no longer practicable, besides 
interfering with the pupils’ taking in groups of notes at a glance. It is, therefore, dis- 
placed by beating time on the desk (silently, with the right hand, the book being held 
in the left). 
In the fifth grade, the new problem is the introduction of chromatic tones. The 
word “chromatic” is a term soméwhat loosely used in referring to pitches outside 
the diatonic scale, the method of drill here being identical with that used in learning 
diatonic tone groups in Grade TIT. ‘Refer back to these directions and.utilize all three 
forms of drill. Cards for drill on a few of the more common progressions involving 
chromatics are available, and Part I of Book Two contains ample material for sight- 
singing practice. In “Supplementary Sight-Singing Exercises” will be found additional 
melodies suitable for the same purpose. Two-part singing and the more complicated 
notation of 6/8 measure are also stressed in this grade. 
In the sixth grade, the remaining rhythmic figures are studied and definite work. 
in the minor mode is undertaken for the first time. Rote-songs in minor have been 
taught from the first grade on, so the pupil has the necessary foundation of experience. 
In the fourth and fifth grades, also, occasional minor melodies have been included in the 
sight-singing material as well, so the children will have had a little practice in reading 
minor music. Now, however, a more formal type of work is to be done, the children 
being required to sing the various forms of the minor scale. Characteristic groups of 
tones are studied also, just as the major tone-groups were taken up in Grade III. 
In studying the minor mode through the use of the syllables, two methods of 
approach are possible. The first of these, known as the relative minor approach, 
involves calling “one” of the minor scale “ ta,” the scale then reading la, ti, do, re, mi, fa, 
so (or si), la. The advantage of this plan is that the same interval relationships that 
have been familiar since the second grade are referred to by the same syllables, and 
the tone-group /a-do-mi is still the same group of tones that the pupils have known for 
a long time, the only difference being that instead of referring to it as “six-eight-three,” 
in major, it is now called “one-three-five,” in minor. 
The other scheme is to refer to the tonic (that is, “one of the scale) in both major 
and minor as “do,” the minor scale then reading do, re, me, fa, so, le, te (or ti), do. 
In this case it is necessary to differentiate sharply between major and minor, for if the 
signature stands for a major key, a certain group of notes will be referred to as “la,
-P-A-G-E-21
12 ‘ UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
do, mi,” but if it is a minor key the same notes will be called by the sylla’'-~ 
so.” The advantage claimed for this latter plan is chiefly in connection w 
of harmony, where, for example, the dominant seventh chord in mino 
with that in major, but where in the first scheme proposed above, the ch: 
referred to in major as “ so, fi, re, fa,” and in minor as “ mi, si, ti, re.” The 
however, that comparatively few public-school children take up the stud; 
in any. serious fashion, whereas the great majority of them engage in : 
singing. The relationships of vocal music are therefore much more impor 
than harmony study. There is no question that the first scheme des 
(using “ta” as the tonic, or “one,” of the minor scale) greatly simplifies +: 
ordinary vocal music in the minor mode, and it has therefore been tho 
the editors to utilize this plan in these books. Any supervisor who for 
reason wishes to call the minor tonic do may of course do so, the material. 
being just as usable from this standpoint as from the other. Such a pi

we believe justifiable, but will also produce unnecessary confusion in tl: 
and will actually result in inferior sight-singing ability. The editors ther: 
recommend the “relative minor” approach, as previously described: 
Three-part work is begun in this grade, and an ample amount of easy 
and studies in three parts will be found in Book Three. 
In all of the work our aim is to be facility on the part of all the pupi 
reading and singing music of moderate difficulty—rather than the trair 
leaders by taking up music which is much more elaborate, the rest of the pu

suggestions in reality constitute a summary of the principles enunciate: 
going pages. :
-P-A-G-E-22
GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS 18 
1. The secret of reading music at sight is to take in groups of notes at a glance, 
not to read one note at a time. This implies constant looking ahead, such “looking 
ahead” being especially necessary when the music, in becoming more complex, necessi- 
tates the reading of the more involved rhythms. Train your pupils, therefore, to 
look ahead constantly when reading music, so that the reading ahead becomes a habit 
formed as early as possible. In this connection it may be well to state that it is often 
necessary to impress on pupils that in order to read music from a book one must look 
at the book and nowhere else! 
2. In the early stages the procedure in singing a new song at sight will be as follows: 
(1) sing the melody by syllable, pointing or beating time; (2) sing the melody with 
“loo”; (8) read the words aloud; (4) sing the words, but keep the eyes on the notes. 
From the fourth grade on, réad all the easier material by leaving out step one, and, 
later on, step two also; in other words, read the words aloud and then sing them at 
once, looking at the notes; but if there is any doubt as to the correctness of the intervals, 
let the syllables be sung. The only difficulty to be encountered in having the text sung 
first will be that the children will look at the words more than at the notes, when as 
a matter of fact they ought to be devoting the major part of their attention to the - 
notes and only a fractional part to the words. 
38. Be sure that the tonality is well established before the melody is begun. Always 
sound the tonic (do) and go from it to the first tone of the song, having the class hold 
this tone until all sing it exactly true to pitch. The old plan of always singing the~ 
tonic chord “ do-mi-so” at the beginning of any vocal exercise is still an excellent one, 
and the time thus taken is well spent. If the pupils are trained to sound the chord or 
to prolong the first tone of the song in this way, as a habit, so that no direction is neces- 
sary except the sounding of the tonic (do), no time at all will be wasted, and the whole 
sight-singing process will be very much facilitated. 
4. Train your pupils not to stop when a mistake is made, but to keep going no 
matter what-happens. Do not form the habit of saying, ““Why did you make such 
and such a mistake?”. Say, “Again!” and if after another trial or two the mistakes 
re-occur and the attention is good, then, instead of chiding, show by imitation how the 
melody should sound, or else choose something easier. The two principal causes of mis- 
takes in sight-singing are (1) lack of attention and (2) too difficult material. If the 
songs are too difficult, teach some of them by rote, so that there may be real pleasure in 
singing from the book; at the same time select simpler sight-singing material from the 
first part of “Supplementary Sight-Singing Exercises,” until the pupils acquire more 
skill and confidence. If this book is not available in quantities for the children’s use, 
copy exercises from it on the board, standing aside while the exercises are sung. Tf the 
teacher constantly stands at the board and points, the children will never become 
independent readers. 
5. The biggest problem in sight-singing is to secure concentrated attention.. With 
such attention you can do anything; without it, nothing. Interesting material will 
help get it; a wide-awake and energetic teacher who looks at the pupils and not at the 
book will be an item; individual singing will tend to inculcate a feeling of individual
-P-A-G-E-23
14 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
responsibility; and a teacher who has the courage not to sing with the class will help 
the children more by her silence than she would by her singing. Make certain, there- 
fore, that the music is at least reasonably interesting, that the teacher is wide-awake 
and energetic, that there is individual singing from day to day, and that the children 
are not deprived of the chance to develop initiative because of the teacher's insistence 
upon singing with them. 
Do not count aloud or beat time audibly except on the rare occasions when neces- 
sary to hold the group together in a difficult passage. Do not beat time in grades one 
to five, except, perhaps, at the beginning of a song to establish the tempo, or at a hold, 
or at the end of the song to secure unanimity of release. Beating time may also be 
necessary, occasionally, during a retard in order to establish a uniform tempo to be 
maintained by the entire group: The recommendations in this paragraph are to be 
interpreted sensibly, the underlying thought being that the more responsibility the 
teacher takes, the less the children will assume; and, therefore, the poorer will be 
their training in initiative, responsibility, and resourcefulness. 
6. Do not waste “singing time” by asking about the key signature, the measure 
sign, etc., of every song. An occasional question of this nature may be necessary, 
but in many schools so much time is spent in talking about the music that there is 
often too little time left for singing it. In general, give the key tone, let the children 
sound it once, without being told; let them go to the first tone of the song, again without 
being told; and then give the signal for singing to begin. - a 
VI. Turory-TEAcHING 
2 The expression, “music theory,” refers to any grouping of related conclusions or 
explanations about music, as contrasted with the study of musical compositions as 
such or the study of the technique of performance. It begins with the kindergarten 
child learning to differentiate between two- and three-beat measure, and culminates 
in the study of musical composition and orchestration. Theory thus takes cognizance 
of any kind of information about music, such as the meaning of the musical symbols, 
the pitch-names of lines and spaces, the signatures of major and minor keys, etc. 
Theory-teaching in the public schools has two purposes: (1) to help the pupil as 
much as possible in his practice of music (sight-singing, etc.); (2) to cause him to 
understand and appreciate music in general more keenly because of having acquired 
a knowledge of its salient facts. 
An acquaintance with the note and rest values and with the names and functions 
of the staff, clef, etc., is of some use in sight-singing; so is the ability to tell in what key 
a composition is written, especially in the more difficult music involving chromatic tones, 
An acquaintance with “period form” as a characteristic type of musical structure, 
on the other hand, is of very little service in reading music, but adds immensely to 
one’s enjoyment and appreciation of music. 
Unless our theory-teaching can meet this test of fulfilling one or the other of these 
functions, one may doubt whether we can justify the time spent on it; indeed, we may
-P-A-G-E-24
GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS ee 
as well confess that theory-teaching is probably the least valuable of the four types 
of work—song-singing, sight-singing, listening lessons, theory-teaching, Many chil- 
dren have doubtless been caused to dislike music by too much emphasis upon the 
theoretical, just as many others have come to “hate music” because they were given 
too much practice in sight-singing. However, a judicious admixture of theoretical 
material is highly valuable, and these books contain suggestions for each grade telating 
to the presentation of the most valuable theoretical facts. The inclusion of certain 
material relating to band and orchestral instruments in Book Four is especially to be 
noted, both on account of the keen interest that it will inevitably arouse, especially 
among boys, and because of.the widening of the pupils’ musical horizon that will result 
from even so slight an introduction to instrumental music. 
VIL. Wratrren Work 
The aim of our lessons on the writing of music is somewhat akin to that’ involved 
in teaching theory—namely, to reinforce the training in sight-singing as much as pos- 
sible, and to develop the pupils’ musical intelligence. Moreover, there is intellectual 
value in the writing of original melodies, just as in any other creative work. This has 
long been recognized with respect to original composition in language-teaching. 
Written work in music must necessarily begin with teaching the pupils to make the 
musical symbols, such as the clef, sharp, flat, ete. The pupils are provided with paper 
on which a staff has been ruled (the “Music Writing Book,’ published in connection 
with this Series is recommended, although any kind of staff paper will do), and in the 
third grade the pupils are asked to copy certain simple melodies, thus learning to make 
the various symbols as neatly, accurately, and rapidly as possible. A little later the 
teacher dictates melodies by reading the syllables (or pitch names) and note values, 
the pupils writing as directed. This activity will be referred to as “verbal dictation.” 
The children are also told to listen while the teacher plays or sings groups of tones, 
and to respond by writing the appropriate notes on the staff. This will be referred to 
as “tonal dictation.” Farther along the children are asked to sing some simple melody 
from their song books, and after singing it are told to close their books and reproduce 
the melody on the staff, afterward comparing their version with that in the book. 
As the work in sight-singing advances, both verbal and tonal dictation, including chro- 
matics and minor mode, become more difficult, and in every case the written work is 
closely correlated with the singing. 
Transposition to other keys, scale-writing, and other valuable forms of work 
may be taken up in grades five to eight, as directed in the monthly outlines. One of 
the most interesting activities in all music study, the writing of original melodies, 
may begin in the sixth year, or at any time after the pupils have learned to take down 
simple tonal dictation. 
It is difficult for some children to invent melodies that are well balanced and 
that have unity, so the editors have provided a very interesting device for the fitst 
step in melody-writing. This consists of a bit of verse, the first half of which has
-P-A-G-E-25
16 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
been supplied with a melody, the children in turn being asked to invent a suitable 
melody for the second half.’ After this has been done a few times, the pupils should 
be ready to write complete melodies on their own initiative, short poems being supplied 
for this purpose. These poems are to be supplemented from time to time by verses 
furnished by the teacher, or perhaps invented by the children themselves. Such work 
in -melody-writing as we have been describing will probably produce the best results 
in the sixth and seventh grades. 
Begin by copying the antecedent of one of the melodies found on the following 
pages on the board, writing the second line of the verse under a blank staff. Now 
have several children (one at a time) sing the first half as written, making up a suitable 
second half, and singing it aloud. The class will decide which one is best, and the 
teacher will write this on the staff. The entire class now sings the completed melody. 
Pass on to another melody and let each pupil try his hand at inventing a suitable 
second half, but singing it silently, and writing it in his own book. If this does not 
work well, go back to the method used with melody No. 1. 
One of the chief difficulties in this work will be the fact that the children do not 
write the melody as they sing it. This should not be a discouragement, but should 
rather be a stimulus to both teacher and pupils to do harder work on sight-singing 
and tonal dictation. : 
After the first half-dozen or so of these incomplete melodies have been completed, 
allow the children to construct entire melodies, using the preceding texts supplied for 
this purpose or any other suitable material that may be available. Urge them to 
read the poem carefully before beginning to compose a tune so as to determine what 
kind of melody will be suitable for it, what type of measure is required, and the direction 
in which the melody should progress. 
Do not be seriously disturbed if the results shown by some children are crude and 
meaningless. The mere process of trying to create music will give even them a more 
intelligent attitude toward the music created by others, and such practice as has been 
recommended will cause all the pupils to observe certain details of structure and appro- 
priateness of melodic line and rhythm to text, that would otherwise be entirely lost 
to them. 
The impulse to create is strong in all of us. Therefore, the delight in welcoming 
into existence something beautiful that we ourselves have had a part in creating will. 
amply repay us for whatever time it takes, and will foster a permanent interest in all _| 
beauty. :

VITI. Ear-rramine 
Broadly speaking, all music study is, or should be, ear-training, and tl 
activities connected with training the ear are surely the most important thing 
education. The child in the first grade must learn to make his voice match hi: 
voice in both pitch and rhythm—ear-training. He must learn also to listen 1 
voice to make certain that his tones are sweet and musical. In the second 
must learn to recognize the repetition of a phrase that has occurred earlier in tuy o---~ 
ear-training. In the third grade he learns characteristic groups of tones in such a 
‘that when he hears them he knows what notes stand for them, and when he see 
notes he knows what the tones are—ear-training, with the beginning of eye-trai...- 
And so on through the entire course. 
The greatest single need of music study is a larger amount and a higher qu 
ear-training, and the greatest difficulty with most professional music students 
they do not listen intently enough either to their own performance or to that o: 
from whom they are seeking guidance and inspiration. / 
In the public schools the formal work in ear-training has two funds--~*-! ---~ 
poses: (1) to assist the ear and eye in forming associations between | 
notation; (2) to cause the mind to take in a larger number of details i 
music that is being sung or listened to, so as to induce the developme: 
grade of music appreciation. 
The first kind of work has already been referred to in connection witl: 
and written work. It consists of dictatmg tone-groups, melodies, cha 
pupil writing on the staff what he hears. Its value in connection with si 
evident, and no further explanation is necessary here, suggestions for the ....00- Ju po 
being found in the directions for grades three and five in this book. 
The second aim referred to above is not so often thought of, and yet it is palpable 
that the majority of people hear but a small part of what is going on at a musical-per- 
formance, whereas if we can but cause them to listen more intently we shall greatly 
increase. their enjoyment and shall make the experience much more valuab" * ** 
The person who hears great variety of tone color in a solo performanc

orchestral performance this is easy, and anyone can quickly learn to discx

but nevertheless immensely more enjoyable, to be able to distinguish all th: 
of tone and the niceties of expression. The listener who hears the musi 
from one key to another, and who is aware of the fact that one composition. 
and another in minor, is getting more for his money than the average Cd 
while the person who gives his fancy free rein and thus hears in the music the rippling 
waves or the sighing wind is experiencing a satisfaction that his stodgy and unimagina- 
tive neighbor is missing.

to do all of these things, but with proper guidance many more could learn to do at

least sore of them; and directly or indirectly our work in school misic ought to develop 
this ability to hear more and more of what is going on when music is being performed. 
Such ability to hear naturally concerns itself with two groups of activities—namely,

32 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHER’S: BOOK 
Suggestions for Dictation Exercises 
What is ordinarily known among professional musicians as “ear-training”’ con- 
sists largely of exercises dictated (played or sung) by the teacher, and written by the 
pupil. Such work was formerly confined entirely to interval dictation, but has been 
growing broader and more comprehensive so that an elaborate course in ear-training 
now begins with simple interval dictation given through melodic and harmonic exer- 
cises, and perhaps culminates in the dictation of the larger musical forms, which are 
to be analyzed by the class simply from hearing them. 
In the public schools the formal work in ear-training is usually confined to three 
types of activity: (1) tone-groups; (2) short melodies involving the analysis of both 
interval and rhythm; (3) simple harmonic exercises involving differentiation between 
major and minor chords, etc. 
In taking down melodies pupils will usually make the mistake of beginning to 
write as soon as the teacher begins to play. This interferes seriously with the pupils’ 
grasp upon the melody as a whole, and although they may get the first few notes better, 
they will usually not get the melody as a whole at all, simply because they cannot 
‘keep up with the teacher unless the melody is dictated very slowly. To cure this 
mistake in method, forbid the pupils to write until you give the signal, asking them 
to concentrate intensively upon the melody while it is played or sung. In the early 
stages, the pupils may be asked to sing it after they have heard you give it, so as to 
make certain that they really have the melody in mind. As soon as possible, however, 
each pupil is expected to sing it mentally (allow no humming) and then to write it. 
Note that the rhythm of the melody is co-equal in importance with the intervals. If 
a pupil has “all the notes right,” he often thinks he has the melody complete, even 
though he may know nothing about the rhythm. Such a recitation is not to be graded 
more than fifty per cent for, of course, the rhythm is just as important as the 
intervals. 
IX. Listenrve Lessons 
Aim. A growing tendency to regard the aim of school music as appreciation rather 
than merely performance is becoming constantly more manifest among thoughtful 
educators. It is true of course that appreciation comes largely through participation, 
yet we are coming to feel more and more strongly that the child has a right to a larger 
musical experience than he can ordinarily get through his own performance. Famil- 
iarity with the great masterpieces of music is possible only in a limited way through 
school singing; but given a phonograph and a player piano, and there is almost no 
limit to such an acquaintance. Ideals of performance, too, will grow much more 
rapidly if the child has opportunities to hear and to be guided by reproductions of 
artists” performances, to say nothing of the ineffable joy of listening to great compositions 
performed by great artists. 
For these various reasons, the listening lesson is being more and more generally 
accepted as an integral part of school-music teaching, a constantly growing number of
-P-A-G-E-42
   GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS ~ 33   
“ 
schools: Being ‘well equipped with phonographs and libraries of records. And why 
not, indeed? Do we not furnish globes and maps for the study of geography, and 
microscopes and botanical specimens for the study of plant life? . 
‘The purpose of the listening lesson is, then, to provide a richer musical experience 
than the pupil’s own limited performing ability makes possible, and the specific aims 
of such lessons in the grades are as follows: (1) To provide a fine type of zsthetic enjoy- 
ment.- (2) To give practice in concentrated listening to music, the ear-training thus 
furnished causing the children to acquire the habit of sitting quietly and thinking only 
of the music being rendered. More and more details come thus within. the scope of 
their attention and all music becomes more and more meaningful. (3) To make the 
children acquainted with the great musical masterpieces so that they shall come’ to 
love these and not be satisfied with the tawdry, trivial, and often vulgar, music of the 
street. (4) To develop ideals of performance, thus causing the children both to per- 
form better and to enjoy more keenly the artistic rendition of others. 
‘Variety of Lessons. The listening lesson is not to be understood as comprising 
merely the playing of phonograph records, although such lessons in all probability will 
be most often given because of the accessibility of the apparatus. The phonograph 
record should, however, be supplemented by various other types of musical experience, 
some of these being: 
1. Interchange of programs by different classes. Two groups of children have been 
learning beautiful songs, each class working on a different selection of material. Why 
not have these groups hold a session once a month, each class singing a number of its 
best songs for the other class, with titles announced, and perhaps details concerning 
composers’ lives, etc., given by members of the class? 
2. ‘Short concerts by local artists. There are singers, pianists, violinists, ete., 
in every community, and such persons are usually glad to perform for children if asked 
in a tactful way. Have several classes assemble for such a concert. If there is. an 
auditorium, let the whole school participate. Mass singing by the entire audience is 
a fine way to begin and close such a program. 
_ Two warnings seem necessary in connection with concerts by outsiders: (1) be 
sure that the selections rendered are at least reasonably suitable for children (singers 
have.a habit of indulging in love songs exclusively); (2) see to it that the program 
is short; not longer than thirty to forty minutes in any case; and in the lower grades 
not more than twenty to thirty minutes. Have the children go away wishing that 
the concert had been longer, rather than impatient because they have had to sit still 
so Jong.” / 
3. Artist recitals entirely outside the school. This does not refer to school con- 
certs, but to recitals in city courses such as are more and more commonly being given, 
even inthe smaller communities. Children in the lower grades probably ought not to 
be urged‘to go to evening concerts, but from about Grade VI on the teacher may well 
bring these recitals to the attention of the pupils, urging them to attend. It is justi- 
fiable to take school time for telling the pupils about the artist or the program. Reduced 
rates may often be secured for children if application is made to the proper person.
-P-A-G-E-43
834 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
Occasionally the artist can be prevailed upon to come to the school auditorium in the 
afternoon and give a short recital for the children. . 
4. The player piano, which has certain limitations with regard to tone color, but 
which has this advantage over the phonograph, that it can reproduce entire composi- 
tions without cuts or mutilations. 
Introducing the Compositions. There are three common methods of approach 
to the hearing of musical masterpieces in such listening lessons as we have been recom- 
mending. The first is to say nothing at, all about the composition, but merely to 
announce it and let the listeners gain their own impressions. This has its value, of 
course, for the pupil does have the joy of hearing the music; yet in most cases it must 
be admitted to be somewhat wasteful, for without any guidance these immature listeners 
will get little that will be remembered. A second method is to call attention to the 
purely musical aspects of the composition, possibly some reference to the period when 
written, etc. This has high value because it stimulates in the listeners a keener obser- 
vation of musical details, especially when the program is directed by a musician of 
taste and experience. A third plan is to call attention particularly to the mood of the 
music as being appropriate to the title, etc. Sometimes the composition is played,. 
and the class asked, by way of variety, to supply a suitable title. This method has 
its value in causing the development of a more imaginative type of listening, but should 
supplement, not replace, the second plan described above. In no case, however, should 
the discussion of the music take much time from the listening. 
Suggestions 
1. Make the occasion of the listening lesson an important event, perhaps the 
culminating music lesson of the week, and never present it in a perfunctory way. If 
either teacher or pupils ever feel bored at these lessons, it is probably because the 
teacher has not prepared for the lesson with sufficient care. Decide on the program 
several days in advance, and make certain that you are well informed concerning the 
various compositions and their composers. Have the children sometimes take part 
in making up a program. Delegate certain ones to go to the library to look up inter- 
esting details concerning composer and composition. Such work has its reward not 
merely. in the added enjoyment with which the music is heard by the pupils, but also 
in the mental growth and the increased resourcefulness of the teacher.* 
2. Remember that while a few pointed remarks about the composition may increase 
the children’s appreciation, a long explanation is wholly out of place, and only cuts 
down the number of repetitions possible in the limited time. A brief explanation 
allowing for repeating the composition several times is far better than a long-winded 
explanation with but one rendition. . 
3. Write on the board for each lesson the titles of the compositions, together with 
the names of the composer and performer, so that the children will acquire the habit 
* Any activity presenting an opportunity for growth and self-development will be welcomed by the ambitious and 
progressive teacher, and in planning listening lessons such opportunities are unlimited.
-P-A-G-E-44
GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO TEACHERS 35 
of following a program with the eye. Be accurate in spelling. Pronounce the titles 
and names before the composition is given, being sure the pronunciation is correct. 
If in doubt, get a pronouncing biographical “dictionary of musicians” for your school 
library. The catalogues published by the various phonograph companies are also of 
great assistance, both for spellings and for pronunciations, and for interesting facts 
about the compositions. A book of opera stories, a good book on orchestral instru- 
ments, a brief history of music, and a few other reference books will help, and the 
children should be encouraged to use these, perhaps by appointing different pupils 
to look up and report upon various matters. A copy of Grove’s “Dictionary of Music 
and Musicians” would be a fine thing to buy with some of the money made at school 
concerts. 
4, During the actual performance of any composition let the room be absolutely 
quiet—as at a concert. Let the teacher as well as the children take the attitude of atten- 
tive listening. Never permit whispering, looking at books, walking about, or anything 
else that would be discourteous or distracting. 
5. At the close of a number, permit the children to talk it over, relating what they 
heard, what they liked, what they did not understand. If there is time the teacher 
may tell of things which she heard that they missed; then go through the same compo-~ 
sition again to see whether the children will hear it all this time. 
6. If some child has at home an especially fine record which his parents are willing 
that he bring to school, by all means allow him to do so, and encourage him to tell the 
other children something about the record. But permit no unworthy compositions 
to be brought in, and of course encourage the children as much as possible to select 
the better compositions. for their music libraries at home. 
Selecting Records 
1. All records for the school should be selected by the music supervisor, or by a 
committee of which he is the chairman. 
2. Procure the best selections that are recorded, and obtain the best renditions 
of them that are available; but if necessary choose a fine composition rendered by a 
lesser artist rather than a poor composition rendered by a much advertised soloist. 
38. If possible, hear the record before definitely buying it for the school library. 
Selecting records from catalogues is often disappointing. : 
(4) Never buy what is commonly known as “popular” music or any kind of 
unworthy selections, and do not allow the children to bring such records from home. 
5. Work for variety in your record library. Vocal records are probably the most 
faithful reproductions available, but the library should also contain records of violin, 
cello, orchestra, band, piano, wind instruments, string quartet, etc. 
Providing Apparatus. Pianos, phonographs, records, storage cases, etc., should 
be provided by the school authorities just as other types of apparatus are furnished, 
and in many cases this will be done if the board members are approached in a reasonable 
way. But if the board fails you, a ready means of raising money is available in the

oncert, at which various grades, perhaps the entire school, will take part. Such 
t can be prepared for largely during the regular daily music period (the ordinary 
“school songs being used), and will be a stimulus to the pupils to work at certain songs 
‘until they can sing them with a higher degree of “finish” than is ordinarily expected

' their socializing value is apparent. 
-X. Tae Dany Lesson Pian 
_ In order to succeed in teaching music or anything else, it is necessary first to plan 
the work, and, second, to work the plan. These books have been carefully planned in 
a large way, and it. now remains for the teacher to work the plan by devising programs 
for the daily lessons which shall insure, first, that the ground outlined shall be covered; 
and, second, that the pupils’ interest in music shall not simply be maintained, but 
shall be constantly increased in both intensity and breadth. It has not been thought 
best to outline the work in too detailed a way because conditions are so diverse in 
_ different communities, but the editors believe that a great deal depends upon dividing 
the material for the month into a series of carefully devised daily lesson plans, and for 
this reason it has been thought best to furnish a series of suggestions designed to facilitate 
the making of such plans. _ 
The two things to be aimed at in making out a series of daily lesson programs are 
(1) variety and (2) unity. There must be sufficient diversity of work so that the 
pupil will not lose interest; yet the same things must be done sufficiently often to insure 
a real command over them by the pupils. The following suggestions may help: 
1. In general begin each lesson with a familiar song, striving for variety even in 
these songs. Plan them a month ahead. If a good song is used in this way once in two 
_ weeks, it will last indefinitely. 
2. Have one big objective for each lesson, and let the children know what it is that 
you hope to accomplish. Place this early in the lesson, when the children’s minds 
-- are fresh. Work for variety in this part of the lesson also. 
8.-As often as possible close the lesson with the pupil in a happy mood. If the 
hard work is-going well, carry it to the very end of the lesson. But if it has dragged a 
little, stop three minutes before the close of the period, and have a familiar song or a 
phonograph selection at the end. 
4. Instead of planning one lesson at.a time, plan a series of lessons. Get into the 
habit of planning the week’s work in advance. Keep your lesson plans together and 
have a review once a month covering all the work of that month. 
To make these suggestions concrete, a series of lesson plans is here furnished, 
These are intended merely to illustrate the method of plan-making referred to above, 
and will not of course fit any particular set of conditions. In other words, the lesson 
~ plan must be “made to order” and cannot be “ready-made.”

Introductory 
The general plan of procedure involved in teaching music to groups of children is 
substantially that followed by the language teacher. It is based on the slogan “The 
thing before the sign,” or, as stated by Professor Farnsworth, “Experience must precede 
formal instruction”—and if the experience is lacking it must be suppli ed.” Tn the case 
of language the child has had much practice in both speaking and listening, and the 
teacher, therefore, begins at once to work with symbols. In the case of music, however, 
the majority of children will have had little or no experience in either singing or listening, 
and the teacher is therefore compelled to begin ‘with ear work instead of eye work. On 
this account the symbols of music are ordinarily not presented until the second grade. 
As already implied, the work in the first grade is to provide the child with a founda- 
tion of musical experience upon which, later on, more formal instruction may be based. 
This experience will consist of some form of rhythmic response like marching, clapping, 
and the like, to strongly rhythmic music; of listening to the phonograph; of hearing the- 
teacher, or some local musician, sing or play; and of imitating the teacher in the singing 
of a fairly large number of short, carefully selected songs. In the course of the year the 
pupil learns the difference between the effect of high and low tones-and long and short 
ones; and learns also to clap the pulse of songs or instrumental pieces and to decide 
whether they are in two- or three-beat measure. During the second half of the year 
the pupil is asked to listen closely to certain of the songs that he sings and to recognize 
phrase repetitions. In order to assist the discriminative activities just referred to, the 
pupil is required to learn (by rote) the so-fa syllables for a number of short songs, and 
the analytical process is helped along still further by figures drawn on the board to 
illustrate graphically the difference between long and short tones, high and low ones, 
and between different varieties of pulsation. The songs should be sung without accom- 
paniment most of the time, the harmony being added sometimes merely to give further 
musical attractiveness and a broader musical experience. The intonation will be aided 
materially-during the earlier part of the year, however, if the melody is played on organ, 
piano, or violin while the children sing. Individual singing of the shorter songs is to be 
a regular part of our procedure from almost the very beginning. Do not expect too

Suggestions for Teaching Rote-songe % in Grade I 
A Begin i in general by preparing the 1e bhildren’ 's minds in some way for the “st: 
of the song, so as to make certain that they will understand the words. Thus, i' 
song deals with the four seasons, make sure that the children are thinking about sprmg, 
summer, autumn, and winter. If the song treats of objects or activities not within the 
children’s experience, do what you can to supply the experience through actual objects, 
pictures, or descriptions—er else leave out that particular song. 
2. The-+teacher sings the entire song with a soft clearvoice and with good enunciation, 
putting herself into the mood of the words. No accompaniment is to be played as yet. 
3. Read the words aloud, or talk about them a moment more. © 
4. Sing the entire song again as before. 
5. Ask a question or two so as to ascertain whether the children have caught the 
words, and whether they understand them. 
6. Sing the entire song again, or at least the first stanza. 
‘7. Drop the song for the day; or if it is a very short song have the class sing part 
or all of it'with you. .To sing the last line only is sometimes effective. 
8. The next day the teacher sings the entire song once more, reviewing the story 
as inay be necessary. 
9. The children are now invited to sing part or all of the song with the teacher 
(still without accompaniment). 
10. If there are mistakes work on the particular spots that need attention, this 
being postponed until the third or fourth day in the « case of a long song. 
11. When the whole song can be sung without error, add the accompaniment, 
playing softly so as not to drown ont: the voices or cause the children to sing loudly 
in a » spirit of rivalry. S
-P-A-G-E-54
  METHODS AND DIRECTIONS - 
   
    
32--On- succeeding days have one row sing the song alone: or divide the song into 
phrases each row of pupils singing a phrase. ~ 
~ 18. Still later have individual children sing the entire song, or each -one phrase 
as in No. 12 above. 
14, In the case of a long, difficult song (of which there. should be but few i in. the - 
course of the year), postpone inviting the children to attempt it, until they have heard 
the teacher sing it on three or four successive days, 80 as to giye timé for the song to. : 
“soak in.” The children will be much more likely to sing the song correctly if they. do - 
not attempt too soon to imitate the teacher. .

another‘ ‘nearly completed, ete. . é :   
  
   
The Child's Singing Voice oe 
The six-year-old child has but a tiny singing voice, and.our objectives i in the first 
year are-swWéetness of tone and correctness of pitch (intonation): rather than power. 
The child’s “shouting voice” is sometimes mistaken for his singing. voice, but no one 
who has learned to love the gentle Alute-like tones that constitute the child’s real singing 
voice will ever tolerate the raucous, out-of-tune sort of “ music” ? that many seem to 
think is all that can be expected at this stage. 
The-best way to get real singing is to avoid “‘yelling”. from the very y beginning, 
encouraging, the children to listen to their voices and trying to arouse the ideal of making 
the singing sound sweet and in tune, “like teacher’s.” (If-the teacher’s voice will not 
bear such atest, use suitable phonograph records to illustrate this point.) 
Three things must be constantly kept in mind in teaching the young child to sing: 
1. The difference between singing and speaking i is that in singing the vowels. are 
held longer. Have the child, therefore, make “Jong tones,” which means, of course 
prolonging the vowels. Slow sustained songs area great help here, while snappy, 
thythmic ones are apt to be a hindrance. Long, smooth tones, therefore, constitute 
the first-aid to good singing. : 
2..The child sings and shouts with the same vocal apparatus. In order to sing 
well, one must first learn to sing softly, so that one may listen to one’s own tones, and 
thus-insure that they shall be sweet and in tune. This in turn will cause the vocal 
organs.to react properly. In other words, soft singing will induce a relaxed condition - 
of the vocal organs, and relaxation in singing is an absolute necessity. Light singing. 
accompanied, by attentive listening is therefore the second. requisite for training the 
child’s voice: - : 
8. ‘Fhe child’s extreme vocal compass at the age of six is often as far down as _ 
cs and as far up as = , but his singing voice lies i in the high rather than 
in the low part of this range. To insure the use of the singing voice and to bar out.the - 
shouting one, the songs must range fairly high, and must be sung at correct piteh. In 
this Series the songs are in the correct compass for good singing by school children. 
-
-P-A-G-E-55
46 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
Please cooperate by having the correct pitch given every time a song is sung, and by goin, 
back to this pitch if it is lost as the result of careless, out-of-tune singing. If the song: 
seem high, the children are singing too loudly. If the children sing softly enough, th 
compass will be found to be correct. 
The So-called “Monotone” or Non-singer 
The first-grade child who cannot sing a tune correctly with the others is by n 
means to be discouraged, for with proper instruction the chances are all in favor of hi 
learning to sing in the course of his first year or two in school. Some children hav: 
quicker ears than others, and some have had a much more extended musical experienc: 
than others before coming to school, but psychologists tell us that the child is a rar 
exception who cannot in time learn to “carry a tune.” Therefore,-no matter how 
poorly he may sing at first, and no matter how far back in his family its members are 
reputed not to have been able to “carry a tune”(!), encourage every child to believe 
that he can learn to sing if he will but do his best. 
At first let every one try to sing, using the “question and answer” songs found in 
Book One. After two or three months organize a*“choir” and admit to it all who 
can sing a tune correctly all alone. Have this choir sit in the rear of the room, thus 
bringing the poorest singers in front of the best ones. Do not make the individual 
singing too formal. Allow the children, when singing alone, to stand beside their own 
seats, or, at first, even to remain seated if they prefer. If some child is too timid to 
try singing alone, let him choose some other child to sing with him the first time or two. 
Reserve the back seats for the choir and admit new members as quickly as they qualify. 
To earn the honor of singing in this special group, most of the children will learn to 
follow the pitch without further aid. If they succeed in getting into the choir too 
quickly, organize a new one with more stringent entrance requirements. Call this 
second group the “glee club” or “senior choir,” if you wish. 
Let this choir now sing alone part of the time, the other children listening. Allow 
the choir to sing with you on a new song, before the class as a whole is permitted to sing 
but do not discourage the slower ones by forbidding them to sing at all. Every child 
in the class should be encouraged to take some part in every lesson. : 
The “calls” already referred to are a useful device that will often help so-called 
“monotones” to acquire the use of their singing voices. The best of these is probably 
| one child calling another, and the child

who is called, responding. Sometimes the entire class will sing the first part of the call. 
This may be done early in the year, and all the children will be found to enjoy the 
exercise immensely. Other “calls” are == gees S, Encourage the

bering that the whole purpose of a call is to get the voice up high. Often a child who 
cannot get the pitch from the teacher’s voice will get it more readily from some other 
child. Make full use of “pupil teachers” both here and in other ways. Let the singing 
be consistently light and sweet. . 
If any of the children cannot sing after two or three months of work in class, ask 
them to stop 4 few moments after school, and carry on the same sort of work with them, 
stressing particularly the calls, and stimulating each child in every practicable way to 
get his voice up. Play the pitches on the piano or organ; sing them to him; if he 
still sigs the low tone, find its pitch on the piano and go up the scale from there, encour- 
aging him to follow, etc. When he has learned to match pitches fairly well, teach 
him some of the simpler songs that are being sung by the class. Before long he will | 
be taking his full share in the music, and may be considered “cur 
Song-singing 
The most important work in Grade I, as in every other grade, is the singing of 
songs; and even the first-grade children can be taught to sing surprisingly well by the 
end of the year. Correct intonation and firm rhythm are to be worked for persistently, 
but besides these two aims there are several other elements of good ‘singing that can 
be secured if the work is directed in the right way. 
The first of these is good enunciation—that is, singing the words plainly. Here 
a great deal depends upon the consonants, the “framework of speech,’ which serve 
to introduce, separate, and cut off the vowel tone in various ways. The best aids to 
securing good enunciation are (1) a good model set by the teacher in her own speaking 
and singing; (2) the ideal, kept constantly before the children, of singing the words so 
plainly that an imaginary listener who has never heard the song shall be able to get the 
story, simply from hearing the children sing it. To enunciate clearly, the lips must be 
used more actively than in ordinary speech; and the teacher will sometimes “speak 
silently,” that is, form the consonants without any vowel tone, to see whether the 
children can “read her lips” as a deaf person does. This helps to “bring the enuncia- 
tion apparatus forward.” 
The second element of good singing is to convey by the tone the meaning of the 
words, just as the character of the melody is in accord with the ideas presented in the 
text. Children’s voices do not have the same variety of color that characterizes adult 
voices, but even a child uses a different “voice” when asking for candy, from his voice 
when quarreling with a playmate; and the first grade is none too early to begin to 
inculcate the idea that in order to sing any song well, one must be thinking about the 
meaning of the words of this particular song, and that this thinking of the words will’ 
automatically bring about the correct quality of tone. 
Other points involved in good singing that may be touched upon in Grade I are: 
Not sliding to a tone, but going cleanly from one pitch to another; not breathing in the 
middle of a word or phrase; making a proper pause at the end of a phrase, etc.

exercises.. There is one objection to singing-games—namely, that the movements are| 
sometimes so violent as to make it impossible to sing well while performing them. 
Two remedies are applicable: (1) Lessen the violence of the movements, eliminating 
trunk bendings, etc. (2) Have some of the children sing while the others go through 
the movements, and then reverse the procedure, so that all may have both kinds of 
"exercise. If neither of these remedies is feasible, the singing-game had better be omitted. 
Picturing 
To help first-grade children to listen intently to the music they sing and hear, 
have them compare the auditory impressions which they are now for the first time trying 
to analyze, with certain types of visual perception already familiar. For example, 
when teaching the children to clap the pulse, it will help them get the idea of accenting 
the first of a group of three beats, if while they are clapping, the teacher will draw on 
the board a series of long and short vertical lines, thus, | | | | | these corresponding 238123 
with the loud, soft, soft of their clapping. The combination of large and small loops is 
good also, and is perhaps even more suggestive of musical rhythm: 
. 123/128 
It will be similarly helpful to draw lines of various lengths to direct attention to 
longer or shorter tones in a melody that the children are singing. For example, the 
melody of “My Country ’tis of Thee” may have its tone lengths represented thus: 
  |-— —| = ——_ ete. If this is now combined with pulse-picturing, and if 
the groups of pulses are marked off by vertical lines, we shall find the child becoming much more observant concerning (1) measures, and (2) long and short tones, than he would be if we required him to analyze auditory imagery without suggesting any com- 
parison with the visual imagery. Again, it will be of 
great value a little later on to call attention to the pitches of tones by making marks 
. on the board, a higher mark calling for a higher tone, and vice versa. The melody 
of “Swanee River,” for example, may be roughly pictured thus:

Note Concerning “America” and “ The Star Spangled Banner” 
’ Teachers who have been in the habit of requiring children to learn both of our 
national songs in the first grade may wonder why only one stanza of “America” 
included in-the above outline, and why “The Star Spangled Banner”’ is left out entirely. 
The omission is not accidental; and the editors have purposely postponed these songs, 
not because they are not in sympathy with having them learned by every child, but 
because the words are so difficult even to pronounce correctly at this stage that the 
child often gets into the habit of singing them in a wholly distorted fashion; and later 
on it is almost impossible to correct the mistakes because they have become so thoroughly 
learned. We believe in the singing of our national songs; we feel that every child ought 
to be required to memorize them and that such memorizing might well form a part of 
the public school promotion test at the end of the third and fourth grades; but we are 
certain that these songs will be better sung in every way if we do not insist upon teach- 
ing them too early. Let both songs be played often and let the children, from the 
first, form the habit of standing at attention during the music; but let us not try to 
teach all {fe stanzas of “America” before the second grade, and let us postpone teach- 
ing “The Star Spangled Banner’’ until the third or fourth grade. 
Educational Council’s Recommendation for Grade I 
The Educational Council * of the Music Supervisors’ National Conference has 
published a bulletin concerning the aims, material, procedure, and attainments for 
each of the eight grades, and as these recommendations seem reasonable and valuable, 
they will be. quoted in this book in connection with the discussion of the work of each 
year. The Council’s recommendations for Grade I are as follows: 
Ams 
(a) To give every child the use of his singing voice and pleasure in song as a means of expression. 
(0) To cultivate the power of careful, sensitive aural attention. 
(e) To provide the pupils, through accompaniments to some of their songs and the hearing of much 
good music, an experience richer than that of their own singing. 
(d) To give every child enjoyment of music as something heard as well as something expressed. (Appre- 
ciation of Music.) « 
*The members of the Educational Council when these recommendations were adopted were: Mr. Will Earhart, 
chairman; Mr. Karl W. Gehrkens, secretary; Mr. Hollis Dann; Mr. Peter Dykema; Mr. Charles H. Farnsworth; 
Mr. T. P. Giddings; Miss Alice Inskeep; Mr. Osbourne McConathy; Mr. W. Otto Miessner; Mr. C. H. Miller.

Material: Book One Completed. Primer (Second Semester Only) 
After having been in school a year the child will have gained both in mi 
and in power of concentration sufficiently so that his work may now be max 
more strenuous. His principal need is still, as in the first year, to sing anc 
as much good music as possible; but because he has now had a year of music: 
we shall expect considerably more of him in the second grade than we did 
and we shall plan the second year’s work in music much more definitely as i 
for the still more formal activities of the third grade. In fact, the second ; 
eminently the place in our school system where the child must learn (per: 
first time in his life) to control his attention. . This ability to keep the min. 
subject for a period of even five to ten minutes, if once attained, will et 
accomplish almost anything. On the other hand, if the child has not lea 
end of this second year to attend to a given matter for a brief period, his 
will have been in many respects a failure; and the teacher had better see in wuat aurec- 
tion her methods may be revised. 
We shall begin the second year with a review. of all that has been done in Grade I, 
and shall hope at the close of it to have every child able to sing with more sweetness, 
accuracy, and expression, and to listen to music much more intelligently and with a 
far higher degree of concentration... We shall expect also to find him able to sing the very 
easiest melodies at first sight without any assistance from the teacher or an instrument.

facility.-in reading music at sight, we must stringently guard against stressing the 
technical. so strongly that the musical shall be lost sight of; otherwise the children will 
come to: dislike the whole course in music. Not every detail of even elementary music 
study can be made esthetically attractive; but.surely the course as a whole can be so 
arranged that pleasurable art experience shall constitute at least a part of each lesson, 
and that must be our constant care from this point on. During this second year, - 
therefore, at least one-half of the time assigned to music must be given ‘over to rote- 
singing and. listening lessons. Never at this stage take. an entire lesson: period for | 
purely technical work. 
Begin the year by reviewing a dozen or more of the best songs learned in Grade I. 
Select these in accordance with your own preferences and the children’s wishes. Spend 
several weeks on these songs, and during this time try to inspire your pupils to sing as 
sweetly and.as expressively as possible. -Do not allow them to sing loudly, and be sure 
to give the correct pitgh for each song every time. Have individual singing at once, 
requiring each of several children to sing a phrase of any given song... Watch posture, 
be sure that the words are pronounced clearly, and see to it that each song is sung in 
the mood ‘that is appropriate to its text. Work with “monotones” if any remain 
uncured. To avoid monotony (1) use the phonograph occasionally. and (2) teack 
some of the-new rote-songs in Book One, following directions for teaching rote-songs 
as outlined“in Methods and Directions, Book One. 
After three or four weeks of these informal activities, begin the more definite 
work of the year, spending approximately one-half of the time in learning new rote- 
songs, in singing old ones for the joy of it, and in listening to musical selections of varied 
‘character; and using the other half in carrying on the work preparatory to sight-singing, 
as directed in the following pages. Read carefully all directions for Grade I and note 
that practically all of these directions apply to Grade II as well. 
Begin the formal work of the year by reviewing the ten Observation Songs i in Book 
One, the syllables to which have been learned in Grade I. Review the picturing of the 
pulse, the:duration, and the pitch of these songs, as directed for Grade I. Have the 
children. anake the loops, dashes, ete., in the air while you make them on the board, 
and while the song is being sung by all the voices. See to it that individual children 
shall be able’to.sing the syllables for these songs. Call attention again to phrase repeti- 
tion. » Ask individual pupils to act as teachers, these “teachers” correcting mistakes 
made during-the individual singing, etc. This will take another month, because during™ 
the mantle one-half of the music period, remember, is being-spent in learning new rote- 
songs, in listening lessons, etc. : 
- In the.third month half of the time is to be spent in teaching new rote-songs, in

singing old ones (both those taught in the preceding two months, and some o 
first-grade songs), and upon listening lessons, including performances by out: 
cians who may be invited to sing or play, and perhaps songs sung by groups o 
from higher grades. The children are to be trained to sit quietly and attenuvay ~, 
such oceasions, and to fix their attention solely upon the music, both when singing an! 
listening. 
The other half of the time in the third month is given to a first p 
music notation. In other words, the children are now. to be shown the 
songs that they have been singing. This is done by showing them the te

which is the most important problem this year. Try constantly to i

persistently in this grade that when they get through “they are not a

doing.” ‘ 
After about two weeks of such work, teach four new Observatioi 
as follows: Place the chart before the children, sing the syllables « 
being studied, and point to the notes. After you have sung it two 
the children try it, helping them if necessary. If it does not go wel 
again, asking the class to note where “do” is, and stimulating k. 
Now let them try once more; if they concentrate they will get it. Hs 
uals sing all or part of the song by way of variety, and when the entice cue vu ong 4 
nicely by syllable, allow them all, as a reward, to sing the words, with accompaniment 
if an instrument is available. 
In the fourth month again, the learning of new rote-songs, reviewing old ones, anc 
listening lessons occupy about one-half the time, the emphasis, of course, to be or 
Christmas songs. In the “work lesson” all the Observation Songs thus far learner? -- 
to be reviewed, but now with the far more difficult requirement that we shall lez 
begin with any phrase designated by the teacher (or pupil teacher). That is, 
singing the entire song, the teacher points to the fourth (or some other) phrase (c
-P-A-G-E-64
METHODS AND DIRECTIONS 55 
i | chart) and says, “Now sing this phrase,” and every pupil must learn to find the correct 
, 
, tone with which to start. This is difficult, but it can be made a game, and by having 
one child after another act as teacher, they will all learn to begin with any phrase that 
may be designated. Vary this by beginning with the first phrase, telling the class to 
stop singing at the instant you stop pointing; then after a moment’s pause point to the 
next note and goon. All this, of course, is done in order to aid the children to associate 
the notes with the tones. Teach six new Observation Songs by syllable as directed 
previously. 
In the fifth month the same process is continued, all twenty songs being used, but 
now with the addition of another difficulty. This new problem consists of commencing 
at almost any point in the song, not necessarily at the beginning of a phrase. - That is, 
instead of pointing to the beginning of a phrase, point to the second note of the second 
phrase, for example, and ask the singers to start here. This is much more difficult, 
and some children will not be able to do it, so do not press this type of drill to the extent 
of making any child unhappy. It is excellent training, however, and still further 
establishes the association between music and its notation. Besides using songs already 
studied by syllable in this way, five new Observation Songs are to be learned from the 
charts, the syllables first, and then the words, as directed for the preceding ones. 
The sixth month in many school systems begins the work of a new term or semester, 
and this seems a convenient and appropriate point at which to place a music book—the 
Primer—in the child’s hands. This book is small and is to be completed by the end of 
the year. It contains the thirty Observation Songs which we are studying, a number 
of new rote-songs, and a small selection of easy melodies for the first sight-singing. 
The words and melodies of the rote-songs are printed in the Primer simply because the 
songs will be more quickly learned in this way. The teacher may use her judgment 
as to whether or not the children shall commit the songs to memory. In the first grade, 
it was necessary that all songs should be memorized, but once the children have learned 
to read and write, the number of songs to be mémorized can be reduced, and the time 
thus saved used in a more profitable way. These rote-songs in the Primer are to be 
taught like ordinary rote-songs except that the children have the words and music 
before them as the teacher sings, so that the songs need be heard but a few times before 
the children will be able to sing them. No syllables are to be used with the rote-songs in 
the Primer. Remember that one-half of the time in this month as in all other months 
of the year is to be devoted to rote-singing, listening lessons, and other forms of musical 
experience yielding esthetic pleasure. 
The notation work consists of two parts: (1) The Observation Songs are sung by 
syllable from the charts as before, with the problem of beginning at any point in the 
songs. (2) The same Observation Songs are sung from the books, the children learning 
to point to the notes in their own books, and learning also to begin at various places 
in the song as directed. In this latter exercise, refer to the lines of music.on the page 
as “staffs,” and direct the class to begin with the “first staff, second measure, third note,” 
or “fourth staff, first measure, third note,” etc. From time to time point out various 
details of notation—staff, clef, sharp, flat, signatures, measure signs, measure, double

bar, etc., so that these terms shall become thoroughly familiar as the names of ** 
common musical symbols. While it is not desirable to require children to lee. 
tions at this stage, it is often feasible to give them an informal explanation « 
of the commoner symbols of music. The last five Observation Songs are to | 
during this month. 
The work of the seventh month i is a continuation of what has been star! 
sixth, more and more skill being acquired in associating notes with tones. Th 
may now sometimes sing the words or syllables of a single phrase, asking th: 
to tell where it is (first staff, second staff, ete.). If this is “easy” play the | 
organ or piano, or sing with “loo.” If this is still “easy” begin at other point: 
beginning of a phrase, and play or sing, the children looking at their books ai 
you just where you have begun —“third staff, third measure, second note,” ew. 
If all this is completed before the end of the month, have the class begin the actua 
sight-singing by doing a few of the melodies in Part II. If these do not go well a 
once, postpone further attempts at sight-singing until the nex* ~-~-** 
During the remainder of the year continue all activitic 
paragraphs, as may be necessary. In addition, a small amour.

work, have the children look carefully at the melody on the cl:

The Educational Council’s recommendations for Grade II are as follows: 
AIMS 
(a) The aims of the First Year again; namely, continued curing of monotones (to give 
the use of his singing voice); development of song-singing; enrichment and extension of son; 
further development of aural power; further development of appreciation, including pleasurak. _ - a 
to the expressive features of songs and to the beauties of musical structure. 
(6) To continue the development of the power to recognize aurally simple phrase groups of tone: 
and of the feeling for simplest rhythms. The introduction of the staff may occur as early as the middl« 
of the First Year or as late as the beginning of the Third Year, depending upon the order of procedure. 
MarTERIALS 
(a) Rote-song books in the hands of the teacher. 
(6) Books containing easy rote-songs (some of which may be in minor keys) and th: ~*~ 
in the usual nine major keys to be used in the development of sight-singing, if begun: - 
least to be printed in large type and open distribution on the page; and both groups 1 
shall be placed in the hands of the children. . 
(c) Some large display form of material that is to be studied; either in some chart for 
(d). A pitch-pipe and staff-liner. 
(e). A keyboard instrument for playing accompaniments, 
(f) A phonograph and some twenty-five good records of music. 
PRocEDURE. 
(a) Singing rote-songs for pleasurable musical experience. 
(b) Imitative exercises for curing so-called “‘monotones.” 
(c) The use of the staff in practicing or Preparing for sight-singing. 
(@) Frequent practice in individual sifging. 
(e) Ear-training for the development of ‘tonal and rhythmic thinking. 
(f) Occasional use of. accompaniments to songs previously learned. 
(g) Learning to listen to. good compositions for the sheer joy and charm of their beauty. Also to 
listen to the salient features of the imitative or descriptive phrases involved; and to the siniple arrangement 
of recurring phrases or “tunes” and rhythmic patterns. 
ATTAINMENTS 
(a) Ability to sing correctly and pleasingly forty to sixty new songs, twenty of which, with two stanzas 
of “America,” are to be memorized. It is also suggested that some of the songs of the First Year be kept 
in repertory. 
(6) Ability of 90 per cent of the pupils to sing individually, freely, correctly, and without harmful vocal 
habits, six or eight of the songs sung by the class as a whole.
-P-A-G-E-70
  (ce) Not more than 5 per cent of the entire class to be “monotones” at the end of the year. The other 
_ pupils to sing without bad vocal habits, with musical enjoyment, and with good musical effect. 
(@) Ability by the end of year (or by middle of the following year aceording to procedure) to sing at 
sight, with syllables, easy melodies in the usual nine major keys, containing notes and rests one, two, three, 
and four beats in length, and employing diatonic tones in stepwise progressions and with simple skips. 
{e) Ability to recognize some five or six compositions on hearing’ the first few measures of éach, to 
follow and recognize a recurrent theme in a new song ot new piece of very simple structure; anda tendency 
to prefer compositions that have real musical merit and charm, to those that are weak and common. 
Grave III 
Material: Book Two; Major Tone-group Drill.Cards 
In ‘this grade the pupil makes his first serious attempt to learn to read music. 
Half of the music period throughout the year is still to be consistently devoted: to 
actual music experience, such as singing familiar songs, learning new rote-songs, and 
listening lessons. But the ability to sing from notation at first sight is so valuable that 
we are justified in devoting the other half entirely to sight-singing and its related activ- 
ities. Guard, however, against allowing the technical work to overstep the bounds of 
“one-half of the music period,” and make certain that this larger emphasis on what 
must be characterized as largely non-esthetic material shall not militate against holding 
the pupils’ interest in music as an enjoyable activity. This can be-accomplished by 
a judicious planning of the daily lessons so as to have a mixture of real musical experience 
and technical drill; by arousing competition in the technical work; by appealing to the 
pupils’ pride; and by explaining that such work is necessary in preparation for the 
later reading of beautiful music that would otherwise be altogether beyond the pupils’ 
reach. 
The chief technical work of the year is the learning of a large number of tone- 
groups in major, these being dictated, sung from notation, etc., as directed for the latter 
part of Grade II, and toward the end of the year written on the staff by the pupils. 
Have constant individual recitations in these various activities, but make the drill 
period short and lively. Three minutes a day of the right kind of concentrated work 
will do wonders. . 
- In the sight-singing exercises, insist that all pupils * “point,” reminding them if 
necessary that the half note is given two “points,” the dotted half, three, and the 
whole note, four. The rests are learned early in the year, and if there is trouble in 
observing them, the children are asked to whisper softly the word “rest” as they point 
to the character. 
In the sixth month the pitch names of lines and spaces are to be taught: They 
are ealledpitch names because they refer to definite fixed pitches as contrasted with 
the syllable names which always refer to relative pitches. The best way to teach the 
pitch names is.to tell the children that the clef is merely a derived form of the letter 
“G” and that it is placed on the second line to mark ‘that line as standing for the pitch 
“G” @). ‘Now tell them that there are only seven letters in the. ‘musical alphabet, , METHODS AND DIRECTIONS os 61
-P-A-G-E-71

and that these are used again and again thus: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b 
e, d, etc. Have them begin at various points and repeat them, thus: e, f, g, a, b, ¢ 
d, e; f, g, ete., or g, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, a, b, etc. Next tell them that each line an” 
on the staff is called by one of these letters in regular order, so if the seconc. 
““g” the space above is “a” and the next line “b,” etc., while the first space is “ 
first line “e,” etc. Now have the children repeat the names of the lines and sp: 
regular order up and down, not always beginning with the first line. Ask them t- 
qut the names of the space below the first line and the space above the fifth Ii, we 
Practice reading pitch names and note values, each child in turn reading one measured 
aloud, and all pupils keeping their fingers on the place so as to be ready tot 
When all this goes well, call attention to the sharp and flat. These charact 
the name of the line or space on which they are placed, and when found in th: 
they likewise modify all other degrees of the same name. Thus, for example, 
line 5 means that the name of the fifth line is f-sharp, but it means that the 
is f-sharp as well; also the third added line below, and the space above the third J 
above: SS. This same principle applies in the case of 
= 
and flats. Have the children practice reading in the keys of G and F until 
is clear, later taking up keys involving more sharps and flats. A new activi 
duced in the last few weeks or months of the year. This consists of pro 
pupil with. staff paper or a music writing-book, and asking him to write th 
. the tone-groups that he has been learning, as these are played on the pianuy ur sung 
with “loo” by the teacher. First, however, give the class a little practice in making 
the clef, showing them that if it is begun on the second line and the scroll made first, 
thus Eee, the remainder of the character is simply a downward stroke with 
a little curl at the bottom. If necessary, dictate a few of the tone groups by speaking 
the syllable names until the children become accustomed to writing on the staff. Have 
the class use the whole note in this written work on account of the greater ease with 
which it is made.

The Educational Council’s recommendations for Grade III are as follows: 
Am 
(a) Continued correction of “monotones”; development of free and beautiful singing of songs; devel- 
opment of the song repertory along lines appropriate to the taste and expanding powers of the children; 
development of aural power and extension of it to new features; further development of appreciation, 
particularly in the direction of pleasurable attention to the expressive and structural beauties of music. 
(b) Develop an elementary degree of power and skill in independent sight-singing. 
Marerian 
(a) Books of music in the hands of the pupils; these books to contain three types of musical material; 
namely: 
(1) Rote-songs of appropriate interest and elaborateness; 
(2) Songs that may be taught partially by rote and partially by reading; 
(3) Easier material for sight-singing. 
All of this material, with the possible exception, of the first group, should be printed. in large 
type, with open distribution upon the page.

The work of the fourth grade is essentially a continuation of that of the third, the 
big new: problem being the learning to read several of the more complicated rhythmic - 
figures. ° The children’s voices are steadily improving, and the singing ought now to 
be so beautiful as to furnish no little esthetic satisfaction to both pupils and teacher. 
As before, singing familiar songs with fine tone quality, correct enunciation, and appro- 
priate expression is perhaps the most valuable activity of the year,-and if only one

thing can be accomplished, this is undoubtedly the thing to choose. But in addition| 
to singing beautiful songs beautifully, the pupils should be making great strides in’ 
the direction of greater speed in reading music, and of greater intelligence regarding 
the essential facts of music—if the work has been well planned and carefully directed. 
Even a fifteen-to twenty-minute daily music period will permit of large progress along 
these. other lines if the lesson plans are carefully made and the work is carried on ener- 
getically and intelligently. 
At the beginning of the year we shall need to review some of the best songs learned. 
in the first three grades, as well as all of the theoretical work previously taken up- 
This review of theoretical work will begin with practice in naming the symbols, their 
spelling being noted. It will be well to make certain that everyone can spell the so-fa 
syllables, and of course all note and rest values (from the whole to the eighth inclusive) 
should be reviewed. It will be of some value to have the children told that a whole 
note equals four quarter notes, two half notes, etc., although such knowledge has little 
application to reading musical rhythm. 
Drill on tone-groups by means of flash’ cards, ete., is still very important and should 
be continued for at least two months, although many pupils doubtless will have re-learned. 
all the groups by the end of a few weeks. If Series IV have not been learned in Grade III 
they should be learned now. Children who know the material thoroughly should 
sometimes be excused from the drill, and given other work to do. As soon as a tone- 
group is so well known that any child in the room can sing it alone at any time, take 
the card out, so that there shall finally be left only a few cards to work on, these, too, 
being dropped out as they are learned. The children are to write these tone-groups on 
the staff, as in the latter part of Grade ITI, the “Music Writing Book” being purchased 
by each pupil for this purpose. An occasional drill period on these tone-groups through 
the entire year is recommended. 
The pitch names of lines and spaces (staff degrees) are reviewed, including the 
added lines above and below. Note particularly the fact that a sharp or flat modifies 
the names of all degrees having the same letter-name, if this character is found in the 
signature. Give the children practice in reading pitch names and note values as 
directed for Grade IIE. 
The hardest work of the year will be the learning of the first four more complex 
rhythmic figures which are encountered in ordinary music Jd d. ~ 1D 
The group of two eighths to a beat was just touched upon in the third grade, and the 
aim is now to make the children so familiar with this and the other three figures that 
their notation will automatically bring up the correct rhythmic response in sight-singing. 
Each of the types is introduced through a rote-song, the children beating time or mark- 
ing the pulse on the desk as they sing. Many exercises follow, containing the rhythmic 
figures, and the book work may be supplemented by additional melodies from “Supple- 
mentary Sight-Singing Exercises.” Occasionally, by way of variety, have the children 
tap the rhythm exercises with pencils while they count aloud or have half the class 
clap the pulse while the others tap the rhythm. To have the children beat the pulse
-P-A-G-E-76
METHODS AND DIRECTIONS — - . 67 
while they sing these exercises at sight is very helpful in teaching rhythm, but to have 
the teacher do it continuously is weakening, and in the end demoralizing. Asa “stunt” 
let them see how many in the room can beat the pulse steadily with one hand and tap 
the rhythm clearly with a pencil in the other hand. This will not be possible for all, 
arid should, therefore, not be required or even stressed very much. 
The drill cards should be of great help in teaching the rhythmic figures. These 
cards contain short rhythmic motives based on very easy intervals. Have the motives 
sung both by the class and by individual children, emphasizing time-beating; then 
whenever in a new song a particular figure causes trouble, refer back to the card con- - 
taining it, after which it should be comparatively easy for the children to sing the 
new melody containing the same figure. 
Note that time-beating by the children is very necessary in all of this rhythm 
work. Time-beating means beating or tapping the pulse: two beats to each measure in 
2/4, three beats in 3/4, etc. Any other kind of muscular movement would do equally 
well, the hand being used simply because it is more convenient. 'The movement should 
be silent most of the time. Some children will beat the rhythm instead of the pulse, 
and in such a measureas J JJ will give a beat for each of the three notes. Tell 
them that beating time is just like marching, and show them how absurd it would be 
to march to the above rhythm by giving a step to each note. Let the teacher illustrate 
the absurdity of such marching by actually going through the performance before the 
class. 
The written work of the year consists of taking down tone-groups as played (or 
sung with “loo”) by the teacher; of copying melodies from Book Two, in order to 
acquire accuracy and dexterity in making the various symbols; and of “verbal dicta- 
tion,” which consists of melodies read from the book by the teacher and written in 
correct notation by the children. For example, a melody would be dictated thus: 
“Clef; sharp on fifth line; four-quarter measure. First note do, a quarter; next re, 
a quarter; mi, fa, eighths; so, la eighths, stroked; bar,” etc. Sometimes the pitch 
names are read instead of the syllables, thus: “g, a quarter note; f-sharp and g, eighth 
notes,” etc. When the teacher has finished reading the exercise, the pupils are to open 
their books to the page from which she has been reading, and compare what they have 
written with what is printed in the book, noting any errors that they may have made 
in the turning of stems, etc. In the last few months the pupils will be able to take down 
melodie dictation, the teacher now playing a short melody (or singing it with “loo”). 
and the pupils singing it mentally (at first orally also) and writing it down. This may 
be preceded by having the pupils sing previously studied melodies from Book Two, 
then closing their books and trying to reproduce the melodies exactly as they appear 
on the page. 
A few suggestions about conducting a tonal dictation lesson may be of value: 
1. Do‘not allow pupils to write while you are playing the melody, but stimulate. 
them in every way to listen closely and to think of nothing except how the melody 
sounds, thus committing it to memory. an
-P-A-G-E-77
68, ‘UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
2. In the early stages, test their memory of the melody by having some or all of 
them sing or hum it aloud after you have played it once or twice. If they cannot 
sing it correctly, they surely will not be able to write it. 
8. In the first few lessons the order may very well be as follows: (1) teacher plays 
the melody twice, (2) children sing it with “loo,” (3) children sing it by syllable, and 
(4) children write it in books, teacher going about the room to see whether it is correct. 
Later on the second and third steps are left out, but the teacher should always insist 
that no one begin to write until the melody has been completely played. In grading 
work of this sort, note that the writing of the correct rhythmic symbols is just as impor- 
tant as placing the notes on the correct staff degrees. That is, rhythm is coequal in 
importance with pitch, and if the rhythm is correct, but the pitch is wrong, the 
whole effort is worth just as much as though the pitch were right and the rhythm 
wrong. The new theoretical work of the year consists in Jearning the signatures of the 
first nine major keys (C, G, D, A, E, F, B-flat, E-flat, A-flat). These are taken up 
in the second half of the year, and will cause no special difficulty, as many of the children 
-will know them already from having heard them referred to so often. In taking up 
the key signatures, work a week or two with the first five; then add the other four, 
and finally drill for a week or so on all nine. Have the recitation made thus: “The 
signature of-the key of B-flat is two flats, b and e”; or, “the signature of the key of A 
is three sharps, f, c, and g.” Have the children note that “the following key in sharps 
always begins on se of the old key.” Have them note also the order of sharps, f—-c—g— 
d—a—e—h, learning these by heart both backward and forward. The reverse order 
is, of course, the way the flats appear in the signature. In drilling upon these matters, 
ask questions in various ways, for example: “What key has three sharps?” “What 
is the signature of the key of B-flat?” “If a certain key has three sharps, what are 
they, and where is do?” When they can recite the signatures with a fair degree of 
fluency, ask the pupils to write them occasionally, being very careful that the sharps 
and flats are accurately placed on the staff. 
, Asmall amount of work introductory to two-part singing may be given during this 
grade, but part-singing should not to be taken up seriously until the following year. In 
singing two-part exercises, have first one side of the room and then the other sing the 
~ lower voice, so that all may come to feel familiar with the singing of an alto part. Vary 
this by having those in the front of the room sing the upper part and those in the rear 
the lower, and vice versa. There is, of course, no such thing as an alto voice in Grade IV, 
unless some individual child is mentally retarded or has for some other reason been 
kept back in his‘ school work. Remember that boys’ and girls’ voices are essentially 
alike at this stage, and that both boys and girls must learn to sing both upper and lower 
parts. Do not “introduce” two-part work in any elaborate way. Simply have all 
learn the lower part of a-song or exercise, then all learn the upper one, finally dividing 
the room into two parts, one side singing the upper, and the other the lower; then chang- 
ing off so that the side which has been singing the upper part now sings the lower. 
If the lower part is “wobbly” assign more voices to it, and caution those singing the eo

AIMS 
I. Almost all the general aims appropriate and desirable in both early and later years in a system of 
instruction in ‘music in public schools have now been assembled. Once more they may be summarized: 
4G) To develop pleasure in song as a means of expression. 
(b) To secure free and correct use of voice in singing. 
({c) To develop musical qualities of performance of songs. 
(d) To develop a conception of music as something to be heard as well as something to be expressed. 
(e) Progressive development of power to use the printed language of music. 
(f) Progressive extension of music experience beyond that provided by the singing of the children. 
(g) Continuous development of power of appreciation by development of aural power, guided by the 
direction of attention to the elements of the beautiful in music. 
II. Specific aims of the fourth year are as follows: 
(a) Introductory steps in two-part singing. 
(b) Extension of knowledge of the tonal and rhythmic material of music along lines appropriate to the 
Fourth Year. The Educational Council’s recommendations for the fourth year are as follows: 
Marerman 
(a) Books of music in the hands of the pupils; these books to contain a very large number of songs 
of high musical merit, of which a few of the more elaborate may be learned by rote. 
(b) Blank musie paper, or music writing-books, in the hands of the pupils. 
(c) A keyboard instrument, a pitch-pipe, and a staff-liner. 
(d) A phonograph and at least twenty-five good records. 
_PRocEDURE 
(a) Singing repertory songs for pleasurable musical expression. 
(b) Individual singing to be employed as a means of strengthening individual capability. 
(c) Ear-training for the further development of tonal and rhythmic thinking involving both old and 
new problems. 
(d) The introduction of two-part singing to be by “‘chording” in two parts on sustained tones, at 
intervals chiefly of the 8d and 6th, or by rounds; both first and second parts to contain beth boys and girls; 
the voices of all to be treated as equal. 
(e) Liberal use of a keyboard instrument in - accompaniments and for purposes of explanation and 
illustration, but not for leading unfamiliar music.
-P-A-G-E-81
72 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
(f) Observing the structure of songs sung, and listening to and giving account of salient points 
structure of standard musical compositions, with a view to developing appreciation of the beauties o 
design. 
ATTAINMENTS 
(a) Continued development of song-singing and extension of repertory; this to include the first stanza 
of “The Star Spangled Banner.” 
(b) Ability of 90 per cent of the pupils to sing individually freely, correctly, and withou 
vocal habits, not less than ten of the songs.sung by the class as a whole. : 
(c) Power and skill to sing at sight music appropriate to this year. 
. (d) Ability of at least 30 per cent of the pupils to sing individually at sight the material which the 
class can read as a whole. 
. (e) Power that enables the pupils to know by sound that which they know by sight, and vice versa.’ 
(f) Increased capacity to observe. the characteristic features of song sung and music heard, such as 
recurrence of themes, salient features of interest and expressive quality; these characteristics to be men- 
tioned in so far as they strike the attention because of the pleasure they give the hearer. Also, ability to 
recognize, and write the names of some twenty standard compositions from hearing the first few measures 
of each.

Tn the fifth grade song-singing is as important as ever, and the year is | 
reviewing some of the best songs taught in the first four years. A limited n 
-these are reprinted in Book Three as repertoire songs, and additional one: 
reviewed from time to time by having the words copied on the board and th 
paniment played on piano or organ. A large number of inspiring songs will 
in the sight-singing material also, and the best of these should be added to ¢: 
toire after they have been learned. A few harder songs to be taught by 
included, and these will be a welcome relief from constantly learning songs b: 
them. 
The child voice culminates in 1 beauty during the fifth and sixth years 
" jife, and the unison singing will now be wonderfully inspiring if it is well dir: 
if the children are constantly encouraged to sing with their “best voices.’ 
a few of the brighter students in the room to beat time as a director does, 
these children conduct some-of the songs occasionally. Precise attacks ancl 
in response to the conventional baton movements, together with following | 
in retards, etc., may now be expected as a matter of course. Do not neglect, 
the texts of the songs and, when necessary, look up the meaning and pronunt 
~. the words. A few new “‘Patriotic and Home Songs” should be committed tc 
and all such songs previously learned should be reviewed from time to time. 
pupils stand sometimes while singing songs, and see that the sitting position 
“easily erect.” Bodily posture has much to do with mental alertness: Th 
of this statement is well known of course, but the effect of the body on the n 
not seem to be so well understood.

  METHODS AND DIRECTIONS © 9 3 
The technical work of the year consists of (1) review of all-theoretical facts pre- 
viously learned; . (2) reciting major scales; (3) a-study of the sharp, flat, and natural; 
(4) drill-on chromatics, and (5) both verbal and tonal dictation. A small amount of. 
sight-singing material in minor will be found in the book, but the minor mode, as such,). 
is not studied in detail until the sixth year. Singing the words first in taking up new\ 
songs is to be attempted more seriously than before, all the easier songs being treated *. 
in this way. Beating time on the desk (silently) to help in getting the rhythm is con-.. ° 
tinued as may be necessary. 'Two-part singing is emphasized throughout the’ year. 
Begin the year with a review of some of the repertoire songs. _At the same.time 
teach the material in Part I of Book Three, page by page exactly as it comes, unless 
there is some good reason for changing the order. When the children have sung as far 
as page 5, begin a review of technical material, taking up the points in the following 
order: 
1. Borrow tone-group cards from Grades TI or IV and test your pupilé on these, 
working only on such groups as prove to be uncertain. See directions for end of Grade 
Il. By way of variety, have the children write these groups occasionally as the teacher 
dictates them tonally. (Play on piano or sing with loo or la.) 
2. Review the names of the syllables, together with their spelling and the spelling 
of the symbol names, as directed for Grade IIT including also the note- and rest-values. 
3. Review the use of the clef, together with the pitch names of lines and spaces, 
including leger lines. Make certain that sharped and flatted degrees are named cor- 
rectly. (The fifth line is called F-sharp in the key of G.) 
4. Have pitch names and note values read aloud,. using songs from Book Three. 
5. Review the signatures of the first nine keys. 
All this will take at least a month, and after completing it we are ‘ready for a review 
of the rhythmic figures. Borrow Rhythm Drill Cards from Grade IV for this purpose, 
and devote the entire month to a thorough review, using melodies from Supplementary 
Sight-Singing Exercises for testing the children’s ability to read the notation of these 
rhythms at sight. For this work have the pupils “beat time”; that is, mark the 
pulse on the desk. If the intervals are easy, the pupils should now be.able to sing at 
first sight without faltering and in steady tempo, any combination of rhythmic figures 
learned in Grade IV. 
While this has been going on, we have been spending a large part of the time upon 
the first few pages of Book Three. Some of this material is in two parts, and in direct- 
ing it the teacher will need to insist on the two things without-which good part-singing 
is not possible. These are: (1) Independence—that is, “minding one’s own business,” — 
and refusing to be thrown off the track when someone else sings a different part. This 
“means concentration. (2) Hearing the other part, and “tuning” one’s voice so as 
to make it blend with the voices singing this other part. This means soft singing 
and careful listening. 
In all part-singing previous to voice mutation pupils should exchange parts con-— 
stantly. .Remember that there are usually no alto voices below the-seventh grade, 
and that the boys! voices are just as high as the girls’. If a boy complains that he 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
4 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHER’S BOOK 
“can’t sing high,” it probably is not because the song is too high, but because he is 
using his voice wrongly. The child’s voice is divided into two parts, commonly referred 
to as the “chest voice” and the “head voice.” The chest voice includes the tones 
= to_ about = or =, but if the boy sings loudly, 
a 
this lower voice can be forced up as high as <= or i ==; and the boy thinks 
that when he can sing no higher with his lower voice, he has reached his highest tones. 
As a matter of fact, however, he can in all probability go at least as high as =     
from about   
  
  
  
  
= 
or = . To get these high tones he must sing more softly, and this softer voice 
is his real singing voice, the chest tones being his “shouting voice.” To prove to the 
boy the existence of these high tones, ask him to stay for a moment after school, sound 
for him the pitches —=s= and = then —— and =, and ask 
him to go from the lower tone to the higher tone, softly. In most cases he will be 
convinced, 
It is our aim to have all children learn to feel entirely at ease in singing a lower 
part. For this reason a great deal of very easy two-part material is supplied. In 
singing two-part exercises always sound “ do,” and then have the two tones with which 
the song begins sounded together long enough to make them blend perfectly. This 
is what Mr. Giddings, in his valuable book entitled “Grade School Music Teaching,” 
ealls “tuning,” and is a highly useful device for getting the children to listen to their 
own voices. At first each part will be learned alone before the two parts are attempted 
together, but after a very short time both parts should be tried together at once. But 
if the children cannot manage it after the second or third attempt, take the parts 
separately. Keep trying, however, to get them to sing both parts together the very 
first time a song is attempted. 
Tn the third month we shall take up a more definite study of the sharp, flat, and 
natural, and here the keyboard chart in the back of Book Three will be found useful. 
Begin by teaching the names of the piano keys, explaining that some of the keys have 
more than one name, just as children do; thus, C-sharp will be the same piano key 
as D-flat, A-sharp as B-flat, and C-flat as B. Now explain that on the keyboard a 
“half step” means a tone produced by the next key either above or below, and that a 
“whole step” means two half steps—that is, a tone produced by the next key but one. 
Now show them on the keyboard chart, or on the keyboard itself if an instrument is 
available in the room, that C and D are a whole step apart, as are C-sharp and D-sharp; 
but that E-and F are only a half step distant, as are also C and C-sharp and G and 
A-flat. Practice naming the keys, finding different names for the same key, and nam- 
ing keys a half step or a whole step higher and lower than the ones named, ete. All 
this will take another month. 
Now explain that the sharp makes a line or space stand for a pitch a half step
-P-A-G-E-84
METHODS AND DIRECTIONS 15 
higher than it otherwise would; that a flat makes it stand for one a half step lower; 
and that a natural restores it to its original meaning after this meaning has been tem- 
porarily changed by a sharp or flat. State also that a double sharp is like two sharps 
and makes the degree stand for a pitch a whole step higher, while a double flat is like 
two flats, and makes it stand for a whole step lower. Have the class sing 
and then by contest iso eoeo la la ila 
to make this still clearer. Explain that there must always be a half step ‘petween 
“ti”? and “do,” and that one reason for using sharps and flats in the signature is to 
make the staff represent the correct tones of the scale. Thus, for example, beginning 
on F and singing do-re-mi-re-do-ti-do, we do not need any sharps or flats. - But call 
G do and sing the same syllables, and it will be found necessary to use F-sharp instead 
of F in order to make the ti-do sound right. Play these tones on the piano or organ 
or have the children sing them until this is clear. 
In the fourth month we shall review the signatures of the nine keys again and 
apply these signatures to reciting scales, thus: The signature of the key of D is two 
sharps, f, and c; therefore, the scale of D will read d—e—f-sharp—g—a—b—c-sharp—d. 
Of course this is really putting the cart before the horse, and the music theorist would 
say: The scale of D is d—e—f-sharp—g—a—b—c-sharp—d; therefore the sig- 
nature of the key of D is two sharps, f and c. But the children have already learned 
the signature, and for this reason the former method will be found much more direct. 
(If you teach the pupils to build scales by half and whole steps over the scale formula, 
no particular harm will be done, but on the whole, probably they had better be spend- 
ing their time in singing beautiful songs rather than going into theoretical matters 
any more deeply than is indicated above.) 
From the third month on, some of the sight-singing material will contain chro- 
matics, but no elaborate explanation need be made of these. Each chromatic tone 
used will be introduced in a rote-song, and after the song has been learned by ear, the 
phrase containing the chromatic may be sung by syllable. If this phrase is repeated 
several times there will be no difficulty in reading at sight the melodies that follow, 
especially in view of the fact that the syllable name is at first printed underneath the 
note. The same exercise will sometimes be found in several keys, at first, so as to 
make clear the various notations that the same chromatic syllable will have in dif- 
ferent keys. 
In the fifth month the pupil’s knowledge of notation is tested and confirmed by 
dictating melodies to him by pitch name, his knowledge of signatures and of notation 
informing him whether or not to place a sharp before the note when the teacher reads 
“Esherp.” Thus in dictating the following exercise, the teacher will read: 
“Key of D, three-quarter measure. First   
  
  measure, high d, a quarter note; c-sharp, a quarter; b, a quarter. Second measure, 
a, a quarter note; g,a quarter; a,a quarter. Third measure, b, a quarter note; high e, 
a quarter; high f-sharp, a quarter. Last measure, high d, a dotted half note.” Use

‘Book Three for this work, the pupils turning to the proper page after writing the melody, 
and comparing what they have written with what is printed. Note that in reading, 
the word sharp follows the letter; thus, f-sharp, but in writing on the staff the sharp 
. precedes the note. 
It will be observed that the monthly outline calls for tonal dictation in the second 
and third months, the exercises referred to being found in Part I of this book. In 
addition to the melodies thus furnished, the pupils should occasionally be asked to 
write on the staff a short melody that they have memorized. The melodies of familiar 
songs may also be used in this way. See. Methods and Directions, Grade IV, for 
suggestions concerning tonal dictation. 
In the sixth month the names of all chromatic syllables are taught, and from this 
time on the pupils are expected to be able to find the syllable name for any chromatic 
note, and to get the correct tone without much difficulty. Use the chromatic drill 
cards a few minutes a day through the entire month. In finding the syllable name of 
any chromatic, the pupils may be given the following directions: First get the syllable 
name as it would be without the chromatic sign; then decide whether the chromatic 
sign signifies a higher or a lower pitch. If higher, the syllable vowel changes to “i” 
(pronounced ee), but if lower it changes to “e” (pronounced 4), except in the case of 
“re,” which already has this sound, and which, therefore, changes to “ra” (pronounced 
rah). The natural causes more trouble than the sharp or flat. In order to make its 
use clearer, ask the pupils to commit the following to memory: ‘‘A natural on a degree 
already sharped, lowers, but a natural on a degree already flatted, raises. 
° The pupil’s knowledge of chromatic notation is now to be confirmed by dictating 
exercises containing chromatics, the children writing the correct notation. If verbal 
dictation is too easy, dictate the exercises tonally. Use for this purpose the tone- 
groups on the drill cards together with some of the easier melodies in Book Three. 
The remainder of the time is to be spent in a review of scale reciting and other 
technical activities taken up earlier in the year, and in emphasizing tonal dictation 
more strongly than before.

The Educational Council’s recommendations for the fifth grade are as follows: 
Ams 
I. General: 
(a) Continued development of free and beautiful singing of songs. 
(6) To acquire an increasingly wide musical experience. 
(ce) To develop increasing power of eye and ear in correlation. 
(d) To develop power to listen for musical beauty as well as for musical knowledge. 
(e) To develop increased power to sing at sight. 
II. Special: 
(f) "To establish two-part singing. 
(g) To develop increasing practical knowledge of the tones of the Chromatic Scale and power to use 
them. 
(4) Extension of knowledge of the tonal and rhythmic material of music appropriate to fifth year. 
(Q To develop a fair degree of power to sing unison songs at sight with words, and an elementary 
degree of power to sing two-part songs at sight with words. 
Maren. 
(a) Books of music in the hands of the pupils, these to contain unison and two-part songs for treble 
voices. 
(b) Blank music writing-paper or music writing-books in the hands of the pupils. 
(c) A keyboard instrument. 
(d) Pitch-pipe and staff-liner. 
(e) Phonograph and library of records of good music. 
. ProcepurE 
(a) Singing of songs for pleasurable musical expression, some of which should be retained in the per- 
manent repertory. 
(b) Individual singing to be employed as a meaus of confirming and establishing individual capability. 
(ce) Ear-training for the further development of tonal and rhythmic thinking involving both old and 
new problems. :
-P-A-G-E-88
METHODS AND DIRECTIONS 79 
(@) In two-part singing, the pupils to be divided indiscriminately as to sex, both girls’ and boys’ voices 
being treated as equal. (An occasional irregular voice may need to be treated as an exception.) Assign- . 
ments of vocal parts to groups to be reversed from song to song or from week to week, to give proper practice 
to the full vocal range of each pupil and to develop in each individual independence in singing the lower 
part; the alto to be taken up first on new songs that require practice on the parts separately; and to be 
sung with the lightness of voice and movement characteristic of soprano. Systematic effort to be made to 
develop sight-singing of two parts simultaneously. 
(©) Systematic attention to be given to singing words at sight when the songs contain nothing but quite 
familiar technical features. , 
(f) Liberal use of a keyboard instrument for accompaniments and many purposes of illustration and 
explanation. 
(g) Observation and analysis of salient features of design in music sung and in standard musical com- 
positions heard: such as persistent reiteration of a motive, recurrences of themes, sequential treatment 
and imaginative changes (as in “‘Morning Mood” or “Asa’s Death” from Grieg’s Peer Gynt music), or 
the divisions of the songforms (as in songs sung or in the Pilgrims’ Chorus from “‘Tannhduser”’), 
ATTAINMENTS 
(a) Continued development of song-singing and extension of repertory; this to include the remaining 
stanzas of “The Star Spangled Banner.” 
(b) Ability of 90 per cent of the pupils to sing individually, freely, correctly, and without harmful 
vocal habits not less than ten of the songs sung by the class as a whole. 
(©) Power and skill to sing at sight music appropriate to this year. 
(d) Ability of at least 30 per cent of the class to sing individually at sight the material which the class 
can sing as a whole. 
(e) Power that enables the pupils to know by sound that which they know by sight, and vice versa. 
(f) Increased capacity to observe the characteristic features of songs sung and music heard, such as 
recurrences of themes, salient features of interest, and expressive quality; these characteristics to be men- 
tioned in so far as they strike the attention because of the pleasure they give the hearer. Also, ability to 
recognize and write the names of some twenty standard compositions from hearing the first few measures 
of each.

Material: Book Three; Music Writing-book; Minor Tone-group Cards 
The beauty and brilliancy of the child’s voice culminates in the sixth grade. In 
another year many of the girls will not be able to sing so high, and within the next 
year or two most of the boys’ voices will “‘change”—that is, become approximately an 
octave lower in pitch. Make the most of the singing this year, therefore, and do not 
hesitate to use many unison songs, these to be sung just for the joy of it, and not because 
they necessarily teach anything new concerning either theory or sight-singing. If 
there are any boys who “can’t sing high” treat them as suggested in Methods and 
Directions, Grade V. Read beginning of directions for Grade V and apply the same 
points here. 
Begin the year by reviewing all the “patriotic and home songs” learned in the 
first five years, seeing to it that all words are recommitted to memory. Take a quiet 
study period for learning these words and test individual attainment by occasionally 
having the words of a stanza written out. The mistakes in spelling, etc., will probably
-P-A-G-E-89
  80. UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHER'S BOOK 
tend to cause both teacher and children to be more careful in learning the words of 
- these songs. 
During the first month review the pitch names and note values, using songs in Book 
Three for this purpose. Review the signatures of the nine keys and the names (includ- 
_ ing spelling) of the chromatic syllables. While all this is being done have the children 
study the material in the book page by page, and in addition plan listening lessons 
about once a week as-may be feasible. 
In the second month review the repertoire songs in Book Three. If these have 
been well learned, the children will sing them as joyously as ever. Use each song 
once or twice, so as not to cause the children to tire of them. Now borrow from the 
third, fourth, and fifth grades the drill cards for learning major tone-groups, rhythmic 
figures, and chromatic tone-groups, and use each set in turn for a short time until the 
material is under control again. The sight-singing material in Book Three now becomes 
more difficult, but is not abnormally hard at any time. If at any time, however, the 
songs seem too complex, use easier material selected from “Supplementary Sight- 
Singing Exercises.” 
The advance technical work of the year begins in the third month and consists 
of a careful study of the minor mode. Let the teacher begin by telling the pupils that 
the key signatures which they learned in the fourth grade do not always stand for 
the major keys with which they are familiar, but that they often represent minor 
keys. Each signature really ‘stands for two keys, the major or “do” key, and the 
minor or “la” key; and to determine whether any given song is in major or minor, 
it-is necessary to examine the music itself. If the music centers about “do” and ends 
on “do ”-it is major; but if it centers about “la” and perhaps ends on “la” it is minor. 
Thus, the signature e= sometimes stands for G-major and sometimes for e-minor. 
Minor music is not as common as major, therefore one sharp in the signature usually 
means G-major; and yet there exists a good deal of minor music, and because this 
signature does sometimes stand for e-minor, it is necessary for intelligent people to 
know both keys. : 
_A capital letter G means G-major, and a small letter e means e-minor. At this 
point the pupil should be asked to turn back to those pages in Part I of Book Three 
which contain minor material and sing again the syllables to this music, noting in 
what keys the various songs ‘are written. The way to get the name of the relative 
minor key is to find “la” and simply give its pitch name, thus: “la” in F is D; there- 
fore, the relative minor of F is D; or, “la” in E is C-sharp, therefore, the relative minor 
of E is c-sharp; and the signature four sharps represents either E-major or c-sharp 
noinor. 
When all this is clear let the children sing several minor exercises from Book Three 
and after this a song in minor, after which there should be no further difficulty in either 
reading or comprehending any of the minor material that will be found in books 
Three and Four. Be sure to make clear to the pupils that singing in minor is 
no more difficult than singing in major, and that the only reason for calling attention
-P-A-G-E-90
  METHODS AND DIRECTIONS my 81 
‘o the minor mode is to make us -more intelligent about the: music that we. sing 
and. hear. 
Most minor music will be found to have “ si” instead of “ so.” Tn other words, 
“seven of the scale is raised,” as we often say. This is done hecause it sounds better 
‘o have seven and eight of the scale only a half step apart, as in major. "When seven 
is thus “raised” the scale is called the harmonic minor scale. Later on there are melo-. 
dies with both six and seven raised, and this is referred to as the melodic minor scale. — 
When both six and seven are thus raised in ascending, they are both very likely to be 
lowered again in descending, so as not to make the effect too much like the major scale. 
After a few minor melodies have been read at sight, the children will see that a 
little drill on the characteristic minor tone-groups will help them to read minor music 
more readily; and the minor tone-group drill cards are now to be used a few minutes 
every day for several weeks. Many of these intervals are the same as those previously 
studied in major, but the feeling is a little different when they are encountered in 
minor, and this tone-group drill will be found to be highly valuable. At the end of 
Directions for Grade II of this book will be found directions for tone-group drill in 
major. Read these directions and follow them in using the minor drill cards, not 
failing to have the children write the tone-group after it has been played by the teacher. 
After another month of sight-singing and interval drill, the children’s knowledge-of the 
minor mode is to be still further strengthened by exercises in verbal and tonal dic- 
tation. Use minor melodies from Book Three for the former, and exercises found in 
Part I of this book for the latter. 
All this may sound very formidable to a teacher who has not been through the 
work before, but if carefully organized, the technical work need never take more than 
a third of the time ordinarily devoted to music, the larger part of the music period 
being consistently spent in singing familiar songs, in learning new songs’ by syllable, 
in listening lessons, etc. Some of the song material in the second part of Book Three 
will be found to be in minor, so that most of the children will have become perfectly 
familiar with the whole idea of the minor mode by the end of the fourth month. 
In the fifth month the cycle of thirty major and minor keys is to be completed, 
simply as a matter of useful general information. However, the keys having more 
sharps or flats than four are not often used in vocal music, and it is not necessary that 
children shall know them so thoroughly as they have been asked to learn the nine 
“common keys” with their relative minors. Since minor music is not nearly so com- 
mon as major; it is doubtful also whether the time spent in thoroughly memorizing the 
minor keys is justifiable in the public schools. If the pupils know the nine major keys 
thoroughly, can reason out the other six readily, and have no difficulty in naming 
the relative minor of any major key, they have all the knowledge of the key signatures 
that most of them will ever need. 
In the sixth month three-part singing is to be begun. It needs no particular intro- 
ducing. When you come to the first three-part exercise, simply say: ‘We shall now 
have to divide. the room into three sections because there are three parts’ sounding 
simultaneously.” The middle part is usually hardest, so the section singing this part
-P-A-G-E-91
82 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHER’S BOOK 
may be a little larger than the others. Most schools have no alto voices in the six 
grade, so parts should be exchanged on successive songs. If occasionally an alto voi 
or a changing voice is found, you may ask that pupil to sing the lowest part permanentl 
or at any rate excuse him from ever singing the high part. Emphasize voice blendin 
and use the “tuning” device for this purpose as suggested for the two-part work 
Grade V. Have three pupils sing a three-part exercise alone sometimes, and contin 
individual work in tone-group drill, sight-singing, etc., through the entire year. It is a 
open question whether individual singing does not do more harm than gc ~ ~ ~ 
seventh and eighth grades, but there is no doubt about its value before the voic 
The written work during the sixth month emphasizes verbal dictation, u: 
other type of work is more necessary; in which case the teacher will modif: 
to suit her particular set of conditions. In the same way, tonal dictation in buus wayyy 
and minor is to be stressed in the next month’s work. The teacher may choose betwee 
giving one entire lesson period a week for such work, or else taking several parts o' 
lessons for it. From this point on the work in Book Three will be found to consist o: 
one-, two-, and three-part material in major and minor, in application of the technica! 
work done earlier in the year. 
. A small amount of sight-singing material on the bass staff is included, 
give the children a more intelligent attitude toward the music that they see i 
hymn books, etc. Tell them that the bass staff is a device for getting on wit] 
so many added lines below the treble staff; that the bass clef is a letter “f” j 
treble clef is a letter “g”’ and that this “f-clef’’ marks the fourth line of th 
that we shall know that this line represents the first “f” below middle ‘ 
voices have not yet changed at this time, so we do not need this staff as the 
later on, when they get their tenor and bass voices; but the pianist needs it constanthy, 
and so does the trombone or tuba player in the band or orchestra. The bass staff exer- 
cises are sung just as though they were on the treble staff, the children’s unchz 
voices sounding an octave higher than the notes indicate. Make clear the fact 
their voices are sounding an octave higher. Not more than three or four lessons should 
be devoted to this work, the children who have pianos at home being encouraged to 
work further, and to try playing on their own pianos simple material written on two 
staffs. 
Written lessons during the remainder of the year are to be given over largely to 
original melodic construction. We shall not expect a deluge of masterpieces to flood 
the world as the result of such work, any more than the English teacher looks for an 
avalanche of inspiring poems and stories as the result of the practice in writing which 
- forms a part of every course in English composition. But we shall be reasonably cer- 
tain of arousing great interest on the part of the children as a result of appealing to 
their creative and expressive instincts and we shall doubtless find them growing more 
intelligent and more appreciative of the melodies invented by others, as well as more 
skilled in the art of expressing tones by means of notes. Sce Part I of this book for fur- 
ther directions and for bits of verse suitable for this work. There is no reason why orig- 
inal verse should not be invented by some of the children, and set to original music by

So far as‘ sight-singing is concerned, the plan thus far outlined culminates at the 
end of Grade VI, and by this time the pupil should be able to sing at sight any part 
(first soprano, second soprano, or alto) of any ordinary music in major or minor. If 
he cannot do so when he enters the seventh grade, it is probably either because he 
has not. ‘concentrated during the music lesson; that is, he has been lazy; or else the 
teachers have not consistently followed the directions given for the first,six grades, 
In case a large proportion of the pupils in the upper grades cannot sing-ordinary music 
at sight, there are two things to do: (1) Teach them to sing attractive union songs

by rote, and try in this way to get them interested in music as music; (2) at the came 
time use “Supplementary Sight-Singing Exercises” from the first page on, ! 
pupils gain sufficient power in taking up new music at sight so as to make : 
to use at least the easier sight-singing material in Book Four. In such an 
the suggestions for this year that follow are of course to be disregarded. 
. In considering upper-grade music, however, the editors have rather ha 
a school system where consistent work in music will have been done for six: 
where the pupils are now ready to put into practice the skill in sight-singing 
have been acquiring, by taking keen delight in the process of reading at sig 
number of attractive musical compositions, and where, furthermore, having 
tered the elementary theoretical material, they are ready to undertake certain more 
advanced steps in the understanding of music. 
A large proportion of the time through both years is to be spent in chor 
interesting material of various types being provided for this purpose in Box 
But in addition to such practice four new types of work may now profitably b 
taken, whether the work is done in the individual seventh- and eighth-yea: 
or in a junior high school. These are: (1) The study of band and orchestra 
ments. (2) Practice in transposition. (8) Some very elementary study of! 
(4) Analysis of the design of some of the most regularly constructed music. 
Tt does not greatly matter in what order these topics are taken up, a 
gesting the above sequence the editors have merely attempted to be as co 
definite as possible. If, however, any supervisor wishes to take them up in

acquired Imowledge and skill j in a highly desirable way. During this review have 
the pupils read enough new songs in Book Four to keep them from feeling that they 
are simply: doing the same old thing over again. A few lessons in melodie construction 
will help also to maintain their interest, and meanwhile the teacher may tell them 
that as soon as they have their knowledge in hand again, something new will be taken 
up.. The secret of getting on with adolescents is (1) to treat them in a somewhat 
more grown-up fashion, giving them both more liberty and more responsibility; and 
(2) to give them a chance at something new; that is, give them an opportunity to 
grow. This is the only way to hold their interest, and it is largely for this reason that 
the new kinds of. work are suggested. - 
Voice-testing 
‘The voices are now changing, and the free exchange of parts thus far practiced must 
be displaced by the singing of a fixed part for either the entire year, or else for a period 
of several months—until the voice is again ready to change to another part. This* 
means testing the voices at least twice a year, and here the services of a musical expert 
are absolutely indispensable. The voices are to be divided into at least four groups— 
namely, high soprano, mezzo soprano, alto, and “bass.” If desired, the alto may be 
subdivided into high alto and low alto, and the “bass” into bass and tenor, although 
such subdivision is usually not of any particular advantage. 
The voices are classified on the basis of range and color, the latter being on the 
whole the more important. A high soprano must be able to sing — lightly, 
easily, and without strain. An alto must be able to sing = easily, and with Is 
dark contralto color. The mezzo soprano child’s voice is like the soprano voice but 
not so high. A “bass” is a boy’s voice that has changed sufficiently so that it can 
go down to about e—— . If it does not go as low as this it is usually put on the - 
alto part, or on what is called the “alto-tenor.” The practice of having girls with 
low voices sing the tenor part is no ommended. On the other hand, the 
musical effect of the tenor part sounding an octave higher than written is bad. There- 
fore a great deal of the music for these grades necessarily must be in three parts. When 
four parts are used they will usually be first soprano, mezzo soprano, alto (not going 
lower than ———=), and bass (not going lower than B=). Urge the chil- 
a 
dren not to strain their voices in singing, and encourage them to ask for a voice exam- 
ination whenever they feel that parts on which they are singing are not appropriate 
to their voices. Never sacrifice a..unie, forthe sake of a well-balanced chorus. The wel- 
fare of the individual voice is far more important than any music: ect. that we 
can possibly expect to produce at this time. On the other hand do not be deceived 
into believing that singing will harm the changing voice of the boy. The small amount 
of singing that is done in the public schools has probably never yet injured a changing

voice, and this will always remain the case, especially if the director watche: 
dren’s facial expression, and sees to it that there is no evidence of strain. If 
curtail vocal effort on account of preserving voices, the bleachers at the 
football game will furnish a more fertile field in which to inaugurate our refi 
the music class. If a boy has a day when he feels moody and does not war 
leave him in peace—providing he is not disturbing anyone else. But if he 
moods chronically, he is probably lazy, and a private conference is sugge 
not scold him in public for not singing, until you have tried everything else 
fun at him in a mild and good-humored way usually produces the best results 
In examining voices, the best plan is to have each pupil come for a pr

range and quality, and recording on a card the child’s age, voice-range anc

minutes, or twenty per hour; but even this will be found to take a very larg 
of time, and since the work should only be done by one who is thoroughly qi 
undertake it, such a procedure will usually be feasible only in a school syst 
each building has its own teacher of music, or in the smaller places. 
If this more elaborate plan is not practicable, the next best thing is t 
scheme recommended by Mr. Giddings in his valuable book “Grade Sch 
Teaching,” to which reference has already been made. Mr. Giddings’ plan 
tially this: Each pupil in turn sings the scale by syllable from   
up ar 
octave (or as far as he can go), then down to the starting point; then down ai 
wo B= (or as near there as he can sing), then back to the starting poin 
All this is done without stopping and is repeated over and over again, loud 
the teacher has decided to what part the pupil is to be assigned. The teac 
holds up one, two, three, or four fingers to show the pupil to what section of the ras 
he is to go, and upon receiving this information, the pupil at once stops singin; 
goes quietly to the section to which he has been directed. The next pupil (wh: 
been standing, ready to begin) at once takes up the same exercise. If he misse 
pitch or falters in any way, the other pupils in the room jump into the breach 
their voices and set him right. This plan is harder on the pupils, and does not giv 
the teacher as good a chance to make a careful decision, but it has the advantage o! 
being quick, and where the teaching force is limited in number, it is often the onl 
feasible way of testing voices at all. If the pupils have been accustomed to si 
alone for six years they will not violently object to the exercise, although in gener: 
the change in size of body and in attitude of mind at the beginning of adolescence 
makes it extremely doubtful whether anything is gained by insisting upon individ 
singing as a regular school exercise in the upper grades. The pupils feel awkward, thei 
voices are often breathy, wheezy, and uncertain of pitch, and they feel that everyon 
is poking fun at them :—and all in all, their love of music is not very likely to be increased

These books should be in the school library if ae The me 
by one of the phonograph companies are of assistance also, and phono- 
graph records illustrating the tone quality of the various instruments are of consider- 
able yalue.: Professor Farnsworth suggests in his “Education Through Music” that 
some of the. boys will want to construct at least crude examples of ‘some of the stringed 
instruments in connection with their manual training activities. 
This is an excellent time to see about the formation of classes in the various string 
and wind instruments, and at least a violin class can probably be organized in almost 
any community. (For suggestions concerning such classes, see Gehrkens’ “An Intro- 
duction to School Music Teaching,” page 43.) A school band or orchestra is well worth 
while, and such organizations will not only add immeasurably to the interest of the 
music class, but will attract certain children—especially boys—to music, who might not - 
be interested at all if our instruction were confined to vocal music. 
. Transposing 
This work on instruments will lead naturally to the second of the four topics sug- 
gested—namely, transposition. Transposing a musical composition means writing 
or playing it in a higher or lower key. This is sometimes necessary in vocal music 
because the music as printed is too high or too low for certain voices. In instrumental 
music itis done because it is very difficult to manage keys with many sharps or flats 
in the case of certain wind instruments, and by transposing the part it is often possible 
to eliminate some of the sharps and flats.. This is explained under the heading “Musical 
Instruments”’.in this book, and both pupils and teachers should make themselves 
thoroughly familiar with this material in the course of these lessons in transposition. ‘ 
For the first lesson in transposition, copy on the board a melody from “ Supple- 
mentary Sight-Singing Exercises” in G. Now draw-another staff under the first one, 
and place on it the signature of the key of F, together with the same measure-sign 
found in the original exercise. The first three notes are do-so-fa; - therefore, in trans- 
posing the melody to F (a whole step lower), the first notes will be F--C—B-flat—that 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
90 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
is, do-so-fa in the key of F. Write these three notes on the staff, tell the pupils to 
copy them, and then have them go on transposing the remainder of the melody, a 
measure at a time, in their books. When most of the pupils have finished, have them 
sing the melody from their books as written in F. Now have it transposed a whole step 
higher from G, and perhaps a step and a half higher, this taking us to the keys of A 
and B-flat. This will be enough for one period, and a class that is not so well pre- 
pared may not get through more than one key in the first lesson. At the next lesson, 
take another melody in the key of C and transpose it to E and A. If this goes reason- 
ably well, take a two-part exercise and transpose it, but if the pupils are a little slow 
in catching the idea, continue the one-part work until this can be done quite fluently. 
See that the pupils transpose by groups of notes (usually entire measures) instead of by 
individual notes. It is quicker, and. will stimulate them still further to read groups 
of notes quickly in sight-singing. ~ 
After a few lessons of this type, tell them how the intervals are named. Call 
the lower note “one” and count up the scale to the higher one to find the proper name 
of any interval. Thus, the interval G to C is a fourth, because in counting up from 
the lower note we have G (one), A (two), B (three), and C (four). In the same way 
G to Ais a second, and G to E is a sixth. G to E-flat is also a sixth, as is G-sharp to 
E; but they are different kinds of sixths, and these need not be learned now except per- 
haps to note that from one to three in the major key is a major third, while in the minor 
key it is a minor third. Have them note here that a major third has four half steps, 
and a minor third only three, calling attention to the literal meaning of the words 
major and minor (larger and smaller). This explanation will take most of a lesson 
period, and there will perhaps be only just time for beginning such an exercise as this: 
Transpose No. 57 a fifth upward. At the next lesson continue the same type of work, 
asking the pupils to name various intervals like CE, D—G, D—B, etc. Assign 
other melodies to be transposed a major or a minor third upward or downward, ete., 
until the whole process is clearly understood by all. When all this is well in hand, 
have them transpose a meledy from the treble staff to the bass staff, an octave lower; 
and vice versa, a melody from the bass staff to the treble staff, an octave higher. Now 
take the soprano part of a song and have it transposed a second or a third lower. As 
written, it is too high for the altos and basses, but after transposing it, all will be able 
to sing it easily. A part-song may thus be turned into a unison song. 
Now refer again to the description of transposing instruments and have the pupils 
transpose parts for cornet in B-flat, clarinet in A, horn in F, alto in E-flat, ete. Have 
some boy bring his instrument and play some of the transposed parts. Now take a part- 
_ song in Book Four, and have the soprano part transposed for cornet, the alto part for 
clarinet, and perhaps the tenor part for a horn or alto, if one is available, and have 
these instruments or any other transposing ones that are available, play these parts 
with the piano, possibly while the entire chorus sings. This is the beginning of what 
is called orchestration, and will open up an entirely new world. All this will take all 
the time allowed to theory for the rest of the seventh year. 
In the eighth year the work in transposing and orchestration is reviewed (after
-P-A-G-E-100
  METHODS AND DIRECTIONS 91 
going over the more elementary work as directed at beginning of this chapter), and 
may be extended in any way that is desirable and feasible. In addition to this, some 
very elementary work in chord construction and in the analysis of form may be under- 
taken. It is, of course, understood that the major portion of the time is to be spent 
in chorus practice, as in the seventh year. : 
Harmony 
In Book Three some of the songs have been in three parts, and in certain cases 
the chords have been marked and the pupils have been asked to note these chords. 
Make allthis more definite and specific at this time by stating that “harmony” always 
refers to several tones sounding simultaneously as constrasted with melody, which 
means a progression of single tones. The tones sounding together are referred to as 
“chords,” a chord being defined as a group of related tones sounding simultaneously. 
Chords are built up in thirds, thus: 1—3—5. A chord on G is, therefore, G—B—D, 
or G—B-flat—D, or G—B-flat—D-flat, or possibly G—B—D-sharp; while a chord 
on C is C—E—G, or C—E-flat—G, etc. A chord of three tones is called a triad (tri 
means three), and a chord of four tones is a seventh chord (1~3—5—7); while one 
of five tones is called a ninth chord (1I—3—5—7—9). Mbost chords are triads, but 
some of their tones are usually “ doubled”; that is, used in more than one octave, or 
duplicated in different voices. In order to be a seventh chord there must be four tones 
of different names, the highest one being a seventh above the root or lowest one. The 
others are called the third and the jifth respectively.

The triad at (a) is called the chord on one (I) in the key of C, because its root is the 
first tone of the major scale of C. The chord at (b) is called the triad on five (V) because 
its root is.the fifth tone of the scale of C. The chord at (c) is the triad on one (I) with 
the root doubled. The chord at (d) is the same triad with the tones differently dis- ~ 
tributed. The chord at (e) is a seventh chord, while the one at (f) is the same chord 
with a different voice distribution. At (g) we have the triad on four (IV), while at 
(h) we have the same triad with the fifth doubled. This is called the subdominant 
triad, while the chord on five is called the dominant triad, and that on one is the tonic 
triad. (The remaining names of the scale tones may be given either here or later as 
may seem desirable. They will be found under “Auxiliary Material for the Teacher” 
in this book.) 
A¥ (i) we have a subdominant triad with the third in the bass, and this is said 
to be the chord on four in its first inversion ([Vg). (Why called inversion?) At (j) 
the same chord appears with the fifth in the bass, this being called the chord on four

“in the second inversion (IV$). No more than two inversions of a triad are 
- because the next one would bring us to the first or fundamental position a; 
‘seventh chord may have three inversions. (Why?) 
Copy these chords on the board one at a time as you present this w 
the class sing, dividing them into three or four parts, as may be nec

Now have them build chords in various ways, thus: What is the tonic cho:

subdominant triad in E-flat major? (A-flat—C-—E-flat.) What is the:

When this much is perfectly understood by everyone, go on to th 
harmonizing a melody. In making up harmony for a melody we musi: 
which has the melody tone in it and which sounds well with both the | | 
the following chords. When several chords contain the melody tone, + | 
one that sounds best. To illustrate this the teacher will copy the folli | 
on the board, turning all stems up (because when two parts appear on t! 
all stems belonging to the upper voice must be turned up in order to show | 
tones belong to soprano, and which to alto), and placing a bass staff cd 
the treble staff, which contains the melody, thus: - 
  The first note is G. What chords contain it? (C~E—G, E—G—B, G—B—1 \ 
Which one sounds best? Play or sing them, and see. (Class may be divided sections, each section sounding a tone.) Most of the pupils will decide on C—Ii “Let us have C in the bass, C doubled in the tenor, E in the alto,” says the teacher. The next tone is A, and after trying various possibilities the pupils will probably decide on F—A—C as the best-sounding chord. “When two successive chords have a tone in common, that tone is usually kept in the same voice because this results in smoother progression,” says our guide, the teacher, “therefore the second chord is written as at (b), the common tone being indicated with a tie. 
  At (c) we have the same melody note as at (a), and there is no reason why we should not use the same chord again. At (d) we may use the same chord as at (c),
-P-A-G-E-102
METHODS AND DIRECTIONS = 93 
  or else the subdominant as at (b). The former probably sounds better. Or we may 
use the tonic chord in its first inversion as at (e). In this case, the E in the alto part 
changes: to G- because the chord sounds better with the root doubled than with the 
fifth, Play or sing these chords to illustrate. At (f) the dominant chord will be found 
to sound best, and at g) the same chord, possibly with the seventh added, satisfies the 
ear. At (h) the tonic is needed again to give the effect of finality. Try. playing the 
chords F—A—C, and A—C—E, with this last melody tone to illustrate this point. 
This:much can be done in almost any school, and the teacher may go as much 
farther as she likes. If more detailed work is to be done, the children will have to learn 
-the interval names more definitely. They will also learn the two rules concerning 
(1) binding tone, and (2) contrary motion, as well as the use of the minor chords 
together with some of the other fundamental principles of elementary harmony.* 
The important thing is to make sure that the pupils study harmony as something heard, 
and not merely as something written. Combine melodic construction and the study 
of harmony, by having the melodies that have been written in one lesson harmonized 
in another. : 
Musical Structure 
The study of form or design in music involves an analysis of its plan of construc- 
tion. All music of any value has a well-defined plan, just as all buildings that lay any 
claim to-beauty have. A musical composition is no more a heterogeneous collection 
of tones, chords, and rhythms, than a beautiful building is a jumbled-up assortment 
of boards, windows, doors, and chimneys. : 
Examine the melody of “Old Folks at Home.” It has a four-measure phrase at 
the beginning, then another four-measure phrase almost like the first one, but with 
a different cadence or ending. Play or sing these eight measures. They make a 
fairly complete melody all by themselves, and if we did not know there is more to 
the tune,-we should be satisfied to close at the end of the eighth measure. Such a 
bit of music is called an eight-measure “period,” and most music is made up of such 
“periods.””’ (It would be more logical to call them sentences because they are made 
by combining phrases.) A period is defined as a little piece of music either complete 
in itself or forming a part of some larger composition. When it-belongs to the larger 
composition, it does not always come to as definite a close as the one we have been 
studying. A period must always have two balanced phrases, the first of which -is 
called the antecedent, or thesis; the second, the consequent or antithesis. The melo- 
dies we wrote in the sixth grade were nearly all eight-measure periods. Look them up. 
“Supplementary Sight-Singing Exercises” has many examples of period construction. 
Have the pupils find examples. Let the teacher make up an antecedent and the pupils 
invent a consequent to follow. All periods are not eight measures long, but most 
of them are, and we shall have time to deal with only the most common type. 
All this will take quite a number of lessons. When the period form is clearly 
* See Heacox’s “‘First-year Harmony” (Ditson) for suggestions.
-P-A-G-E-103
94 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
understood go back to “Old Folks at Home.” What happens after the first eight 
measures? The same eight measures are repeated exactly. And what next? There 
is an entirely new melody with a different rhythm, a different direction of melody 
tones, and a higher pitch register. This is followed by another four-measure phrase 
which will be found to be identical with phrase two. Now let us see: The melody 
has six phrases which are combined, in pairs, into three periods. The consequents 
of all the periods are identical, and the antecedents of one and two are also alike. But 
the antecedent of period three is different. Why? Play the entire song, but instead 
of the antecedent of period three as written, play the antecedent as it occurs in periods 
one and two. Now play it all as written again. Why better as Foster wrote it? The 
class will probably decide that it is because of the fact that more variety is secured 
by having something entirely new at this point, and that it is this variety that makes 
the melody more interesting. 
Here we have the two principles upon which all music is constructed: ) There 
must be repetition in order to get symmetry and what is called “unity”’—that is, a sense 
of oneness, or belonging together; (2) this repetition must be relieved by some sort of variation 
or contrast in order to avoid monotony. 
Play the consequent of the first period twice. Do we like that? No. Now play 
the first period as written. It sounds better because, although most of it is the same, 
there is just a little difference at the end. This is called variation. What a relief 
the new melody at the beginning of the third period was, and yet how well the 
same old theme sounds when we come back to it again in the consequent of this 
same period! In order to make it easier to refer to repetition, variation, and contrast 
in these lessons, let us use letters to refer to the six phrases of “Old Folks at Home,”’ 
as follows: A A’ A A’ B A’, If a phrase, A, is repeated with a different sort of varia- 
tion, let us call it A’. 
Analyze a number of melodies, indicating by letters how | the he phrases are repeated 
or varied, and subdividing the melody into periods thus: AA A’ AA’ A’B BA’ . See “Sup- 
plementary Sight-Singing Exercises,” for suitable material. 
The “theme and variation” is a common form of construction in the larger instru- 
mental pieces. In this case, we have the same melody each time (usually the theme 
is a short piece of music like a period), but each time it is varied in some way. Some- 
times the melody i is an octave lower, sometimes the accompaniment is changed; again 
it is in minor instead of in major, etc. Look up Schubert Op. 35 in A? as an example 
of this type, and have it played if possible. Ask pupils who play the piano well, to 
bring other examples. 
The Rondo is another common type of design. Here we have the same melody 
again and again in the same form, but eaeh repetition is separated from the preceding 
one by some sort of contrasting melody, thus: A B A CA B’ A, etc. For examples 
of rondo, see Beethoven Rondos C, G, A.—Mozart 3 Rondos. 
_ The most common type of construction is probably the ternary form. This has 
three parts, the first and third of which are either exactly or approximately the same 
(repetition) while the middle part is quite different (contrast), Many dances and
-P-A-G-E-104

other simple pieces are written in this form, and of the larger forms it is on the whole 
the easiest to recognize when heard. For examples of the ternary form, see the Scherzo 
ztrom Beethoven’s “ Moonlight’ Sonata,” Opus 27. 
Thematic variation is one of the most interesting expedients for avoiding monotony. 
This consists in taking a bit of melody, and twisting, turning, stretching, and com- 
pressing it in many different ways, but always keeping its original contour sufficiently 
clear so as to make it recognizable as the same theme. Thus a theme like that at (a) may 
be varied as at (b), (c), (d), and in hundreds of other ways. Play or sing these varia- 
tons ana ask pupils to invent “ns : 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  henie variation is found mostly in instrumental music. Those who are studying 
piano may be asked to bring their piano music to school, especially compositions like 
sonatas and sonatinas, and play examples of thematic variation that they have found. 
The whole subject of design will be found to be fascinating, but this is probably 
as far as eighth-grade pupils should be expected to. go; and there will naturally be 
many schools in which other types of work have not been. brought to that point of 
perfection which will justify the teacher in taking time for even this much.

best of these qualities of feeling as agencies toward the reinforcement and upbuilding of fine and strong 
élements of character. 
(c) To articulate more closely for the pupils, individually and collectively, the musical interests and 
activities of the school with those of their homes and their community. 
(d) To recognize and encourage the special interest that pupils of this age have in the mechanism, 
technique, and use of musical instruments. 
(e) To recognize and encoutage special individual musical capabilities as a feature of @ an avocational 
as well as a vocational stage of development. 
(f) To pay special attention to the diverging needs of the voices of the pupils. 
(g) To strengthen and extend technical knowledge and capability with reference to tonal and rhythmic 
elements and features of staff-notation and sight-singing. 
(hk) To add to the appreciation of the formal elements in music an appreciation of the moods charac- 
teristic of romantic and modern music. :

Tue Purm Wxo Has Never Hap Any Music 
It often happens that some boy or girl enters an upper grade without having had 
any musical instruction whatsoever. In such a case the teacher is usually willing 
to give extra time to helping him catch up with the class but does not always know 
exactly what to do. Conditions vary and each case must be treated individually, 
but the following general order of procedure has been found practical: 
1. Give the pupil the order of the so-fa syllables. Tell him that each line and 
space is called by a syllable name, locate do for him in some simple song in his book, 
and have him write out the syllables for this song. Correct his mistakes, and then 
have him do the same thing in the case of several other songs in different keys. 
2. When he can write out and read syllables fairly accurately teach him to find 
do from the right-hand sharp or flat, and give him practice in locating do in quite a 
number of songs, having him sometimes write out and read aloud the syllables for 
a measure or two after he has located do.

3. Teach him the note and rest’ values and the names of the measure signs and 
have him read several songs thus: “This song is in three-quarter measure. First 
measure, quarter note, quarter note, quarter note; second measure, dotted quarter 
note, eighth note, quarter note; next measure, three quarter notes; next measure, 
dotted half note.” 
4. Have him sing the syllables for a few familiar songs and teach him to beat 
time, giving two beats to a half note, etc. - 
5. Teach him the use of the G clef and the pitch names of the lines and spaces as 
directed for Grade TI. . 
6. Have him read both pitch names and note values. / . 
7. By this time or before he will probably be ready to try a simple melody at 
sight by syllable, singing the correct syllables and pitches and giving the tones their 
proper duration. 
_ 8. Teach the signatures of the first nine keys. 
9. Give practice in simple verbal dictation. 
Nore. During all this time encourage the pupil to take part in the regular daily music lesson, doing more and more 
of the work from day to day as he gains in knowledge and skill. . 
Tur OpsERVATION SONG 
As its name implies, an “Observation Song” is one in which there is something 
special to be observed. It is always taught largely or entirely by ear, and after it has 
been well learned its notation is to be studied. The first Observation Songs are intended 
to teach the general principles of music notation, but later on each new tonal and 
rhythmic effect is studied, first by ear in the Observation Song introducing it, then by 
noting carefully what the notation is that stands for this particular effect. We are 
thus following the general pedagogical procedure of going from the whole to its parts, 
as well as the universally accepted maxim “From the thing to the sign.”

INTRODUCTION 
TO MUSIC APPRECIATION LESSONS 
{It is not our intention to convey the idea that the following type lessons must 
be followed in a strict sense. They are presented as model lessons for the grade teacher, 
who may either use them as they are, or may substitute other music material from 
phonograph records, player-rolls, or the actual music material of the grades, provided 
the general character of presentation is maintained—Epitor’s Norz.]

PREFACE 
To awaken and develop musical thought and judgment is one aim of music appre- 
ciation; to call into play the power to perceive the xsthetic and spiritual significance 
of music is another aim. 
The first-named aim seems to receive due consideration in the ‘music class room, 
but how often the second aim is lost in the teacher’s eagerness to fulfill the first! 
There is a surprising number of adults—shall we add, many music teachers?— 
who can name and describe every instrument of a symphony orchestra, can name 
the principal compositions of every great composer and can recite. music facts by the 
hour, but have not the power to sit quietly and partake of the esthetic and spiritual 
significance of the music they hear. They have developed musical judgment, but 
have they “chosen the better part”? 
Capacity to listen properly isthe greatest test of musicianship and of musical 
intelligence. 
These two aims: (1) developing musical judgment, (2) developing power to per- 
ceive the esthetic and spiritual significance of music, have been kept in mind in the 
working out of the eighty succeeding lessons. The ten lessons of each grade are 
type lessons, not necessarily consecutive. In every group will be found those which 
emphasize one of the two aims mentioned. 
Lessons in contrasting rhythms, the study of music form, folk music, musical 
terms and descriptive music in which the listener is developing mental alertness— 
all of these type lessons, and many others, have for their aim the development of musical 
judgment. 
The esthetic appeal may be entirely lost in the types just named. However, 
the wise teacher sees to it that no music-appreciation period ends without some attention 
being given to the esthetic and spiritual significance. 
The “quiet listening” lesson best serves the second aim. It will be noticed that 
all the succeeding lessons are continually suggesting “quiet listening.” Why not 
’ occasionally stop counting recurring themes and noting the entrance of different instru- 
ments long enough to listen to the music? 
Let us ever keep in mind that we want to develop a nation of music lovers, not 
music analyzers. 
Hearing a beautiful selection many times is necessary to full appreciation. There- 
fore, the same material is listed many times in these lessons. 
Only the things which are likely to be encountered in the experience of a pupil 
of the elementary schools have been treated. 
108
-P-A-G-E-113
104 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
‘These lessons have been worked out in the class room. It is hoped the suggested 
presentations may help teachers in arousing interest. Then, if the music is given a 
chance, it will do the rest. 
Keep in mind that the music-appreciation period should be spent in hearing music, 
not in talking about it. Shakespeare’s statement, “The appetite increases by what 
it feeds upon,” is nowhere truer than in musical experience. 
If by providing an acquaintance with the great masterpieces of music literature 
we can develop taste—a taste for the beautiful, which will function alike in art, poetry, 
and music—we shall give to the students a priceless and permanent possession.

  MUSIC APPRECIATION LESSONS 
FIRST GRADE 
Lesson: 1 
Rhythmic Development through Kindergarten or First-grade Band 5 
Start with simple march, giving every child an opportunity to play a drum. -(Sat- 
isfactory drums are easily made from oatmeal boxes.) 
When using a sound-producing instrument, if a child does not play in rhythm 
with the piano or phonograph he will discover it for himself, which is much more effective 
than having the teacher discover it. Playing an imaginary instrument. will not obtain 
the same results. 
After every child in the room is able to respond to simple march rhythm with his 
drum, introduce another instrument, the bells. 
The child will be likely to name the drums as a loud instrument, the bells as a soft 
instrument. Let every one have an opportunity to play the bells, then give bells to 
girls, drums to boys. 
Play any march such as “Tenth Regiment,” in which there are contrasts of 
loud and soft. 
Have boys and girls play alternately. 
In like manner introduce other instruments. A soft-sounding ng tambourine may 
be made by sewing tiny bells to the edge of a paper plate. Kindergarten blocks covered 
with sandpaper, rubbed together, and blocks hit together, make useful instruments. 
With sound-producing instruments the child develops much more rapidly than 
with imaginary instruments, not producing sound. 
Toy instruments, small cymbals, xylophones, etc., may be purchased at small 
expense. 
After all pupils have had many opportunities to play sound-producing instruments 
they may choose to play imaginary violins, ’cellos, or horns. 
Do not choose a director until every child has had an opportunity to “think” 
rhythm for himself. Later different children who have shown ability in following the 
rhythm, should be allowed to act as directors as a reward for thoughtful listening.

Lesson 2 
Interpretation through Medium of Pictures 
Aim—To learn to listen thoughtfully and creatively. 
Material suggested: 
    Galloping horses. 
Pictures Birds flying. 
Soldiers marching. 
“The Wild Horseman.”—Schumann. (Scenes from Childhood.) 
Music Flying rhythm.—Arnold’s Book of Rhythms. 
“Soldier’s March.”—-Schumann. (Scenes from Childhood.) 
Records “The Wild Horseman.”—Schumann. 
recommended { “Waltz of the Flowers.”—Tschaikowsky. 
Soldiers’ March.”—Schumann. 
  Development of Lesson 
Show the pictures and let the children discuss. what they see in each. Then place 
them where the children can see them while the music is played. 
“I am going to play some music that télls the same story as one of these pictures. 
Let us listen and see which picture the music fits. If you know, wait until I finish 
playing and then raise your hand.” 
After one piece is played, choose a child to come and point to the picture he thinks 
the music expresses. 
“Why do you think it is that picture?” 
Allow several children to show which they think it is, and when several make 
the same choice ask the class how many agree. 
Allow the children to interpret their idea by bodily activity. 
“Would you like to be those birds?” (Or horses, or soldiers, whichever it may be.) 
If a child’s choice disagrees with your own, do not ignore his opinion, but ask 
why he thought the music told about that picture. If he believes your soldier music 
is about the horses, ask, “Could you be a horse galloping with that music?”; Let him 
try it out; then allow him to correct his own decision. 
After thus interpreting one rhythm, develop the other two in like manner. 
Lesson 3 > 
Interpretation through Pictures and Verses 
Aim—Creative listening. 
Material: 
“‘Hush-a-bye, Baby, on the Tree Top.” 
Pictures and rhymes } “Hickory Dickory Dock.” 
“One Foot Up and One Foot Down.”—Jessie Wilcox Smith,

“Cradle Song.”-—Schubert. 
Records suggested { “Lullaby.” —Brahms. 
“Cradle Song.”——Schumann. (Scenes from Childhood.) 
Hofer—Music for “Child World.” 
“Gipsy Rondo.”—Haydn. - : 
“Dance to Your Daddy.”’—Songs for Little Children. 
Show the pictures to the children and let them say the verses. 
“IT have some music that tells the same story as these stanzas and pictures. See 
if you can tell which verses this music is telling.” 
Play “Cradle Song” or “Rock- a-bye, Baby.” 
Ask some child to get the picture or say the rhyme he thinks the music fits, and 
the reason for his choice. + 
“How many think the music was about the picture John chose?” 
“Now let’s listen again and see which rhyme the music is going to tell us this ti time.” 
Play one’ of the other selections and let the children find the pictures and say the 
verse fitting the music. 
Allow children to interpret one of the rhythms through movement, if they wish. Music

Interpretation through Poetry 
Material: 
“The Rain is Raining All Around.”—Robert Louis Stevenson. 
“I Am a Giant Strong and Bold.” 
Poems | “The Wind.”—Rossetti. 
“‘Hush-a-bye, Baby, on the Tree Top.” 
“The Raindrops.”—Mendelssohn. 
Hofer—Music for “Child World.” 
Music | “Fifth Nocturne,” Leybach, 2d page. - 
Brahms—Lullaby. 
Presentation 1—Wéith teacher at the Piano. 
“Who knows a verse about the rain?” 
Let some child give the verse. 
“Does someone know a verse about something that helps mother’s clothes to dry, 
and sometimes takes our hats off our heads?” 
Let the children give you the verse if possible. If they do not know it, teach them. | 
In many first grades the children are taught the above verses and are apt to respond, 
if you simply ask for them. 
Suppose Mary has responded with “ The Wind” and John with “The Rain.” 
“T’m going to let the music tell a verse. Let’s see whether it is John’s or Mary’s.” 
After they’ve decided, play it again, that they may have the pure enjoyment of 
listening to the music-poem.

Presentation 2—With records. 
Tell one poem and play two compositions. Let the children decide which music 
tells about the poem. 
Tf children give verses about soldiers, squirrels, a seesaw, or clock, appropriate 
music may be easily found. 
“Wind Amongst the Trees.” 
“Brahms’ Waltzes.”

Developing Rhythmic Expression 
Material: “Rustic Dance.” —Arnold’s Book of Rhythm. 
. “Amaryllis.’—Book Four, Universal School Music Series. 
Have the children sit on the floor near the piano. 
“Listen and see what the music tells you to do.” 
Play a few measures with convincing rhythm. Choose part of the children to do 
what the music tells them to do. : : 
Supposing they skip (hippity hop). 
Ask those sitting on the floor whose skipping they like best. 
After the children have decided, let the chosen two or three skip alone. The 
teacher may speak about high skipping, lightness, or any good quality she observes. 
Then let all the children skip. If any have difficulty in sensing the rhythm, have 
them clap softly while standing still, then try again. Some may skip while others clap 
for them. (This is especially helpful i in developing technic of the gallop or high-stepping 
ponies.) 
Repeat the same music for the same movement several days. 
Lusson 6 
Developing Rhythmic Expression 
Aim—To develop alertness and response to different rhythms. 
Music: 
“High-stepping Horses” 
“Swallows” 
“Kerry Dance” 4 Arnold’s collection of rhythms for the home 
“Giants” and kindergarten. 
“A-Riding We Will Go” . 
Rhythms from Book One, Universal School Music Series, or 
Record: Rhythm Medley, including “High-stepping Horses,” ete.
-P-A-G-E-118
MUSIC APPRECIATION : ‘ 109 
Have children stand about the room where there is sufficient space. 
“The music is going to tell you different things to do. Let’s be sure to stop when 
the music does, and listen a minute to the next music, so we'll know what it is telling 
us to do before we begin to move.” 
Play any of the above rhythms, then stop a moment to be sure the children are 
in a listening attitude for the next part. 
If they have difficulty in responding to any theme, play the one of similar type 
with which they are familiar. 
Later on, this kind of a lesson may be given with quicker transitions from one 
theme to another to see if the children notice change of rhythm in unexpected places. ’ 
Lzsson 7 
Descriptive Music 
Aim—Listening for particular thing. 
This lesson may be given in the spring when the children have been noticing birds 
and flowers. 
Musie: “Warblings at Eve.”—Richards. With Teacher at Piano. 
“T am going to play you some music that tells about a little boy who went out 
walking. After he had gone a little way he heard something. If you listen very 
carefully perhaps you can tell what he heard. 
Play first nine measures, skip to “a tempo” on top of 2d page and play to end of 
that movement or play first nine measures and skip to 8d page. Begin at last line 
and play eight measures. Give the children a chance to express what they hear before 
you tire them by making them wait too long. 
The children undoubtedly will hear birds singing. If they do not, but have another 
good interpretation, accept it. 
Similar lesson may be even more effectively presented through the record ‘“‘ Warb- 
lings at Eve.” Let the children raise their hands every time they. hear the birds sing 
and the bell ring. Girls might listen for birds, and boys for bells. After the above 
detail has been discovered, listen quietly to the composition in its entirety. ‘“Let’s 
play we are out in the park on a. lovely spring morning, sitting on the grass, listening to 
this happy music. (Play record in its entirety.) 
“Have you ever gone on a picnic? Tell me what you did.” 
“Once upon a time some Teddy Bears had a picnic. Oh, they had such fun! 
Can you guess how Teddy Bears might dance? I think this music will tell us about 
their clumsy play. Let your hands keep time with them on your desks. 
“Put up your hand when you hear the bears talk.” 
Record: “Hollaender March.”
-P-A-G-E-119
110 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
Lesson 8 
Quiet Listening for Pure Enjoyment 
Aim—Appreciation of zsthetic beauty. 
Music: ‘The Brook.”—Karganoff. 
“The Bells.”—Kullak. 
“Minuet.” —Paderewski. j 
“Music for the Child World.”—Hofer. : 
Form the habit of giving the children an opportunity to listen without having to 
listen for a particular thing or without thought of interpretation through activity. 
The habit of quiet listening can be acquired only through much practice. It is 
entirely separate and does not result from bodily activity or even necessarily from 
descriptive music. 
Play a signal for the children to gather up to the piano and sit down ready to listen. 
Then when they are fixed comfortably, play one or two selections without comment 
before or after, unless it is giving the title of the piece or answering some question 
from a child. . 
Sometimes a child will request a composition to be played again. 
Similar lesson may be given through phonograph renditions of such compositions as: 
“Praeludium.”—Jarnefelt. 
“Cradle Song.” —Schubert. 
“To a Wild Rose.”—MacDowell. 
“Serenade.”—Moszkowski. 
“Moment Musical.’’—Schubert. 
“Humoresque.”—Dvorak. 
Lesson 9 
Dramatic Play, Developed from Suggestion in Music Pictures 
Musie: “Fifth Nocturne.’’—Leybach. 
Presentation, with Teacher at Piano. 
Ask children to tell some Mother Goose rhymes. When “Little Miss Muffet” 
is given, tell them you have some music that tells that story. They may raise their 
hands when they hear Miss Muffet run away. 
Play the first three lines of the “Fifth Nocturne” ending with the run. 
- Play it through again, asking the children to raise their hands when they think the 
spider is creeping up beside her. 
Now ask if they’d like to make a game of it. Choose a Miss Muffet and a spider, 
and let them play it with their own interpretation. 
Allow the group to criticize, giving them opportunity to decide whether the spider 
came at the right moment and whether Miss Muffet ran at the right time.
-P-A-G-E-120
MUSIC APPRECIATION | 111 
Choose several Miss Muffets and several spiders. 
Later all the class can play it, the girls being Miss Muffets and the boys being the 
spiders. , 
Lesson 10 
Dramatic Play with Music—Development from Free Interpretation 
Music: “Shadows” from Hofer’s “Music for the Child World,” Vol. 2. 
Play the selection through, and ask the children what they think it tells. 
Allow as many interpretations to be given as are offered. ‘Then ask the children 
which they think is best. If it is hard to find a “best,” accept several, but select one 
to be dramatized. 
For instance, if one of the best suggestions is “Snowflakes,” ask what is happening 
_in the first part and what in the second. They may suggest that it is snowing in the 
first part and they are shoveling snow in the last. 
Let the child who gave it this interpretation, show how he can be a snowflake 
and how he can shovel the snow to the music. 
Let all the children interpret it. Have a short check-up period in which you 
discuss how you can best be a snowflake. Ask such questions as: How do the snow- 
flakes fall—do they come straight down or whirl around? Can you hear them when 
they fall?, ete. Then discuss how you shovel snow—is the snow heavy? Do you 
have to push hard? Listen and sec if you can hear the music tell you when to push, 
and when to throw. 
Play again, choosing a few of the best to interpret it while the others watch, 
SECOND GRADE 
Lzsson 1 
Rhythm’ 
Play “March of the Toys,” Herbert or Tschaikowsky or “The Fairies,” “Clowns” 
or “Dwarf Gnomes,” etc. by Louis Mohler. 
Children imagine some toy that might be marching to the music (such as puppets, 
marionettes, dolls, etc.). Ask one child from each row or group to turn into a “toy,” 
and do what he thinks the toys could do. Let class decide which child made the best 
toy. : 
Play “Stars and Stripes. ”—Sousa, or “‘ Military March”—Schubert. 
“Is this another march for toys? No, soldiers are marching to this music. You 
may choose ten boys to join this company of soldiers. Tell me which boys marched 
in step with the music.”
-P-A-G-E-121
112 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
“Let us all play soldiers with our arms. Rest your elbows on your desks. Make 
your forearms into tall, straight soldiers. In every row I will choose the best soldier.” 
Lesson 2 
Rhythmic Response 
“Yesterday we were all soldiers with the Soldier March music. 
“To-day I will play you another march. It may turn some of you into soldiers, 
and others into toys, brownies, or fairies. Let us sit quietly in our chairs and listen. 
Do what you think the music tells you to do with your hands or arms or heads.” 
Record suggested: “ Fairest of the Fair.”’—Sousa, or any good school march. 
Play march. , 
“I saw so many different things that we can do to the music. John may come 
to the front and we will do with our hands what John does with his. When we come 
to a new part of the music, John may point to a new leader who will show us something 
different to do to the music.” 
Lesson 3 
Rhythmic Response 
“Have you ever played horse? Show me how a horse goes. John walks, Jack 
runs, James gallops. 
“T am going to play some music which shows the way some horses are moving.” 
Record: (a) Theme for high-stepping horses or reindeer running. 
“This boy may show us how these horses go.” 
- (6) “Light Cavalry Overture.”—Suppé. 
“Who wants to show how this horse is going?” 
‘ (c) “Badinage.”—Herbert. 
“Hold up your hands when this horse is trotting, put them down when the horse 
walks. : 
“This row may be horses. Please follow the music when it changes its pace.” 
Nore.—It must be remembered that these lessons are types, not necessarily in order. In actual 
presentation three lessons on rhythm would not be given in succession to the exclusion of other types.

“A long time ago your great-great-grandmother made the thread with which she 
sewed. She made it on a spinning wheel. (Show picture of spinning wheel.) There 
was a spinning wheel in each home and sometimes two. Even little girls had to spin

Lesson 6 
Mozart 
“Would you like to hear of a little boy just about as old as you who, once upon a 
time, really went to a palace to visit a king? Perhaps we will find just how he happened 
to go to the palace and if the king was glad to have him there. 
“Ever so long ago, in a country ’way across the sea, there lived a little boy named 
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Wolfgang or Wolferl, as his family called him, was a 
happy boy and used to have a fine time playing with his older sister, but the thing he 
liked best to do was to listen to music. The father used to play so beautifully on the 
piano that the little boy often forgot all about the game he was playing and stopped to 
listen. 
“Sometimes a man would come to see Wolfgang’s father, bringing with him a trum- 
pet on which he played. My! Wolfgang liked this so much that he used to dance 
while the man played. 
“ He liked, too, to hear his sister practice, and sometimes after she had finished play- 
ing he would climb up on the piano stool and with his baby fingers pick out the tunes 
he had heard. 
“He was very happy when his father said he might take lessons, too, and soon 
he could play so well that grown-up people liked to listen to him. He not only played 
music which someone else had thought of—‘composed,’ we say——and written down 
on paper, but when he was only five years old he made up little tunes which his father 
wrote down for him. As he grew older he learned for himself to write them on paper. 
“Tn all his lessons he was quick to learn, but what do you suppose he liked very 
much? It was arithmetic, and it is said he sometimes covered the chairs, tables, walls, 
and floors with figures. 
“But, of course, it was his music that he liked the best of all, and he worked so 
hard and played so well, that one day his father said, ‘Wolfgang, would you like to go 
with your sister and me, and play for the King, who has invited us to visit him?’ 
“Wolfgang thought it would be the nicest thing he had ever done, to go to the 
palace and play for the King. Do you wonder that he was pleased? So in a few 
days he and his sister started with their father on that wonderful trip. 
“The King was so pleased when he found that such a little boy and girl were going 
to play for him that he had a regular party for them, and invited some of his friends 
to come and listen to the little concert. 
“Wolfgang was a very small boy to play before a King, but he was not afraid, 
‘ and all were so pleased that they wanted him to come again. When they went home, 
beautiful presents were given to the two children, and among them one that, made 
Wolfgang very happy. This was a violin. 
“Before long, the little boy had learned to play on his violin and the organ, as 
well as the piano. He kept on making up music, and writing it down so that other 
people could play it. Their children and grandchildren played it, and now many

I have a story to tell you about a boy who liked to play soldier, too, ané | 
he was such a fine leader the other boys always wanted him to be the captain. 
Robert Schumann was the boy’s name. He studied his lessons in school just as 
you do and he liked to play games, too. . 
One day he told his friends that he had a new game for them. He + 
piano and played for a few minutes. Then he asked, “Which one of yoi 
music sound like?” They all said, “Why! that was Franz!” for surely 
was just as gay and merry as happy Franz. Then the music changed and 
sweet. When Robert had finished the children said, “Robert, you are a 
player, for your music told us plainly that you were thinking of little Gretche

and whom Robert didn’t like. If you had been there I am sure you would |:

went to a concert and heard the finest music to which he had ever listened. “I wonder,” 
he thought, “if I could ever play so well. Anyway, I can try, and each day do my 
best. That is the only way.” 
As Robert grew older he became more and more: interested in music. . With a 
group of his friends he formed a little orchestra, and such good times as they had playing 
together! He was the leader and played the piano and when he could not find music to 
suit him he composed for his orchestra. His father was greatly delighted when he 
came in and heard them playing Robert’s music. 
- Just as we might suppose, that little boy became a really famous musician and 
composer.

Tam sure you have all had a play-house with walls of leaves or of snow and a play- 
store and paper money with which to buy. You have all attended play-tea-parties and 
play-shows, but have you heard of a play-funeral? 
The funeral which we are to have to-day is not even the play of boys and girls, 
All taking part are pasteboard dolls with heads, hands, and legs that move only when 
someone pulls a string. Such dolls are sometimes called marionettes. 
One of these dolls has lost its head, poor thing, and nobody seems able to fix it, 
so what else could his playfellows do but give him a funeral. 
Listen to the first sad tune. Certainly the dolls feel very sorry. Soon you will 
hear musi¢ in the distance. Then the line of marionettes, with their jerky steps, comes 
nearer and nearer until the loud music of the horns tells that it is passing close at hand. 
One doll seems to be a very noisy mourner. When you hear his noisy cry, held up 
your hand. 
Would you like to choose ten girls and turn them into marionettes? Let us see 
whether the music tells them when to take their jerky steps.

Lesson 2 
The Orchestra 
Is there a boy or girl in this class that has never heard an orchestra? Some of 
you have heard the picture-show orchestra, Others have heard the high-school orches- 
tra. Have any of you heard a symphony orchestra? If so, you are very fortunate, 
for the magic doors of music are best opened to us through the symphony orchestra. 
The music of a great singer is very beautiful, as is that produced on the piano, 
the pipe organ, or the violin, but no single instrument can take us to such mountain 
peaks of beauty as does the symphony orchestra. Let me introduce you to the dif- 
ferent families of instruments that make up a symphony orchestra. 
One family is played by bowing across strings. One is made of brass, and played 
with wind. Another is made of wood and played with wind, while the instruments of 
the fourth family are sounded by striking upon them. I am sure you all have played 
some of this last family when you were very little people. 
Of course, since these families are made of different material and played in different 
ways, they do not sound the same. It is this variety of tone that makes the orchestra 
so rich and beautiful. When we are hearing the big orchestra, it is rather hard to 
recognize the voices of the different families, so let us listen to each family by itself.

. Lesson 3 
String Family , 
Violin 
We have already learned that the orchestra is made up of four happy families. 
To-day, let us get acquainted with the members of the string family. Why, one of 
them is not a stranger at all. We have loved it a long, long time. What is its name? 
Yes, the violin is the most familiar and perhaps the most important member of 
the string family. The violins in an orchestra are usually grouped by the leader, who 
is called the conductor. They are divided into two groups. The first violins, at the 
left of the conductor, play soprano, and the second violins, at the right, play an alto part. 
The instruments on which these parts are played are exactly alike. 
The concert master, who is the leader and trainer of the string players, sits in the 
front chair to the left of the conductor. 
The violin is a wonderfully constructed instrument made of seventy parts. The 
choicest sycamore, maple, pine, and ebony are used in its making. There are four 
strings on the violin and some day perhaps you will learn what they are, and how they 
are tuned. 
The violin bow is a curved stick on which two hundred white horsehairs are stretched. 
When a player draws his bow across the strings, a smooth, rich tone is heard, but if he 
does not care for a smooth tone, he lets his bow fall and rebound on the string, thus 
producing a bouncing effect. A wavering tone is made by trembling the finger of the 
left hand on the string; a wailing sound, by sliding the finger along the string while 
bowing. At times the strings are tapped by the wooden back of the bow. Sometimes 
the player does not use the bow at all, but plucks the string instead. This way of play- 
ing is. called “‘Pizzicato.” Sometimes he bows on two strings at once, playing both a 
soprano and an alto. This is called double-stopping. aS annie .-cneenetenereeer

Look at this picture of a symphony orchestra. Do you see the group « 
directly in front of the conductor, who have violins so big that they are held 
the knees instead of being tucked under the chin? These are the violoncellos. 
time ago they were called “viol da gamba,” meaning “knee fiddle.” The tl: 
strings of the violoncello (called ’cello for short) give the instrument a deeper v 
that of the viola.

to the string family, but they furnish the low tones for the whole orchestra. Their 
tones are heavy, gruff, and often gloomy. 
Would it not be fun to make up a fairy tale and play that each instrument in 
‘the string family is a real person in our story? We probably would not give the part 
of the dainty maiden or the fond lover to the double bass. What part do you think 
the double bass could best take? 
You all know the story of ‘‘Goldilocks and the Three Bears.” 
If the string family were to play this story, I would like to have the viola be 
Goldilocks. Which would you choose for the father bear, which the mother bear, and 
which the baby bear with a small, high voice? 
For string ensemble hear “Oh Vermeland, Thou Lovely.”

You have all heard the story called “The Elves and the Shoemaker,” have you 
not? Perhaps you know a song that tells it. 
When the story opens, the shoemaker and his wife were very poor. So poor were 
they that they could buy enough leather for only one pair of shoes at a time. 
But do you remember how their fortune changed? 
Every morning when the shoemaker came into his shop he found all the leather 
he had left in the shop made into shoes which he sold for money that bought much 
more leather. 
And who made these shoes every night while the shoemaker slept? That was 
the question that bothered the shoemaker and his good wife. So they planned to - 
stay up one night. At midnight came two little elves who stitched, sewed, and ham- 
mered till every shoe was finished and standing in a row on the shoemakers’ table. 
The shoemaker and his wife then set to work and they stitched and sewed and ham- 
mered till shirts, coats, vests, trousers, stockings, and shoes just the right size for the 
Tittle elves were ready by Christmas Eve. 
Imagine the gay little elves when, instead of the usual supply of leather they spied 
these things on the shoemakers’ table. They put them on with highest glee, dancing 
and skipping as fast as they had hammered and stitched before. : 
Let us play this Grimm fairy tale is a moving picture and we are the orchestra

Lesson 7 
Instruments of Percussion 
The word “percussion” is so big that it hardly interests girls and boys. | 
there are no more interesting instruments than these instruments of percussio: 
the men at the back of the stage who are beating instruments, shaking tambo: 
These men are the players of the percussion instruments. 
Some percussion instruments produce musical tones; others, only n. 
instruments without musical tone are used to beat the rhythm. Think o' 
in a parade without a big bass drum. It is the beating of that drum that mal 
along. The side drum, or snare-drum, as it is often called, looks like a baby 
and it sounds much more gay and exciting. When both are playing, it is ea: 
of a solemn father with a steady step and his little boy running along at his side. 
neither drum plays a tune, yet music would hardly be music without them. 
Other percussion instruments which have no tune are the tambourine, castanets, 
cymbals, triangle, and the gong, which is sometimes called the tom-tom. 
Perhaps you have seen the tambourine and castanets. They are often used in 
Spanish dances. The tambourine is a wooden hoop with a parchment head which is 
to be struck by the knuckles in rhythm, while the hoop is shaken to set a-tinkling the 
little metal discs fastened loosely to it. 
Castanets are bell-shaped pieces of hard wood which are clapped together to accent 
the rhythm. They really belong in the hands of Spanish dancers, but, no doubt, you 
city boys and girls have often heard them used by elevator-starters in a department 
store.

re MUSIC APPRECIATION 127 
When you hear a symphony orchestra growing louder and louder, watch the man 
at the back of the stage who holds two round plates of copper or brass in his hands. 
These plates are called cymbals. When crashed together they make a loud, metallic 
sound. Very often a loud strain of music ends in a mighty crash of the cymbals. 
The triangle of the symphony orchestra is like the triangle used in your school. 
Its tone is clear and sweet. 
A Chinese instrument called the gong or tom-tom is nothing but a big metal plate 
on which the bass drummer strikes with his soft covered drumstick. 
These percussion instruments without tunes are seldom played continuously 
through any selection of music, so one or two players manage to play them all. Would 
it not be fun to be the man whose job is that of beating, shaking, and crashing 
these instruments? Though he needs not to think of tune, he has a very important 
work after all. Every beat, every crash must come at exactly the right instant. Soa 
man at “The battery,” as that part of the orchestra i is sometimes called, has no time 
for day-dreams. 
Instruments of Percussion that Have Pitch 
Kettledrums or Tympani 
While one man is able to take care of several of these percussion instruments 
which play no tune, the player of the tympani, or kettledrums, is one of the busiest 
men in the orchestra when he plays on his two or three kettles, as the case may be. 
The tympani are great, copper kettles with skin stretched over the top. This 
skin is held in place by a metal hoop containing screws. When these screws are tight- 
ened the skin is stretched, and when the skin is struck the sound is higher than the 
sound coming from a looser skin. So the sound or pitch of the tympani can be changed 
to fit the music. 
One kettledrum is tuned to sound like do of the music. Another is tuned to 
so and another to fa. If the man ‘who wrote the music would keep the same 
do from first-to last, the tympani player would have an easier time, but no, the 
music changes its do, fa, so, so many times and the man behind the tympani must 
tune his drums as often. If you watch the tympani player at the concert, you will 
see how often he puts his ear down to the drums and turns their screws. 
Chimes 
The chimes of an orchestra are much like the chimes in a church tower. They 
consist of metal pipes which are struck with hammers and the tones are very sweet 
and solemn. Often, these days, we hear chimes, installed in a fine organ at a picture 
show. 
Xylophone 
You have seen a zylophone, I am sure, but you probably did not know what to 
call it. It is two rows of wooden slabs above metal pipes and is struck by hard rubber 
hammers. Listen to the zylophone in this pretty melody.

Orchestra Bells / 
While this instrument sounds like bells, it looks like the xylophone, so i” 
is rather misleading. But the bars upon which the player strikes are of stee. 
of wood, as in the xylophone. That is why it sounds so different. 
Celesta 
The celesta looks like a little organ and sounds like silver bells. It is pla; 
as a piano is played, but sounds very different. Inside of a piano, the hamr: 
upon strings, but in the celesta there are little steel bars (like the bells), upon 
the hammers play. Listen to the “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” played 
celesta. Can we wonder that the composer of this dainty music has chosen th: 
on which to play it?

Lesson 9 
Meter-sensing 
When you open your music books to a new song, I wonder what interests you 
after the words have been read. No doubt, the 2, #, or ¢ at the beginning of the song 
tells you much. If I should play you several songs that you have never seen, do you 
think you could tell me what figure to put above the line in the time signature? Listen 
to this folk dance—“I See You.”” Now while I play it again, you may clap the strong 
beat. In the first phrase “I see you, I see you” what words were sung on the strong 
beat? You may now clap all beats, making strong beats stronger than the others. 
How many weak beats did you discover between the strong beats? 
In your singing lesson you have learned that the strong beat is the first beat of 
the measure. Now tell me how many beats in a measure in this folk dance, “I See 
You.” Will you please write the upper figure of the time signature and I will write the. 
lower figure. Listen to another selection. 
“Polonaise.” —Moskowski. 
“Military Polonaise.”—Chopin. 
Clap the strong beat in the first two phrases and the strong and weak beats of the 
next two phrases. Are there the same number of beats to a measure in this “Minuet” 
as in the folk dance “I See You”? ‘Your-ears tell you that a minuet swings in threes. 
A minuet is the stately, charming dance that was much loved in the time of George 
Washington. Ladies with the rich brocades and powdered hair, gentlemen with knee 
breeches and silver-buckled slippers stepped these measures, now swinging low curtsies, 
now touching hands a-tiptoe. 
Listen to this Polish Polonaise. After clapping strong and weak beats, tell me 
whether this swings in twos as did the “I See You,” or in threes as did the “Minuet.” 
‘You discovered three beats to a measure in the “Polonaise” as in the “Minuet,” but 
how very different its movement. A polonaise is a stately march rather than a dance. 
Some other day, we are going to hear a Spanish bolero and a mazurka, and discover 
whether they swing in twos or in threes.

Let me tell you of a summer storm. The clouds rolled up black and terrifying; 
the birds fled to sheltered places in the hedges or under the eaves; the little children 
who were playing out of doors quickly ran to the shelter of home and the comforting 
companionship of mother. 
Soon the storm was over and the children who had been watching the widening rain- 
pools from the window saw the clouds break and the sun peep through, and in the 
eastern sky there shone a beautiful rainbow. 
Here is a lovely picture of a rainbow. 
How do you suppose the children felt when they saw the rainbow? Happy, to 
be sure! , 
Is that the way you feel when you see a rainbow? I wonder if all “happinesses” 
are alike. Let us think a minute. 
You are happy when you see the Christmas tree with its gifts and shining candles, 
are you not? How does it make you feel? Does it make you want to do something 
to show how happy you feel? Yes, you might clap your hands, or jump around, or 
sing. That is a noisy happiness, isn’t it? Now think again. 
Suppose it is a stormy night outside and you are at home sitting before the warm 
fire. Perhaps mother is sewing, father is reading the paper, little sister is playing with 
her doll, and you are reading an interesting story. If you stopped to think about it, 
would you not feel happy? Would you feel like jumping around to show your happiness 
as you did when you beheld the Christmas tree? Would it be a noisy happiness, or a 
quiet happiness? 
Now let us think a moment what our rainbow means. Do you recall the Bible 
story of the rainbow? 
There had been a great flood and nearly all the people of the world had been drowned 
as a punishment for their wickedness. Then God promised those whom He had saved 
from the great waters that He would never again destroy the earth by a flood, and as 
a token of this promise He put. the rainbow in the heavens so that when people saw it 
they might remember His promise. 
Now what sort of happiness do you feel when you see the rainbow, a quiet happiness 
or a noisy happiness? 
I am going to play three pieces of music. Please listen and tell me which one 
makes you feel the same kind of happiness that you feel when you see the rainbow.

FIFTH GRADE 
Lesson 1 
Woodwind Instruments 
We are well acquainted with the instruments of the string family of our symphony 
orchestra. Now let us make friends with the woodwind family. I am wondering if 
their names will be old or new to you. 
Let me introduce to you the flute, the piccolo, the clarinet, the oboe, English horn, 
bassoon, and contra-bassoon—a family of wooden pipes, all of which are blown to produce 
sound. Now, if all these wooden pipes are blown in the same way, why are their voices 
so very different in quality? . 
-If you have watched the players of these wooden instruments in an orchestra you 
have noticed that some of them are constantly examining a certain small part placed 
-on the mouthpiece. This is a little strip of cane called a reed. The tone quality of 
the members of the woodwind family differs largely because some members have no 
reeds, indeed no mouthpiece at all, but a hole. Some have one reed, and some have 
two reeds. : 
The flute and the little flute, called piccolo, are the no-reed instruments. They 
are the pipes, either wood or silver, which are held to the right of the player, while he 
blows across the hole in the side. While the flute can sing to high C, higher than most 
sopranos we know, yet the piccolo was made to carry the flute’s song even higher than 
that. The flute is the bird of the orchestra. It can warble and trill and run long 
scales as neither the lark nor the nightingale can do. Listen to the flute as it sings like 
a happy, care-free child its song of daintiness and joy. 
Record: “The Whirlwind.”—Krantz. 
“Wind Amongst the Trees.” 
An instrument with a very different kind of soprano voice is the clarinet. It is a 
wooden pipe with one reed attached to its mouthpiece by metal bands. 
~ When the player presses his lower lip and blows his breath on this reed it vibrates 
and a mellow, sweet, yet weird sound comes forth. The bird-like joy which was heard 
in the voice of the flute does not belong in the voice of the clarinet. Its tones are richer 
and fuller, more like the voice of a tender mother. Listen to the “Lullaby” from 
“Erminie,” sung by the mellow voice of this one-reed, woodwind instrument, the 
clarinet. 
The remaining woodwind instruments make a family by themselves. This family 
is the two-reed or double-reed section of the woodwind family. Each instrument 
has a narrow, brass tube to- which two thin strips of cane, the reeds, are fastened with 
wax thread. A peculiar, nasal sound is produced by the wind passing between these 
two reeds. The oboe, the smallest of this two-reed family, sings a soprano as does the 
flute and the clarinet, but what a different kind of soprano! It is no less beautiful
-P-A-G-E-142
MUSIC APPRECIATION Li 133 
because it has a touch of sadness in it, and often sounds so far away. Listen to the 
voice of the oboe in “First Nowell.” The oboe has an important office in the great 
orchestra, for to the sound of the oboe’s pitch, the other instruments tune. 
The double-reed instrument, rather larger than an oboe and with a lower-pitched 
voice, is called an English horn. This is a misleading name, for really it is a wooden 
pipe, instead of being a horn, and, if the truth were told, it is not English at all.- Its 
voice is often used to express loneliness and sadness, though a plaintive tenderness is 
always present. Hear the English horn in this selection. 
“Messiah” (Pastoral Symphony), Handel. 
“Andante” (New World Symphony), Dvorak. 
Think of an oboe or English horn grown to be 9 feet long! How could the player 
ever handle such an instrument without bothering all of his neighbors? 
This very long oboe is the bassoon, but it is not.as clumsy as you might imagine, 
for this 9-foot pipe is apparently doubled back on itself, thus making it just about 
half as long. A cord fastened to the instrument goes around the neck of the player 
so he can have both hands for working the keys. 
Some say the bassoon cannot sing a solo, but listen to this bassoon. 
“Hungarian Fantasie.”—Weber or “ Danse Chinois.”—Tschaikowsky. 
Has it not sung an interesting song? The bassoon when played in quick, short — 
tones, jumping from high to low very rapidly may make a great deal of fun for the 
listeners. It is often called the clown of the orchestra, though sometimes -it plays a 
very sombre part. Listen to the bassoons in “The Hall of the Mountain King” from 
“Peer Gynt Suite,” as they play the queer tones of those tormenting trolls, or notice 
its awkward toddle in the “Dance of the Chinese Doll,” from “Nutcracker Suite.” 
The great big bassoon which sings a very low tone is called the contra-bassoon. 
If you were giving a family name to each of the four members of this double-reed. wood- 
wind family which would be mother and which father? Which could best play the 
part of the modest sister and which would make the stalwart. son?

Brass Family 
Perhaps the instruments most interesting to the boys are those belonging to the 
brass family. Boys, why do you like this family so well? Is it the shiny bright metal 
that gleams in the light, or the loud sound that sometimes is heard from this section 
of the orchestra? While the brass instruments usually have a part in the loud music, 
they are often also heard in the very soft passages. 
The trumpet of the symphony orchestra looks somewhat like the cornet. of our 
school orchestra. However, the tone of the trumpet is much more brilliant and triumph-
-P-A-G-E-143
184 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
ant. When the entire orchestra is playing on some mighty strain, you will very likely 
hear the trumpets’ melody leading out. 
In the stately march from the opera “Tannhiuser” the trumpet plays an important 
part. 
Listen to the trumpet as it sounds the call to arms at the beginning of the fourth 
part of the “William Tell” overture. 
What instrument sings that beautiful song of Night in the “Nocturne” from 
Mendelssohn’s “Midsummer Night’s Dream” music? I am not surprised that some 
of you think it is a woodwind, for it is indeed as sweet and mellow as a clarinet or English 
horn. That melody is carried by the brass instrument, the French horn. But the 
tone of the French horn is not always so sweet and mellow. By placing his right hand 
inside the bell of the horn at a certain angle, the player can produce a harsh and nasal 
tone. Watch the French horn player when you go to a concert. Not only is the tone 
altered by. the way he-places his right hand in his horn, but the pitch is changed also. 
The French horn looks like the old-fashioned hunting horn. The tube which is 
sxound around and around would be froin 12 to 16 feet long if were straightened out. 
No fifth-grade boy needs to be told the name of the horn which, to all appearances, 
is operated somewhat like his bicycle pump. At least, the player seems to pump the 
lower part of his instrument back and forth as he plays. The player of this instrument, 
the trombone, must have a very good ear, for the pitch is determined by the distance 
he slides this tube back and forth. Listen to the trombone in the “Triumphal March” 
from Aida. In the opera, a band of a dozen trombones at the back of the stage makes 
this scene a very brilliant one. 
The one big brass horn of the orchestra, is the fuba. Its 18-foot tube is wound 
around many times, but still it takes up a great deal of room. Listen for its deep, full 
tones—perhaps the most solemn tones of the whole orchestra.

Folk Music 
From the beginning of the world it has been the natural desire of people to sing 
and dance. No doubt the cave-woman sang her baby to sleep. The cave-man prob- 
ably had his song and dance of triumph after a victorious “kill.” 
When people were making pictures on rocks, in place of written words, they had 
their songs—songs of work, of war, of sorrow and of joy. 
These songs and dances were handed down from father to son. Thé only way 
to keep a song was to remember it, because for thousands of years people did not know 
how to write music. Thus, only ‘the tunes of lasting worth have come down to us 
through the ages. 
This sort of music, handed down from mouth to mouth, is called folk-music. In 
every country the folk-songs are different from those of other countries. One would

kind of songs as those who live by a southern sea, when their whole manner of life is 
so different. 
Norway 
Norwegian folk-songs express the ruggedness of the country. ‘They speak of fiords, 
lofty snow-capped mountains, dark and dismal forests, and strange spirits, fairies, 
and trolls, which play so important a part in the legends of the north countries. Edward 
Grieg, the greatest Norwegian composer, caught the spirit of these legends. You per- 
haps remember one of his compositions that pictures the northland trolls. 
Folk-songs of Ireland 
Love of country, sorrow at her unhappy condition, and hope for her independence, 
are elements that have crept into the music of the Irish people. 
Thomas Moore was the folk-lore poet of Ireland. Love and sorrow in the Irish 
heart were expressed by Moore in his poems, many of which were set to folk-tunes.

Lesson 5 
~ Overture to “William Tell” 
An opera is a play which is sung instead of being spoken. An overture to an’ 
opera is the part played by the orchestra before the curtain rises. Some overtures. seem 
to introduce the characters of the opera which follow, some merely prepare us in spirit 
for what is to come, while others give in tone a condensed story of the opera. 
. You have read the story of William Tell, the brave Swiss who shot the apple from 
the head of his own son, and led his countrymen against the Austrian invaders, making 
Switzerland the first republic in the world. 
Rossini, the composer of the opera, “William Tell,” seemed to want to put the 
listeners in Switzerland, land of William Tell, for he opens the overture with a picture 
of dawn in the mountains. The tune played by the ’cellos in the opening’ strain sug- 
gests the rising sun. This quiet mood of dawning in the mountains is followed. by the 
second movement of the overture where the strings suggest the distant murmurs of 
the storm. As the storm comes nearer and nearer, the violins picture the scurrymg 
of the birds and sheep to places of shelter. Finally, the storm breaks. The whistle 
of the wind and sharp lightning flashes are pictured by the piccolo, the scattering rain- 
drops by the flute, the swish of shrubs by violins and the heavy peals of thunder by the 
brass, cymbals, and drums. When the storm ceases we hear the flute call of the shepherd 
boy as he gathers his flock. 
Part 3—“Calm.” The third movement is the calm following the storm. At such 
a time, in the mountains the air is very clear and one can see great distances. In 
this we hear the herd-boy’s song, which is an Alpine folk-song played by the English 
- horn and echoed by the flute. The chirping of the birds is suggested by the s 
notes of the flute. The triangle struck at intervals is the bell of the flock. 
Part—“The Call to Arms.” The last movement opens with a trumpet 
arms and the nation-wide gathering of the Swiss troops who hurriedly march agai 
the enemy. es

I wonder what makes you like one tune and not like another. There must be 
some reason. 
We all know the tune of ‘ “America” very well. Let us sing it. The tune of the 
first phrase, “My country, ’tis of thee,” runs like this: do do re ti do re. TI wish you 
would sitig every phrase of the first stanza of “America” to the tune of thé first phrase. 
Would you like a song in which ali phrases had the same tune? Why not? Certainly 
a song would be very tiresome if one little tune was repeated again and again without 
change. . / 
Now sing another familiar tune. This time sing with the phonograph or piano 
the tune “Old Folks’ at Home.” The tune for the first phrase of this song is, 
mi re do mi re do do la do. Did you hear this tune of the first phrase more than once 
throughout the song? Listen again to the first stanza and the chorus, and turn down 
a finger every time you hear the tune of the first phrase. Yes, five times you have 
heard ‘the first phrase tune, I wonder if this song would please you just as well if 
every phrase had a new tune. Sing the chorus once again. When singing this chorus, 
don’t you have a rather pleasant feeling when the phrase “Oh! darkies how my heart 
- grows weary” comes along with our friendly first phrase tune? 
In all music, whether it is a song for a little child to sing or a great selection for a 
symphony orchestra to play, the two qualities that you have discovered you want in | 
music are always present if the music is worth while. First you discovered you did not 
like “America” if all phrases were just alike. In all good music there must be variety. 
Then in “Old Folks at Home” you decided you wanted some phrases alike. It made 
your song more interesting to have some tunes used more than Ofte. Repeating phrases 
several times throughout a piece of music gives wnity. 
Listen to the first phrase of this beautiful ‘““Rondino” on a theme of Beethoven. 
I want you to hear this first tune until it becomes an old acquaintance. Do you think 
now you would know that phrase wherever you meet it? We will now play the entire 
selection, which takes less than three minutes. Turn down a finger for this familiar 
tune every time you hear it. How many times has the composer seen fit to use this | 
little tune?

There are many ways of telling a story. If an elaborate story is told on the stage 
through acting and the spoken word, it is called a drama. If it is sung, instead of 
spoken, it becomes an opera. 
In France and Russia they are very fond of another way of telling a story, a way 
we seldom see in America. Instead of speaking or singing, the actors tell the story 
through dancing, and such a performance is called a “ballet” (pronounced bal-la). 
The greatest ballets in the world come to us from Russia, so it is not to be wondered 
- at that the great Russian, Tschaikowsky (Chi-kuv-ski), should make a ballet of this 
charming story which children love. 
The collection of eight musical numbers which we know as the “Nutcracker Suite” 
were originally dances in the ballet. 
Once upon a time a little girl had a Christmas party. Each of her little friends 
brought a gift. One of them brought her a Chinese doll and one an Arabian doll, 
and there were two little toy pipers, a Russian doll, and, oh, so many things! But, 
strangely enough, the present the little girl liked best of all was a lovely silver nut- 
cracker. 
The first number of the suite is an overture light and dainty as can be. The 
second number is the march which accompanies the children as they enter and march 
around the tree, There is a moment of suspense-and admiration when the sparkling 
tree is first seen, plainly expressed in the music, and then the march is continued. 
After the party is over and the guests have gone home the little girl was so excited 
she just couldn’t sleep, and so she crept downstairs to look once more at her lovely 
silver nutcracker. 
It was midnight, and often strange things happen in stories at this hour. On 
the way downstairs she saw a mouse and was so terribly frightened that whoever can 
say whether the rest of the story really happened, or if she fainted and dreamed it all. 
But all of a sudden the lovely nutcracker appeared, turned into a fairy prince; he fought 
and killed the mouse king, and all the other little mice scampered away. And then 
he made the little girl his lovely princess, and together they flew away over Jam Moun- 
tain to the Land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, where they were entertained at a wonderful 
party. This is the music of the “Sugar Plum Fairy.”

' The Sugar Plum Fairy had some lovely dancers at the party, and who should 
they be but the very little dolls that were on the Christmas tree, all come to life! 
I am going to play you dances for three different kinds of dolls in this strange 
fairyland. You may name the dance you think most suitable for every doll.- 
There will be a dance for the Chinese doll. Think of an old-fashioned Chinese 
girl with her dainty feet and long, tight skirt and I am sure you can find the dance 
for her in this group. Think how she must toddle along, with her tiny bound feet! 
There will be the dance for the Arabian doll. You have heard a dance for an 
Arabian girl before this. Her name was Anitra. Can you remember her dance? 
Then there will be the “Dance of the Toy Pipers,” sometimes called “Dance of 
the Flutes,” for three solo flutes play the dance, with dainty accompaniment of strings 
played pizzicato. In the midst of this number we may hear the oriental note of a 
trumpet, and then the return of the dancing flutes. 
At the close of the party the Sugar Plum Fairy invites all her guests to dance 
together the “Waltz of the Flowers.” 
Was there ever a waltz more graceful and delicate? 
Lesson 9 
Characterization of Instruments 
Listen to “The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy,” and tell me the instrument you 
hear. 
To what family of instruments does the instrument belong? 
Someone may describe the celesta (learned in former lesson). 
When Tschaikowsky wrote this suite he had not seen the celesta. I wonder to 
what instrument he had expected to give the part of “Sugar Plum Fairy.”’ When he 
heard the celesta in Paris he was delighted and said, “I must use it in my ‘Nutcracker 
Suite’ for it is indeed a real fairy.” 
Listen now to this queer oriental ‘Dance of the Chinese Doll.” What is that low- 
toned instrument that is singing a monotonous do so so steadily? 
Yes, that is the big, awkward, double-reed woodwind, the bassoon. 
Above its steady do so we hear another woodwind instrument, the very highest- 
toned woodwind of all. Can you tell its name? 
“The Dance of the Arabian Doll” is the queerest music of all. The English horn 
alternates with the clarinet in giving the melody. To make it oriental, the tambourine 
without jingles is used. 
The “Dance of the Reed Pipes” is played on three flutes. 
Listen again to the “Waltz of the Flowers.” Why has Tschaikowsky used the 
harp in this number? Do you think the harp pictures the daintiness and beauty of 
the flowers better than any other instrument could picture it?

Lesson 1 
Folk-musie of Scotland and Italy 
Scotland . 
No folk-songs speak more plainly of a people than do those of the Scotch. Loyalty 
to country, love of home life, and sturdiness of character stand out prominently. The 
words of Scottish folk-songs tell much of Scotland’s history. 
Robert Burns did much for Scottish folk-music. He wrote verses picturing the 
Scotchman’s home life, many of which he set to the old folk-tunes. Some of Burns’ 
poems which have become folk-songs are “Flow Gently, Sweet Afton,” “Coming 
Through. the Rye,” and “Auld Lang Syne.” 
Scottish folk-songs have two characteristics which make them different from the 
songs of other countries. Have you ever heard of the Scotch snap? Sing the first two 
lines of “Coming Through the Rye” and notice the way you say “bod- yn and “com-in’.” 
That is an example of Scotch snap. 
The second reason for Scotch music differing from that of other countries has to 
do with the bagpipe, which is the national instrument of Scotland. You may think 
the bagpipe is a harsh-sounding instrument, but to a Scotchman’s ears there is no 
sweeter music. All the tones of our scale are not possible on the bagpipé, and for 
that reason the Scotch folk-songs which came down through the ages in company with 
the bagpipe are made on a five-tone scale. If you were to sing their five-tone scale you 
would sing do re mi so la do, leaving out fa and ti. 
Italy 
Strange as it may seem, Italy, which j is known as the Land of Song, has fewer 
folk-songs than most countries. Italy was the first country to be wealthy enough 
to devote much time to operas and serious music. The Italians have had operas so 
long and the tunes from Italian operas have become so familiar to all Italians that 
they have taken the place of folk-music among the people. 
Italy does not sing of her mountains, as does Norway, nor of her lakes and braes, 
as does Scotland. Neither have they the fund of fairy legends, as have the people 
from the North lands. Their folk-music is very different. They are a practical folk, 
who ett their j joy: out of living and loving.

_ 142 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
Naples has quite a fund of street ditties, such as “Santa Lucia,” “My Sunshine” 
(“O Sole Mio”), and “Funiculi.” They are really folk-songs, though each one was 
composed by an individual instead of coming from a group of individuals. Folk-music 
of Naples is built on graceful lines, quite different from the angular tunes of Norway 
and Sweden. The languor of the southern climate is felt in every strain. 
Folk-songs of Venice speak of moonlit seas, starlit evenings, and overhanging 
balconies. They usually have the swing of a boat song, and are often heard from the 
lips of the handsome, dark gondoliers, as they push their boats along the Grand Canal.

Lesson 2 
Folk-music of Hungary 
We have spoken of folk-songs of Russia because most of the Russian folk-music 
was in the form of songs. The folk-music came from the working-people, and the 
music was made while the work was being done. No time had they to stop their work 
and play on instruments. Because their love of music had to find expression in working- 
hours, their music was vocal. 
Can you think of any reason why the folk-music of Hungary is, for the most part, 
instrumental, instead of vocal? You see, the music-makers of Hungary have been the 
wandering, care-free gypsies, who were not a race of workers. Their hands were free 
to play their instruments when they chose, through many a long, lazy hour. So that 
is the reasgff that Hungary has fewer folk-songs and more folk-dances than other 
countries.\/ Gypsy dances are fascinating, with wild and dizzy passages in major mode 
following slow, dreamy strains in minor mode. 
“Hungarian Dance.” 
“Csardas.” 
A Hungarian composer named Liszt loved his native folk-music, as did Tschaikow- 
sky. Liszt made frequent visits to the gypsy camps, for he loved their music and their 
dancing. The “Csardas” which you have just heard influenced Liszt in his writing of 
music. Notice the contrasting parts, the first part being very slow, while the second 
part is fast and furious. This “Csardas” seems to embody the changing emotions of 
the gypsies. 
Liszt took these simple folk-tunes and worked them into wonderful piano numbers 
which he called “Rhapsodies.” The fifteen “Hungarian Rhapsodies” of Liszt have 
been played by all the greatest pianists since his day. Can you “see” with your ears? 
That is what I want you to do in listening to Liszt’s “Second Hungarian Rhapsody.”

Watch for the beautiful folk-tunes and you will “see” the delicate little runs and trills 
which Liszt hangs on these lovely melodies. 
Can it be that Liszt not only took his little tunes from.the gypsies, but that his 
love of ornamentation came from his contact with these gay people who bedeck them- 
selves with beads and ribbons of so many colors? 
Notice that Liszt’s “Rhapsody” has the contrasting parts which we discovered in 
the “Csardas.”

Lesson 3 
Folk-music of Russia 
I hope by this time you have learned to sing many folk-songs of Scotland, Ireland, 
Italy, and Norway, and many other European countries. 
Listen to two folk-songs of Russia and tell me what the Russian peasant has 
expressed in his songs: 
“Volga Boat Song.” 
“The Shining Moon.” 
Yes, the folk-songs of Russia are outbursts of deep feeling and wild, hopeless 
yearnings, and unrestrained joy. Someone has said that humanity is most inclined ta 
make music when sad. That may explain the wealth of Russian folk-music. Their 
oppression and hardships have made their music sad and melancholy. Most of their 
folk-songs are in the minor mode, expressive of their distréss.. However, the strong 
accent of many of their songs suggests brawny muscle, broad shoulders, and a deter- 
mined will. . 
Russia was fortunate in having a very wonderful composer, Peter Tschaikowsky, 
who loved the folk-music of his native land so well that he used it many times. 
“Andante Cantabile.”—Tschaikowsky. 
It is said that one day as Tschaikowsky sat composing in his studio the song of a 
peasant workman wafted in at the window. The old folk-song of the peasant haunted, 
him until he worked it into a movement for a string quartet. He called this movement 
“Andante Cantabile,” which means a “slow song.”

Lesson 4 
Hero Story 
FELIX MENDELSSOHN 
Was there ever a happier or luckier boy than Felix Mendelssohn? “Felix” means 
“happy,” and that was a good name for this little boy, who had a beautiful home, 
loving parents who were able to give him everything he needed, a dear little sister 
Fannie, whom he loved very dearly, and another dear sister and brother, besides. 
That is why, perhaps, the music he wrote makes us think of all sorts of happy things— 
bird songs, springtime, and fairies. 
You must not think that because he: was rich he did not work. On the contrary, 
the four children rose at five o’clock every morning and began their tasks. Besides 
the studies such as you have, they learned foreign languages and spent many hours 
with their music. 
But Felix liked other things besides music. He loved the out-of-doors, and I 
am sure if he had lived in these days he would have been a Boy Scout. He liked all 
sorts of games, horseback-riding, and swimming. He once said, “I think I like the 
sea almost better than the sky.” 
Like Mozart, he was a “wonder child.” Before he was three years old he would 
play little tunes before company, and he and his sister Fannie delighted their friends 
by the duets they played together. 
Such good times these brothers and sisters had, for they all loved music, and as 
they grew older, gave many concerts to their friends. To their father’s beautiful 
home came many visitors. There were poets and artists and musicians, all of whom 
were very proud of the little Felix. 
_ He was not so old as you boys and girls when he began to compose music, and 
_he wrote a good deal of it every year. Many of these compositions were played at the 
family concerts. 
‘When he was only seventeen he wrote one of his most beautiful and famous com- 
positions, one to which people never tire of listening. 
He and his sister Fannie had been reading Shakespeare’s fairy play, “A Midsummer 
Night’s Dream,” and Felix was so charmed with it that he wanted to tell the same story 
in music. Perhaps you have heard it. It is called “Overture to Midsummer Night’s 
Dream.” In another lesson we will hear this “Overture.” 
Mendelssohn composed songs arid music for the piano and other instruments, In 
all his music we can hear his happy spirit.

Lesson 5 
“ Midsummer Night?s Dream” 
In our last lesson we learned of Felix Mendelssohn, who, with his sister Fannie, 
became interested in Shakespeare’s play, “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” when they 
were small children. ‘ 
When Felix was only seventeen he composed this wonderful masterpiece, which 
he called “Midsummer Night’s Dream Overture.” 
An overture, as you know, is a musical selection picturing the action of the drama 
which follows. / 
Mendelssohn wrote this overture as a piano duet so that he and his sister Fannie 
might have the pleasure of playing it together. Later he wrote it for the orchestra. 
This overture is a real adventure in fairyland.. (You know midsummer nights 
belong to fairies.) 
When. the overture opens, the queen of the fairies has taken possession of the 
wood. We hear four mysterious chords from the woodwinds, which put us under her 
spell, then the strings give forth the daintiest fairy music. 
But the fairies are not alone in the forest. Listen and you will hear the soft, 
sweet voices of some lovers. Then comes a rustic dance of some workmen who have 
come tothe woods to practice a play. Ah! trouble is brewing for all those that come 
under thé fairy spell on a midsummer night. Then for fun, Puck squeezed the magic 
juice into the lovers’ eyes. Only as a little prank, but what a mix-up results. The 
lovers forget whom they came to meet. The workman, Nick Bottom, is changed into a 
donkey. . 
If you listen very carefully you will hear the deep bray through the deep voice 
of the bassoon. 
But before morning comes, all misunderstandings are made right and we are 
ushered: out of fairyland as we were ushered into it, through the four selfsame chords 
of the woodwinds.

Record: “Midsummer Night’s Dream Overture.” 
Seventeen years after this overture was written Mendelssohn was asked to write 
incidental music to the drama. 
Incidental music is music written to be played between the acts of the play. Men- 
delssohn wrote a dainty “Scherzo” to be played before the fairy revel in the wood. 
A “Scherzo” is a selection of a playful, sportive character. 
The “Nocturne,” which means “night-piece,” a beautiful orchestral number 
where the French horns are heard, is played while the lovers lie asleep, when Puck 
has such a good chance to play his pranks. 
The “Wedding March” is played when the lovers have readjusted matters.

“Scherzo.””—Mendelssohn. 
““Nocturne.’”—Mendelssohn.

Lesson 6 
Descriptive and Pure Music 
Play “In a Monastery Garden” without naming it or making any remarks about 
it. Ask class to listen to the entire selection and then to suggest a name for it, on the 
basis of what they have heard. 
Pupils will probably say they heard church bells and church singing. Someone 
may hear the singing of monks. 
Question: “If you heard monks, were they in a church? Why not?” 
Some pupil will remember the singing of birds, so the “out-of-doors” is suggested. 
“Tf this music is not in a church, where is it?” 
Answer: “Near a church.” 
Give name of selection after the class has suggested several names. 
“Did you think entirely of music in hearing the composition or was your mind 
on a scene or a story?” 
Listen to another selection. 
“Melody in F.”—Rubinstein. 
Was any scene or story brought to your mind through this music? 
You have discovered that some music paints a picture or tells a atory. This kind 
of music is called descriptive, or program music. Unless its “program” is very definitely 
told, we enjoy it a great deal more if we know its significance in advance of hearing it. 
Other music is enjoyed for tonal beauty alone and is called pure music. —

Definite and Indefinite Program Music 
1. Definite 
In music like “In a Monastery Garden” we hear the actual sounds in imitation. 
You perhaps remember “Hunt in Black Forest,” “Clock Store,” and other selections 
that. belong to definite descriptive music, such as “In a Monastery Garden.” You 
hardly needed to know the name. The music names the selection for you. 
2. Less Definite 
Let me’play some other examples of descriptive music for you. 
Play fBrook.”—Boisdeftre. 
“Swan.”—Saint-Saéns: 
‘Spring Song.” —Mendelssohn. 
“Wild Rose.” —MacDowell. 
“Top.” (Impromptu.)—Bizet. 
“Do you hear actual sounds that name these compositions for you? Let us find 
a name that might be suitable for one of the above.” ‘ 
(Play “The Swan” without naming it.) 
“Dreaming,” “Summer Breezes,” “Quiet Evenings,” etc., are suggestions for . 
titles. Any of these might be suitable. To each one of us it might bring a different 
picture, but the composer has given it a name that makes it paint the same picture 
for us all. He called it “The Swan.” Let us hear it again. This time, because we 
have heard the ‘name, we will sce the graceful swan as it dips and bends, and we will 
see the sparkling ripples on the smooth lake. 
In descriptive music like “The Swan” the name serves as a label to help the listener 
catch the composer’s thought. 
8. Indefinite 
Listen to these three selections and decide whether they belong to descriptive music 
or pure music. 
Play ‘“Nocturne.”—Chopin. 
“Serenade.’’—Schubert. 
“Meditation.”’—Massenet. 
“Liebestraum.”’—Liszt. 
No doubt the pupils will vote for pure music if these selections are unfamiliar. 
Tracurr: “I, like you, would name these selections as pure music if I did not 
know the names.”’ 
Name, and play again. 
This type of selection is the most indefinite of descriptive music. _The name is the 
only thing that takes it out of the class of pure music. The name “Nocturne,” meaning 
night song, does not tell us much. Let the music paint whatever picture it may, but

“ Peer Gynt Suite” 
Are you asking yourself this question—‘What is a suite?” A suite of rooms 
in a hotel is several rooms grouped together. A suite in music is several selections 
written to be played together. Each is complete in itself in a way, but they are all 
eonnected by a common story. 
The music of Peer Gynt was written by Edvard Grieg, a great Norwegian com- 
poser, as incidental music for the play “Peer Gynt,” written by his friend and fellow- 
countryman, Ibsen. 
Incidental music is played between the acts of a play. Much of this interesting 
music is unknown, but certain favorite compositions have been published in a collection 
known as “Peer Gynt Suite” No. 1, and still others are heard less often in a group as 
“Peer Gynt Suite” No.2. The four numbers that follow are “Peer Gynt Suite” No. 1. 
Many of the happenings in Ibsen’s play are taken from the folk tales, legends, 
and superstitions of the Norwegian people.

Peer Gynt, as the story goes, was a reckless youth who loved his. ‘mother dearly, 
but told her such awful stories. No wonder he was afraid‘in the dark. Peer’ ‘wandered os 
over the earth learning many of the lessons of life through hard knocks. ’ : 
One time his wanderings led him to Egypt. Early one morning he éani 
sand to the great statue of Memnon. Sitting on a stone he waited fo: 
Slowly the dawn stole over the desert. The shadows melted away.» P 
the brightening sky, dreamed of all he meant to do in the future. Soon the first rosy 
streaks of the rising sun struck the desert. Longer and brighter the rays, grew, until a 
suddenly Peer’s eyes blinked into the hot, blinding face of the sun itself.“ : 
The selection, “Morning,” pictures Peer Gynt in Egypt when he beheld the sun 
coming over the statue of Memnon. This selection opens with a six-tone motive’ ‘for 
the flute which is repeated time and time again by different- groups of instruntients, 
every repetition of the tune being louder and higher. So mi re do re mi so mi re ‘do 
mi so mi so la mi la so. The listener is conscious of a complete awakening of a new 
       
day. The woodwind instruments help the picture, for they sing the morning notes 
of- birds and insects. 
Peer once halted in his wanderings long enough to steal down into his: hoine valley 
to see hig mother. He found his house bare, cold, and cheerless. _ Poor Aase, his mother, 
had lost her _land and farmhouse and was only permitted. to keep her home until her 
death. 
Peer, by the light of a tiny fire on the hearth, saw his mother lying ill on? ‘the broken- 
down bed. Aase was joyful to see him once more before she died, for she loved him 
dearly. Peer sat by her bedside, talked gently, and sang to her: Trying to divert her 
mind by one of his boyish games, he harnessed the bed post and played he was driving 
the old horse past fiords and pine groves to the beautiful castle. To ease her tired 
back, he lifted her, and there in his arms, quite peacefully, she died. 
“Aase’s Death” pictures Peer’s farewell to his mother. The simplicity of the 
tune seems to portray Peer’s simplicity of spirit, for at-his mother’s deathbed he is a 
child again. A three-tone motive is used many times until the tune builds into a 
powerful climax. mi la ti mi la ti do ti la ti do re do ti. From this climax, the motive 
is turned around, and the music gradually becomes softer and lower, until it ends in 
a few moaning chords. 
In another part of Ibsen’s play Peer wandered into a desert where he found a 
beautiful white horse and bundle of gorgeous robes that had been stolen from an Arab 
chief. Donning the robes and mounting the horse, he rode afar, and was taken for a 
prophet by the Arabians. Peer had not forgotten how to tell his marvelous stories, 
and the Arabs believed them, and treated him like a king. Beautiful Arabian girls 
danced for hini. Anitra, the chief’s daughter, was the most lovely dancer of all... So 
graceful was she that Peer, before he journeyed on, gave her all the gold’and jewels. . 
“Anitra’s Dance” is a mazurka which is played by the stringed instruments only. 
Toward the end the ’cello is heard in a plaintive melody which seéms to speak of Peer 
yearning for’ home amid the gayety of the dancers. :

wedding guests! But what was even worse, he ran away from her as soon as they 
got to a deep wood. All the villagers were at his heels in a pack, every man of them 
armed with a gun or a club. Peer ran for dear life, leaping from rock to rock till 
he slipped and struck his head on a stone. 
All of a sudden he was in the land of the Trolls. Many maidens were there, but 
he seemed to like the “green-clad one” best of all, and asked the King of the Trolls 
for the hand of his daughter in marriage. The King said she should have a handsome 
dowry, and Peer liked that very much, but first he must agree to several conditions. 
He must promise to stay with them always. Peer said, if they would call him king 
that would be easy to do. Second, he must agree to eat only of their food, served to 
him by Trolls with pigs’ heads and night caps. “So be it,” said Peer. “Perhaps it 
will taste a little less sour in time.” ‘“‘ And next you must throw off your Christian man’s 
garb,” said the King, “and wear a silk bow on the end of your tail.” 
“But I haven’t a tail!’’ said Peer. 
“Then, of course, you must get one,” said the King. 
“Very well,” said Peer. “It is wisest to follow the fashion a bit-tie away.” 
Then said the King, “Finally, you must have your eyes slit, so you will see like a 
Troll forever.” And he started to pick at his left, and scratch out his right, whereupon 
Peer cried, “You must be mad! There’s a limit to all things on earth,” and he started 
to run away. 
The “green-clad one” fainted, and was carried out. The King shouted, “Dash 
him to shreds, my children!” 
"Whereupon all the little troll imps set upon him and bit him and hit him and 
pinched him. Peer rushed this way and that, but the trolls swarmed around and tripped 
him and he fell buried under a heap of them, crying, “Mother, help me, I die!” 
Just then the church bells sounded, Peer opened his eyes, looked all around him, 
and there weren’t any imps at all. 
In the selection “In the Hall of the Mountain King” we see Peer’s tormentors, 
the trolls, in a grotesque theme played first by the bassoons. La ti do re mi do mi, 
ritiri, retere, la tido re mi do milasomido miso. This theme is repeated again and 
again, all. the time increasing in volume and speed. The sharp, staccato chords at the 
close seem to represent Peer’s harsh treatment at the hands of the trolls, and then his 
sudden awakening. 
Lesson 10 
“Peer Gynt Suite” (Continued) 
Of course you are wondering whatever finally became of Peer. There are some 
beautiful songs among the incidental music which will give us the ending of the story. 
Many, many years before, indeed, when Peer was a very young man at home, 
he had seen and loved a beautiful girl named Solveig. She was so very shy and obedient 
that at first she couldn’t understand a boy like Peer, but when she came to know him

better she saw how really fine he was, if only he didn’t have such terrible manners. 
All the time Peer wandered away from home so foolishly, Solveig had perfect faith 
that some day he would come home, and one day as she sat spinning she sang this 
lovely song of happy faith, which is sometimes called her “Sunshine Song.” 
“Solveig’s Song.”—Grieg 
One day when he did come back to her, so weary and so tired, she soothed him 
and put him to sleep like a little boy, with a tender lullaby.

SEVENTH GRADE 
Lesson 1 
Schubert 
The story of a great man who has lived unhonored by the many to find in death 
a fame of which, in his greatest hopes, he had never dreamed, has come to you over 
and over in your studies of great people. / 
Sometimes you have called him Bach, sometimes Beethoven, and many other 
names would do as well, but to-day we will call him Schubert. 
Widely as musicians differ in their opinions, on one thing all agree—that Schubert 
is.the greatest of song writers. Many composers have lived whose songs nearly equal 
his, but Schubert was the first to put the best of himself into short songs, and he i is, 
therefore, called the Father of Art Songs. 
The story of his life is short and sad. He was born in Vienna on the last day of 
January, 1797. His father was a poor school-teacher with nineteen children, and 
he had neither time nor money to help little Franz with his music. 
But Franz had such a beautiful voice that -he gained admission to a choir, where 
he was taught by very good masters. He became an enthusiastic member of the school 
orchestra and composed many pietes for it to play. 
- When-he was sixteen he left the school, and as he had no money to keep on with 
music studies he became a teacher in his father’s school. Poor Franz Schubert! How 
he disliked the monotonous drudgery of teaching. But the harder his lot became the 
more beautiful grew his lovely songs. And how amazingly fast he wrote them! Exquis- 
ite bits of poetry did not seem to enter his mind as words, but as melodies, and he could 
write them down in a moment. 
It is said that once when he was eating in a tavern he picked up a volume of Shake- 
speare that belonged to one of his companions. He chanced to open at the lovely 
bit of verse, “Hark, Hark, the Lark at Heaven’s Gate Sings.” 
The usual boisterous noise of the tavern, the clatter of dishes, and the crying of 
children was around him, but Schubert’s train of thought was not disturbed. Suddenly

Lesson 2 
Art Songs 
We have found that folk-songs are simple, untaught expressions of the people of a 
nation, and oftentimes the name of their composer has never been known. 
Art songs are quite the opposite in every way. They are produced by a skilled 
musician, and are deliberately made to interpret poetry. If we were to attempt to 
_ trace the very first ones, it would lead us back to the age of the troubadours, the trou- 
vers, and the minnesingers—the wandering musicians of long, long ago who went from 
castle to castle entertaining the people with the lovely songs they “made up.” How- 
ever, many of them were composed hastily to fit some occasion, and very few of them 
have come down to us. 
And then there followed many years in which the great composers busied them- 
selves with operas and oratorios, or great instrumental works that would take a whole 
evening to perform; and nobody took much notice of beautiful short songs. If oeca- 
sionally such a composer did write a lovely, short song, it was like a chip that flew from 
his work-bench, as it were, and not his main business in composing. ° 
But finally there came a day when great composers wanted to say the more simple 
things of beauty. Franz Schubert became the first of a long series of song writers

which has continued to the present day: You will sometime become acquairited with 
many of them, including Schumann, Franz, Grieg, and MacDowell. 
Someone has compared the big operas and oratorios and such things to a great 
floral design, or an enormous cluster or bush of flowers, and the short songs to one. 
single beautiful rose bud, or even a fragrant violet which one might find in the woods. 
Such a song is the expression of the heart of a poem, through music, and for the 
song writer the world is full of beautiful poetry. If he be a really great writer, his 
dearest hope is that he may write something worthy of the great art to-which he has 
joined his own. So it is with a singer—he must study. the poetry, and speak it dis- 
tinctly; and so it is with us if we would learn more of art songs. 
Such a poem (or Lied) usually presents a single mood or picture; and even though 
it may have several stanzas they all tell the same thing, in a way. In this.case the 
composer will probably repeat the same tune for each of the stanzas. This style-of 
song-writing is called strophic or folk-song style. :

Again, the sentiment expressed in the various stanzas of the poem may differ more 
or less, in which case, if the composer follows accurately the changing thought content 
of the poetry, the music of each stanza will be different. This style of writing is called 
detailed, or thru-composed. It usually has an accompaniment which helps greatly 
to convey the spirit of the poetry. ee

Lesson 3 
Art Ballad ~~ 
Both in poetry and music the term “ballad” has been used with the greatest freedom 
and no exact definition. 
Ballads may spring from folk or art sources. Many old ballads were little more 
than sentimental popular songs, and sometimes there was an accompanying dance. 
Perhaps you have heard a funny old story-telling song with a great many verses, all 
to the saine tune of music. 
The art ballad as we know it was first written by Schubert and Loewe, and has 
been a very distinct type of composition ever since. 
The art ballad is a song expressing poetry with various characters and scenes, 
and probably quite a series of changing feelings. It is composed in the detailed or 
“thru-composed” style, and is quite likely to have a descriptive accompaniment that 
heightens the dramatic effects of the story.

Terms of Pure Music 
How many times we have enjoyed following music that has led us to “The Brook”’ 
or “The Hall of the Mountain King” or “The Land of the Sugar Plum Fairy” with 
its quaint little dancing dolls. And we have “seen” whirlwinds, and swans, and clock 
stores, and so many things we know and like. Always the names of these compositions 
tell-us what the music is describing. 
But there is another “Music land,” which is much more enchanted, at least that is 
what the greatest musicians say, and they go there often. Its compositions do not 
describe things, for they are purely music. 
We would all like to go to the land of Pure Music, but there are those iron gates 
in the way, across which are written such queer words as Andante Cantabile, Fugue, 
and Scherzo. Most of us wouldn’t dare to say them aloud, nor guess where such strange 
passwords would lead. 
Let us consult a guide book. . 
Music Notation and Terminology—K. W. Gehrkens. Andante? The guide book 
tells us it means “going.” Usually when we go “Andante” it is rather slowly, but 
how shall we go this time? Cantabile? That we find, simply means “in a singing 
manner.” Perhaps there are few things in music land that everyone loves any more 
than this lovely composition for strings that “goes in a singing manner.” 
“Andante Cantabile.”—-Tschaikowsky. 
The next password is Fugue. One hears it pronounced so many queer ways. 
Just how do you say it? (Ftg.) . 
The guide book will tell us that through it we are to be initiated into the musical 
game of “Follow Your Leader.” The players will give out a tune. They say “Keep 
track of this.” Then they give out a second tune and say “Don’t let. this confuse 
you.” And while your ears are straining after the first, the second keeps darting across 
the path like a rabbit in an autumn hunt. Then, just to make the game more exciting, 
they may give out a third tune. 
The listener who can keep in his mind the first tune, and recognize it each time 
it is played, no matter how it may be “juggled” in with others or turned upside down 
in the effort to “trap” the hearer—that person wins the game. His reward is some 
of the keenest sport in all the realm of music.

Bach was a master of the Fugue. He was able to accomplish such difficult melodic 
manipulations and do it so artistically that he was called “Master.” He has never 
-been equaled even to this day, though that was two hundred years ago. 
Material: ‘Old Rounds.” 
“Hold Thy Peace” (traditional), used in “‘Twelfth Night.” 
Fugue.—Bach, 
And so we see that these passwords aren’t so hard after all, and when we think how, 
they have frightened us it is quite a joke. 
Joke! By the way, that is what Scherzo means! Even the sedate old musicians 
of the powdered wigs loved a joke, and have given us many musical ones, like this 
one: 
Scherzo—from Eroica Symphone.—Beethoven. 
Lesson 5 
Unfinished Symphony 
In all the literature of instrumental music there is no more - beloved composition 
than the unfinished symphony of Schubert. 
A symphony is a sonata written for orchestra. But whatisasonata? A long, Jong 
time agoa sonata was merely a composition that was played (sounded) upon an instru- 
ment instead of being sung, as was most music, so very long ago. But it was not long 
until instrumental music became elaborate, and for about one hundred and fifty years 
now a “sonata” has meant a lengthy and more or less elaborate composition, always 
having three or four separate divisions called “movements, ”” as a baseball game has 
several innings. 
Sometimes these movements seem like chapters of a book—one containing stirring 
passages with much action, while another may be pensive, and still another sparkling, 
light, and rhythmic, like a dance. These “chapters” (movements) of a symphony 
are given names which describe the musical content; its rate of speed. (tempo) or its 
mood, such as allegro, andante, scherzo, etc. 
The symphony is the very highest type of instrumental music, in fact, so important 
is it, that orchestras which play symphonies are called “symphony orchestras,” in cox- 
trast to others which do not, such as dance or theater orchestras. 
The first movement of a sonata or symphony always deals with more than one 
melody, as a story has more than one character. You can easily learn the melodies 
(tunes) in Schubert’s symphony, for they sing themselves like lovely songs, wistful 
and tender. 
The first melody is little more than a phrase, which serves as an introduction to 
the two principal ones.

Lesson 6 
Stephen Foster 
Take a trip to the far-off country of Africa. We will stop for the night in a little 
village. Hark! someone is singing! The words are strange to us because they are in 
a language we do not understand. But the tune, surely we recognize that, and it 
almost makes tears of homesickness come to our eyes to hear it in this far country. It 
is “Old Folks at Home,” and it is being sung as if the singer enjoyed it. 
Now we are in Asia, and as we pass along a little narrow street we see a group of 
dark-faced natives listening to a man who is singing. In his native tongue he is singing 
“Old Folks at Home.” As we again note the familiar strains we realize that it is 
indeed true, as has been said, that music is a universal language. 
- You, no doubt, would like to hear something of the man who wrote this song 
that has sung its way around the world. 
. Stephen Collins Foster was born in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, i in . He came 
of a good family. His father was a general merchant, who shipped goods on flat- 
bottomed boats, down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans. Perhaps 
the stories his father told on his return from these trips influenced Stephen in writing 
so many Southern melodies. 
He was the idol of a tender and devoted mother, which goes far to account for the 
delicacy and refinement which gives his melodies much of their charm. He loved music 
_.. from childhood. When two years old he would lay his sister’s guitar on the floor and 
_/spick out harmonies, while at eight he taught himself the flute and, later, the piano.

. His first composition was written for four flutes, to be played at his school com- 
mencement. At nineteen he formed a singing club among the young men of his acquaint- 
ance, and he composed many songs for the club, among them being “Uncle Ned.” From 
that time on he continued to write songs with melodies so simple and appealing that 
they have all the characteristics of genuine folk-songs. 
When only twenty, before he had become a professional musician, he gave two 
of his songs, “Uncle Ned” and “O Susanna,” to a friend. This friend cleared $10,000 
from their sale, and his small musical publishing business grew, through the popularity 
of these songs, to be one of the leading publishing houses of the West. 
His songs often echoed his personal feelings. ‘“Massa’s in de Cold, Cold Ground,” 
though a darky song, expressed his loneliness after the death of his father. “Old Dog 
Tray” was written in memory of a beautiful setter he had owned. “My Old Kentucky 
Home” was composed on a pleasant summer afternoon as he sat whtching the little 
darkies on the lawn of a fine old Southern plantation “while the birds made music all 
the day.” His best-known song, “Old Folks at Home,” was first sung by Christy, 
the famous minstrel, who paid $500.for the privilege of singing it before it was pub- 
lished, and for signing his own name to the first edition. This explains why Christy’s 
name appears on the title page of the first edition. 
Foster wrote at least one hundred and sixty songs, all expressing sentiments that 
are dear to all, love of home, of mother, of wife, or of sweetheart. Even during his 
lifetime his music was on thousands, perhaps millions, of lips. It has been said that 
during the last years of his life, which were passed in great loneliness in New York, 
the most familiar sound he heard about him were strains of his own music, the least 
familiar sight a face he knew. Now, he is recognized, too late to prosper him, as a 
truly great composer of tender, refined melodies which have had a large part in develop- 
ing the musical taste of America. 
Joy has been carried through these songs to millions of people who do not know 
they were written by Stephen Collins Foster.

Never‘ so long as the piano remains the piano will Chopin be forgotten. Other

The country of Poland is but a small spot on the map of Europe to-day, but once 
it was one of the large and important kingdoms of that continent, and the people were 
-very proud of their country. 
As you can see by the map, it is surrounded by strong and powerful countries and 
for years the Poles struggled to keep these neighboring nations from taking away their 
territory. History has no greater heroes than these Polish soldiers, for they loved their 
country as we love our own United States, but they fought in vain. Poland was divided 
among Austria, Germany, and Russia. 
Still the people longed for the time to come when their country might again be free, 
and even the children had a share in this hope. 
You know that after the World War Poland was in part restored, and that a very 
famous Polish musician gave up his music that, as President of Poland, he might help 
his country to build herself anew. Yes, it was Paderewski, whose marvelous playing 
you may sometime hear. 
It was while Poland was still a divided country, in the same year that Abraham 
Lincoln was born, that there was born this baby boy, Frederick Chopin, who was to 
express through the music that made him famous his love for his country and his sorrow 
over her condition. 
When not yet nine years old he was invited to play at a public concert, and so 
modest was he that he thought the pleasure of the audience was because of his clothes, 
a splendid native Polish costume. 
Polish people have always been very fond of music, and their folk-songs are a part 
of their national life, so Chopin loved to use in his music these folk-tunes. 
When he was about twenty years old he went away from Poland, sad indeed to 
leave his beloved country. He went to Paris and at first was greatly discouraged, for 
no one seemed to care for his music. He was just about to sail for America to see. 
if he could not better his fortunes when he was invited to spend an evening in the home 
of a wealthy man. - He so pleased the people with his playing and his charming manners 
that they all wanted to help him. 
This is what he wrote home about it: 
“T shall not go to America now, for I am happy in Paris. I have work in plenty 
and the best of friends. Among them are princes and nobles. Many fine musicians 
have come to me for lessons. From the praises I receive I might imagine myself a 
great artist; however, no one knows so well as I that I still have much to learn.” 
Except for concert tours into England or Germany the remainder of his life was 
spent in Paris, in this circle of wit, talent, and fashion. Picture to yourselves such 
an evening as he often spent in private drawing-rooms with people of great fame. 
Among the company we would find Franz Liszt, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer, and 
‘maybe Robert and Clara Schumann. 
Can you name the beautiful music you might hear if each of these people would 
play one of his own compositions? © 
Chopin seldom played in great public places, preferring to resign in favor of the 
great and brilliant Liszt, but in his circle of friends he loved to play. Never had the

piano sounded before, as it did when touched by his delicate hands, in moods now 
tender, now martial, now gay, capricious, or sad. 
But unfortunately Chopin was never strong, and always when his great talent 
would have led him here or there he was restrained by illness; and he died when only 
forty years of age. 
Before he left Poland his friends had presented him with a silver loving cup filled 
with Polish earth so that he might always have that token of his native land near him. 
When he died this earth was sprinkled on his grave, so that though he was buried in a 
foreign country he rested beneath Polish soil. 
Some of the best-loved piano compositions of Chopin are those in which he has 
perpetuated the customs or idealized the dances which Poland enjoyed at the height 
of her power and splendor. 
In those days a coronation ceremony was a magnificent sight where proud nobles 
wore rich robes and many jewels and marched in stately pomp through the throne hall 
to be presented to the king. “The Polonaise” which was written for this occasion 
embodied the dignity and beauty of the procession. In later times it came to be used 
as the opening number at state balls. 
Chopin has given us a great number of ideal polonaises, with variety of moods 
and suggestions, but all based on the original polonaise. 
“Military Polonaise.” —Chopin. 
Probably the most enduring dance of modern times has been the waltz. It was 
introduced into the social life of Vienna in 1780 and soon became a favorite throughout 
Europe. Waltz music was originally intended as rhythmic accompaniment to the 
dance, but by and by composers used this fascinating rhythm as a basis for compositions 
no longer to be used as dances, but as tone pictures of the moods that one might find 
among the dancers—some light and gay, some tender or sad, some filled with jest and 
laughter. 
The waltzes of Chopin remain the standard of this idealized waltz. 
Waltzes.—Chopin. (See any catalog of recorded material.) 
The mazurka was a dance of ancient Polish origin. Its meter is also $ (2 or 3), 
but its rhythm (or motion) is very different from that of either the majestic polonaise 
or the smooth, graceful waltz. 
Generally speaking, in the mazurka the accent falls on the second beat in the meas- 
ure, and although in slower tempo than the waltz, it is subject to sudden outbursts of 
Slavie fire, and marked contrasts of mood. 
Chopin gave us many idealized mazurkas that are like tiny poems, full of caprice.

Lesson 9 
Oratorio 
From very earliest times , dramatic performances have been used to teach moral 
and religious truths, and to instruct people in history and legend. 
Long before people were taught to read, indeed before there were any books ¢ except 
for a few precious hand-made parchments, there were plays, called mystery or morality 
plays, of which you will some day hear in your history work. 
The subjects of these plays were from the Bible, or maybe from the life of a:saint, 
or they illustrated a religious truth, and their presentation was usually associated 
- with music. 
Nobody knows when or how such productions started, but as-early as the twelfth
-P-A-G-E-170
MUSIC APPRECIATION 161 
century they seem to have been rather common—sometimes under the auspices of the 
church, and sometimes given by strolling companies who traveled about in a kind of a 
wagon that could be turned into a little theater on any street corner. 
These early performances were often made ridiculous by inappropriate costumes 
and inferior presentation, but there were those who saw in this crude performance a 
_form of art well worth serious development, because it could be at the same time instruc- 
tive and very beautiful. 
One of the principal reformers was S. Philip Neri, who had a scene from Scripture 
dramatically rendered before or after his sermons. As these observances were first 
introduced in the Oratory or chapel of S. Philip’s church they came.to be commonly 
spoken of as “Oratorios,” and soon this term was accepted.not only in Rome, but 
throughout the whole world. 
The first real oratorio as we know it was given in Rome in 1600. Many improve- 
ments were made, to be sure, until the finest oratorios of all the world were written by 
Handel, who died in 1759. 
The composer of the nineteenth century who has written the most glorious oratorios 
is Felix Mendelssohn, whose oratorios rank second only to those of Handel. 
The oratorio is such a splendid form of composition for great choruses that in 
these days almost any serious subject is often written as an oratorio. Mendelssohn’s 
greatest ones were the Bible stories of St. Paul and Elijah. 
Next to “The Messiah” by Handel. “Elijah” is more often given than any oratorio 
in the world. The libretto (book of the words; the text itself) is taken from Old Testa- 
ment accounts of the prophet Elijah (largely from the books of Kings) which tell of 
his work among the ancient Hebrews, whose kingdoms were at this time divided, and 
whose religion was filled with false prophets. 
At the time of our story Ahab, the king of the Israelites, has takén for his queen, 
Jezebel, a worshiper of Baal, and largely through her influence, the worship of Jehovah 
has given place to that of idols. 
It is at this time that Elijah, a prophet of Jehovah, appears, and predicts that 
“There shall not be dew nor rain these seven years,” and a terrible drought follows, 
which is described in a series of beautiful choruses, solos, and duets. 
Among the Israelites is a faithful young man, Obadiah, who tells the people if 
they would forsake their idols and return to God they would find Him kind and gracious. 
There is no lovelicr tenor solo in all literature than “If with All Your Hearts”— 
Mendelssohn. But the people do not repent, and during the terrible years of famine 
there is great persecution of the prophets. Many are killed, and Elijah is forced to 
hide, fed miraculously by the ravens, and finally by a widow whose son he restores 
to life. 
At length he decides to leave his hiding-place and to settle the issue by a great 
contest on Mt. Carmel. 
All the priests and followers of Baal are summoned, as are the faithful followers 
4 Jehovah. They erect an altar with sacrifices upon it, and agree that whichever god 
‘hall send fire to consume the sacrifice shall be acknowledged the true God of Israel.

From local artists she should lead her class to become interested in the world artists. 
Let the teacher announce that she is going to arrange a radio concert for Friday 
afternoon. Her concert will be given by four of the great violinists of the world. Those 
artists are: 
Heifetz 
Kreisler 
Elman « 
Morini 
She should ask the class to be able to tell her something about these four violinists 
in the fifteen-minute current-event period immediately preceding the concert. 
A concert announcer may be chosen from the class who is privileged to give an 
item of interest about the artist he announces. 
Teachers should make it a point that no matter how perfectly the broadcasting 
is done, unless the receiving instrument is in good condition, the radio concert is a

Musical Terms 
Long ago we discovered that the names of compositions are really labels that tell 
us of their content. Many of them are familiar words, which indicate that the music is 
descriptive of objects or movements in the natural world about us. 
And then we found that the strange words which are used as titles to pure music 
are also full of meaning if we but understand them, “passwords” we called them.
-P-A-G-E-173

Because the program for any fine concert (especially if it be pure instrument:

one of two things: : . 
1. Form or style of the composition. 
2. Its rate of speed, or tempo. 
Because it is simpler, let us consider the second group first. The word “tempo’ 
' means rate of speed, or manner of movement. A long, long time ago when there wer

Lesson 2 
Correlation 
In modern education there is a new appreciation of the correlation of differer| 
jects. . Nowhere is there a greater opportunity for two subjects to illumine each 
than the parallel interpretation of English and music. ; 
The following lesson was a natural outgrowth of a study of Longfellow’s Evangeline: 
A child remarked that she always thought of the song, “Listen to the Mocking 
Bird,” when she read the passage describing that bird. 
Since many especially beautiful. passages had been selected for memorizing, it was suggested, no doubt, music could be found that would be a fitting accompaniment for many of these “memory quotations” if each one would look among his records at home. A sort of guessing contest was held on the material brought to class. . 
The child bringing the record would play it and the pupils would ‘find the suitable _.words or passage. Sometimes two or three records would be played for one Passage

  and the children chose the one they considered best suited. This lesson took three 
days aud then the selections had not all been heard. 
3. The following were selected and the passages are quoted: 
. “Spinning Song” from Mendelssohn’s “Songs Without Words,” played by 
‘Rachmaninoff. 
“Close at her father’s side was the gentle Evangeline seated, 
Spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her. 
Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was its diligent shuttle, 
While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like the drone of a bagpipe, 
Followed the old man’s song, and united the fragments together.” 
. Massenet’s “Angelus.” 
“Anon from the belfry 
Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs of the village 
Columns of pale’blue smoke, like clouds of incense ascending, 
Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and contentment.” 
“Peer Gynt,” “Moming Song.”—Grieg. 
(“William Tell” Overture, “The Dawn.”—Rossini.) 
“Pleasantly rose next morn, the sun on the village of Grand-Pré.. 
Pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air, the Basin of Minas, : 
Where the ships with their wavering shadows. were riding at anchor. 
Life had long been astir in the village, and clamorous labor . 
Knocked with its hundred hands at-the golden gates of the morning.” 
(The “ Peer Gynt ” number was selected because the-class agreed they could geta » picture 
of the rising sun more clearly.) _ 
. “Ave Maria.”—Schubert. McCormack-Kreisler. 
“Then came the evening service. The tapers gleamed from the altar; 
Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest, and the people responded, 
Not with their lips alone, but their hearts: and the Ave Maria 
Sang they, and fell on their knees, and their souls, with devotion translated, 
Rose on the ardor of prayer, like Elijah ascending to heaven.” 
. “Ave Maria,” “Cavalleria Rusticana.”—Mascagni. 
“Ave Maria.” Bach-Gounod. 
“Foremost the young men came; and, raising together their voices, 
“Sang they with tremulous lips a, chant of the Catholic Missions: 
‘Sacred heart of the Saviour! O inexhaustible fountain! 
Fill our hearts this day with strength and ‘submission and patience!” : 
Then the old men, as they marched, and the women that stood by the. wayside 
Joined in the sacred psalm, and the birds in the sunshine above them. 
“s Mingled their notes therewith, like voices of spirits departed.” .

6. Overture 1812.—Tschaikowsky. 
(The class decided that the “ crashing chords were exciting—reminded them ol 
timbers—minor tune—rises and falls like fames.”) 
“Suddenly there rose from the south a light,.as in autumn the blood-red 
Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o’er the horizon 
Titan-like stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow, 
Seizing the rocks and the rivers, and piling huge shadows together. 
Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village, 
Gleamed on the sky and the sea, and the ships that lay in the roadstead. 
Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of flame were 
Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands o| 
Then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch, and 
Whirled them aloft through the air, at once from a hundred hou: 
Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled.” 
7. “Ase’s Death,” (Peer Gynt) Grieg. 
“Funeral March.”—Chopin. (Played by de Pachmann.) 
“As they turned at length to speak to their silent companion, 
Lo! from his seat he had fallen, and stretched abroad on the seashore 
Motionless lay his form, from which the soul had departed. 
Then a familiar voice she heard, as it said to the people— 
‘Let us bury him here by the sea. When a happier season 
Brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile, 
Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard.’ 
Such were the words of the priest. And there in haste by the sea-side, 
Having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches, 
But without bell or book they buried the farmer of Grand-Pré. 
And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow, 
Lo! with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation, 
Solemnly answered the sea, and mingled its roar with the dirges.” 
(The class chose Chopin’s March because there was that calmer strain which seemed 
to refer to the lines, “‘ When a happier season,” etc.) 
“Mocking Bird.”—Seth Winner. (Ghick and Kellogg.) 
“Then from a neighboring thicket the mocking-bird, wildest of singers, 
Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o’er the water, 
Shook from his little throat such floods of delirous music, 
That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen. 
Plaintive at first were the tones, and sad; then soaring to madness 
Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes. 
Single notes were then heard, in sorrowful low lamentation; 
Till, having gathered them all, he flung them abroad in derision, 
As, when, after a storm, a gust of wind through the tree-tops 
Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches.”

(The class preferred that Rhapsody for this passage, as it had a sad theme mixed in 
with the dance.) 
“In the neighboring hall a strain of music, proceeding 
From the accordant strings of Michael’s melodious fiddle, 
Broke up all further speech. Away like children delighted, 
All things forgotten beside, they gave themselves to the maddening 
Whirl of the dizzy dance, as it swept and swayed to the music, 
Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments. 
Meanwhile, apart of the head of the hall, the priest and the herdsman 
Sat, conversing together of past and present and future, 
While Evangeline stood like one entranced, for within her, 
Olden memories rose, and loud in the midst of the music 
Heard she the sound of the sea, and an irrepressible sadness 
Came o’er her heart, and unseen she stole forth into the garden.”

Like the swect thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit. 
Nearer and round about her, the manifold flowers of the garden 
Poured out their souls in odors, that were their prayers and confessions 
Unto the night, as it went its way, like a silent Carthusian. 
Fuller of fragrance were they, and as heavy with shadows and night-dews, 
Hung the heart of the maiden. The calm and the magical moonlight 
Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings, 
As through the garden gate, between the brown shade of the oak trees, 
Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie. 
Silent it lay, with a silvery haze upon it, and fireflies 
Gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers. 
Over her head the stars, the thoughts of God in the heavens, 
Shone on the eyes of man, who had ceased to marvel and worship, 
Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple, \

Divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden: 
Now in the Tents of Grace of the meek Moravian Missions, 
Now in the noisy camps and the battle-fields of the army, 
Now in secluded hamlets, in towns and populous cities. 
Fair was she and young, when in hope began the long journey; 
Faded was she and old, when in disappointment it ended. 
Each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty, 
Leaving behind it, broader and deeper, the gloom and the shadow. 
Then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o’er her forehead, 
Dawn of another life, that broke o’er her earthly horizon, 
As in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning.” 
13. “Evening Song.”—Schumann. 
“On the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man. 
Long and thin, and gray were the locks that shaded his temples; 
But, as he lay in the morning light, his face for a moment 
Seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood; 
So are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying. 
Motionless, senseless, dying, he lay, and his spirit exhausted 
Seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness, 
Darkness of slumber and death, forever sinking and sinking. 
Then through those realms of shade, in multiplied reverberations, 
Heard he that ery of pain, and through the hush that succeeded 
Whispered a gentle voice, in accents tender and saint-like, 
‘Gabriel! O my beloved! and died away into silence, 
Then he beheld in a dream, once more the home of his childhood; 
Green Acadian meadows, with sylvan rivers among them, 
Village and mountain, and woodlands; and walking under their shadow, 
As in the days of their youth, Evangeline rose in his vision. 
Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he lifted his eyelids, 
Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline knelt by his bedside. 
Vainly he-strove to whisper her name, for the accents unuttered 
Died on his lips, and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken. 
Vainly he strove to rise; and Evangeline, kneeling beside him, 
Kissed his dying lips, and laid his head on her bosom. - 
Sweet was the light of his eyes; but it-suddenly sank into darkness, 
As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement.”

Lesson 3° 
Opera 
Toward the close of the sixteenth century in Florence, Italy, there was a little 
circle of nobles, students, and music lovers who met often at the home of Count Bardi 
to discuss the revival of Greek drama—that is, a drama in which the effect of the story 
is heightened through its union with music. 
Unfortunately they had no means of knowing exactly what this Greek drama was, 
for no manuscripts of Greek music dramas were preserved through the dark ages in 
which music and drama were alike forgotten. Two or three great musicians, Peri, 
Caccini, and others, set about working out a style of music-writing that wéuld lend 
itself to dramatic performance. The greatest music they had in those days was arranged 
for great choruses, and, of course, if a character in a drama was to be a conquering hero, 
or a gallant lover, or a scheming villain he must not be lost in a chorus with other 
_people, but must sing alone in a manner which would approach as nearly as possible, 
ordinary speech. This need gave rise to the type of singing which is called recitative 
(rés-ti-ta-tév’) (musical recitation), in which there is often very little accompaniment 
and not much melody, but the words stand out distinctly. -You have heard that style 
of singing often; it was also used in the oratorio. 
The story of any opera demands a great deal of recitative singing. There are other 
moods in which one just wants to sing, and we find many lovely songs in operas, called 
arias (a’ri-&). : 
It is very well for Mignon to dream and sing of her native land where the orange 
grows and the breeze gently wafts the song of the birds, in a lovely aria (“Know’st 
Thou the Land”), but if a knight were commanding his squire to bring his armor and 
shield and to wait for him at some appointed place it would be better to sing as nearly as 
possible like the spoken word. 
As you hear solos from operas you can easily tell if they are recitative (declamatory) 
or aria (song). Oftentimes one solo begins in the former manner and ends in the latter. 
While an opera contains action, speech, stage-setting, and music, the singing is 
really the chief factor, and the one to which all others give way since that is what dis- 
tinguishes it from the ordinary spoken drama. 
This new musical drama (opera) soon outgrew the narrow circles of the Florentines 
and became an occasion for great display as entertainments at public festivities and . 
the courts of princes. And so quickly did it spread that opera houses built exclusively , 
for its production soon. appeared in Italy, and almost at the same time in France, 
Germany, and England, and throughout the musical world. 
Our own United States has been receptive to the operas that have come to us - 
from the older countries. As yet, however, we have but two: permanent organizations 
for production of opera—the Metropolitan Opera Co. in New York and the Chicago 
Opera Co. Efforts to maintain them in other cities have failed because of the tremen- 
dous expense involved, but there are several good traveling companies whose tours -

Lesson 4 
RICHARD WAGNER 
In Italy; where opera was first developed, it was the custom of the composers to 
write a number of songs for special singers—music in which acting was of little impor- 
tance, but which should serve to show off to the fullest extent the voices of the singers. 
In fact at one time in Italy the operas were called “concert operas.” 
Richard Wagner, one of the greatest geniuses of all times, felt that there was no 
real art in such music—that an opera, or music drama, should mean much more than 
mere “vocal gymnastics,” and his greatest compositions in the field of opera are called 
“musie dramas.” / 
“Every part of the drama,” he said, “must be in harmony with its poetic idea.” 
Neither the poetry nor the music must be regarded as of the greater importance. Com- 
bined with these two must be the added effect of the other fine arts. The acting, the 
scenery, the dancing, must all have their place, and contribute to the perfect whole. 
That he might secure this unity he wrote his own words (the librettos) for his 
operas, he made his own drawings for the scenery, and regarded no detail as too unim- 
portant for ‘his attention. He made his orchestra a very important part of his music 
“dramas, for in its music one hears the story told without words. 
To represent each idea—love, death, the sword, giants, or the different heroes— 
Wagner wrote a special musical phrase called a “motive,” and if one makes a study of 
his operas he-can by listening to the orchestra tell what character is about to appear 
on the stage or what thought is being suggested. 
: So that nothing should distract the attention of the audience, the orchestra was 
concealed from view. ’ 
Because his ideas were so different from those of the other musicians of his time, 
he was laughed at and his work was most severely criticized. Publishers would not ' 
buy his music, and he was often almost penniless. But through it all—poverty, lack of 
artistic sympathy, unkind criticism—he did not lose faith in himself or his own ideals, 
but persevered and kept on writing as subjects for new operas came into his mind. 
In other ways he was not popular in his.own country. He was very outspoken
-P-A-G-E-180
MUSIC APPRECIATION 171 
against the rulers at times, so he was not allowed to live at home and therefore sought 
a new home in Switzerland. 
While there in exile, his friend Liszt, then almost a “musical king,” gave a per- 
formance of “Lohengrin” in Weimar. Of course, Wagner could not be present. But 
this opera so won the heart of the young Prince of Bavaria that he championed Wag- 
ner’s cause, inviting him to Bavaria and helping him with funds to build the theater 
at Bayreuth, in which theater his music dramas were presented regularly, until inter- 
rupted by the late war. 
Greatest singers regarded it the highest honor to be invited to sing there, in the 
great Wagnerian festivals. 
One of Wagner’s most popular operas is “Die Walkiire,”’ which is indeed only one 
of a group of four operas with a continuous story, but designed to be performed on 
separate evenings. 
So great a master of the orchestra was Wagner that his orchestral compositions 
for operas often appear on concert programs for great symphony orchestras, and the 
two which follow are favorites in the realm of titanic and thrilling music. 
Ride of the Valkyries ' > r by :      
  
The Valkyrie maidens in the opera “Walkiire” were daughters of the great god 
Wotan. Dressed in silver armor, shining helmets, and glittering shields, it was their 
mission to carry the souls of dead heroes from the battlefields to their resting place 
in Walhalla. 
The “Ride of the Valkyries” depicts these war maidens flying through space on 
winged horses, amid the mountain crags, the swiftly moving clouds, the rushing winds 
and flashes of lightning. Above it all we can easily distinguish two significant musical 
figures, or “motives,” the use of which was so characteristic with Wagner. One stands 
for the galloping war horses: 
The other is the wild war cry of Briinnhilde, the favorite daughter of Wotan, 
and the leader of the Valkyrie maidens. 
As we hear the composition listen for these two motives which come again and 
again, like friendly guide-posts among the confusion of the warlike scene. 
Briimnhilde’s cry 
  
  But one time Briinnhilde disobeyed her father, the great god Wotan; and though 
she was his best-beloved war maiden it was necessary to punish her. Her father took

  Lesson 5 
LOHENGRIN 
A story of the Holy Grail—of stately Lords and Ladies of old, and of a wondrous 
Knight i in shining white armor, such is the story of Lohengrin. 
There was great excitement in the duchy of Brabant, for King Henry was honoring 
it with a royal visit. _ 
- Trumpets’ were sounding and heralds were calling upon all loyal subjects to enroll 
under the banner of the King for an expedition against the Hungarians who were about 
to invade the kingdom. 
The King summoned Frederick of Telramund to whom he expressed his pleasure 
in the loyalty and devotion of the people, but added that he had heard rumors of some 
trouble in the province. 
Then Frederick stepped forth and spoke: 
“Your Majesty knows that after the death of the Duke I was appointed guardian “sof the duchy and ‘also of the Duke’s young son, Godfrey, and daughter, Elsa. There is.a strange story I have to tell, though I would fain keep silent.

“Tt chanced that one day the Lady Elsa with her brother wandered forth, but 
later she returned alone, pretending the boy had been lost from her in the forest. 
Though we questioned her she would answer nothing, but her palg and trembling face

she told the King of a dream and a vision that had come to her, wherein-a handsome 
and noble knight had been sent by Heaven to help her. 
“Elsa’s Dream.” 
These were the words that Elsa used in describing her wonderful dream. In the. 
last verse she proclaims her faith in the knight of her dream. 
“Lonely amid my sorrow, 
I knelt to God and pray’d, 
To Him my grief outpouring, 
I pleaded for His aid, : 
And from my lips unbounded, : 
Awoke so sad a cry 
Like mighty notes it sounded 
Far o’er me in the sky. 
My grief the zephyrs bore Him, 
To Him who knoweth well, 
And weariness stole o’er me, 
In slumber sweet I fell. 
“Tn silver armor gleaming 
A Knight appeared to me, 
A Knight of mien angelic, 
The like I ne’er did see,
-P-A-G-E-183

A golden horn hung lightly, 
He leaned upon his sword, 
He was so high and knightly, 
He shall me aid afford. 
With courteous gentle bearing 
Gave comfort he to me, 
No more my lot deploring, 
He shall my champion be. 
“Mark ye! Whom Heav’n has sent me 
Shall gain a guerdon rare, 
In my good father’s country 
The royal crown shail wear; 
To yield him my possessions 
Shall be my dearest pride, 
For thus my fair name shielding, 
Lo! I will be his bride.” 
As was a custom in those far-off days, the King then made decree that the truth 
should be proved by combat between Frederick and a champion chosen by Elsa. 
Once did the trumpet call forth in vain for one who would stake his honor and 
perhaps his life in defense of Elsa’s innocence, but no champion appeared. 
“Let the trumpet call again,” said Elsa. “My knight dwells afar.” 
So again the call rang out. 
Suddenly the people nearest the water’s edge began to cry, “A marvel! Look! 
A boat appears, drawn by a swan, and lo! a knight in full armor, standing on the prow!” 
Now all saw the knight, who we know was Lohengrin, step out of his boat with a 
kind word of farewell to his faithful swan. 
Lohengrin asked Elsa if she accepted him as her hero and she promised that if 
he were victor in her cause she would pledge herself and her possessions to him. 
“A promise I must ask of you,” said the knight. “By your love for me, never ask 
“From whence to thee I came, 
Or what my race and name,’ 
and Elsa faithfully promised, by her love for Lohengrin, that she would never question 
him. 
Now the combat took place and Lohengrin was victorious over Frederick, whose 
life he spared. And great was the rejoicing that the innocence of the Lady Elsa had 
been thus proved: 
By his defeat, Frederick was rendered an outcast. In his shame he reproached 
his wife that she had, by her counsel, brought this disgrace upon them, for it was she 
who had persuaded him to accuse Elsa of the crime. And he would have fled from 
the place but that Ortrud urged him to remain, telling him that if he would leave it 
all to her she would bring grief upon Elsa and Lohengrin.
-P-A-G-E-184
MUSIC APPRECIATION : : 175 
Her plan was to awaken Elsa’s curiosity so that she would break her promise 
to Lohengrin and beg to know his name. 
* At first Elsa declared her perfect faith in her knight, but little by little doubts 
crept in, despite her happiness and love, and after the wedding when she and Lohengrin 
were alone she asked the forbidden question: 
“TI pray you, tell me your name and race. I will never speak them to another.” 
Lohengrin reminded her of her promise and asked her to take back her question, 
but Elsa begged until they were interrupted by the forced entrance of Frederick and 
four of his friends, who rushed upon them with drawn swords, With one stroke of 
Lobengrin’s sword which Elsa quickly caught up and handed to her husband Frederick 
fell dead, and his four comrades let fall their swords and fell on their knees before the 
knight. 
Now againythe King and people gathered by the river bank waiting for Lohengrin 
who, so they expected, was to lead forth the soldiers in battle. 
Lohengrin appeared, amid the cheers of the crowd. But he, looking sorrowfully 
upon them, told them that his wife, the Lady Elsa, had broken her word and now he 
would not longer withhold his name. 
“Tn distant lands,” he said, “stands a mountain, Monsalvat. It is the shrine for 
the Holy Grail and is guarded by faithful knights. These knights may journey far 
to help the weak and relieve distress, and always will they be victorious. But mark 
this—if one discloses his name and race and course of his power he must return to 
Monsalvat. 
“Know, then, that I was sent by Heaven to aid the Lady Elsa in her distress. 
My father, Parsifal, is guardian of the Grail, and I am his son, Lohengrin.” 
Then sore distress fell upon Elsa when she saw what she had done; and now, 
approaching slowly upon the bosom of the water she saw the Swan. 
Lohengrin turned to Elsa and told her that had she trusted him but one year he 
would have restored to her her brother, who was alive. As his farewell he gave her 
his sword, ring, and bugle. “Give them to your brother if he should one day return. 
They will bring to him success on every battlefield.” 
He was about to step into the boat when Ortrud, whose hate could no longer be 
hidden, cried out, “Go forth! Go forth! I’ll tell to your wife the true story of how 
by my magic I changed her brother to the form of yonder swan.” And to Elsa, “Tf 
your knight had tarried he could have released him, but now you will never see him 
again.” 
Lohengrin heard all that the wicked Ortrud had been saying, and when her wild 
words ceased he fell upon his knees in silent prayer, while all the people looked on 
in wonder. 
‘Suddenly, down a beam of light there fluttered a white dove, the dove of the Grail, 
and Lohengrin knew it for a token that his prayer had been answered. 
He loosed the golden chain which bound the swan to the boat, and as the snowy 
bird sank out of sight there rose out of the stream a fair young knight in silver armor, 
whom all knew for the missing Godfrey, brother of Elsa.

    Prelude to First Act—‘ Lohengrin.” 
-. Perhaps you have read of King Arthur and his knights and know the story of the 
Holy Grail, but in order to understand the Prelude to Wagner’s opera, “Lohengrin,” 
you will need to be familiar with the legend and here it is: 
= The Cup, or Grail, out of which Christ and his disciples drank at the Last Supper 
-was given to Joseph of Arimathea i in whose tomb the body of Christ was placed after the 
“crucifixion, 
“~. Such magic power did the cup bear that the mere beholding of it was sufficient 
"to heal all diseases of whatever kind. To the one who possessed it, perfect peace came. 
“By divine power it was spirited away and only seldom was it restored to human sight. 
“To only the noblest, purest, and most self-sacrificing of mortals was granted the privilege: 
of seeing it. Many a knight hoped to conquer his selfish nature, and make himself 
worthy of success. by going on a mission in search of the Holy Grail. 
_ . It was at last given to a band of brave and pure and gentle knights, who with 
their leader had wandered far, seeking it. They were commanded to build for it a 
worthy home on Mount Salvat. These knights were called the “Knights of the Holy 
Grail.” 
Tn order that they might be fit guardians of this holy treasure they must always 
keep themselves pure and brave, and hold themselves ready to go forth as messengers 
of the Grail to relieve distress and help the weak. 
-In this Prelude, which at once places us in a proper mood for the story that is 
to unfold itself, Wagner used but one motive, and that a most beautiful one. 
/ The first soft tones of the violins picture to us a heavenly band of angels who 
from their home on high are bearing earthward the Holy Grail. 
- Nearer and nearer come the angels and in greater sweetness and power the music 
swells forth until we imagine we can see the Grail, streaming with holy light, revealed 
in all its beauty before our eyes. > 
Then the music becomes even softer and more ethereal than it was in the beginning, 
while the Holy Grail and its heavenly guardians vanish from our sight. The Grail is 
_ gone, but the hearts of all who have beheld it have been made purer by its sacred blessing. 
Wagner uses many instruments in painting this lovely picture. The one motive, 
__the “Grail” motive, first is murmured by the strings, later by the flutes, the oboes, 
_-and the clarinets. 
. The French horns, trombones, and the ’cellos tell of the approach of the Grail 
- to-earth and the trumpets proclaim its coming into full splendor. A moment of quiet

The King of Symphony Writers 
BEETHOVEN 
What do you think would be one of the saddest misfortunes that could befall 
one whose love for music was the strongest feeling of his life? Surely it would be to 
live in a world of silence—to hear sweet harmonies only as they sang themselves in 
one’s imagination. Such was the fate of Beethoven—one of the very greatest musicians 
of all the world. / 
History seldom paints a more pathetic picture than when he appeared before 
an audience the last time to conduct his great Ninth Symphony. The men of the 
orchestra revered him, and Beethoven never knew that during that great performance 
the loyal concert master secretly directed their playing, that it might sound as the 
great master would wish. When it was finished he turned Beethoven around to see 
the cheers with which the great audience greeted his greatest symphony—for he was 
entirely deaf.
-P-A-G-E-187
178 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
In the wonderful year when the American colonies signed the Declaration of 
Independence, Ludwig van Beethoven was a child of six years living in a quaint city 
of Germany on the Rhine River. How proud are the people of Bonn to-day to point 
out to visitors a certain low building which was his birthplace! 
Already, at that early age he had started on the path that was to lead to his undying 
fame in the world of music. He was still a baby when his father, who was a musician, 
but a selfish, good-for-nothing sort of man, began to give him piano lessons with the 
hope that he, like Mozart, might become a “‘wonder child” and by his playing bring 
in money to fill the family pocketbook. 
: Poor little boy! At an age when you boys and girls were having happy play- 
times with no cares or labors, the little Ludwig was painfully and tearfully toiling 
over his scales and finger exercises. 
This might have made another child hate music, but his love for it survived the 
childhood drudgery and he early showed promise of his genius. By the time he was 
ten he could play remarkably well, not only the piano, but the violin and organ, and 
soon after was made assistant court organist. How proud he was of his fine costume, 
his beaver hat, and his sword by his’ side, for that last was a part of the costume of 
every gentleman of those days. - 
The death of his mother, whom he dearly loved, saddened his young manhood and 
he applied himself harder than ever to his music. He studied and taught and played, 
but, unlike Mozart, Beethoven at the age of twenty-five had but few published 
compositions. 
After his deafness began to come upon him he turned more and more to his music. 
He was sensitive about his misfortunes, and for comfort went to the country. From 
the woods which he loved he once wrote to a friend, “My deafness troubles me less 
there than elsewhere. Every tree seems to speak to me of God.” 
Beethoven wrote his music as he thought it should be written and he played as 
he felt it should be played. There were many rules in those days which people were 
supposed to follow just because it was the fashion, but Beethoven cared not for rules, 
-. fortunately, but expressed himself through his music in the way he felt it. 
He also made many changes in the use of the instruments of the orchestra which 
the people at that time thought were very queer, but which we know were to make 
orchestral music more beautiful. 
His nine symphonies are still among the greatest musical compositions that have 
ever been written, and wherever orchestral music is played these mighty compositions 
are heard, though they were written over one hundred and fifty years ago. 
Beethoven’s life lacked the happiness and love that made the music of Mozart 
and Mendelssohn so lighthearted, but the thoughts, the longings, the spiritual aspirations 
that he could perhaps not express in words were put into the wonderful music which 
he composed. 
Not that it is gloomy—on the contrary, it is full of courage, of hope, and inspiring 
dignity. It mirrors his love of nature, his reverence for God, and his belief in the 
brotherhood of man.

Think of the mountain peak that lifts itself above the plain, its head rearing itself 
against the blue sky. The sunlight showers its gold upon it—down its slopes tumble 
laughing cascades—its meadows are starred witha million flowers. Sometimes storms 
rage about and above it and its peak is lost in clouds, but again the clouds scatter, the 
storm ceases and the mountain is once more outlined in its serenity and majesty. 
Such is the music of Beethoven. Even though deafness shut him out from the 
world of sound, though his friends failed him as friends sometimes do fail one, even 
though his life was one of constant toil, still he sang for us, through his music, of hope 
and peace and the dignity of the human soul.

Symphonic Poem 
To-day we are going to enjoy a new music form. 
A French composer by the name of Dukas by chance happened to read a poem 
written by one of Germany’s greatest poets, Goethe. He was-impressed by its musical 
possibilities, and immediately decided to interpret it through a symphony orchestra. 
This music would describe the action of the poem and give to the listener the same 
mental picture that the reader receives. If we have the story of the poem told by a 
symphony orchestra, what kind of a composition would you call it? Yes, a symphony 
poem is good, but the correct name for it is “symphonic poem.” 
Let me tell you in a few words the story in the poem that Goethe wrote, then we 
will listen to the music and see if Dukas conveys Goethe’s ideas. The name of the 
poem is “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice.” 
The story is of a magician or a sorcerer ‘who was so clever that at times when 
traveling from one town to the next, to give his act, when necessary to have water for 
his bath he would turn a broom into a servant, who would hop to the stream for water 
and fill the magician’s bathtub. When the tub was full the sorcerer would again say 
some mystic words, and immediately the broom would be turned back to its original 
form. 
The apprentice to this sorcerer was hoping very much that he could have someone 
wait upon him. But the magician would never tell the apprentice the magic words. 
- $o the apprentice decided one day that he would hide behind some curtains in his 
master’s room and learn the words. He did so. When he learned the words he went  
-P-A-G-E-190
  - MUSIC APPRECIATION © fessc 181 
  to his-room, took the broom, said the magic words, and immediately the broom started — 
in its niost fantastic way to hop to the creek and bring the water. But lo!. what was — 
the apprentice’s amazement when the tub being full, he was not able to say the magic 
words and stop the broom. 
The apprentice became frightened and decided to kill the servant. He took an axe 
and chopped the broom in two. But instead of having one going after water two sprang - 
up, and: doubled their efforts. Things were now worse than ever. The brooms kept 
hopping to the creek, the tub overflowed, the water ran all over the rooms, filled the 
house and. ran into the streets, and still the brooms hopped back and forth. - The town. : 
was aroused, but nothing could be done, unless the magician could come and say the 
magic: words. , ws 
When the magician found out his apprentice had been false to him, he -was 50 - 
offended and hurt that as soon as he stopped the broom he went away and has never: 
been heard of since. . : 
Now let us listen to the symphonic poem written by Dukas.     
Nore to Tzacurr.—lIt is not well in impressionist music to expect too literal an interpretation, but 
certain very obvious features will be noticed by the pupils. Such as: - 
The grotesque hop of the broom. 
The swish of the water. 
The confusion of the flood. oe <6

PART IV 
AUXILIARY MATERIAL FOR THE TEACHER 
J, Conpuctine 
It is not necessary that the grade teacher should know a great deal about conduct- 
ing, but a few of the more fundamental facts probably will help her to do better work 
as a musical inspirer. 
Conducting is now ordinarily understood to mean making movements with a baton, 
or with the hands, that tend to cause a group of singers or players to perform music 
effectively. The minimum effect of this should be to cause them to start together, 
keep together, and stop together. This part of conducting is not difficult to learn, 
and any bright and fairly musical grade teacher can acquire it in a short time. 
The conventional baton or.hand movements for the various types of measure~are 
as follows: — 
14 
  1 3 &§ 2 14 5 
Duple Measure Triple Measure Quadruple Measure Sextuple Measure 
Various modifications of these figures occur as they are interpreted by different 
directors, and it is not important to follow the exact line either of a diagram or of any 
particular condustor’s beat. As a matter of convention, however, it is best to use 
the general direction of beat which has been found most satisfactory by experienced 
conductors, and it will be worth the teacher’s while to spend a few moments every 
day in practicing these baton movements until she is able to beat time without thinking 
about it, thus being enabled to devote her entire attention to the music which she is 
interpreting through her beat. : 
In learning to beat time one must guard against being too stiff and angular on the 
one hand, and too relaxed and graceful on the other. The ideal is a mean between 
199
-P-A-G-E-209
  UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
  these two, and the easiest beat to follow is one which is graceful and yet firm. The 
“down beat on one of a measure is a good deal like throwing down a rubber ball, to have 
it bounce up again; and this rebound, or back-stroke, is, on the whole, the most impor- 
tant thing in what is called the knack of beating time. Watch any experienced con- 
ductor as he beats time, and you will soon get the “hang” of it. 
One of the hardest things to learn is the knack of getting people to start and stop 
together; yet this, too, can be quickly learned. _ In beginning, be sure that the children 
are looking at you as you hold your baton poised. Now make a quick preliminary 
movement, and then bring your hand down for the first tone of the song. If you do 
not understand this, try saying, “Ready! Sing!” and just as you say “Sing!” bring 
your hand up, in the preliminary movement above suggested. The words “Ready! 
' Sing!” occupy approximately two beats; and this often helps the conductor to establish 
the tempo or rate of speed, which, of course, is one of the things the conductor is especi- 
ally responsible for. But do not get into the habit of saying every time, “Ready! 
Sing!” If you do, the children in turn will get into the habit of not looking up, and 
you will have trouble when you come to venture giving a public performance. In 
the last measure of a composition, do not beat time, but hold the baton poised so that 
the singers can see it; then just before you bring it down to “cut off” the tone, raise 
it a little as suggested above in connection with securing a firm attack. The same 
thing is done in the case of a hold @). Tell the children that a hold means to look 
up and prolong the tone until the signal to stop is given. 
_ .One of the most important things in conducting is to get every performer into the 
habit of looking at you, especially at the beginning, at the end, at holds, and during 
changes in speed. You cannpt get good results in conducting if this habit has not 
been formed. On the other hand, be sure that you hold your baton or hand high 
enough so that both singers and accompanist can see it easily. 
If the tempo drags or runs away, do not hesitate to beat audibly on the desk for 
a minute or two, or to count aloud. But remember that this is only a temporary expe- 
dient and that it must not be allowed to continue. If you count or tap constantly, 
the children are bound to become weak in rhythm. Moreover they will soon get into 
~ the habit of never looking up. 
All these directions refer to beating time, but of course there is much conducting 
that does not involve formal time-beating. In general it is not necessary to do much 
formal conducting below the sixth grade. In the lower grades, simply signal the chil- 
- dren to start and perhaps to stop, beating time only as may be necessary to keep them 
going. Besides, in these lower grades, the teacher often suggests the meaning of the 
song through facial expression and by posture, so that it is well to encourage the chil- 
dren from the first grade on to watch the teacher as a matter of habit. 
Il. Directions ror Wrirmve Music 
  Tn board work always use a staff-liner, or else have a staff permanently painted 
the board.. In case of seat work furnish the pupils with paper already ruled with
-P-A-G-E-210
  AUXILIARY MATERIAL FOR THE TEACHER : 201 
a staff, or have each one obtain the “Music Writing-book,” published as supplementary 
material to this Series. 
In board work use a pieae of chalk about one inch long, on its side, for making 
note-heads, rests, etc. In seat work use pencil rather than pen, and see that the pupils 
do not spend too much time making note-heads. The note-head need not be full size, 
a large size dot answering all purposes. 
- Note the following directions for turning stems: 
When only one part (or voice) is written on the staff, the following rules apply: 
. e9) If-the note-head is below the third line, the stem must turn up. (2) If the note-head 
is above the third line, the stem must turn down. (3) If the note-head is on the third 
line, the stem is turned either up or down with due regard for the symmetrical appear- 
ance of. the measure in which the note occurs. 
When two parts are written on the same staff, the stems of the upper part all turn 
up, and those of the lower part turn down, in order that the parts may be more readily 
identified. But in music for piano and other instruments on, which complete chords 
can be ‘sounded by one performer, and also in simple, four-part vocal music in which 
all voices have approximately the same rhythm, several notes are often attached to

Make the G clef in the two movements, (1) the scroll and up-stroke (begun on

curve at about the fourth line. (See page 62.)

The sharp has two light vertical lines and two heavy slanting ones. Note the 
direction of the slant #. The flat is made with-a down stroke, retraced up a little 
distance, and then completed without lifting the pencil, b. The natural, or cancel, is 
made in two parts 1 4. The tie usually connects the heads of notes. The-dot 
after a note is always placed on a space. When the note head is on a line, the dot 
is usually placed i in the space above if the next note is higher, but in the space- ‘below if 
the next- ‘note is lower.

Origin of Sofa Syllables 
- The syllables so universally used in sight-singing are derived from a Gregorian 
chant, called “Hymn to Saint John,” which is printed here as a matter of historical 
interest. This hymn provides syllables for six tones only. The remaining syllables 
are of later origin. ‘“‘Ut” was replaced by “do” because it was unvocal. An excellent 
phonograph record of the “Hymn to Saint John” is available, and may be used to 
make clear to the children in the upper grades, the historical derivation of the syllables 
which they spend so much time practicing.

IV.. Music Notation ANALYZED 
For many centuries there was no way of writing music, and melodies (there was no 
part-musi¢) were transmitted from one generation to another by voice and ear (cf. folk 
lore). In this way a melody was often varied considerably as it passed on from one 
person or generation to another. About the year 1000 a.p. the beginnings of modern 
staff notation came into existence, and by 1750 the scheme was practically complete 
as we have it to-day. 
: Staff, notation consists of four essential elements—namely, (1) lines and spaces of 
" astaff Pepresenting higher and lower pitches, both lines and spaces being used (instead of 
lines only as at first); a sign called a clef, together with other characters like the sharp 
and: ‘flat, designating the pitches represented by the lines and | spaces; (2) the various 
kinds of notes, 9, ad d*, the shape of the note indicating the relative duration 
of the tone, and the position of the note-head on the staff indicating the desired pitch; 
(8) bars across the staff indicating position of principal accents, thus dividing the 
- music into groups called measures; (4) signs, words, etc., indicating the relative loud- 
ness, softness, rate of speed, etc. 
1. Pitch Notation. The modern staff has five lines, numbered from below upward, . 
4, 5. The spaces are also used to represent pitch, and are referred to as first. 
md space, third space, fourth space, space below and space above. Addi- oS 2, 
    
   al lines and spaces may be added, these being called ledger (or leger) lines, or simply 
add “tines These are referred to as first added line above (or below), space above 
the ‘added line above (or below), second added line above, space above the:second 
pee bove, etc. The various lines and spaces of the staff, as well as'those above - 
and D ire often referred to as _ lesrees of the staff” (ef. degrees of a thermometer). 
 
-P-A-G-E-215

‘is to indicate that the second line stands for the pitch G, and that the lines of the staff 
are, therefore, E—G—B—D—F, and the spaces D—F—A-—-C—E—G. The bass 
clef is a letter F, and its function is to indicate that the fourth line of the bass staff 
represents F, Note that this F is a fifth below “middle C,” and that the G-clef marks 
the fifth above. Middle C is so called because it is the middle note between the two 
staffs—that is, the middle line of an imaginary “grand staff,” of eleven lines. Note 
_ also that the first added line below the treble staff represents the same pitch as the 
first added line above the bass. The illustration below will make these points clear. 
  G@ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFE®6 
Middle C 
So far we have provided only for the tones produced by playing on the white keys 
of a modern keyboard. In addition, the staff may be made to represent the tones 
produced by striking the black keys. This is done by the use of five characters which 
are used to make the lines and spaces of the staff stand for additional tones. These 
five characters are as follows: sharp @, flat @), double sharp («orx), double flat 
(2?), and natural (or cancel @)). The sharp makes a staff degree Jepresent a pitch 
one half step higher—that is, the next adjacent key, either white or black, to the right, 
on the piano keyboard. The flat, in the same way, makes the staff degree represent 
a pitch a half step lower—that is, the adjacent key, either white or black, to the left. 
The double sharp makes the degree represent a pitch a whole step higher than it would 
with no sharp on it, and the double flat likewise, a whole step lower. The natural, 
or cancel, restores the original meaning of the degree, when it has been modified by 
one of the other four characters. The following keyboard diagram will help to clarify 
these points: .

When any one or more of the characters are needed regularly through a composition, 
it is easier to write it at the beginning of each staff than to keep writing it in every 
measure. For this reason such sharps or flats as are needed throughout the composition 
are collected at the beginning of each staff in what is called the key signature. When 
used in the course of a composition, all five of the pitch-modifying characters affect 
only the line or space on which they are placed, and only for the measure in which they 
are used—that is, their effect terminates at the bar. But when used in the signature, 
the characters are understood to affect all degrees of the same name throughout the 
staff, including added lines and spaces. Only sharps and flats are thus used in the 
signature, hence the signature-sharp and the signature-flat have a wider range of appli- 
cation than the other characters. If, for example, a signature-sharp is placed on the 
fifth line of the treble staff, the name of this line is changed to F-sharp for the entire 
length of that staff; but it is also understood that the first space stands for F-sharp, 
as well as the third added line below, and any other added lines and spaces that may . 
be used in the composition. Double sharps and double flats are ordinarily used only 
on degrees that have already been sharped or flatted in the signature; hence to restore 
_ the degree to its signature condition, a combination of natural and sharp (or. flat) is 
often used; thus, #$. This would mean that the line is to be single-sharped as it was 
in the signature, instead of double-sharped, as it has been temporarily. 
2. Tone Duration. The relative length of tones is indicated by the shape of the 
notes. There is also a set of characters called rests for indicating rhythmic silences of 
corresponding relative lengths. The notes and rests in common use are.as follows: 
? whole note ™ whole rest 
2 half note ™ half rest 
quarter note % quarter rest 
¢ eighth note + eighth rest 
” § sixteenth note # sixteenth rest 
i thirty-second note i thirty-second rest 
The relative values of the notes and rests are indicated by their names, a whole note 
heing equal to two half notes, four quarter notes, etc., but the actual length of the 
one naturally depends on the rate of speed of any given composition. The duration 
value of any note or rest ‘is increased by one-half if a dot is placed after it. A dotted 
alf note thus becomes equivalent to a half note tied to a quarter note. A dotted 
luarter note similarly is equivalent to a quarter note tied to an eighth note. 
The foundation of musical rhythm is a steady succession of pulses, every other one 
r every third one of which is slightly stressed. In order to keep the rhythm steady 
tis customary and entirely justifiable for elementary music students to make a muscular 
novement for each of these pulses. In the first grade this movement consists of clap- 
xing, marching, etc. In the second and third grades it consists of pointing rhythmically _ 
o the notes, while in the fourth grade a silent hand movement’ on the desk is usually 
ubstituted for pointing. Marking the pulse with the foot would be just as good

ut is usually noisy and, therefore, not desirable. A bobbing of the 
good from a rhythmic standpoint, but interferes seriously with smooth 
ae production,-and should therefore be discouraged. Counting aloud 
e of the same sort, the movement of the throat muscles being the essen- 
srocess rather than the sound of the voice, but this is naturally not prac-

own muscles if they are to become firm and steady sight-readers. The 
ng and the tapping is done by the teacher, the worse for the children, 
(ease uy eevee will they be in acquiring a firm grasp upon musical rhythm. 
  “When a tone occupies a-full beat, or two or three beats, this marking the pulse 
is all that is necessary in order to get the rhythm. But when there are several tones 
” “to a pulse, the rhythm is more complicated, and here the only thing to do is to classify 
-the various rhythms into “rhythmic figures” and learn each one. Fortunately for 
_the learner there are comparatively few of these rhythmic figures, so that to master 
them is not so formidable a task as might be supposed. The commonest of the rhythmic. 
as figurere as follows: . 
Ig evenly divided beat FFs subdivided beat 
L: 5 unevenly divided beat Te joe ai of subdivided and 
Tt triplet = evenly divided beat 
Pbeat-and-a-half note dd Spulse syncopation 
These rhythmic figures are combined in various. ways, and thus constitute the 
foundation of practically all rhythmic construction. When once thoroughly mastered, 
they give one the key to almost any combination of musical rhythms that the ordinary 
person is likely to encounter, especially in vocal music. The Rhythm Drill Cards 
contain these types in characteristic progressions, and the drill thus afforded will help 
_ the pupil become thoroughly familiar with them all. 
In addition to these, it is necessary to learn the notation of the same figures when 
the eighth note or the half note has a beat instead of the quarter note as ordinarily. 
Such study may be postponed until the middle or upper grades except in the case of 
6/8, which is in such common use that it should be taken up comparatively early, prob- 
ably in Grade IV or Grade V. The most common types of 6/8 measure are:

@ TT IH OL TFT 
The same figures that are given above as characterizing 6/8 measure are found in 
9/8 measure and 12/8 measure, and in all these cases the difficulty of reading the nota- 
2 tion is increased by the fact that 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8 are so often taken as duple, triple, 
--4 quadruple measures, respectively. In other words, 6/8 in a rapid tempo becomes 
: and we have in effect a rhythm of triplets iT For this reason, it becomes

necessary. for the music student to learn to beat either six or two in reading 6/8, there 
being six beats in a measure if the tempo is slow, but only two if the tempo is rapid. 
8. Accents and Measures. The bar is a device for marking accents, the note follow- 
ing the bar being always accented. This divides notes into natural groups (measures), 
the first note in each group being always accented. Sometimes there is a secondary 
or lesser accent within the group. In singing or playing these accents, they_are usually 
felt by the performer rather than heard by the listener, but they must be there, else the music 
will not have adequate rhythmic foundation. 
The fundamental types of measure are duple and triple. Quadruple measure 
is conipound duple, having a secondary accent on the third beat.. Sextuple measure 
is likewise duple, having a secondary accent on the fourth beat. 
As stated above, the notation of musical rhythm is complicated by ‘the fact that 
the quarter note is not always used as the beat or pulse note, the eighth note or the 
half note being substituted. In other words, duple measure, although ordinarily 
written as two-quarter measure is sometimes found as two-eighth measure or two- 
half measure. Likewise, three-quarter measure is sometimes displaced by three-eighth 
or three-half, etc. This is unfortunate, but because such notation is often encountered 
the various rhythmic types must be mastered, both as they occur in the majority of 
cases, and as they occur in the rather more exceptional instances. The unequally 
divided beat in four-quarter measure appears as J. § , but in four-eighth measure it 
would be notated as F » while in four-half measure it would appear as dd » but 
the essential rhythmic figure involved in all three notations is identical, and the 
changes in measure sign have nothing whatever to do with the rate of speed. (For examples 
of these types of measure, see “Supplementary Sight-Singing Exercises.’’) 
The triplet consists of three tones, the first of the three being accented. It is a 
very common rhythmic figure—so common that, instead of writing it as a triplet, it 
is often indicated by a measure sign of its own. Thus: 2 iT 7 ld 3 fd. is often 
written § JTJ JV | ¢ gd. Sixeighth measure (in rapid tempo) is, therefore, as 
already noted, to be accounted for as a compound duple measure with the triplet as its 
characteristic rhythm. Similarly nine-eighth measure and twelve-eighth measure are 
simply three-quarter and four-quarter measures respectively. 
The measure signs ordinarily encountered are as follows: 
        . @/4. two-quarter measure 2/8 two-eighth measure ~ 
8/4 three-quarter measure 3/8 three-eighth measure * 
4/4 four-quarter measure 4/8 four-eighth measure

‘The names used above are perhaps not so common as “two-four time,” “six-eight 
time,” etc., but are so much more nearly self-explanatory that teachers are urged to 
break themselves of the habit of using the older names, and to employ the newer ones 
always, so that the pupils may fall naturally into the habit of using the better terminol- 
ogy. In the same way, teachers are urged to say, “Sing the syllables,” rather than, 
“Sing the notes”; to use the words note and tone correctly (notes are seen, but tones 
are heard); and in.general to employ musical language more correct than is often heard 
even among musicians. 
4. Tempo and Dynamics (Speed_and, Force). In addition to indicating pitch, 
accent, and relative duration, the composer wishes his music to be performed with 
appropriate rate of speed (tempo) and with suitable gradations of power (dynamics) 
to be designated by himself. ‘ Certain terms, signs, etc., are in accepted use for these two 
purposes; and although their use and interpretation cannot be as exact as is the case 
with the rest of music notation, yet if one is to read music intelligently, one must know 
at least the general interpretation of these signs. Music notation is universal—inter- 
national—and in order to make it possible for compositions to be freely used in all 
countries, irrespective of language, the Italian expressions have come to be almost 
universally employed as a musical language known throughout the civilized world. 
Tempo, or rate of speed, is indicated in two ways: (1) By a a sign like j= =. 
(2) By words like Andante, Allegro, ete. The “first of these is called a a metronome indi- 
cation, and is a device for getting the exact rate of speed by means of a clock-like 
machine called the metronome. By sliding the weight on the pendulum to the figure 
indicated and setting the metronome in motion, one may get the exact tempo. The 
second method of indicating tempo is less exact but more common, and certain terms 
which are in everyday use should be learned by all music students. They are arranged 
in groups because their meanings overlap, and because their application is not exact. 
1. Grave (lit. weighty, serious), larghissimo, adagissimo, and lentissimo—indicating 
the very slowest tempo used in rendering music. 
2. Largo, adagio, and lento—indicating a quite slow tempo. 
8. Larghetto (i.e., a little largo) and adagieito (a little adagio)\—a slow tempo, but 
not quite so slow as largo, etc. 
4. Andante (going, or walking, as contrasted with running) and andantino— 
tadicating a moderately slow tempo. 
5. Moderato—a moderate tempo. 
6. Allegro and allegretto—a moderately quick tempo, gllegretto being usually inter- 
preted as meaning a@ tempo. somewhat-slowér than allegro. — 
7. Vivo, vivace (lit. lively)—a tempo between allegro and presto. 
8. Presto, prestissimo, vivacissimo, and prestissimo possibile—the most rapid tempo 
possible. 
Besides these terms, there are a number of others which call for a quickening or 
\ retarding of the ordinary speed. The most common of these are:
-P-A-G-E-220
AUXILIARY MATERIAL FOR THE TEACHER @11 
ritenuto (rit.) 
ritardando (rit.) + gradually slower. 
rallentando (rall.) 
Pit lento slower at once. meno mosso : 
accelerando 
stringendo | gradually faster. 
Pi mosso 
Un poco animato } faster at once. 
After any of these modifying terms, the expression a tempo (or tempo primo) means 
a return to the original rate of speed. 
The various degrees of loudness and softness are referred to as the “dynamics” 
of music. A group of Italian terms expressing the various degrees from “most 
softly’ to “most loudly” are supplied for the convenience of the teacher. 
Pianississimo (ppp)—as softly as possible (it will be noted that this is a sort of 
hyper-superlative of piano). 
Pianissimo (pp)—very softly (the superlative of piano). 
Piano (p)-—softly. 
Mezzo piano (mp)—medium softly. 
Mezzo forte (mf)—medium loudly. 
Forte (f)—loudly (lit. strong). 
Fortissimo (ff)—-very loudly (the superlative of forte). 
'Fortississimo (fff)—as loudly as possible. 
In addition to the terms defined in the above list, the following are in common use:

V. Derwnitions oF Terms Rexatine to Notation 
A staff is a collection of parallel lines, together with the spaces belonging to them. 
The modern staff has five lines with their spaces, these being ordinarily referred to
-P-A-G-E-221
INIVERSAL SCHOOL -MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
‘cond line, third line, fourth line, and fifth line (beginning with the lowest) 
ow (i.e., space below the first line), first space, second space, third space, 
and space above. 
a sign placed on the staff to designate what pitches are to be represented 
dspaces. Thus, for example, the G clef shows us not only that the second 
ff represents G, but that the first Tine represents E, the first space F’, ete. 
milarly shows us that the fifth line of the bass staff represents the first 
le €, the fourth line the first F below middle C, ete. 
at of the staff may be increased either above or below by the addition 
called leger lines, and notes may be written on- either these lines or on the 
*-spaces above and below them. 
The lines and spaces constituting the staff (including leger. lines if any) are often 
. referred to as staff degrees, i.e., each separate line and space is considered to be “‘a 
degree.of the staff.” The tones of a scale are also sometimes referred to as “ degrees 
ef the scale.” 
: A sharp is a character that causes any degree of the staff on which it is placed 
“or with which it is associated to represent a pitch one half-step higher than it otherwise 
would. 
A flat is a character that causes any degree of the staff on which it is placed or 
with which it is associated to represent a pitch one half-step lower than .it otherwise 
would. : 
A double-sharp causes the staff degree on which it is placed to represent a pitch 
one wholg-step higher than it would without any sharp. Similarly, a double-flat: causes 
the staff Yegree on which it is placed to represent a pitch one whole-step lower than 
it would without any flat. 
‘The natural (sometimes called cancel)-annuls the effect of previous sharps, flats, 
double-sharps, and double-flats, within the measure in which it occurs. After a double- 
sharp or double-flat, the combination of a natural with a sharp, or a natural with a 
flat is often found: in this case only one sharp or flat is annulled... (Sometimes also 
the single sharp or flat will be found by itself, canceling the double-sharp or double- 
flat:) The natural is often used when a composition changes key. 
: The group of sharps or flats (or absence of them) at the beginning of a staff par- 
tially indicates the key in which the composition is written. Collectively they are 
ealled the key signature. : 
_ The same key signature may stand for either one of two keys, the major key, or its 
relative minor; hence, in order to determine in what key a melody is, one must note 
whether the tones are grouped about the major tonic do or the minor la. In a 
harmonized composition it is almost always possible to determine the key by referring 
«to the last bass note; if the final chord is clearly the do chord, the composition is in 
the mejor key, but if this final chord is clearly the fa chord, then almost certainly 
re composition is in the minor key. 
ups, flats,.naturals, double-sharps, and double-flats, occurring in the course 
‘composition (j.e., after the key signature) are called accidentals, whether they 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
AUXILIARY MATERIAL FOR THE TEACHER - 213 
actually cause a staff degree to represent a different pitch or simply make clear a nota- 
tion about which there might otherwise be some doubt. The effect of such accidentals 
terminates at the bar. 
When two different notations represent the same pitch, the word enharmonic is 
applied. Thus we may say that F-sharp and G-flat are euharmonically the same. 
A note is a character expressing relative duration, which when placed on a staff 
indicates that a certain tone is to be sounded for a certain relative length of time. 
The pitch of the tone to be sounded is shown by the position of the note-head on the 
staff, while the length of time it is to be prolonged is shown by the shape of the note. 
Thus, for example, a half note on the second line of the treble staff indicates that a 
specific pitch (g’) is to be played or sung for a period of time twice as long as would 
be indicated by a quarter note in the same composition. The note may have one, 
two, or three parts called respectively head, stem, and hook. The hook is sometimes 
called tail or cross stroke, and when several notes of similar denomination are written 
together, they are said to be stroked, thus: 7] ra FF 
A rest.is a character which indicates a rhythmic silence of a certain relative length. 
A bar is a vertical line across the staff, dividing it into measures (usually). The 
word bar is often used synonymously with measure by orchestral conductors and others; 
thus, “begin at the fourteenth bar after J.” This use of the word, although popular, 
is incorrect. 
A double-bar consists of two vertical lines across the staff, at least one of the two 
being a heavy line. The double-bar marks the end of a division, movement, or entire 
composition. 
A double-bar (or single heavy bar) with either two or four dots indicates that a 
section is to be repeated. If the repeat marks occur at only one point the entire pre- 
ceding part is to be repeated [see (a)]; but if the marks occur twice (the first time at 
the right of the bar, but the second time at the left), only the section thus enclosed 
by the marks is to be repeated [see (b)]. Sometimes a different cadence (or ending) 
is to be used for the repetition,.and this is indicated as at (c). 
  
  
  
  The.words da capo (D. C.) mean literally “from the head,” i.e,, repeat: from the 
beginning. The words dal segno (D.S.) indicate a repetition from the sign (8 o ¥) 
instead of from the beginning. In the case of both D. C. and D. S, the word fine (mean- 
ing literally the end) is ordinarily used to designate the point at which the repeated 
section 1s to terminate.
-P-A-G-E-223

_.+ The fermata or hold over a note or chord indicates that its time is to be prolonged, 
the duration of the prolongation depending upon the character of the music and the 
taste of the performer or conductor. (7) 
. The sign 8va...... (an abbreviation of all’ ottava, literally at the octave) above 
the staff, indicates that all tones are to be sounded an octave higher than the notes 
indicate. When found below the staff the same sign serves to indicate that the tones 
are to be sounded an octave lower. The term 8va bassa has also this latter significa- 
tion. Col 8 means play the octave higher or lower with the tone indicated by the 
. printed note. 
A dot after a note shows that the value of the note is to be half again as great as 
it would be without the dot. a.nd | 3 d. =f 
When two dots follow the note the second dot adds half as much as the first dot 
has added.d..=d_d fi dumd fh 
A dot over or under a note is called a staccato mark and indicates that the tone 
is to be sounded and then instantly released. A pointed dot (}) indicates a still sharper 
staccato. / 
A te is a curved line connecting the heads of two notes that stand for the same 
tone. It indicates that but one tone is to be sounded, this having a duration equal 
to the combined value of both notes. For example, a half note tied to a quarter note 
would indicate a tone equal in duration-length to that shown by a dotted half note; 
two half notes tied would indicate a tone equal in duration to that shown by a whole 
note. : 
Accent marks are made in a variety of fashions. The most common forms follow:

VI. Terms Retatine to Various Types or Compositions, Etc. 
In monophonic music there is one voice which has a pronounced mélody, the other 
voices (if present) supporting this melody as a harmonic (and often rhythmic) back- 
ground. An example of this is the ordinary hymn tune with its melody in the highest 
part, and with three other voices forming a “four-part harmony.” ~The sonata, sym- 
phony, opera, modern piano piece, etc., are also largely monophonic though many such 
compositions employ a combination of the monophonic and the polyphonic styles. 
In polyphonic music each voice is to a certain extent melodically interesting, and 
the “harmony” is the result of combining several melodies in such a way as to give 
a pleasing effect, instead of treating a melody by adding chords as an accompaniment

or support. Counterpoint, canon, round, fugue, etc., are all polyphonic in style. The 
word contrapuntal is often used synonymously with polyphonic. 
Counterpoint is the art of adding one or more parts or melodies to a given melody, 
the latter being known as the “cantus firmus” or subject. It may, therefore, be broadly 
defined as the “art of combining melodies.” 
Imitation is the repetition by one part, either in unison or at some other pitch, 
of a subject or theme previously introduced by another part. If the imitation is exact, 
the term strict imitation is applied, but if only approximate, then the term free imita- 
tion is used in referring to it. The repetition need not have the exact pitches of the 
subject in order to be strict; on the contrary, the imitation is usually at the interval ~ 
of an octave, or a fifth, or a second, ete. 
A canon is a contrapuntal composition in the style of strict imitation, one part 
repeating exactly (but at any interval) what another part has played or sung. 
The familiar rownd is an example of canon, each voice repeating exactly what 
the first. voice has sounded, while this first voice is still gomg on with its melody. The 
round is defined, therefore, as a variety of canon in which the imitation is always i in 
unison. 
The fugue (Latin, fuga—flight) is a form of contrapuntal composition in which 
the imitation is always in the dominant key, i.e., a fifth above or a fourth below. The 
imitation (called “the answer”) may be an exact repetition of the subject (sometimes 
called “the question”), but is usually not so. 
A theme is a fragment of melody used as the subject of a fugue, as the basis of 
the development section in “sonata form,” etc. Sometimes it is a complete tune 
(often in period form), on which variations are made, as in the familiar theme and 
variations. . 
VA suite is a set of instrumental dances, all in the same key or in nearly related keys. 
The first dance is often preceded by an introduction or prelude, and the various dances 
are so grouped as to secure contrast of movement—a quick dance being usually fol- 
lowed by a slower one. The word suite is also more loosely applied to any set of short 
instrumental compositions. 
‘A sonata is an instrumental composition of three or more movements (usually 
four), the first and last of which are almost always in rapid tempo. Each of these 
movements is a piece of music with a unity of its own, but they are all merged together 
in a larger whole with a broad underlying unity of greater scope. The design or plan 
of the first movement is typical, and is called sonata form. 
When the sonata has four movements, these are usually arranged as follows: 
1. A quick movement (allegro, presto, etc.), often preceded by a slower introduction. 
2. A slower movement (largo, andante, adagio, etc.). 
3. A minuet or scherzo, usually with a “trio” or contrasting middle part, in which 
case the part preceding the trio is repeated after the trio is played. 
4. A quick movement—the finale, sometimes a rondo, sometimes another sonata- 
form, sometimes a theme with variations.
-P-A-G-E-225
    UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
These movements are all in closely related keys, but in a variety of contrasting 
rhythms. 
A trio is a sonata for three instruments (such as piano, violin, and ’cello), while 
a quartet * is a sonata for four instruments, the most common quartet combination 
being as follows: first and second violins, viola, and violoncello. 
The term chamber music is often applied to instrumental music for trio, quartet, 
quintet, and other similar combinations which are suitable for a small room rather 
than for a large concert hall. 
A concerto is a sonata for a solo instrument with orchestral accompaniment, the 
form being usually somewhat modified so as to adapt it to a composition in which there 
must necessarily be opportunity for a good deal of technical display. There are usually 
but three movements in the concerto. : 
The great majority of concertos are for piano and orchestra, but examples of con- 
certos for violin, ’cello, flute, oboe, and other solo instruments (all with orchestral 
accompaniment) have also been written. A few modern composers have applied the 
term concerto to certain large organ works (with no orchestral accompaniments), but 
this use of the word is so contrary to the accepted definition that it is hardly justifiable. 
When a concerto is played on two pianos (without orchestra), this does not mean 
that there is no orchestral part, but that there is no orchestra to play it, and so the 
parts that should be played by the orchestral instruments have been arranged for a 
second piano (sometimes organ). 
4 A symphony is a sonata for full orchestra. In general its construction is the same 
as that of the sonata, but it is usually of much larger proportions and has in it much 
greater variety of both tonal and rhythmic material. The symphony is generally 
conceded to be the highest type of instrumental music ever evolved. 
4 The symphony was accepted as a standard form in the time of Haydn (1732-1809) 
and was developed enormously by Haydn himself; Mozart (1756-1791) and Beethoven 
(1770-1827), reaching perhaps its highest point in the famous “Nine Symphonies” 
of the last-named composer. Later symphony writers whose works are at present 
being performed include Brahms, Schumann, Tschaikowsky, and Dvordk. 
A sonatina, as its name implies, is a little sonata. It differs from the sonata proper 
principally in having little or no development, the second section being of slight impor- 
tance as compared with the corresponding section of a sonata. 
¥ Program music is instrumental music in which the composer attempts to convey 
to the listener an image or a succession of images that will arouse in him certain emo- 
tions which have been previously aroused in the composer’s mind by some scene, event, 
or idea. The clue to the general idea is often given at the beginning of the music in 
the form of a poem or a short description of the thing which has suggested the music 
to the composer. 
* The words trio and quartet are also applied to vocal works for three and four voices respectively, and to smaller 
instrumental compositions for various combinations, these having no relation to the trio-sonata, etc., described above. 
_ “The word irio is also applied to the middle section of minuets, scherzos, marches, etc., the term originating in the old 
usage of writing this part for three instruments only.
-P-A-G-E-226
  AUXILIARY MATERIAL FOR THE TEACHER 217 
“A symphonic poem (or tone poem) is an orchestral composition of large dimensions 
(resembling the symphony in size), usually embodying the program idea (see above). 
It has no prescribed form, the “program” dominating its structure. 
The symphonic poem was invented by Liszt (1811-1886) and has since been used 
extensively by Strauss, Saint-Saéns, and others. It came into existence as a part 
of the general movement which has caused the fugue and the sonata successively to 
go out of fashion—viz., the tendency to invent forms which would not hamper the 
composer in any way, but would leave him absolutely free to express his ideas in his 
own individual way. 
-Barcarole (or barcarolle)—a boat-song. Also applied to a vocal or instrumental 
composition in the style of a gondolier’s boat song. 
Berceuse—a cradle song. : 
Carol—a hymn of joyful praise, usually associated with Easter or Christmas 
festivities. The word carol meant originally a dance, hence the happy character of 
songs of this type. 
“Nocturne (sometimes spelled nocturn, notturno, nokturne, etc.)—a night piece; 
a quiet, melodious, often somewhat sentimental composition, usually for piano solo. 
‘Overture (from overt—open)—an instrumental prelude to an opera or oratorio. 
The older overtures were independent compositions and bore no particular relation 
to the work which was to follow, but in modern music (cf. Wagner, Strauss, etc.) the 
overture introduces the principal themes that are to occur in the work itself, and the 
introduction thus becomes an integral part of the composition as a whole. The word 
overture is sometimes applied to independent orchestral compositions which have 
no connection with vocal works, as the Hebrides Overture by Mendelssohn. 
Toccata—a, brilliant composition for piano or organ, usually characterized by 
much: ‘rapid staccato playing. 
Aanihep i is a sacred choral composition, usually based on Biblical or liturgical 
words: It may or may not have an instrumental accompaniment, ent, and is usually 
: writfen in four parts, but may have five, six, eight, or more.

  ‘atorio is a composition on a large scale for chorus, soloists, and orchestra, the 
text usually dealing with some religious subject. The oratorio is not intended for _ 
1 service, but is written for concert performance. The accompaniment /

-opéra is opera with a serious plot, in which everything is sung, there being 
dialogue. 
-comique is a species of opera in which part of the dialogue 
Opéra comique- is not synonymous with comic opera, for 
often serious as not. ‘ 
       
-P-A-G-E-227
ne 218 UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
A comic opera is a humorous opera, the plot providing many amusing situations, 
and the whole ending happily. It corresponds with the light comedy in literature. 
A light opera is one with an exceedingly trivial plot, in which songs, dances, and 
pretty scenery contribute to the amusement of the audience. The music is lively 
but usually as trivial as the plot. 
The term music drama was used by Wagner in referring to his own operas, and 
is also sometimes applied to other modern operas in which the dramatic element is 
supposed to predominate over the musical. 
Recitative is a style of vocal solo common to operas, oratorios, and cantatas, especi- 
ally those written some time ago. Its most striking characteristic is the fact that the 
word-text is of paramount importance. 
Aria is likewise a style of vocal solo found in operas, etc., but its predominating 
characteristic is diametrically opposed to that of the recitative. In the aria the word- 
text is usually entirely subordinate to the melody, and the latter is often very ornate, 
containing trills, runs, etc. 
The rendition of this ornate style of music is often referred to as “colorature sing- 
ing,” but it should be noted that not all arias are colorature in style. 
The familiar solos from the Messiah—‘Rejoice Greatly”? and “The Trumpet 
Shall Sound” are good examples of the aria style. 
A folk-song is a short song sung by and usually originating among the common 
people. Its dominant characteristic is usually simplicity; this applying to word- 
text, melody, and accompaniment (if there is one). The text of the folk-song is usu- 
ally based on some event connected with ordinary everyday life, but there are found 
also many ‘examples in which historical and legendary happenings are dealt with. 
“Auld Lang Syne” and “Comin’ Thru the Rye” are examples of folk-songs. 
There has been some difference of opinion as to whether a song, the composer of 
which, is known is to be classified as a folk-song. Recent writers seem to be taking the 
sensible view of the matter—viz., that if a song has the characteristics of a folk-song 
rather than an art-song, and if it is sung and loved by the common people, then it is . 
just as much a folk-song whether the composer happens to be known or not. 
Cadenza—a brilliant passage, usually in an instrumental composition, introduced 
just before the close of a movement. The cadenza was formerly improvised by the 
performer (thus giving an opportunity of displaying technical sil), but since Beethoven, 
composers have usually written their own cadenzas. 
Obbligato (sometimes incorrectly spelled obligato)—an accessory melody accompany- 
ing harmonized music (usually vocal music). The word obbligato (lit. bound, obliged) 
refers to the fact that this is a melody so important that it cannot be omitted in a com- 
plete performance; in other words, it is the opposite of ad libitum. 
Score—a term used in.two senses: 
1. To refer to all the parts of a composition that are to be performed simultane- 
ously, when they have been assembled on a single page for use by a choral or orchestral 
conductor. The term vocal score usually refers to the,chorus parts together with an
-P-A-G-E-228
AUXILIARY MATERIAL FOR THE TEACHER 219 
accompaniment arranged for piano or organ, while the terms full score and orchestral 
score refer to a complete assemblage of all parts, each one usually being printed on a 
separate staff, but all staffs being braced and barred together. 
2. To designate some particular point to which teacher or conductor wishes to 
call attention—as, “Begin with the lower score, third measure.” The word brace is 
also frequently used in this sense. 
Modulation is a change of key without any break in the continuity of chords or 
melody tones. Harmonic modulations are usually effected through the medium of 
a chord, some or all of whose tones are common to both keys. 
The term A capella (sometimes spelled cappella) refers to part-singing (either 
sacred or secular) without accompaniment. This term means literally “in chapel 
style” and refers to the fact that in the early days of the church all singing was 
unaccompanied. 
A libretto (lit. little book) is the word-text of an opera, oratorio, cantata, or some 
other similar work. 
VIT. A Summary or Music History 
For the average person, the history of music begins with the names of Bach and 
Handel, both of whom were born in 1685. Of course there had been music of a sort 
for thousands of years before, but most of that was crude and unsatisfactory from the 
standpoint of our present. cultivated taste. Up to about a.p. 1000 all music (so far 
as we know) had only one part—that is, there was no such thing as harmony. There 
was no adequate notation, and melodies were transmitted from voice to ear only. 
Since about the year 1000, however, both “harmony” and an adequate scheme of 
music notation have developed phenomenally, so that although music was the last 
of the fine arts to mature, it has even now far outstripped most of the other arts, both 
in complexity and in universality of appeal. 
In early music both voices and instruments produced the same pitches, and the 
effect must have been very monotonous. With the improvement in “harmony” 
and with the advent of an adequate scheme of notation, the instrumental accompani- 
ment became more independent, and the music, therefore, more interesting. 
Opera came into existence in Italy about a.p. 1600. The modern major and minor 
scales have been in use from about the same time. The piano was invented about 
1700 by an Italian. It was so called because its predecessors, the harpsichord and: 
the clavichord, were keyboard instruments on which one could not vary the loudness 
or softness of the tone to any great extent; and since such variation in power was 
possible on the new instrument, it was called the forte-piano or piano-forte, literally 
the “loud-soft” or the “soft-loud.” This term is, of course, now commonly abbre- 
viated to “piano” although one still often finds an evening of piano music referred 
to as “‘a pianoforte recital.” 
The pipe organ is a very ancient instrument, and even its fairly modern form dates
-P-A-G-E-229
UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
 ~- ~-lore Bach. Its mechanism has, to be sure, been vastly improved since that 
= time, but the basic idea came into existence long before the invention of the piano. 
Stringed instruments are very ancient, but the modern family of strings (violin, 
viola, cello, and contra bass) did not come to their final state of refinement until about 
“*.1700—that is, about the same time the piano came into existence. 
   - Of the wood-wind instruments, the flute and oboe are the oldest, and the clarinet 
the most modern, the latter not coming into use until the time of Beethoven. The 
. prass-winds are very ancient in their origin, but the precursors of the present types 
~ were deficient in that no way was provided of altering the length of the tube by valves 
or slides, and they, therefore, could be used in only one key. The valve principle 
was invented about a hundred years ago, the slide idea being much earlier. 
The same difficulty existed in the case of the harp, and because it could be played 
in only one key without being re-tuned, it was not practicable as an orchestral instru- 
ment and was not extensively used in orchestral compositions until after 1846, when 
Erard (France) invented the “double-action harp,” which can be played in any key. 
The art of singing came to perfection with the development of opera in Italy in the 
17th and 18th centuries and the vocal quality then developed has never been excelled, 
although much improvement has been made in the direction of a more sincere cor- 
relation of the tone quality with the spirit of the text. This latter development was 
due largely to the new type of vocal composition—the art song—that came into exist- 
ence about 1725 with the great masterpieces of Schubert. 
A similar change came about in opera from the time of Gluck and Wagner on. In 
Italian opera, the main thing was to make beautiful tones-with the voi¢e. The text 
did not matter, and the stage action was frequently interrupted for encores, etc. But 
‘Wagner insisted that an opera was above everything else a drama, and that the singer 
roust, therefore, be an actor, striving in every way to bring home to the audience the 
dramatic message of the play. These ideals of opera and art-song have brought about 
a great change in modern singing, and the present-day vocalist must not merely pro- 
duce beautiful tones, but must faithfully interpret the words he is singing. The ora- 
torio came into existence soon after the opera was invented and was at first given with 
action and scenery, but is now presented as choral music. 
The earliest music probably consisted of beating a log with a stick to furnish 
rhythmic. sounds for dancing. This was probably accompanied by vocal sounds, 
which in turn gave rise to a choral chant; and thus was derived the idea of melody. 
Long, long afterward, two melodies came to be sung together, then three or more, 
and thus “harmony” came into being. The practice of combining various melodies 
horizontally began to be supplanted by that of adding chords to a single melody ver- 
tically at about the time the opera was invented—that is, about 1600. 
With the development of instruments there has been more and more interest in 
_ instrumental music, and to-day symphonic music—that is, music played by a sym- 
phony orchestra, is considered to be the highest type of music in existence. With 
-. the refinement in both the design and manufacture, and the playing of instruments 
swhich has been taking place, there is developing a larger and larger interest in color-—
-P-A-G-E-230
  AUXILIARY MATERIAL FOR THE TEACHER 221 
that is, tone quality (timbre). More and more beautiful combinations of tone color 
in orchestral music are being invented, so that we may well think of timbre as the fourth 
element of music to develop, the first three having already been referred to as rhythm, 
melody, and harmony. There has been nothing essentially new in the direction of 
rhythmic or melodic development since Schubert (1797-1828), but harmonic effects 
and: color combinations are constantly being changed and added to. 
VIL. Brograruies or THE Wort’s Greatest Composers 
The names of the greatest masters of musical composition should be known by 
every child, just as the names of the great writers are. A brief list of the best-known 
composers is furnished in order to make easily accessible the principal facts about the 
lives of. men whose compositions are frequently sung or heard by the children. Teachers 
are: ‘expected to give the children at least the facts here furnished, so that the pupils 
may. grow into an attitude of intelligence about such matters. The names are arranged 
from a chronological standpoint. 
-Bach, Johann Sebastian, 1685-1750, Germany. Wrote great quantities of organ 
music, choral music (cantatas, masses, etc.), piano works (preludes and fugues, inven- 
tions; ete.). Perhaps the greatest master of the polyphonic style who has ever lived. 
One‘of the three or four greatest composers in the entire history of music. 
Handel, Georg Friedrich, 1685-1759, Germany. Lived most of his life in Eng- 
land. - Wrote operas and oratorios mainly. Best known for the “Messiah,” the most- 
sung. and most-beloved of oratorios. The famous “Largo” is an air from an opera 
called “Xerxes.” 
Haydn (Hidn), Franz Joseph, 1732-1809, Austria. Piano pieces (mostly sonatas), 
orchestral works, oratorios. Best-known choral work is the oratorio, “The Creation.” 
ht the synphony to its perfection as an orchestral composition, and therefore 
is sometimes called the “Father of the Symphony.” Best known as the great prede- 
cessor. and teacher of the two still greater composers following him, Mozart and 
oven. 
fozart (MOot’sart), Wolfgang Amadeus, 1756-1791, Germany. Piano pieces, 
liy sonatas, symphonies for orchestra, operas, including “The Magic Flute”. 
The Marriage of Figaro.” A composer of the very greatest promise who worked 
the most trying difficulties, and who died before he had an opportunity of giving 
orld more than just a taste of his genius. 
hoven (Ba'td-ven), Ludwig van, 1770-1827, Germany. Wrote instrumental 
uainly, consisting of sonatas, symphonies, string quartets, ete. Also an opera, 
io,” two masses, songs, etc. One of the greatest of all musicians, and usually: con- 
‘to be one of the three greatest composers of all time (Bach, Beethoven, Wagner). 
ibert, Franz Peter, 1797-1828, Austria. Songs, piano pieces, operas, sym- 
‘ete. Best known for his beautiful art-songs and his famous “Unfinished 
ay.” Commonly considered to be the greatest writer of art-songs inthe 
ry of music.

geg UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Jacob Ludwig Felix, 1809-1847, Germany. Piano pieces, 
songs, orchestral music, oratorios, etc.. A composer with a fluent graceful style who 
was exceedingly popular in his day, but whose music does not wear so well as that of 
certain other composers because it lacks somewhat in depth. Best-known works are 
the oratorio, “Elijah,” and a set of melodious piano pieces called “Songs Without 
Words.” 
Chopin, Francois Frederic, 1809-1849, French-Polish. Wrote piano music almost 
exclusively, but has given the world some of the most beautiful compositions ever 
written for this instrument, and therefore ranks very high. 
» Liszt, Franz, 1811-1886, Hungary. A great conductor, a brilliant pianist, and 
a versatile composer. Wrote orchestral works, especially “Tone Poems”; songs; 
piano pieces. Arranged and transcribed a very large number of compositions for 
piano, orchestra, etc. His “Hungarian Rhapsodies” probably his best-known 
compositions. . 
Wagner (Vah’g-ner), Richard, 1813~1883, Germany. An operatic composer, 
commonly regarded as one of the three greatest composers in the entire history of 
music (Bach, Beethoven, Wagner). He called his operas “music dramas,” as a protest 
against most operas which other composers were writing and which left out the dramatic 
element almost entirely. Exercises wonderful power of expression through harmonic 
innovations and unique instrumental combinations. 
Brahms, Johannes, 1833-1897, Germany. Orchestral works, songs, piano pieces, 
chamber music, and the “Requiem.” Perhaps the greatest composer of instrumental 
music since Beethoven; also one of the world’s greatest song writers. Best-known 
works, symphonies for orchestra, and songs. : 
Tschaikowsky (Chi-kéfs-kee), Peter Ilyitch, 1840-1893, Russia. Orchestral works, 
operas, songs, etc. Russia’s greatest composer. Best-known works are his sym- 
phonies Nos. 5 and 6. 
Dvorak (Dvor-zhik), Antonin, 1841-1904, Bohemia. Orchestral works, chamber 
music, songs. His symphony called “From the New World” is his best-known work 
and is one of the most popular orchestral compositions in existence. This symphony 
is based on themes taken from American negro melodies which Dvorak collected while 
living for a time in America. 
Grieg (Grég), Edvard Hagerup, 1843-1907, Norway. Songs, piano pieces, orches- 
tral works. Norway’s greatest composer. 
MacDowell, Edward Alexander, 1861-1908, America. Piano pieces, songs, 
orchestral works. Best-known compositions are the four sonatas together with several 
charming groups of short sketches. America’s greatest composer up to the present time. 
Verdi, Giuseppe, 1813-1901, Italy. Wrote operas and the “Manzoni Requiem.” 
Best-known operas, “Aida,” “Il Trovatore,” “Rigoletto.”

X. Mousicat InstRuMENTS 
Musical instruments may be classified in many different ways, but for our pur- 
pose it will be most practicable to divide them into two groups—namely, first, the 
“many-tone” or harmony-producing instruments, like the piano and the organ, in 
the case of which there is usually only one performer; second, the “‘single-tone” or 
melody-producing instruments, like the violin, cornet, etc., in the case of which several 
performers are usually necessary in order to produce’ a satisfactory musical effect. 
When only one performer takes part, the performance is called solo-playing, but with 
several players uniting their efforts we have what is called ensemble (meaning “to- 
gether”) music. . 
The most common instruments of the first class are, of course, the piano and the 
organ. The celesta (a percussion instrument sometimes used in the modern orchestra) 
also has a keyboard, while the same general idea is made use of in the construction 
of large-size accordions. The harp has no keyboard, but is capable of producing a 
numberof tones at the same time, although not in the same way, and not with the 
same facility as with the piano. Certain less valuable instruments like the guitar, 
mandolin, etc., may also be caused to produce several tones simultaneously. 
The second class includes practically all other instruments that one ordinarily 
finds in band or orchestra. The commonest ones are: violin, viola, violoncello, double 
bass, flute, piccolo, clarinet, bass clarinet, oboe, English horn, bassoon, double bassoon, 
cornet, trumpet, French horn, trombone, tuba, saxophone, and the sax-horns (like 
the alto, tenor, and baritone found in bands). 
The Piano. 'The piano is undoubtedly the most widely used instrument in existence. 
Its popularity is accounted for by the fact that its keyboard action is so arranged that 
almost any kind of music can be played on it at almost any rate of speed, with almost 
“any reasonable variation of power. Once tuned by a capable mechanic, the piano 
cannot be played out of tune (like the violin, for example), and this fact also accounts 
largely for its popularity. In other words, the piano is usable, and therefore it is used. 
Its weakness is its comparative uniformity of tone quality; and unless an artist is 
performing, this uniform tone quality becomes monotonous. By a skillful use of various 
touches combined with a subtle and dexterous manipulation of the pedals, an artist 
is able, however, to vary the quality considerably, and this variation in color is one 
of the things for the student to train his ear to hear at a piano recital. 
A clear understanding of the piano mechanism will help one both in playing and 
in listening. The following facts should be verified by taking off the front of an upright 
piano, or lifting the cover of a “grand,” and carefully observing the functions of the 
various parts as here described: , 
1. The strings are struck by felt hammers which fly back immediately after touch- 
ing the strings. If the hammer remained on the string, the vibrations of the string 
would be stopped, and a dull thud would result. This flying back is then extremely 
important. If the hammer were made of wood or some other hard substance the
-P-A-G-E-236
  AUXILIARY MATERIAL FOR THE TEACHER 227 © 
tone quality would be much poorer (verify this by striking a piano string with a nail 
or the end of a ruler). . 
2. In the middle and upper registers a hammer strikes two or three strings tuned. 
in unison. If there were only one string, the upper register would be weak as compared 
with the lower. The strings of the lower register are heavier in order to avoid the 
necessity of too long a string. Lower pitch is secured either by lengthening a string 
of the same thickness or by increasing the thickness without. additional lengthening. 
If the lowest strings were no thicker than the upper ones they would have to be thirty 
or forty feet long! : 
8. Each string (or set of unison strings) has a piece of soft felt (damper) pressing 
against it to keep it from vibrating when not wanted. If it were not for these dampers, 
there would be a confused jumble. (Depress the damper pedal, and play while holding 
it down continuously to illustrate this point.) There are two ways of lifting the dampers 
from the strings: (1) by striking the key the damper of the corresponding string is 
lifted and held away from the string as long as the key is held down; (2) by depressing 
the right-hand pedal (called the damper pedal, not the loud pedal) all dampers are 
held away from all strings until the pedal is released, when they all go back. The / 
guiding principle to be observed in using the damper pedal is this: “Release the pedal 
when the harmony changes.” Thus, if a chord F—A—C is repeated or if some of the 
tones of the chord are repeated elsewhere on the keyboard, the pedal may be held 
down without hurting one’s ears. But if now the chord B-flat—D—F is to be played 
immediately after the chord F—-A—C, the dampers must first be allowed to stop the 
tones of the F—A—C chord, so that they will not interfere with the tones of the new 
chord. Therefore the pedal is released just an instant before the second’ chord is 
sounded. 
4. The strings are made fast to fixed pins at one end and to movable tuning pins 
at the other. They are stretched over a soundboard and connected with it only by 
means of a very small bridge. This soundboard is made of thin, well-seasoned wood, 
and has the same function as the body of the violin—namely, to intensify and enrich 
the tone (resonate). The bridge also acts just like a violin bridge. (Get a tuning-fork 
if possible, set it vibrating, and hold the end on the piano soundboard or on the body 
of the violin to illustrate resonance.) 
5. There are three authentic piano pedals. Some pianos have only two, these 
being the damper pedal already referred to, and the “soft pedal.” The soft pedal 
works differently on the upright than in the case of the grand piano. In the upright, 
it moves all the hammers nearer the strings so that when the keys are struck, the ham- 
mers have a smaller swing, and, therefore, do not strike so hard (of. driving large and 
small nails). In the grand piano, the soft pedal moves the entire action (keyboard 
and all) slightly to one side so that the hammers strike only two of the three strings, 
this producing a softer tone, and also a little different quality of tone, In the older _ Pianos there were only two unison strings in the upper register, and when the soft pedal 
moved the action over, only one of them was struck. The pedal, therefore, came to 
be known as the “una corda” or one string pedal, and this term is even now frequently
-P-A-G-E-237
    498 _ UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES, TEACHERS’ BOOK 
applied when the composer wishes. the performer to depress this particular’ 
pedal. 
The third pedal is also a kind of damper pedal, in some cases acting only on the 
lower third of the keyboard, but in the modern grand piano functioning as a selective 
damper pedal so that if any key or group of keys are struck, and the sostenuto pedal 
depressed, the dampers corresponding with these particular keys are held away from 
the strings as long as the pedal is kept down, all other dampers remaining on the strings 
unless the damper pedal is depressed. This third pedal, when present, is the middle 
one of the three, so that one may always be certain that the right-hand pedal is the 
damper pedal, and the left-hand one the soft pedal. Certain makes of pianos have 
pedals for softening the tone during practice, etc., but these are of no particular value, 
and are not to be recommended. In purchasing a new piano, points to be looked 
for are: (1) Good tone quality throughout both upper and lower registers; (2)-an even 
scale, the upper register being sufficiently full and rich to balance the lower; (8) respon- 
sive action, neither too hard nor too easy; (4) a frame cast all in one piece for the 
sake of strength; (5) evidence of fine workmanship in all details of construction. 
The Organ. The pipe organ has recently come into much wider use than formerly, 
and pipe-organ ‘music is evidently destined to become more and more popular. ‘This 
is due (1) to the enormous variation in power that is possible on a great modern organ; 
(2) to its wide range of tone color; (3) to its extensive pitch compass; (4) to the 
amazing facility of control which modern mechanical devices like pedals, pistons, 
and couplers give to a single performer, this being manifest in sudden changes of: power 
and quality, in playing melodies with a subdued accompaniment of different color, 
in the production of echo effects, and in combinations containing chimes, etc. 
The essentials of a pipe organ are (1) several sets of whistle-like pipes of various 
degrees of power and quality, the smallest pipes being as thin as a pencil and only a 
few inches long, the largest ones being sixty-four feet long and several feet in diameter; 
(2) a bellows or fan for producing steady air pressure in a reservoir; (3) stop knobs 
operating ‘mechanisms for admitting air from these reservoirs to long air-tight boxes 
on which the pipes are set (wind chests); (4) a keyboard with a mechanical device 
opening the pipe corresponding with each key, so that the air pressure is brought to 
bear on the pipe when the key is depressed, and is shut off when the key is released. 
In a modern organ this mechanism is usually electrical. 
The pipe organ usually has several keyboards called manuals, these making possible 
quick changes of power or tone quality. This makes it easy to play a melody on one 
keyboard and a softer accompaniment of contrasting color on another keyboard. In 
the largest organs one of the keyboards or manuals often controls pipes in an echo 
organ, this being placed far back in the auditorium, but connected with the rest of 
the organ by means of wires, and, of course, some sort of conduit for conveying the 
air pressure from the air reservoir to the wind chests. A pedal keyboard is practically ‘ 
universal in modern organs, this also increasing the range of the performer’s control. 
The keyboards, pedal keyboards, combination pedals, etc., are collectively called the 
console, and in the electrical organ the console is often at a considerable distance from 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
AUXILIARY MATERIAL FOR THE TEACHER 229 
the - pipes that actually produce the tones, these often being placed at the sides of the 
hall, in the ceiling, or even in another room. 
A stop or register is a set of pipes of similar tone quality throughout, one pipe 
for each: key of the entire manual. When the stop-knob corresponding with this set 
of pipes is pulled out (or the tilting tablet shifted), the air pressure is admitted from 
the pressure reservoir to the particular wind chest on which these pipes are fixed, and 
when any key is now depressed, the corresponding pipe in this set sounds its tone. 
But if. the stop-knob is pushed back again, the air pressure is cut off from this set of 
pipes, and if the same key is now depressed, the pipe does not sound. If the performer 
draws out five stop-knobs, this means that the air pressure is admitted to five different 
wind chests, and if a single key is now held down, five different. pipes—one in each 
register or stop—sound the same pitch, but with five different qualities of tone. This 
corresponds with having five instruments like violin, piano, cornet, flute, and clarinet 
all sound the same pitch at the same time. Now suppose the organist plays a chord 
of four tones: at once twenty pipes “speak.” Let him draw two pedal-stops and 
“double” the lower tone on the pedal keyboard and we have twenty-two pipes sounding. 
Now let him push in a coupler, and thus connect another keyboard on which he has 
previously drawn eight stop-knobs, with the one on which he is playing, and at once 
thirty-two additional pipes speak—fifty-four in all. Thus almost infinite variety in 
power and quality is at the organist’s command. 
In order to provide for still greater variation in power, some of the sets of pipes 
are enclosed in a practically sound-proof chamber called the “swell box.” This room 
is provided with shutters that can be opened and closed ‘at will by means of a “swell . 
pedal.” When the shutters are closed, the tone is so soft that we can scarcely hear it. 
When the shutters are opened we can hear the tone at its full strength. 
This manipulation of mechanical devices on the pipe organ is called “registration,” 
and by making full use of all the combination pedals, etc., that the organist has at 
his disposal, he is able to command a greater extent of range and power than any other 
single musical performer, the compass, dynamic possibilities, and variety of combina- 
tion_of the organ comparing in extent. with the modern symphony orchestra. Dr. 
Eliot has been quoted as stating that the performer on a modern pipe organ does 
more'things at the same time than are demanded by any other type of human activity. 
The advantage of the organ over the piano is its power to sustain tones without 
diminishing (in the piano the tone begins to die away as soon as it is begun);’ its great 
iefy df power and tone color; and its somewhat greater range. Its disadvantage 
is its: great size and complexity and its difficulty of manipulation, together with the 
enormous expense of a large modern organ. There is also a certain feeling that one 
is listening to mechanical music in going to an organ concert; that is not so much present 
ina] ano recital. In some way, the piano seems to be closer and warmer, more intimate 
(with. human voice and the violin this is even more the case), while the organ seems 
far : away, cold, and impersonal. This is perhaps to be accounted for by the fact that 
the: power and quality of the tones are not in any way affected by the way the per- 
former strikes the key, as in the case of the piano.

EnseMBLe Music 
The instruments of the second class mentioned at the beginning of this chapter 
are used in various ensemble combinations. The string quartet consists of two violins, 
viola, and ’cello. Sometimes the piano is added, making a quintet. The trio often 
consists of violin, ’cello, and piano, but many other trio combinations are used. A 
band is often made up of brass and percussion instruments only (cornets, altos, tenors, 
baritones, tubas, trombones, trumpets), but such a combination affords little variety 
of tone color or shading, and the high-grade concert band has as many or more wood- 
wind instruments (clarinets, flutes, oboes, bassoons, etc.) as brass ones, and is likely 
to have several saxophones as well. Such a band is often referred to as a military band, 
because the best bands are frequently to be found in the army and navy. The concert 
band occasionally makes use of a few ’cellos or double basses for the sake of added 
smoothness and sonority in the bass parts. 
The term “orchestra” is commonly applied to any kind of ensemble group in 
which the strings (violins, violas, ’cellos, basses) furnish the characteristic body of tone,’ 
or at least are more prominent than the wind instruments,, There is the theatre orches- 
ira, for example, with from five to fifteen players, consisting perhaps of two first violins, 
two seconds, one viola, one ’cello, ‘one bass, one clarinet, one cornet, one trombone, 
together with drums and “traps” and a piano. The school orchestra usually has a 
piano, several violins, and such other instruments as may happen to be. available. 
But the term “orchestra” really refers to the symphony orchestra, such a band of 
players producing. the most exalted of all types of music, this being particularly the 
case when a large proportion of the players are high-class solo performers, and when 
the conductor is not only a good director, but also a musician of both authority and 
imagination. ~~ oe 
A symphony orékestra consists of four classes of instruments: (1) strings (first - 
and second violin, viola, ’cello, and bass); (2) wood-winds (oboe, English horn, bassoon, 
double bassoon, flute, piccolo, clarinet, and bass clarinet); (8) brass-winds (trumpets, 
trombones, tuba, French horns, and sometimes cornets); (4) percussion (kettledrums, 
bass drum, snare drum, bells [glockenspiel], triangle, tambourine, etc.). A modern 
symphony orchestra has from sixty to one hundred players, about three-quarters of 
whom play stringed instruments, so that the main body of tone is of string color, the 
winds being used to give variety of tone quality, and to help furnish great bursts of 
tone at climactic points. Since the strings are able to play with such extraordinary 
agility and variety, a symphony orchestra can produce many different kinds of effects—— 
assages, dramatic changes in power from very, very soft to very, very 
loud, con: asts of tone quality, ete. The conductor of a symphony orchestra is indeed

The seating of the players varies somewhat with the size and shape of the stage, 
etc., but is usually approximately shown in the diagram below.

Tun Score 
The conductor’s score contains all the parts exactly as each one appears before 
each player, so that the conductor:can tell just what each performer is supposed to be 
playing at any given moment, Some of these parts are transposed (e.g., trumpet and 
clarinet), some are written with other clefs than the familiar G and F clefs (e-g., viola, 
’eello, and bassoon), and, all in all, the business of conducting a symphony orchestra 
is indeed a very complex affair. Some modern composers commit entire scores of long 
compositions to memory, and this, when actually done, represents the very peak of 
‘virtuosity. A sample page of an orchestral score is included to make these matters

~The student is advised to seize every possible opportunity of hearing a symphony 
“ofchestra play or rehearse, sometimes sitting where he can see the players and the 
conductor close up. If a miniature score of some composition that is to be played 
can be secured, it will heighten manifold the interest and satisfaction of hearing’ that 
patticular composition. Such scores can be secured for a small sum, and a collection 
them might well form a part of the school library. 
“A brief description of the various instruments ordinarily found in bands and 
‘orchestras is furnished in the hope that pupils will feel sufficiently interested to learn 
at east: the fundamental facts concerning each instrument. The first thing to do is 
to learn the four general classes and the names of the various instruments in each class. 
econd thing is to become familiar with the appearance of each instrument, together 
’ its location in the seating plan of a symphony orchestra. The third is to learn the 
characteristic tone quality of each instrument in its various registers, so that one may 
always know what instrument is sounding whether one can see it or not.

violin as a solo instrument because it is not capable of producing so many varieties. of

  ent. is ordinarily used only with other wind instruments—i.e., in bands. It is occa- 
sionally called for in the orchestra, but not often. ‘The B-flat clarinet is perhaps, all 
in all, the most useful instrument in. the wood-wind family. It has a very extensive 
compass, has several registers each producing a different sort of tone quality (of. G string 
on the violin as contrasted with the other strings), and is capable of producing brilliant 
passages as well as slow and sustained ones. Above all, its quality is beautiful and 
is universally loved, especially that of the lowest register (called the. chalumeau). 
Bands usually employ the B-flat clarinet, and if only one instrument is purchased, 
it should be a “low pitch B-flat.” The E-flat clarinet is often called for in band music, 
but its quality is hard and squeaky. In the symphony orchestra, only the B-flat and 
A instruments are used, the one to be called for in any particular composition depending 
upon the key of that composition, an attempt being made to avoid too many sharps 
and flats. The bass clarinet is in B-flat, its range being an octave below that of the 
ordinary clarinet in B-flat.

  None of the wood-wind instruments can be tuned without making it difficult or 
impossible to play their higher tones in tune, so they must all be built to play in a 
certain standard pitch. For this reason, all other players in a symphony orchestra 
tune to the “A” of the oboe or clarinet. 
Brass-Winp INSTRUMENTS . 
The French horn is one of the most interesting of instruments, and when well 
played its tone quality is unsurpassed in beauty by any instrument in the orchestra. 
_ But it does not have so great variety of quality as some other instruments, and there- 
fore is not so useful as, for instance, the violin and the clarinet. It is also not so agile 
as the cornet, flute, etc., and is, besides, more difficult to play. However, it is-indis- 
~ -pensable in both band and orchestra, and French horn players are always in demand.

who has ambitions to play the French horn may do his preliminary: work on 
aper and easier “circular alto” or “mellophone.” The French horn is often 
  
  
‘ealled valve horn. Its range is —— to i=. Its tube is sixteen feet long 
is conical in shape throughout—that i is, it tapers gradually from the mouthpiece 
to the bell. 
‘The cornet (pronounced kor’ -net) is perhaps the-most common of the brass instru- 
‘ments. It is easy to play, i is capable of great agility, and has fairly satisfactory tone qual- 
ity. Itis prominent in all bands, and is sometimes used even in symphony orchestras in 
place of, or in addition to, its more aristocratic relative, the trumpet, which is some- 
  : Deo. 
what harder to play. The range of the cornet is from e— to — . Cornet- e 
players who are ambitious to become professional musicians will do well to transfer — 
to the trumpet or perhaps some other wind instrument, as cornet-players are always 
plentiful, but performers on the trumpet and French horn are usually scarce. The 
cornet is a transposing instrument, sounding & whole-step or a step-and-a-half lower 
than the notes indicate. 
The trumpet has about the same range as the cornet, and is manipulated in the 
same way. Its mouthpiece is longer and more slender than that of the cornet, this 
making tone production more difficult. Its tube is longer than that of the cornet, 
and is conical in shape—that is, tapering from end to end instead of being cylindrical 
(that-is—of the same diameter) throughout. The tone quality of the trumpet is more 
brilliant and ringing, more like the tenor voice in quality, while the cornet is somewhat 
effeminate in comparison—something like a man’s falsetto tones. All cornet parts 
can be equally well played on the trumpet, and vice versa. Both cornet and trumpet 
can be tuned by pulling out. or pushing in a short crook by means of which the total 
length of the tube can be slightly varied. In the same fashion, another sliding crook 
lowers the pitch of a B-flat instrument a half-step so that both B-flat and A trumpet 
or cornet parts may be played on the same instrument. 
The pitch sounded by the trombone (pronounced trom’bone) is altered by lengthen- 
ing or shortening the tube’ of which the instrument is constructed, this being possible 
because the lower part slides into the upper and can be pulled out to increase the total 
length of the tube through which the air passes. There are usually three trombones 
in the orchestra, each in general playing a separate part, and the combination of this. 
trio with the tuba on the bass part is majestic and thrilling, being powerful enough 
to dominate the entire orchestra in fortissimo passages. But the trombones are useful 
in soft passages also, and their tone when playing pianissimo is rich and serene, yet 
.. Sonorous. 
The alto, tenor, baritone, and bass (or tuba) commonly found in bands are all 
~ members of what is called the “sax-horn family.” There is also a soprano sax-horn 
which is like the E-flat cornet and E-flat trumpet found in large bands. In most cases, 
the cornet and trumpet take the place of the soprano member of the family. ‘ The sax- 
‘. horns are comparatively recent additions to the wind instrument family, having been

invented about 1840 by a Frenchman named Adolphe Sax. They all have a long 
tube with crooks of varying lengths which can be thrown in or cut out by means of 
valves (just as in the cornet, trumpet, and French horn). The tuba often has 
as many as four of these valves, but in general'there are three only. These instru- 
ments are valuable in supplying the harmony parts in bands, especially in small and 
incomplete ones, but their tone quality is only fairly satisfactory, and is capable of very 
little variety. They can be tuned by means of a tuning slide which makes the tube of 
which the instrument is composed a little longer or shorter, as in the case of the 
trumpet, ete. 
Percussion InstRUMENTS 
_ The instruments of percussion are many and various, but are all alike in that 
the tone is produced by striking something. Most of them have no definite pitch, 
but simply produce a noise, and, therefore, are valuable simply as rhythmic adjuncts 
to the tones produced by the other instruments. The kettledrums, bells (glockenspiel), 
celesta, and one or two other members: of this group, produce definite-pitches, however, 
and are extremely useful in both band and orchestra. The drums, cymbals, etc., as 
used in bands and small orchestra combinations are often referred to collectively as 
“traps.” 
The ketiledrums are ordinarily used in pairs, sometimes in three or even fours. 
The kettledrum-player must have a keen ear and be a good musician as well as a skillful 
performer, and he ordinarily does nothing else but play kettledrums. In the case of 
the other percussion instruments, however, one player usually manipulates several 
different instruments. The compass of a pair of kettledrums is one octave — 
and they are usually tuned so’ that one drum sounds the tonic (one of the seale) and 
the other the dominant (five of the scale). The celesta consists of a series of metal 
plates with resonators attached, which sound the chromatic scale through several 
octaves and are played by means of a keyboard mechanism. The glockenspiel or 
“bells” is a series of metal plates tuned to the chromatic scale. The player has a 
small hammer in each hand with which the plates are struck. The aylophone (pro- 
nounced zi-1d-f6n) is a series of wooden bars tuned to the chromatic scale. The bars 
are struck with hammers as in the case of the bells. 
The illustrations of the remaining percussion instruments will be all that is needed 
to make one intelligent about their use. Since most percussion instruments do not 
produce definite pitches, their notation often consists of notes on a straight line, or 
possibly notes written on a:line or space of the staff, but in such a case not referring to 
any particular pitch.

: “Its compass is = to =. The modern harp has forty-six 
: igs, which ‘ate tuned in wail seo and whole-steps so as to sound the scale of C-flat 
“Tt has a series of seven pedals around its base, each pedal having two notches 
: below. it, into. ‘either’ of which the pedal may be lowered and held fast. One pedal 
shortens the F-flat : string so that it now sounds F (giving the key of G-flat); a second 
’ one shortens the C-flat string so that it sounds C (giving the key of D-flat); a third 
pedal shortens the G-flat string so that it sounds G (giving the key of A-flat); the 
__ fourth. changes the D-flat to D (giving the key of E- flat), and so on until, when all 
. fhe’ pedals are fixed in their first notches, the scale of C is sounded-instead of C-flat, 
‘was the case before any ‘of the pedals were depressed. But if the first pedal is now 
_ pushed down into the second notch the original F-flat string is still further shortened 
and now sounds the pitch F-sharp (giving us the key of G), and if all the other pedals 
are likewise successively lowered to the second notch we get in turn all the sharp keys 
_ —D, A, E, B, F-sharp and C-sharp, the last-named key being obtained as the result 
of having all the pedals fixed in their second notches, thus making all the tones of the 
original C-flat ‘scale a whole-step higher so that they now sound the C-sharp scale. 
Chords of not -more than four tones for each harid may be played simultaneously 
on the harp, but arpeggio and scale passages are the rule, and are more characteristic 
than simultaneous chords. The notation of harp music is essentially like that of piano — 
music.

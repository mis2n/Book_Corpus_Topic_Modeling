  PREFACE, 
THE present book is a revision of my Latin Grammar 
originally published in 1895. Wherever greater accuracy or 
precision of statement seemed possible, I have endeavored 
to secure this. The rules for syllable division have been 
changed and made to conform to the prevailing practice 
of the Romans themselves. In the Perfect Subjunctive 
Active, the endings -zs, -zmus, -itis are now marked long. 
The theory of vowel length before the suffixes -gnus, -gna, 
-gnum, and also before j, has been discarded. In the 
Syntax I have recognized a special category of Ablative 
of Association, and have abandoned the original eieciaain: 
as to the force of tenses in the Prohibitive. 
Apart from the foregoing, only minor and unessential 
modifications have been introduced. In its main lines the 
work remains unchanged.

FROM THE PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. 
THE object of this book is to present the essential facts 
of Latin grammar in a direct and simple manner, and 
within the smallest compass consistent with scholarly 
standards. While intended primarily for the secondary 
school, it has not neglected the needs of the college stu- 
dent, and aims to furnish such grammatical information as 
is ordinarily requiredAg yn@ergr{afrate courses.

        From the Preface to the First Edition. 
The experience of German educators in recent years has 
tended ‘to restrict the size of school-grammars of Latin, 
and has demanded an incorporation of the main principles 
of the language in compact manuals of 250 pages.t_ Within 
the past decade, several grammars of this scope have ap- 
peared which have amply met the exacting demands of the 
full Gymnasial Latin course, —a period of study repre- 
senting quite as much reading as that covered by the aver- 
age American undergraduate. 
The publication in this country of a grammar of similar 
plan and scope seems fully justified at the present time, as 
all recent editions of classic texts summarize in introduc- 
tions the special idioms of grammar and style peculiar to 
individual authors. This makes it feasible to dispense 
with the enumeration of many mnutiae of usage which 
would otherwise demand consideration in a student’s 
grammar. 
In the chapter on Prosody, I have designedly omitted 
all special treatment of the lyric metres of Horace and 
Catullus, as well as of the measures of the comic poets. 
Our standard editions of these authors all give such thor- 
ough consideration to versification that repetition in a 
separate place seems superfluous.

1 One of the most eminent of living Latinists, Professor Eduard Wolfflin, 
of Munich, has expressed the opinion that the essentials may be given within 
even smaller compass than this, See his Preface to the Schmalz-Wagener 
Lateinische Grammatik, 1891.

THE ALPHABET. 
1. The Latin Alphabet is the same as the English, 
except that the Latin has no w.    
           1. EK occurs only in Kalendae and a few other words; y and z were 
introduced from the Greek about 50 B.c., and occur only in foreign 
words — chiefly Greek. 
2. With the Romans, who regularly employed only capitals, I served 
both as vowel and consonant; so also V. For us, however, it is more 
convenient to distinguish the vowel and consonant sounds, and to write 
iand u for the former, j and v for the latter. Yet some scholars prefer 
to employ i and u in the function of consonants as well as vowels. 
CLASSIFICATION OF SOUNDS. 
2. 1. The Vowels are a, e, i, 0, u, y. The other letters 
are Consonants. ° The Diphthongs are ae, oe, ei, au, eu, ui. 
2. Consonants are further subdivided into Mutes, 
Liquids, Nasals, and Spirants. 
3. The Mutes are p, t, c, k, q; b, d, g; ph, th, ch. Of 
these, — 
a) p,t,c, k, q are voiceless,! z.e. sounded wéthout voice or vibra- 
tion of the vocal cords. 
6) b, 4, g are voiced,? ze. sounded with vibration of the vocal 
cords. 
  
1 For ‘voiceless,’ ‘surd,’ ‘ hard,’ or ‘ tenuis’ are sometimes used. 
2 For ‘ voiced,’ ‘sonant,’ ‘soft,’ or ‘media’ are sometimes used.

   Sounds, Accent, Quantity.    
         ¢) ph, th, ch are aspirates. These are confined almost exclu- 
sively to words derived from the Greek, and were equivalent 
to p+h, t+h,c+h, ze. to the corresponding voiceless 
mutes with a following breath, as in Eng. loop-hole, hot-house, 
block-house. 
      
      
     4. The Mutes admit of classification also as 
Labials, Pp, b, ph. 
Dentals (or Linguals), t, d, th. 
Gutturals (or Palatals), ce, k, q, g, ch. 
       
            
   
  5. The Liquids are1, r. These sounds were voiced. 
6. The Nasals are m,n. These were voiced. Besides 
its ordinary sound, n, when followed by a guttural mute, 
also had another sound,—that of ng in szzg,—the so- 
called n adulterinum; as, — 
          
    anceps, double, pronounced angceps.     7. The Spirants (sometimes called Fricatives) are £, s, h. 
These were voiceless. 
8. The Semivowels are j and v. These were voiced. 
9. Double Consonants are x and z Of these, x was 
equivalent to es, while the equivalence of z is uncertain. 
ES. Vials.

SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS. 
8. The following pronunciation (often called Roman) is 
substantially that employed by the Romans at the height 
of their civilization; z.e. roughly; from 50 B.c. to 50 A.D. 
1. Vowels. 
a as in father; & as in the first syllable of ahd; 
é as in they; € asin met; 
I asin machine; i asin pin; 
6 as in note; 6 as in obey, melody 3 
@ asin rude; Ui as in put; 
y like French ~, German #. 
2. Diphthongs. 
ae like a7 in azsle; eu with its two elements, é and t, 
oe like.oz in o7; pronounced in rapid succession ; 
ei as in rein; ui occurs almost exclusively in ca 
au like ow in how; and Auic. These words are pro- 
nounced as though written Awee 
and wheek. 3. Consonants. 
b, d, f, h, k, 1, m, n, p, qu are pronounced as in English, except that 
bs, bt are pronounced fs, ft. 
ce is always pronounced as &. 
is always a plain #, never with the sound of s# as in Eng. oration. 
aiways as in gef ; when ngu precedes a vowel, gu has the sound of 
gw, as in anguis, languidus. 
j_ has the sound of y as in yet. 
x was probably slightly trilled with the tip of the tongue. 
s always voiceless as in séz; in sudded, suavis, suéscé, and in com- 
pounds and derivatives of these words, su has the sound of sw. 
v like w. 
x always like #s; never like Eng. gz or 2. 
% uncertain in sound; possibly like Eng. zd, possibly like z. The 
yj _ latter sound is recommended. 
“he aspirates ph, ch, th were pronounced very nearly like our stressed 
Eng. #, c, #—so nearly so, that, for practical purposes, the latter 
sounds suffice. 
Doubled letters, like 11, mm, tt, efc., should be so pronounced that 
both members of the combination are distinctly articulated. me ct 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
4 Sounds, Accent, Quantity. 
SYLLABLES. 
4. There are as many syllables in a Latin word as there 
are separate vowels and diphthongs. 
In the division of words into.syllables, — 
1. A single consonant is joined to the following vowel; as, vo-lat, 
ge-rit, pe-rit, a-dest. 
2. Doubled consonants, like tt, ss, e¢c., are always separated; as, 
vit-ta, mis-sus. 
3. Other combinations of two or more consonants are regularly 
separated, and the first consonant of the combination is joined with the 
preceding vowel; as, ma-gis-tri, dig-nus, m6n-strum, sis-te-re. 
4. An exception to Rule 3 occurs when the two consonants consist 
of a mute followed by 1 or r (pl, cl, tl; pr, cr, tr, efc.). In such cases 
both consonants are regularly joined to the following vowel; as, a-gri, 
vo-lu-cris, pa-tris, ma-tris. Yet if the 1 or r introduces the second 
part of a compound, the two consonants are separated; as, ab-rumpé, 
ad-latus. 
5. The double consonant x is joined to the preceding vowel; as, 
ax-is, t€x-I. 
QUANTITY. 
5. A. Quantity of Vowels. 
A vowel is dong or short according to the length of time required for 
its pronunciation. No absolute rule can be given for determining the 
quantity of Latin vowels. This knowledge must be gained, in large 
measure, by experience; but the following principles are of aid: — 
I. A vowel is long,!— 
a) before nf or ns; as, infans, Inferior, cOnstiim6d, cénsed, 
Insum. 
6) when the result of contraction; as, nilum for nihilum. 
2. A vowel is short, — 
a) before nt, nd; as, amant,amandus. A few exceptions occur 
in compounds whose first member has a long vowel; as, n6n- 
dum (n6én dum). 
6) before another vowel, or h; as, meus, trahd. Some excep- 
tions occur, chiefly in proper names derived from the Greek; 
as, Aenéas. 
1In this book, long vowels are indicated by a horizontal line above them; as, 
&, i, 5, etc. Vowels not thus marked are short, Occasionally a curve is set 
above short vowels; as, 6, ti.

        Accent. 
B. Quantity of Syllables. 
Syllables are distinguished as ong or short according to the length 
of time required for their pronunciation. 
1. A syllable is long,!— 
@) if it contains a long vowel; as, mater, régnum, dius. 
6) if it contains a diphthong; as, causae, foedus. 
c) if it contains a short vowel followed by x, z, or any two con- 
sonants (except a mute with 1 or r); as, axis, gaza, restd. 
2. Asyllable is short, if it contains a short vowel followed by a 
vowel or by a single consonant; as, mea, amat. 
3- Sometimes a syllable varies in quantity, vz. when its vowel is 
short and is followed by a mute with 1 or r, ze. by pl, cl, tl; pr, cr, 
tr, efc.; as, Agri, volticris.2 Such syllables are called common. In 
prose they were regularly short, but in verse they might be treated as 
long at the option of the poet. 
Note. — These distinctions of ong and short are not arbitrary and 
artificial, but are purely natural. Thus, a syllable containing a short 
vowel followed by two consonants, as ng, is long, because such a syl- 
lable requires more tzme for its pronunciation; while a syllable con- 
taining a short vowel followed by one consonant is short, because it 
takes ess te to pronounce it. In case of the common syllables, 
the mute and the liquid blend so easily as to produce a combination 
which takes scarcely more time than a single consonant. Yet by sepa- 
rating the two elements (as ag-ri) the poets were able to use such 
syllables as long. 
ACCENT. 
6. 1. Words of two syllables are accented upon the first; as, tégit, 
mérem. 
2. Words of more than two syllables are accented upon the penult 
(next to the last) if that is a long syllable, otherwise upon the ante- 
penult (second from the last) ; as, amavi, amantis, miserum. 
3. When the enclitics -que, -ne, -ve, -ce, -met, -dum are appended 
to words, if the syllable preceding the enclitic is long (either originally 
or as a result of adding the enclitic) it is accented; as, miser6que, 
hominisque. But if the syllable still remains short after the enclitic 
has been added, it is not accented unless the word originally took 
the accent on the antepenult. Thus, pértaque; but miserdque. 
1 To avoid confusion, the quantity of sy//ab/es is not indicated by any sign. 
2 But if the 1 or r introduces the second part of a compound, the preceding 
syllable is always long; as, abrump6,

       6 Sounds, Accent, Quantity. 
    
     4. Sometimes the final -e of -ne and -ce disappears, but without 
affecting the accent; as, tant6n, istic, illfic, vidén (for vidésne). 
5. In utraque, each, and plér&que, most, -que is not properly an 
enclitic; yet these words accent the penult, owing to the influence 
of their other cases, — utérque, utrimque, plérimque. 
      
       
    VOWEL CHANGES.! 
7. 1. In Compounds, — 
      
    
  @) & before a single consonant becomes 1; as, — 
colligé for con-legé. 
        
  4) & before a single consonant becomes 1; as,— 
adigé for ad-ag6. 
       ¢) &% before two consonants becomes & ; as, — 
expers for ex-pars.         d@) ae becomes 7; as, — 
conquir6 for con-quaeré, 
       
é) au becomes ii, sometimes 6; as,— 
conclidé for con-claudé; 
expl6d6 for ex-plaudé. 
2. Contraction. Concurrent vowels were frequently contracted into 
one long vowel. The first of the two vowels regularly prevailed ; as, — 
trés for tre-es ; cdpia for co-opia; 
mal6 for ma(v)el6; c6gé for co-agé; 
amAsti for amA(v)isti; cdmé for co-em6é; 
débes for dé(h)abed; jainior for ju(v)enior. 
nil for nihil; 
3. Parasitic Vowels. In the environment of liquids and nasals a 
parasitic vowel sometimes develops ; as, — 
vineulum for earlier vinclum. 
So periculum, saeculum. 
4. Syncope. Sometimes a vowel drops out by syncope; as, — 
ardor for aridor (compare a@rédus) ; 
valdé for validé (compare validus). 
  
1 Only the simplest and most obvious of these are here treated.
-P-A-G-E-15
Peculiarities of Orthography. 
CONSONANT CHANGES.! 
8. 1. Rhotacism. An original s between vowels became r; as,— 
arb6s, Gen. arboris (for arbosis) ; 
genus, Gen. generis (for genesis) ; 
dirim6 (for dis-em6). 
2. dt, tt, ts each give s or ss; as, — 
pénsum for pend-tum; 
versum for vert-tum; 
miles for milet-s; 
sessus for sedtus; 
passus for pattus. 
3. Final consonants were often omitted ; as, — 
cor for cord; 
lac for lact. 
4. Assimilation of Consonants. Consonants are often assimi- 
lated to a folowing sound. Thus: accurré (adc-); agger6 (adg-) ; 
asser6 (ads-); allatus (adl-); apports (adp-); attuli (adt-); 
arride6 (adr-) ; afferd (adf-) ; occurré (obc-) ; supp6n6 (subp-) ; 
offerd (obf-) ; corru6 (comr-); collatus (coml-); eéc. 
5. Partial Assimilation. Sometimes the assimilation is only 
partial. Thus :— 
@) b before s or t becomes p; as, — 
scripsi (scrib-si), scriptum (scrib-tum), 
6) g before s or t becomes c; as, — 
actus (ag-tus). 
¢) m before a dental or guttural becomes n; as, — 
eundem (eum-dem); princeps (prim-ceps). 
PECULIARITIES OF ORTHOGRAPHY. 
9. Many words have variable orthography. 
1. Sometimes the different forms belong to different periods of the

ing forms almost down to the Augustan age; after that, cum, vultus, 
vulnus, vult, efc. So optumus, maxumus, lubet, lubid6, ¢é/c., 
down to about the same era; later, optimus, maximus, libet, libid6, 
etc. 
2. In some words the orthography varies at one and the same 
period of the language. Examples are exspect6, expectd; exsistd, 
exist6 ; epistula, epistola; aduléscéns, adoléscéns ; paulus, paul- 
lus; cottidié, cotidié; and, particularly, prepositional compounds, 
which often made a concession to the etymology in the spelling ; as, — 
ad-ger6 or aggerd; ad-ser6 or asser6; 
ad-lici6 or allicis; in-latus or illatus ; 
ad-rogans or arrogans; sub-movesé or summove6; 
and many others. 
3- Compounds of jacié were usually written 6icid, déici6, adicié, 
obicid, efc., out were probably pronounced as though written adjici6, 
objicis, etc. 
4. Adjectives and nouns in -quus, -quum; -vus, -vum; -uus, 
-uum preserved the earlier forms in -quos, -quom; -vos, -vom; 
-uos, -uom, down through the Ciceronian age; as, antiquos, anti- 
quom; saevos; perpetuos; equos; servos. Similarly verbs in 
the 3d plural present indicative exhibit the terminations -quont, 
-quontur ; -vont, -vontur; -uont, -uontur, for the same period; as, 
relinquont, loquontur ; vivont, metuont. 
The older spelling, while generally followed in editions of Plautus 
and Terence, has not yet been adopted in our prose texts.

INFLECTIONS. 
angen 
10. The Parts of Speech in Latin are the same as 
in English, véz. Nouns, Adjectives, Pronouns, Verbs, 
Adverbs, Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections; 
but the Latin has no article. 
11. Of these eight parts of speech the first four are 
capable of Inflection, z.c. of undergoing change of form 
to express modifications of meaning. In case of Nouns, 
Adjectives, and Pronouns, this process is called Declen- 
sion ; in case of Verbs, Conjugation. 
Cuapter I.— Declension. 
A. NOUNS. 
12. A Noun is the name of a person, place, thing, or 
quality ; as, Caesar, Caesar; Réma, Rome; penna, feather ; 
virtiis, courage. 
1. Nouns are either Proper or Common. Proper nouns are perma- 
nent names of persons or places; as, Caesar, RGma. Other nouns 
are Common; as, penna, virtiis. 
2. Nouns are also distinguished as Concrete or Abstract. 
@) Concrete nouns are those which designate individual objects ; 
as, m6ns, mountain ; pés, foot ; diés, day ; méns, mind. 
9
-P-A-G-E-18
10 Infections. 
Under concrete nouns are included, also, collective nouns ; 
as, legiG, /egion ; comitatus, retinue. 
6) Abstract nouns’ designate qualities; as, c6nstantia, s¢ead- 
Sastness ; paupertas, poverty. 
GENDER OF NOUNS. 
13. There are three Genders, — Masculine, Feminine, 
and Neuter. Gender in Latin is either natural or gram- 
matical. 
Natural Gender. 
14. The gender of nouns is natural when it is based 
upon sex. Natural gender is confined entirely to names 
of persons; and these are — 
1. Masculine, if they denote males; as, — 
nauta, sadlor; agricola, farmer. 
2. Feminine, if they denote females; as, — 
mater, mother ; régina, gueen. 
Grammatical Gender. 
15. Grammatical gender is determined not by sex, but 
by the general signification of the word, or the ending of 
its Nominative Singular. By grammatical gender, nouns 
denoting things or qualities are often Masculine or Femi- 
nine, simply by virtue of their signification or the ending 
of the Nominative Singular. The following are the gen- 
eral principles for determining grammatical gender : — 
A. Gender determined by Signification. 
1. Names of Rivers, Winds, and Months are Mascu- 
line ; as, — 
Séquana, Seine; Eurus, east wind; Aprilis, April. 
2. Names of Z7ees, and such names of TZowns and 
Islands as end in -us, are Feminine; as, — 
quercus, oak ; Corinthus, Corinth ; Rhodus, Rhodes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  Number. — Cases. II 
Other names of towns and islands follow the gender of their endings 
(see B, below) ; as, — 
Delphi, m.; Leuctra, n.; Tibur,n.; Carthagé, f. 
3. Indeclinable nouns, also infinitives and phrases, are 
Neuter ; as, — 
nihil, nothing; nefas, wrong; amare, to love. 
NoTE.— Exceptions to the above principles sometimes occur ; as, Allia (the 
river), f. 
B. Gender determined by Ending of Nominative Singular. 
The gender of other nouns is determined by the ending 
of the Nominative Singular. 
Nore 1.— Common Gender. Certain nouns are sometimes Mascu- 
line, sometimes Feminine. Thus, sacerdds may mean either priest or 
priestess, and is Masculine or Feminine accordingly. So also civis, 
citizen; paxéns, parent; etc. The gender of such nouns is said to be 
common. 
Nore 2.—Names of animals usually have grammatical gender. 
according to the ending of the Nominative Singular, but the one form 
may designate either the male or female ; as, Anser, m., goose or gan- 
der. So vulpés, f., fox; aquila, f., eagle. 
NUMBER. 
16. The Latin has two Numbers, — the Singular and 
Plural. The Singular denotes one object; the Plural, 
more than one. 
CASES. 
17. There are six Cases in Latin: — 
Nominative, Case of Subject; 
Genitive, Objective with of, or Possessive ; 
Dative, Objective with Zo or for; 
Accusative, Case of Direct Object; 
Vocative, Case of Address; 
Ablative. Objective with dy, from, in, with. 
  
1 The great majority of all Latin nouns come under this category. The prin- 
ciples for determining their gender are given under the separate declensions.
-P-A-G-E-20
12 Inflections. 
1. LocaTivE. Vestiges of another case, the Locative (denoting 
place where), occur in names of towns and in a few other words. 
2. OBLIQUE CASES. The Genitive, Dative, Accusative, and Abla- 
tive are called Oblique Cases. 
3. STEM AND CASE-ENDINGS. The different cases are formed by 
appending certain case-endings to a fundamental part called the 
Stem. Thus, portam (Accusative Singular) is formed by adding 
the case-ending -m to the stem porta-. But in most cases the final 
vowel of the stem has coalesced so closely with the actual case-ending 
that the latter has become more or less obscured. The apparent case- 
ending thus resulting is called a termination. 
THE FIVE DECLENSIONS, 
18. There are five Declensions in Latin, distinguished 
from each other by the final letter of the Stem, and also 
by the Termination of the Genitive Singular, as follows : — 
DECLENSION. Fina Letrer or Stem. Gen, TERMINATION. 
First a -ae 
Second 6 i 
Third : -is Some consonant 
Pourth a -tis 
Fifth é 8 
Cases alike in Form. 
19. 1. The Vocative is regularly like the Nominative, except in 
the Singular of nouns in -us of the Second Declension. 
2. The Dative and Ablative Plural are always alike. 
3- In Neuters the Accusative and Nominative are always alike, and 
in the Plural end in -a. 
4. In the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Declensions, the Accusative 
Plural is regularly like the Nominative. 
  
1The Stem is often derived from a more primitive form called the Root, 
Thus, the stem porta- goes back to the root per-,por-. Roots are usually mono- 
syllabic. The addition made to a root to form a stem is called a Suffix. Thus 
in porta- the suffix is -ta.

Peculiarities of Nouns of the First Declension. 
21, 1. EXCEPTIONS IN GENDER. Nouns denoting males are Mascu- 
line; as, nauta, sadlor ; agricola, farmer; also Hadria, Adriatic Sea. 
2. Rare Case-Endings, — 
@) An old form of the Genitive Singular in -as is preserved in 
the combination pater familias, father of a family ; also in 
mater familias, filius familias, filia familias. But the 
regular form of the Genitive in -ae is also admissible in these 
expressions ; as, pater familiae. 
4) In poetry a Genitive in -ai also occurs; as, aulai.
-P-A-G-E-22
14 Inflections. 
¢) The Locative Singular ends in -ae; as, Rémae, at Rome. 
d) A Genitive Plural in -um instead of -drum sometimes occurs ; 
as, Dardanidum instead of Dardanidarum. This termina- 
tion -um is not a contraction of -4rum, but represents an 
entirely different case-ending. 
é) Instead of the regular ending -is, we usually find -abus 
in the Dative and Ablative Plural of dea, goddess, and filia, 
daughter, especially when it is important to distinguish these 
nouns from the corresponding forms of deus, god, and filius, 
son. A few other words sometimes have the same peculiarity ; 
as, libertabus (from liberta, /reedwoman), equabus 
(mares), to avoid confusion with libertis (from libertus, 
Sreedman) and equis (from equus, horse). 
Greek Nouns: 
22. These end in -é (Feminine); -as and -és (Masculine). 
In the Plural they are declined like regular Latin nouns 
of the First Declension. In the Singular they are declined 
as follows :—

and are declined like porta; as, grammatica, BeOenar S misica, 
music; rhétorica, rhetoric. 
2. Some other peculiarities occur, especially in poetry.

Peculiarities of Inflection in the Second Declension. 
25. 1. Proper names in -ius regularly form the Genitive Singular 
in -I (instead of -iI), and the Vocative Singular in -I (for -ie); as, 
Vergili, of Virgil, or O Virgil (instead of Vergilii, Vergilie). In 
such words the accent stands upon the penult, even though that be 
short. Nouns in -ajus, -ejus form the Gen. in -aI, -eI, as Pompejus, 
Pompei. 
2. Nouns in -ius and -ium, until after the beginning of the reign 
of Augustus (31 B.C.), regularly formed the Genitive Singular in -i 
(instead of -iT) ; as, — 
   
-P-A-G-E-25

3. Filius forms the Vocative Singular in -I (for -ie); véz. fili, 
O son! : 
4. Deus, god, lacks the Vocative Singular. The Plural is inflected 
as follows : — Nom. ai (dei) 
Gen. dedrum (deum) 
Dat. dis (deis) 
Acc. deds 
Voc. di (dei) 
Abul. dis (deis) 
5. The Locative Singular ends in -1; as, Corinthi, a¢ Corinth. 
6. The Genitive Plural has -um, instead of -6rum, — 
a) in words denoting money and measure; as, talentum, of 
talents; modium, of pecks; séstertium, of sesterces. 
6) in duumvir, triumvir, decemvir; as, duumvirum. 
¢) sometimes in other words; as, liberum, of the children; 
socium, of the allies.

III. Consonant-Stems that have partially adapted themselves 
to the Inflection of 7-Stems. 
40. Many Consonant-Stems have so far adapted them- 
selves to the inflection of i-stems as to take -ium in the 
Genitive Plural, and -is in the Accusative Plural. Their 
true character as Consonant-Stems, however, is shown by 
the fact that they never take -im in the Accusative Singu- 
lar, or in the Ablative Singular. The following words 
are examples of this class : —

  Peculiarities of Nouns of the Fourth Declension.    
       
  49. 1. Nouns in -us, particularly in early Latin, often form the 
Genitive Singular in -i, following the analogy of nouns fn -us of the 
Second Declension; as, senati, Grnati. This is usually the case in 
Plautus and Terence. 
2. Nouns in -us sometimes have -i in the Dative Singular, instead 
of -ui ; as, friictii (for frictui). 
3. The ending -ubus, instead of -ibus, occurs in the Dative and 
Ablative Plural of artiis (Plural), “mds; tribus, tribe; and in dis- 
syllables in -cus ; as, artubus, tribubus, arcubus, lacubus. But 
with the exception of tribus, all these words admit the forms in -ibus 
as well as those in -ubus. 
4. Domus, house, is declined according to the Fourth Declension, 
but has also the following forms of the Second : —                  
            
     
domi (locative), a¢ home; domum, homewards, to one’s home ; 
domé, from home; dom6s, homewards, to their (etc.) homes.

Peculiarities of Nouns of the Fifth Declension. 
52. 1. The ending of the Genitive and Dative Singular is -éi, 
instead of -€%, when a consonant precedes; as, sp&i, ri, fid&i. 
2. A Genitive ending -i (for -&1) is found in plébi (from plébés = 
plébs) in the expressions tribiinus plébi, tribune of the people, and 
plébi scitum, decree of the people ; sometimes also in other words. 
3- A Genitive and Dative form in -6 sometimes occurs; as, acié.

mentioned below in § 70. 1, all Adjectives of the Third 
Declension follow the inflection of i-stems; 7.2. they have 
the Ablative Singular in -i, the Genitive Plural in -ium, the 
Accusative Plural in -is (as well as -és) in the Masculine 
and Feminine, and the Nominative and Accusative Plural 
in -ia in Neuters.

2. Celer, celeris, celere, swift, retains the e before r, but lacks 
the Genitive Plural. 
3. In the Nominative Singular of Adjectives of this class the Femi- 
nine form is sometimes used for the Masculine. This is regularly true 
of saliibris, silvestris, and terrestris. In case of the other words 
in the list, the use of the Feminine for the Masculine is confined chiefly 
to early and late Latin, and to poetry.

1. It will be observed that vetus is declined as a pure Consonant- 
Stem; ze. Ablative Singular in -e, Genitive Plural in -um, Nominative 
Plural Neuter in -a, and Accusative Plural Masculine and Feminine in 
-6s only. In the same way are declined compos, controlling ; dives, 
rich; particeps, sharing; pauper, poor; princeps, chzef; sdspes, 
safe; superstes, surviving. Yet dives always has Neut. Plu. ditia. 
2. Inops, weedy, and memor, mindful, have Ablative Singular 
inopi, memori, but Genitive Plural inopum, memorum. 
3. Participles in -ans and -éns follow the declension of i-stems. 
But they do not have -i in the Ablative, except when employed as adjec- 
tives; when used as participles or as substantives, they have -e; as, — 
A sapienti vir6, dy a wise man; but 
a sapiente, dy a philosopher ; 
Tarquini6 régnante, under the reign of Tarquin. 
4. Plis, in the Singular, is always a noun. 
5. In the Ablative Singular, adjectives, when used as substantives, — 
@) usually retain the adjective declension ; as, — 
aequalis, contemporary, Abl. aequali 
cénsularis, exconsul,  Abl. cdnsul: 
  So names of Months; as, Aprili, 4fri/; Decembri, De- 
cember. 
6) But adjectives used as proper names have -e in the Ablative 
Singular; as, Celere, Celery ; Juvenile, /uvenal.

       Inflections. 
    c) Patrials in -As, -Atis and -is, -Itis, when designating places, 
regularly have -1; as, in Arpinati, ov the estate at Arpinum; 
yet -e, when used of persons; as, ab Arpinate, dy an Arpi- 
       natian.     
6. A very few indeclinable adjectives occur, the chief of which are 
friigi, frugal; néquam, worthless. 
7. In poetry, adjectives and participles in -ns sometimes form the 
Gen. Plu. in -um instead of -ium; as, venientum, of those coming. 
      
       
       COMPARISON ,OF ADJECTIVES. 
  71. 1. There are three degrees of Comparison, — the 
Positive, the Comparative, and the Superlative. 
2. The Comparative is regularly formed by adding -ior 
(Neut. -ius), and the Superlative by adding -issimus (-a, -um), 
to the Stem of the Positive deprived of its final vowel ; as, — 
| highest,             
      
        
       
     altus, high, altior, higher, altissimus, 4 : perenne eee > very high. 
fortis, drave, fortior, fortissimus. 
félix, fortunate, félicior, félicissimus.        So also Participles, when used as Adjectives; as, — 
     
  doctus, earned, doctior, doctissimus. 
egéns, eedy, egentior, egentissimus. 
    3- Adjectives in -er form the Superlative by appending -rimus to 
the Nominative of the Positive. The Comparative is regular. Thus: —    asper, rough, asperior, asperrimus. 
pulcher, deautiful, pulchrior, pulcherrimus. 
acer, sharp, acrior, acerrimus. 
celer, swift, celerior, celerrimus. 
a. Notice matirus, matirior, matirissimus or matirrimus. 
4. Five Adjectives in -ilis form the Superlative by adding -limus to 
the Stem of the Positive deprived of its final vowel. The Comparative 
is regular. Thus :— 
facilis, easy , facilior, facillimus. 
difficilis, difficult, difficilior, difficillimus. 
similis, /ike, similior, simillimus. 
dissimilis, z#dike,  dissimilior, dissimillimus. 
humilis, ow, humilior, humillimus.

5. Adjectives in -dicus, -ficus, and -volus form the Comparative 
and Superlative as though from forms in -dicéns, -ficéns, -voléns. 
Thus : — 
maledicus, slanderous, maledicentior, maledicentissimus. 
magnificus, magnificent, magnificentior, magnificentissimus. 
benevolus, £zxdly, benevolentior, benevolentissimus. 
a. Positives in -dicéns and -voléns occur in early Latin; as, 
maledicéns, benevoléns. 
6. Dives has the Comparative divitior or ditior ; Superlative divi- 
tissimus or ditissimus. 
Irregular Comparison. 
72. Several Adjectives vary the Stem in Comparison ; 
    bonus, good, melior, optimus.

parvus, sall, minor, minimus. 
magnus, /arge, maximus. 
multus, ch, plirimus.

a. The Superlative is lacking also in many adjectives in -Alis, 
-Ilis, -ilis, -bilis, and in a few others. 
Comparison by Magis and Maxime. 
74. Many adjectives do not admit terminational compar 
ison, but form the Comparative and Superlative degrees by 
prefixing magis (sore) and maximé (7o0s¢). Here belong — 
1. Many adjectives ending in -alis, -dris, -idus, -ilis, -icus, imus, 
Inus, -6rus. 
2. Adjectives in -us, preceded by a vowel; as, idGneus, adapted: 
arduus, steep; necessarius, necessary. 
a. Adjectives in -quus, of course, do not come under this rule. 
The first u in such cases is not a vowel, but a consonant. 
1 Supplied by vetustior, from vetustus, 
2 Supplied by recentior. 
8 For newest, recentissimus is used. 
4 Supplied by minimus nati. 
5 Supplied by maximus nati.

not admit of comparison; as, hodiernus, of ¢o-day; annuus, annual; 
mortalis, mortal. 
2. Some special words ; as, mirus, gnarus, merus; and a few 
others. 
FORMATION AND COMPARISON OF ADVERBS. 
76. Adverbs are for the most part derived from adjec- 
tives, and depend upon them for their comparison. 
1. Adverbs derived from adjectives of the First and 
Second Declensions form the Positive by changing -i of 
the Genitive Singular to -€; those derived from adjectives 
of the Third Declension, by changing -is of the Genitive 
Singular to -iter ; as, — 
carus, caré, dearly; 
pulcher, pulchré, deautifullys 
acer, acriter, fiercely $ 
levis, leviter, Zightly. 
a. But Adjectives in -ns, and a few others, add -ter (instead 
of -iter), to form the Adverb; as, — 
sapiéns, sapienter, wesely ; 
audax, audacter, doldly; 
sollers,  sollerter, skz//fully, 
2. The Comparative of all Adverbs regularly consists of the Accu- 
sative Singular Neuter of the Comparative of the Adjective; while the 
Superlative of the Adverb is formed by changing the -I of the Genitive 
Singular of the Superlative of the Adjective to -€. Thus— 
(carus) caré, dearly, carius, cirissimé. 
(pulcher) pulchré, deautifully, . pulchrius, pulcherrimé. 
(acer) acriter, fiercely, acrius, acerrimé. 
(levis) leviter, Lightly, levius, levissimé. 
(sapiéns)  sapienter, wzsely, sapientius, _sapientissimé. 
(audax) audacter, do/dly, audacius, audacissimé.

continud, zmediately ; subitd, suddenly 5 
raré, rarely ; and a few others. 
a. cito, guickly, has -5. 
3. A few adjectives employ the Accusative Singular Neuter as the 
Positive of the Adverb; as, — 
facile, easily. multum, much 3 paulum, /it¢/e ; 
4. A few adjectives of the First and Second Declensions form the 
Positive in -iter; as, — 
hiimanus, hiimaniter, humanly; 
alius, aliter, otherwise. firmus, firmiter, firmly ; 
largus, largiter, copiously 3 
a. violentus has violenter, 
5. Various other adverbial suffixes occur, the most important of 
which are -tus and -tim; as, antiquitus, amciently; paulatim,

5. Mille is regularly an adjective in the Singular, and indeclinable. 
In the Plural it is a substantive (followed by the Genitive of the objects 
enumerated ; § 201. 1), and is declined, — 
Nom. milia Acc. milia 
Gen. milium Voc. milia 
Dat. milibus Abi. milibus

Numerals. 47 
Thus mille hominés, @ thousand men; but duo milia hominum, 
two thousand men, literally two thousands of men. 
a. Occasionally the Singular admits the Genitive construction ; 
as, mille hominum. 
6. Other Cardinals are indeclinable. Ordinals and Distributives 
are declined like Adjectives of the First and Second Declensions. 
Peculiarities in the Use of Numerals. 
81. 1. The compounds from 21 to 99 may be expressed either with 
the larger or the smaller numeral first. In the latter case, et is used, 
Thus : — triginta sex or sex et triginta, ¢hirty-six. 
2. The numerals under go, ending in 8 and 9, are often expressed 
by subtraction ; as, — 
duodéviginti, e/ghtcen (but also octé6decim) ; 
Undéquadraginta, ¢hirty-nzne (but also triginta novem or novem 
et triginta). 
3. Compounds over too regularly have the largest number first; 
the others follow without et; as, — 
centum viginti septem, one hundred and twenty-seven. 
anno octingentésim6 octégésim6 secunds, iz the year 882. 
  Yet et/may be inserted where the smaller number is either a digit or 
one of the tens; as, — 
centum et septem, one hundred and seven 3 
centum et quadraginta, ove hundred and forty. 
4. The Distributives are used — 
a) To denote so many cach, so many apiece 3 as,— 
bina talenta eis dedit, he gave them two talents each. 
5) When those nouns that are ordinarily Plural in form, but 
Singular in meaning, are employed in a Plural sense; as, — 
binae litterae, two epistles. 
3ut in such cases, tini (not singuli) is regularly employed 
for one, and trini (not ternt) for zhree ; as, — 
iinae litterae, ove efistle; trinae litterae, three epistles. 
¢) In multiplication; as, — 
bis bina sunt quattuor, twice two are four. 
d@) Often in poetry, instead of the cardinals; as, — 
bina hastilia, two spears.

in which they stand; like mysedf, yourself, in ‘J see myself, . 
etc. They are declined as follows : — 
      First Person. Second Person. Third Person. 
Supplied by oblique Supplied by oblique 
cases of ego. cases of ti. 
Gen. mel, of myself tui, of thyself sui 
Dat. mihi, to myself tibi, Zo thyself sibit 
Acc. mé, myself té, thyself sé or sésé 
Voc. 
Abl. me, with myself, etc. 8, with thyself, etc. Sé or sésé 
1. The Reflexive of the Third Person serves for al genders and for 
both numbers. Thus sui may mean, of himself, herself, itself, or of 
themselves ; and so with the other forms. 
2. All of the Reflexive Pronouns have at times a reciprocal force ; 
as, — d inter sé pugnant, ¢hey fight with each other. 
3- In early Latin, sd occurs as Accusative and Ablative. 
III. POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS. 
86. These are strictly adjectives of the First and Second 
Declensions, and are inflected as such. They are— 
First Person. Second Person. 
meus, -a, -um, my ; tuus, -a, -um, Zhy ; 
noster, nostra, nostrum, our ; vester, vestra, vestrum, your ; 
Third Person. 
suus, -a, -um, 47s, her, its, their. 
1. Suus is exclusively Reflexive; as,— 
pater liberds suds amat, the father loves his children. 
Otherwise, 42s, her, its are regularly expressed by the Genitive Singular 
of is, véz. ejus; and ¢heir, by the Genitive Plural, e6rum, earum. 
  
1 The final i is sometimes long in poetry.

50 Inflections. y The Vocative Singular Masculine of meus is mi. 
3. The enclitic -pte may be joined to the Ablative Singular of the 
Possessive Pronouns for the purpose of emphasis. This is particularly 
common in case of su6, sud; as, su6dpte, suapte. 
IV. DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS. 
87. These point out an object as here or there, or as 
previously mentioned. They are   
hic, ¢iis (where I am) ; 
iste, ‘iat (where you are) ; 
ille, that (something distinct from the speaker) ; 
is, that (weaker than ille) ; 
idem, ¢he same. 
Hic, iste, and ille are accordingly the Demonstratives of the First, 
Second, and Third Persons respectively. 
Hic, ¢his.

2. qui, what? what kind of? is declined precisely like the Rela- 
tive Pronoun; vz. qui, quae, quod, éfc. 
a. An old Ablative qui occurs, in the sense of how ? 
b. Qui is sometimes used for quis in Indirect Questions. 
¢. Quis, when limiting words denoting persons, is sometimes 
an adjective. But in such cases quis hom6 = what man? 
whereas qui hom6 = what sort of a man ? 
d. Quis and qui may be strengthened by adding-nam. Thus:— 
Substantive. quisnam, who, pray? quidnam, what, pray ? 
Adjective. quinam,quaenam, quodnam, of what kind, pray ?

     Indefinite Pronouns. — Pronominal Adjectives. 53 
1. In the Indefinite Pronouns, only the pronominal part is declined. 
Thus: Genitive Singular aliciijus, ciijuslibet, ec. 
2. Note that aliqui has aliqua in the Nominative Singular Femi- 
nine, also in the Nominative and Accusative Plural Neuter. Qui has 
both qua and quae in these same cases. 
3. Quidam forms Accusative Singular quendam, quandam ; Geni- 
tive Plural quérundam, quarundam; the m being assimilated to n 
before 4. 
4, Aliquis may be used adjectively, and (occasionally) aliqui sub- 
stantively. 
5- In combination with né, si, nisi, num, either quis or qui may 
stand as a Substantive. Thus: si quis or si qui. 
6. Ecquis, azy one, though strictly an Indefinite, generally has 
interrogative force. It has both substantive and adjective forms, — 
substantive, ecquis, ecquid; adjective, ecqui, ecquae and ecqua, 
ecquod. 
7. Quisquam is not used in the Plural. 
8. There are two Indefinite Relatives, — quicumque and quisquis, 
whoever. Quicumque declines only the first part; quisquis declines 
both, but has only quisquis, quidquid, qu6qu6 in common use. 
                        
        PRONOMINAL ADJECTIVES. 
92. The following adjectives, also, frequently have pro- 
nominal force :— 
1. alius, another ; alter, the other ; 
uter, which of two? (interr.); neuter, nezther ; 
whichever of two (rel.) ; 
ainus, one; niillus, o ove (in oblique cases). 
2. The compounds, — 
uterque, utraque, utrumque, cach of two; 
utercumque, utracumque, utrumcumque, whoever of two ; 
uterlibet, utralibet, utrumlibet, either one you please ; 
utervis, utravis, utrumvis, either one you please; 
alteruter, alterutra, alterutrum, the one or the other. 
In these, uter alone is declined. The rest of the word remains 
unchanged, except in case of alteruter, which may decline both parts; 
as, — 
Vom. alteruter altera utra alterum utrum 
Gen. alterius utrius  eé/c.

VERB-STEMS. 
97. Conjugation consists in appending certain endings 
to the Stem. We distinguish three different stems in a 
fully inflected verb, —

placére, please; placitus, having pleased, agreeable. 
prandére, lunch; pransus, having lunched. 
potare, drink ; potus, having drunk.

the Active Voice; viz. — 
revertor, reverti (Inf.), reverti (Perf.), to return. 
dévertor, déverti (Inf.), déverti (Perf.), to turn aside. 
PERIPHRASTIC CONJUGATION.

bining the Future Active Participle with the auxiliary sum, 
the Passive by combining the Gerundive with the same 
auxiliary.

PECULIARITIES OF CONJUGATION. 
116. 1. Perfects in -avi, -évi, and -ivi, with the forms derived 
from them, often drop the ve or vi before endings beginning with r or 
s. So also n6vi (from néscd) and the compounds of mévi (from 
moved). Thus: —    
amavisti amasti délévisti délésti 
amavisse amasse délévisse délésse 
amavérunt amarunt délévérunt délérunt 
amaverim amarim déléverim délérim 
amaveram amaram déléveram déléram 
amavero amaro délévers déléra 
novisti nosti noverim noérim 
novisse nosse noveram noram 
audivisti audisti audivisse audisse         
-P-A-G-E-88
80 Inflections. 
2. In the Gerund and Gerundive of the Third and Fourth Conju- 
gations, the endings -undus, -undi, often occur instead of -endus and 
-endi, as faciundus, faciundi. 
3. Dic6, diicd, facid, form the Imperatives, dic, diic, fac. But 
compounds of faciS form the Imperative in -fice, as c6nfice. Com- 
pounds of dic6, dics, accent the ultima; as, 6dfic, dic. 
4. Archaic and Poetic forms : — 
a. The ending -ier in the Present Infinitive Passive; as, 
amarier, monérier, dicier, for amari, monéri, dici. 
6. The ending -Ibam for -iébam in Imperfects of the Fourth 
Conjugation, and -ib6 for -iam in Futures; as, scibam, 
scib6, for sciébam, sciam. 
Instead of the fuller forms, in such words as dixisti, scrip- 
sistis, surréxisse, we sometimes find dixti, scripstis, 
surréxe, ec. 
d. The endings -im, -is, e¢c. (for -am, -as, e¢c.) occur in a few 
Subjunctive forms; as, edim (ea), duint, perduint. 
5. In the Future Active and Perfect Passive Infinitive, the auxil- 
iary esse is often omitted; as, Actiirum for actiirum esse; éjectus 
for 6jectus esse. 
FORMATION OF THE VERB STEMS. 
Formation of the Present Stem. 
117. Many verbs employ the Verb Stem for the Present 
Stem ;1 as, dicere, diicere, amare, monére, audire. Others 
form the Present Stem variously, as follows : — 
1. By appending the vowels, 4, 6,1; as, — 
juvare, Present Stem juva- (Verb Stem juv-). 
augére, s “ augé- ( “ “  aug-). 
vincire, ae «  vincl- ( “ “  vinc-). 
2. By adding i, as capid, Present Stem capi- (Verb Stem cap-). 
3- By the insertion of n (m before labial-mutes) before the final con- 
sonant of the Verb Stem; as, fund6 (Stem fud-), rumpé (Stem rup-). 
4. By appending -n to the Verb Stem; as, — 
cern-6 pell-6 (for pel-nd). 
  
1 Sfrictly speaking, the Present Stem always ends in a Thematic Vowel (8 or 
5); as, dic-8-, dic-6-; am&-8-, am4-3-, But the multitude of phonetic changes 
involved prevents a scientific treatment of the subject here. See the Author's Latin 
Language. 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  Formation of the Verb Stems. 81 
5. By appending t to the Verb Stem; as, — 
flect-6. 
6. By appending sc to the Verb Stem; as, — 
crésc-6, scisc-6. 
  7. By Reduplication, that is, by prefixing the initial consonant of 
the Verb Stem with i; as, — 
gi-gn-6 (root gen-), si-st-6 (root sta-). 
Formation of the Perfect Stem. 
118. The Perfect Stem is formed from the Verb Stem— 
1. By adding v (in case of Vowel Stems) ; as,— 
amav-i, délév-i, audiv-ti. 
2. By adding u (in case of some Consonant Stems) ; as, — 
strepu-i, genu-i, alu-i. 
3. By adding s (in case of most Consbnant Stems) ; as, — 
carp-6, Perfect carps-i. 
scrib-6, “ — scrips-i (for scrib-si). 
rid-ed, “ ris-T (for rid-si). 
sent-id, “ séns-I (for sent-si). 
dicd, “ dix-i (ae. dic-si). 
a. Note that before the ending -si a Dental Mute (t, d) is 
lost; a Guttural Mute (c, g) unites with s to form x; while 
the Labial b is changed to p. 
4. Without addition. Of this formation there are three types : — 
@) The Verb Stem is reduplicated by prefixing the initial con- 
sonant with the following vowel or e; as, — 
curr6é, Perfect cu-curri, 
pose6, “ po-posci. 
pells, & pe-puli. 
NOTE r.— Compounds, with the exception of d6, st, sist6, discd, poscd, 
omit the reduplication. Thus: com-puli, but re-poposci. 
NOTE 2.— Verbs beginning with sp or st retain both consonants in the redu- 
plication, but drop s from the stem; as, sponded, spo-pondi; st6, steti. 
4) The short vowel of the Verb Stem is lengthened; as, lego, 
légi; agé, gi. Note that 4 by this process becomes 6. 
¢) The vowel of the Verb Stem is unchanged; as, vert6, 
verti; minu6, minui.

82 Inflections. 
Formation of the Participial Stem. 
119. The Perfect Passive Participle, from which the 
Participial Stem is derived by dropping -us, is formed : — 
1. By adding -tus (sometimes to the Present Stem, sometimes to 
the Verb Stem) ; as, — 
ama-re, Participle ama-tus. 
délé-re, a délé-tus. 
audi-re, @ audi-tus, 
leg-ere, st léc-tus. ; 
scrib-ere, “ scrip-tus. 
sentire, “ sén-sus (for sent-tus). 
caed-ere, “ cae-sus (for caed-tus). 
a. Note that g, before t, becomes ¢ (see § 8, 5); b becomes p; while 
dt or tt becomes 88, which is then often simplified to s (§ 8, 2). 
2. After the analogy of Participles like sénsus and caesus, where 
-sus arises by phonetic change, -sus for_-tus is added to other Verb 
Stems; as,— __ _ hs 
1ab-i, Participle lap-sus. 
fig-ere, “ fi-xus. 
a. The same consonant changes occur in appending this ending -sus 
to the stem as in the case of the Perfect ending -si (see § 118, 3, a). 
3. A few Verbs form the Participle in -itus; as, — 
doma-re, dom-itus. 
moné-re, mon-itus. 
4. The Future Active Participle is usually identical in its stem with 
the Perfect Passive Participle; as, am&-tiis, am&tiirus; moni-tus, 
monitirus. But— 
juva-re, Perf. Partic. jitus, has Fut. Act. Partic. juvatirus.1 
lava-re, “ “  lautus, es oy “  lavatirus. 
par-ere, “ “  partus, Saggy oa “  paritirus. 
uu-ere,; < -rutus, Se ee ¥ “  ruitirus. 
seca-re, “ «“  sectus, re 6 ss “ — secatirus.

mor-i, “ “ mortuus, “ “ “ “ moritirus. 
ori-ri, fe “«  ortus, See tat Fe “ ~ oritirus.

IRREGULAR VERBS. 
124. A number of Verbs are called Irregular. The most 
important are sum, d6, edé, fer, vold, n6l6, mal6, ed, fi. 
The peculiarity of these Verbs is that they append the 
personal endings in many forms directly to the stem, 
instead of employing a connecting vowel, as fer-s (2d 
Sing. of fer-d, instead of fer-is. They are but the relics 
of what was once in Latin a large class of Verbs. 
125. The Inflection of sum has already been given. Its various 
compounds are inflected in the same way. They are— 
absum abesse afui am absent 
Pres. Partic. abséns (absentis), absent. 
adsum adesse adfut am present 
désum deesse défut am lacking 
insum inesse infui am in 
intersum interesse interful am among 
praesum praeesse praefui am tin charge of 
Pres. Partic. praeséns (praesentis), present. 
obsum obesse obfui hinder 
prosum prédesse profui am of advantage 
subsum subesse subfui am underneath 
supersum superesse superfut am left 
NoTe.—Pr6sum is compounded of préd (earlier form of prd) and sum; 
the d disappears before consonants, as pr6sumus; but prddestis, 
126. Possum. In its Present System possum is a compound of 
pot- (for pote, ad/e) and sum; potui is from an obsolete potére. 
PRINCIPAL PARTS. 
possum, posse, potui, to be able.

139. Particles are the four Parts of Speech that do not 
admit of inflection ; vz. Adverbs, Prepositions, Conjunc- 
tions, Interjections. 
ADVERBS. 
140. Adverbs denote manner, place, time, or degree. 
Most adverbs are in origin case-forms which have become 
stereotyped by usage. The common adverbial terminations 
have already been given above (§ 76). The following 
TABLE OF CORRELATIVES is important : oe 
RELATIVE AND INTERROGATIVE. DEMONSTRATIVE. INDEFINITE,

ibi, illic, istic, there. piam, somewhere. 
quo, whither ; whither? hiic, hither. aliqu6, fo some place.

  Prepositions. 107 
PREPOSITIONS. 
141. Prepositions show relations of words. The fol- 
lowing Prepositions govern the Accusative : — 
ad, Zo. contra, against. post, after. 
adversus, against. erga, toward. praeter, past. 
adversum, foward, extra, outside. prope, ear. 
against. Infra, below. propter, oz account of. 
ante, before. inter, detween. secundum, after. 
apud, with, near. intra, within. subter, dencath. 
eirea, around. jaixta, near. super, over. 
circiter, about. ob, on account of. supra, above. 
circum, around. penes, zx the hands of. trans, across. 
cis, this side of. per, through. ultra, deyond. 
eitra, chis side of. pone, behind. versus, foward. 
1. Usque is often prefixed to ad, in the sense of even; as, — 
fisque ad urbem, even fo the city. 
2. Versus always follows its case ; as, — 
R6mam versus, foward Rome. 
It may be combined with a preceding Preposition; as, — 
ad urbem versus, foward the city. 
3. Like prope, the Comparatives propior, propius, and the Super- 
latives proximus, proximé, sometimes govern the Accusative; as,— 
Ubii proximé Rhénum incolunt, the Ubii dwell next to the Rhine ; 
propius castra hostium, zearer the camp of the enemy. 
142. The following Prepositions govern the Ablative:— 
4, ab, abs, from, by. cum, with. pro, ix front of, 
absque, without. dé, from, concerning. for. 
cGram, iz the presence 6, ex, from, out of. sine, without. 
of. prae, before. tenus, 7p Zo. 
1. A, ab, abs. Before vowels or h, ab must be used; before con- 
sonants we find sometimes 4, sometimes ab (the latter usually not 
before the labials b, p, f, v, m; nor before c, g, q, or t); abs occurs 
only before té, and a is admissible even there. 
2. HB, ex. Before vowels or h, ex must be used; before conso- 
nants, we find sometimes 6, sometimes ex.

as the lips. | 
4. Cum is appended to the Pronouns of the First and Second 
Persons, and to the Reflexive Pronoun; usually also to the Relative 
and Interrogative. Thus :— 
mécum nobiscum quocum or cum quo 
técum vobiscum quacum 97 cum qua 
sécum quibuscum oy cum quibus 
On quicum, see § 89, Footnote 1. 
143. Two Prepositions, in, 2, zzto, and sub, under, gov- 
ern both the Accusative and the Ablative. With the Ac- 
cusative they denote motion; with the Ablative, rest ; as, — 
in urbem, zfo the city ; in urbe, 2 the city. 
1. Subter and super are also occasionally construed with the 
Ablative. 
144, RELATION OF ADVERBS AND PREPOSITIONS. 
1. Prepositions were originally Adverbs, and many of them still 
retain their adverbial meaning; as, post, afterwards; ante, previ- 
ously ; contr’, on the other hand, etc. 
2. Conversely several words, usually adverbs, are occasionally 
employed as prepositions ; as, — 
clam, pridié, with the Accusative. 
procul, simul, palam, with the Ablative. 
3. Andstrophe. A Preposition sometimes follows its case. This 
is called Andstrophe ; as, — 
ei, qués inter erat, those among whom he was. 
Anastrophe occurs chiefly with dissyllabic prepositions. 
CONJUNCTIONS AND INTERJECTIONS. 
145. 1. Conjunctions are used to connect ideas. For 
Coérdinate Conjunctions, see §§ 341 ff. Subordinate Con- 
junctions are treated in connection with Subordinate Clauses. 
2. Interjections express emotion. Thus:— 
1. Surprise; as, én, ecce, 6. 
2. Joy; as, i6, euoe. 
3. Sorrow and Pain; as, heu, 6heu, vae, pré. 
4. Calling; as, heus, eho.

  Compounds. 115 
II. COMPOUNDS. 
158. 1. Compounds are formed by the union of simple 
words. The second member usually contains the essential 
meaning of the compound; the first member expresses 
some modification of this. 
2. Vowel changes often occur in the process of composition. 
Thus :— 
a. In the second member of compounds. (See § 7. 1.) 
6. The final vowel of the stem of the first, member of the com- 
pound often appears as i where we should expect 6 or 4; 
sometimes it is dropped altogether, and in case of consonant 
stems i is often inserted; as, — + 
signifer, standard-bearer ; 
tubicen, ¢rumpeter ; 
magnanimus, high-minded 3 
matricida, matricide.

SYNTAX. 
ene 
160. Syntax treats of the use of words in sentences. 
Cuarter I,— Sentences. 
CLASSIFICATION OF SENTENCES. 
161. Sentences may be classified as follows :— 
1. DECLARATIVE, which state something; as, — 
puer scribit, the boy zs writing. 
2. INTERROGATIVE, which ask a question; as, — 
quid puer scribit, what zs the boy writing ? 
3. ExcLamatory, which are in the form of an exclamation; as,— 
quot librés scribit, how many books he writes ! 
4. IMPERATIVE, which express a command or an admonition; as, — 
scribe, write ! 
FORM OF INTERROGATIVE SENTENCES. 
162. Questions may be either Word-Questions or Sen- 
tence-Questions. 
1. Word-Questions. These are introduced by the various 
interrogative pronouns and adverbs; such as— quis, qui, 
qualis, quantus, quot, quotiéns, qué, qua, ec. Thus: — 
quis venit, who comes ? 
quam diii manébit, how long will he stay? 
117 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
118 Syntax. 
2. Sentence-Questions. These are introduced — 
a) By nénne implying the answer ‘yes’ ; as, — 
n6nne vidés, do you not see? 
6) By num implying the answer ‘zo’; as, — 
num exspectas, do you expect? (2.e. you don't expect, do you ?) 
¢) By the enclitic -ne, appended to the emphatic word (which 
usually stands first), and simply asking for information; 
as, — 
vidésne, do you see? 
A question introduced by -ne may receive a special impli- 
cation from the context; as, — 
sénsistine, did you not perceive ? 
d@) Sometimes by no special word, particularly in expressions of 
surprise or indignation ; as, — 
ti in jiidicum cGnspectum venire audés, do you dare to 
come into the presence of the judges ? 
3. Rhetorical Questions. These are questions merely in 
form, being employed to express an emphatic assertion ; 
as, quis dubitat, who doubts? (= no one doubts). 
4. Double Questions. Double Questions are introduced 
by the following particles : — 
utrum ... an; 
-ne..... an} 
—....an. 
If the second member is negative, annGn (less often necne) is used. 
Examples : — 
utrum honestum est an turpe, 
honestumne est an turpe, ts it honorable or base? 
honestum est an turpe, 
suntne diann6n, ave there gods or not? 
a. Byan ellipsis of the first member, an sometimes stands alone. 
Its force depends upon the context ; as, — 
A rébus gerendis abstrahit senectiis. Quibus? An 
eis quae juventiite geruntur et viribus? Old age (it is 
alleged) withdraws men from active pursuits. From what 
pursuits? Is it not merely from those which are carried on 
by the strength of youth?
-P-A-G-E-127
  Simple and Compound Sentences. 119 
5. Answers. : 
a. The answer YEs is expressed by ita, etiam, vérd, 
sané, or by repetition of the verb; as, — 
‘visne locum mitémus?’ ‘sané.’ ‘Shall we change the 
place?’ ‘Certainly, 
‘estisne vos légati?’ ‘sumus.’ ‘Are you envoys?’ ‘ Yes. 
6. The answer No is expressed by nén, minimé, 
minimé vér6d, or by repeating the verb with a 
negative ; as, — ; 
‘jam ea praeteriit?’ ‘ndn.’ ‘Has it passed?’ ‘No, 
‘estne frater intus?’ ‘n6n est.’ ‘/s your brother within?’ 
‘No. 
SUBJECT AND PREDICATE. 
163. The two essential parts of a sentence are the Sus- 
ject and PREDICATE. 
The Supject is that concerning which something ts said, 
asked, etc. The PREDICATE is that which ts said, asked, 
etc., concerning the SUBJECT. 
SIMPLE AND COMPOUND SENTENCES. 
164. Sentences containing but one Subject and one 
Predicate are called SmmpLE SENTENCES, those containing 
more are called Compound SENTENCES. Thus puer librés 
legit, the boy reads books, is a Simple Sentence; but puer 
librdés legit et epistulas scribit, tie boy reads books and 
writes letters, is a Compound Sentence. The different 
members of a Compound Sentence are called CLAUusEs. 
165. CodrpINATE AND SUBORDINATE CLAUSES. Clauses which 
stand upon an equality are called CoOrpINATE; a Clause dependent 
upon another is called SUBORDINATE. Thus in puer librés legit et 
epistulas scribit the two clauses are Codrdinate; but in puer librés 
legit qués pater scribit, the boy reads the books which his father writes, 
the second clause is Subordinate to the first. 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
120 Syntax. 
Cuapter II.— Syntax of Nouns, 
SUBJECT. 
166. The Subject of a Finite Verb (ze. any form of 
the Indicative, Subjunctive, or Imperative) is in the Nomi- 
native Case. 
1. The Subject may be — 
a) A Noun or Pronoun; as, — 
puer scribit, ¢he boy writes; 
hic scribit, his man writes. 
4) An Infinitive; as,— 
dec6rum est pr6 patria mori, Zo die for one’s country is a 
noble thing. 
c) A Clause; as, — 
opportiiné accidit quod vénisti, 7 happened opportunely 
that you arrived. 
2. A Personal Pronoun as Subject is usually implied in the Verb, 
and is not separately expressed ; as, — 
seribé, / write; videt, he sees: 
a. But for the purpose of emphasis or contrast the Pronoun is 
expressed ; as, — 
ego scribé et tii legis, 7 write, and you read. 
3. The verb is sometimes omitted when it can be easily supplied 
from the context, especially the auxiliary sum ; as, — 
récté ille (sc. facit), he does rightly ; c6nsul profectus (sc. est), the 
consul set out. 
PREDICATE NOUNS. 
167. A PREpIcATE Nown is one connected with the Sub- 
ject by some form of the verb Sum or a similar verb. 
168. A Predicate Noun agrees with its Subject in 
Case ;! as, — 
  
1 For the Predicate Genitive see §§ 198, 3; 203, 5.
-P-A-G-E-129
  Predicate Nouns. — Appositives. 121 
Cicer6 Grator fuit, Cicero was an orator ; 
Numa creatus est réx, Vuma was elected king. 
1. When possible the Predicate Noun usually agrees with its Sub- 
ject in Gender also; as, — 
philosophia est vitae magistra, philosophy is the guide of life. 
2. Besides sum the verbs most frequently accompanied by a Predi- 
cate Noun are — 
@) f16, évad6, exsist6 ; mane6; videor; as,— 
  Croesus nén semper mansit réx, Croesus did not always 
remain king. 
6) Passive verbs of making, calling, regarding, etc.; as, creor, 
appellor, habeor; as, — 
Rémulus réx appellatus est, Romulus was called king; 
habitus est deus, he was regarded as a god. 
APPOSITIVES. 
169. 1. An Appositive is a Noun explaining or defin- 
ing another Noun denoting the same person or thing; as, — 
Cicer6 cénsul, Cicero, the Consul; 
urbs Rima, the city Rome. 
2. An Appositive agrees with its Subject in Case; as, — 
opera Cicer6nis Gratéris, the works of Cicero, the orator ; 
apud Hérodotum, patrem historiae, 77 the works of Herodotus, the 
Sather of history. 
3. When possible the Appositive agrees with its Subject in Gen- 
der also; as, — 
assentati6 adjiitrix vitidrum, flattery, the promoter of evils. 
4. A Locative may take in Apposition the Ablative of urbs or 
oppidum, with or without a preposition ; as, — 
Corinthi, urbe praeclara, or in urbe praeclara, at Corinth, a famous 
city. 
5. PARTITIVE APPOSITION. A Noun denoting a whole is frequently 
followed by an Appositive denoting a part; as, — 
milités, fortissimus quisque, hostibus restitérunt, the soldiers, all 
the bravest of them, resisted the enemy.
-P-A-G-E-130
122 Syntax. 
THE CASES. 
THE NOMINATIVE. 
170. The Nominative is confined to its use as Subject, 
Appositive, or Predicate Noun, as already explained. See 
§§ 166-169. 
THE VOCATIVE. 
171. The Vocative is the Case of direct address; as, — 
erédite mihi, jiidicés, believe me, judges. 
1. By a species of attraction, the Nominative is occasionally used 
for the Vocative, especially in poetry and formal prose; as, audi ti, 
populus Albanus, /ear ye, Alban people! 
2. Similarly the Appositive of a Vocative may, in poetry, stand in 
the Nominative; as, nate, mea magna potentia sdlus, O son, alone 
the source of my great power. 
THE ACCUSATIVE. 
172. The Accusative is the Case of the Direct Object. 
173. The Direct Object may express either of the two 
following relations : — 
A. The PERSON or TuING AFFECTED by theaction; as,— 
consulem interfécit, he slew the consul; 
legé librum, J read the book. 
B. The Resutt Propucep by the action; as, — 
librum scripsi, 7 wrote a book (7.e. produced one) ; 
templum struit, he constructs a temple. 
174. Verbs that admit a Direct Object of either of these 
two types are TRANSITIVE VERBS. 
a. Verbs that regularly take a Direct Object are sometimes used 
without it. They are then said to be employed absolutely ; 
as, — 
riimor est meum gnatum amare, 7 zs rumored that my 
son zs in love. 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  The Accusative. 123 
Accusative of the Person or Thing Affected. 
LTDSos1 This is the most frequent use of the Accu- 
sative; as in — 
parentés amamus, we love our parents ; 
mare aspicit, he gazes at the sea. 
2. The following classes of Verbs taking an Accusative of this kind 
are worthy of note: — 
a) 
2) 
¢) Many Intransitive Verbs, when compounded with a Preposi- 
tion, become Transitive. Thus :— 
1) Compounds of circum, praeter, trans; as,— 
hostés circumstare, fo surround the enemy 3 
urbem praeterire, fo pass by the city; 
mirés transcendere, ¢o climb over the walls. 
2) Less frequently, compounds of ad, per, in, sub ; as, — 
adire urbem, Zo visit the city ; 
peragrare Italiam, ¢o travel through Italy ; 
inire magistratum, fo ake office ; 
subire periculum, /o undergo danger. 
Many Verbs expressing emotions, regularly Intransitive, have 
also a Transitive use; as, — 
queror fatum, / dament my fate; 
doled ejus mortem, / grieve at his death ; 
rided tuam stultitiam, / /augh at your folly. 
So also ligeé, maere6, mourn; gem6, bemoan; horred, 
shudder, and others. 
The impersonals decet, z¢ becomes ; A€decet, zt 7s unbecom- 
ing; juvat, zt pleases, take the Accusative of the Rerson 
Affected ; as, — 
mé decet haec dicere, zt becomes me to say this. 
In poetry many Passive Verbs, in imitation of Greek usage, 
are employed as Middles (§ 256, 1; 2), and take the Ac- 
cusative as Object ; as, — 
galeam induitur, he puts on his helmet ; 
cinctus tempora hederA, having bound his temples with 
tuys 
n6d6 siniis collécta, having gathered her dress in a knot.
-P-A-G-E-132
Syntax. 
Accusative of the Result Produced. 
176. 1. The ordinary type of this Accusative is seen in 
such expressions as — 
librum scrib6, / write a book ; 
domum aedific6, / build a house. 
2. Many Verbs usually Intransitive take a Meuter Pronoun, or 
Adjective, as an Accusative of Result. Thus :— 
a) A Neuter Pronoun; as, — 
haec gemébat, he made these moans 3 
illud glorior, 7 make this boast ; 
eadem peccat, he makes the same mistakes. 
4) A Neuter Adjective, —particularly Adjectives of number or 
amount, —multum, multa, pauca, efc.; also nihil; as, — 
multa dubit6, J have many doubts ; 
pauca studet, he has few interests 3 
multum valet, he has great strength; 
nihil prégreditur, he makes no progress. 
NoTE. — In poetry other Adjectives are freely used in this construction; as, — 
minitantem vana, making vain threats ; 
acerba tuéns, giving a fierce look; 
dulce loquentem, sweetly talking. 
3. The adverbial use of several Neuter Pronouns and Adjectives 
grows out of this Accusative; as, — 
multum sunt in vénatione, ¢hey are much engaged in hunting. 
a. So also plirimum, very greatly; plérumque, generally; 
aliquid, somewhat; quid, why? nihil, not at all; etc. 
4. Sometimes an Intransitive Verb takes an Accusative of Result 
which is of kindred etymology with the Verb. This is called a Coc 
NATE ACCUSATIVE, and is usually modified by an Adjective ; as, — 
sempiternam servitiitem serviat, /et him serve an everlasting slavery ; 
vitam diiram vixi, / have lived a hard life. 
a. Sometimes the Cognate Accusative is not of kindred ety: 
mology, but merely of kindred meaning; as, — 
stadium currit, he runs a race; 
Olympia vincit, he wins an Olympic victory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  The Accusative. 125 
5. The Accusative of Result occurs also after Verbs of tasting and 
smelling ; as, — 
piscis mare sapit, the fish tastes of the sea; 
GratiGnés antiquitatem redolent, the speeches smack of the past. 
Two Accusatives— Direct Object and Predicate Accusative. 
177.11. Many Verbs of Making, Choosing, Calling, 
Showing, and the like, take two Accusatives, one of the 
Person or Thing Affected, the other a Predicate Accusa- 
tive; as, — ct : mé hérédem fécit, he made me heir. 
Here mé is Direct Object, hérédem Predicate Accusative. 
So also — 
eum jiidicem cépére, they took him as judge; 
urbem R6mam vocavit, he called the city Rome; 
sé virum praestitit, he showed himself a man. 
2. The Predicate Accusative may be an Adjective as well as a 
Noun; as, — 
hominés caecGés reddit cupiditas, covetousness renders men blind; 
Apollé Sécratem sapientissimum jidicavit, Apollo adjudged Soc- 
rates the wisest man. 
a. Some Verbs, as redd6, usually admit only an Adjective as the Predi- 
; cate Accusative. 
3. In the Passive the Direct Object becomes the Subject, and the 
Predicate Accusative becomes Predicate Nominative (§ 168. 2.4) ; as, — 
urbs Roma vocata est, the city was called Rome. 
a, Notall Verbs admit the Passive constrrction; redd6 and effici6, for 
example, never take it. 
Two Accusatives— Person and Thing. 
178. 1. Some Verbs take two Accusatives, one of 
the Person Affected, the other of the Result Produced. 
Thus :— 
a) Verbs of requesting and demanding, as,— 
Otium divs rogat, he asks the gods for rest ; 
mé duds Grati6nés postulas, you demand two speeches of 
Me. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
126 Syntax. 
So also 6r6, posed, reposc6, exposed, flagitd, though 
some of these prefer the Ablative with ab to the Accusative 
of the Person; as, — 
opem 4 té posed, / demand aid of you. 
4) Verbs of teaching (doced and its compounds) ; as, — 
té litteras doces, / teach you your letters. 
¢) Verbs of zxguzring ; as, — 
té haec rogé, / ask you this ; 
té sententiam rog6, / ask you your opinion. 
d) Several Special Verbs; vz. moned, admone6, commoned, 
c6gé, acctisé, argué, and a few others.. These admit only 
a Neuter Pronoun or Adjective as Accusative of the Thing; 
as, — 
té haec moneé, J give you this advice ; 
mé id acciisas, you bring this accusation against me ; 
id cédgit nés natira, nature compels us (to) this. 
é) One Verb of concealing, c&16 ; as, — 
non té célavi serménem, / have not concealed the conver- 
sation from you. 
2. In the Passive construction the Accusative of the Person be- 
comes the Subject, and the Accusative of the Thing is retained; as, — 
omnés artés édoctus est, he was taught all accomplishments ; 
rogatus sum sententiam, / was asked my opinion ; 
aliquid admonémur, we are given some admonition. 
a, Only a few Verbs admit the Passive construction. 
Two Accusatives with Compounds. 
179. 1. Transitive compounds of trans may take two 
Accusatives, one dependent upon the Verb, the other 
upon the Preposition; as, — 
milités flimen tradiicit, he leads his soldiers across the river. 
2. With other compounds this construction is rare. 
3. In the Passive the Accusative dependent upon the preposition is 
retained ; as, — 
milités flimen tradiicébantur, the soldiers were led across the river- 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  
The Accusative. ; 127 
Synecdochical (or Greek) Accusative. 
180. 1. The Synecdochical (or Greek) Accusative denotes the part 
to which an action or quality refers; as, — 
tremit artis, literally, 4e treméles as to his limbs, i.e. his limbs tremble; 
niida gent, lit. dare as to the knee, i.e. with knee bare; 
mantis revinctus, lit. tied as to the hands, i.e. with hands tied. 
2. Note that this construction — 
a) Is borrowed from the Greek. 
6) Is chiefly confined to poetry. 
¢) Usually refers to a part of the body. 
d) Is used with Adjectives as well as Verbs. 
Accusative of Time and Space. 
181. 1. Duration of Time and Extent of Space are de- 
noted by the Accusative ; as, — 
quadraginta ann6s vixit, he lived forty years ; 
hic locus passiis sescent6s aberat, this place was six hundred paces © 
away. 
arborés quinquaginta pedés altae, frees fifty feet high. 
abhinc septem ann6s, seven years ago. 
2. Emphasis is sometimes added by using the Preposition per; as, 
per biennium labéravi, J oiled throughout two years. 
Accusative of Limit of Motion. 
182. 1. The Accusative of Limit of Motion is used — 
@) With names of Towns, Small Islands, and Peninsulas ; as,— 
Romam véni, / came to Rome ; 
Athénas proficiscitur, he sets out for Athens ; 
Délum pervéni, / arrived at Delos. 
4) With domum, domés, riis ; as,— 
domum revertitur, he returns home ; 
riis 1b6, / shall go to the country. 
Note.—When domus means House (z.e. building), it takes a prep- 
osition ; as,— 
in domum veterem remigrare, ¢o move back to an old house. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  128 Syntax. 
2. Other designations of place than those above mentioned require 
a Preposition to denote Limit of Motion; as,— 
ad Italiam vénit, he came to /taly. 
a. The Preposition is also customary with the Accusatives 
urbem or oppidum when they stand in apposition with 
the name of a town; as, — 
Cirtam in urbem, /o the city Cirta; 
Genavam ad oppidum, /o the town Geneva. 
b. The name of a town denoting limit of motion may be com- 
bined with the name of a country or other word dependent 
upon a preposition ; as, — 
Thirids in Italiam pervectus, carried to Thurit in Italy; 
cum Acén ad exercitum vénisset, when he had come to 
the army at Ace. 
3. To denote toward, to the vicinity of, in the vicinity of, ad is 
used; as, — 
ad Tarentum véni, / came to the vicinity of Tarentum; 
ad Cannas pugna facta est, a battle was fought near Cannae. 
4. In poetry the Accusative of any noun denoting a place may be 
used without a preposition to express the limit of motion; as,— 
Italiam vénit, he came to Italy. 
5. The goal notion seems to represent the original function of the 
Accusative Case. Traces of this primitive force are recognizable in 
the phrase infitias ire, Zo deny (lit. to go to a denial), and a few other 
similar expressions. 
Accusative in Exclamations. 
183. The Accusative, generally modified by an Adjec- 
tive, is used in Exclamations; as, — 
mé miserum, ah, wretched me! 
O fallacem spem, of, deceptive hope! 
Accusative as Subject of the Infinitive. 
184. The Subject of the Infinitive is put in the Accusa- 
tive; as, — 
vided hominem abire, / see that the man is going away.
-P-A-G-E-137
The Accusative.— The Dative. 129 
Other Uses of the Accusative. 
185. Here belong — 
1. Some Accusatives which were originally Appositives.; vzz.— 
id genus, of that kind ; as, hominés id genus, men of that kind 
(originally hominés, id genus hominum, men, that kind 
of men) 3 
virile secus, muliebre secus, of the male sex, of the female sex ; 
meam vicem, tuam vicem, ¢éc., for my part, etc. ; 
bonam partem, magnam partem, 7x large part; 
maximam partem, for the most part. 
2. Some phrases of doubtful origin ; as, — 
id temporis, at that time; quod si, but if; 
id aetatis, at that time; c&tera, 77 other respects. 
THE DATIVE. 
186. The Dative case in general expresses relations 
which are designated in English by the prepositions to 
and for. 
Dative of Indirect Object. 
187. The commonest use of the Dative is to denote the 
person ¢o whom something is given, satd, or done. Thus:— 
I. With transitive verbs in connection with the Accu- 
sative ; as, — 
hance peciiniam mihi dat, he gives me this money ; 
haec nobis dixit, he said this to us. 
a. Some verbs which take this construction (particularly 
d6n6 and circumdé) admit also the Accusative of the 
person along with the Ablative of the thing. Thus:— 
Either Themistocli miinera dénavit, he presented gifts to 
Themistocles, or 
Themistoclem miineribus d6navit, he presented Themis- 
tocles with gifts ; 
urbi ey cireumdat, he buclds walls around the city, or 
urbemana eciroumdat, Jes surrounds the city with walls. 
Ai J. WOODFIN, Ag   jJent 
=RICAN 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
130 Syntax. 
II. With many intransitive verbs; as, — 
nulli lab6ri cédit, 4e yields to no labor. 
a. Here belong many verbs signifying favor, help, injure, 
please, displease, trust, distrust, command, obey, serve, resist, 
indulge, spare, pardon, envy, threaten, be angry, believe, 
persuade, and the like; as, — 
Caesar popularibus favet, Caesar Savors (i.e. is favor- 
able to) the popular party ; i 
amicis cénfid6, / trust (to) my friends ; 
Orgetorix Helvétiis persuadsit, Orgetorix persuaded 
(made it acceptable to) the Helvetians ; 
+ bonis nocet qui malis parcit, he injures (does harm to) 
the good, who spares the bad. 
NOTE. — It is to be borne in mind that these verbs do not take the Dative by 
virtue of their apparent English equivalence, but simply because they are intransi- 
tive, and adapted to an indirect object. Some verbs of the same apparent English 
equivalence are ¢ransztive and govern the Accusative; as, juv6, laedd, délecté. 
Thus: audentés deus juvat, God helps the bold; néminem laesit, re 
injured no one. 
4. Verbs of this class are used in the passive only impersonally ; 
as, — 
tibi parcitur, you are spared ; 
mihi persuadétur, / am being persuaded; 
eI invidétur, he 7s envied. 
c. Some of the foregoing verbs admit also a Direct Object in connection 
with the Dative; as, — 
mihi mortem minita&tur, he threatens me with death (threatens 
death to me). ss 
III. With many verbs compounded with the preposi- 
tions: ad, ante, circum, com-,? in, inter, ob, post, prae, pré, 
sub, super. 
These verbs fall into two main classes, — 
1. Many simple verbs which cannot take a Dative of the indirect 
object become capable of doing so when compounded with a preposi- 
tion ; as, — 
afflictis succurrit, he helps the afflicted ; 
exercitul praefuit, he was in command of the army 3 
intersum c6nsiliis, / share in the deliberations. 
     1 Many such verbs were originally intransitive in English also, and once governed 
the Dative. 2This was the original form of the preposition cum, 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  The Dative. 131 
2. Many transitive verbs which take only a direct object become 
capable, when compounded, of taking a Dative also as indirect 
object; as, — 
peciiniae pudérem anteponit, he puts honor before money; 
inicere spem amicis, fo imsPire hope in one’s friends ; 
Labiénum exercitui praefécit, he put Labienus in charge of the 
army. 
Dative of Reference. 
188. 1. The Dative of Reference denotes the person Zo 
whom a statement refers, of whom it ts true, or to whom tt 
zs of interest ; as, — 
mihi ante oculds versaris, you hover before my eyes (lit. hover before 
the eyes to me); 
illl sevéritas amdrem nin déminuit, zw his case severity did not 
diminish love (lit. to him severity did not diminish); 
intercliidere hostibus commeatum, #0 cut off the supplies of the 
enemy. 
a, Note the phrase alicui interdicere aqua et igni, /o interdict one 
from fire and water. 
Nore.—The Dative of Reference, unlike the Dative of Indirect Object, does 
not modify the verb, but rather the sentence as-a fvhole. It is often used where, 
according to the English idiom, we should expect a Genitive; so in the first and 
third of the above examples. 
2. Special varieties of the Dative of Reference are— 
a) Dative of the Local Standpoint. This is regularly a 
participle; as, — 
oppidum primum Thessaliae venientibus ab Epiré, the 
Jirst town of Thessaly as you come from Epirus (lit. 
to those coming from Epirus). 
6) Ethical Dative. This name is given to those Dative con- 
structions of the personal pronouns in which the connection 
of the Dative with the rest of the sentence is of the very 
slightest sort; as, — 
ti mihi istius audaciam défendis? ‘e// me, do you defend 
that man’s audacity ? 
quid mihi Celsus agit? what ts my Celsus doing? 
quid sibi vult? what does he mean? (lit. wish for him- 
self 2)
-P-A-G-E-140
132 Syntax. 
c) Dative of Person Judging; as, — 
erit ille mihi semper deus, /e will always be a god to me 
(z.e. in my opinion) ; 
quae ista servitiis tam claré6 homini, ow can that be 
slavery to so illustrious a man (z.e. to his mind) ! 
d@) Dative of Separation. Some verbs of taking away, 
especially compounds of ab, dé, ex, ad, govern a Dative of 
the person, less often of the thing; as,— 
honG6rem détraxérunt hominti, ‘hey took away the honor 
Srom the man; 
Caesar régi tetrarchiam éripuit, Caesar took the tetrarchy 
away from the king; 
silici scintillam excidit, he struck a spark from the flint. 
Dative of Agency. 
189. The Dative is used to denote agency — 
1. Regularly with the Gerundive; as, — 
haec noébis agenda sunt, these things must be done by us 3 
mihi eundum est, / #zust go (lit. 2 must be gone by me). 
a, To avoid ambiguity, & with the Ablative is sometimes used with the 
Gerundive ; as, — 
hostibus 4 ndbis parcendum est, the enemy must be spared by us. 
  Much less frequently with the compound tenses of the passive 
voice and the perfect passive participle ; as, — 
  disputatio quae mihi niiper habita est, the discussion which was 
recently conducted by me. 
3. Rarely with the uncompounded tenses of the passive; as, — 
honesta bonis viris quaeruntur, /oble ends are sought by good men. 
Dative of Possession. 
190. The Dative of Possession occurs with the verb esse 
in such expressions as : — 
mihi est liber, 7 have a book ; 
mihi n6men est Marcus, / have the name Marcus. 
1. But with nomen est the name is more commonly attracted into 
the Dative ; as, mihi Marco némen est. 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  The Dative. 133 
Dative of Purpose or Tendency. 
191. The Dative of Purpose or Tendency designates 
the end toward which an action is directed or the direction in 
which it tends. It is used — 
1. Unaccompanied by another Dative; as, — 
castris locum déligere, fo choose a place for a camp; 
legi6nés praesidi6 relinquere, fo /eave the legions as a guard (lit. 
Sor a guard) 3 
receptui canere, /o sound {he signal for a retreat. 
2. Much more frequently in connection with another Dative of the 
person : — 
a) Especially with some form of esse; as, — 
fortiinae tuae mihi ciirae sunt, your fortunes are a care to 
me (lit. for a care) ; 
nobis sunt odié, they are an object of hatred to us; 
cui bon6? fo whom is it of advantage? 
6) With other verbs ; as, — 
hés tibi mineri misit, he fas sent these to you for a 
present ; 
Pausanias Atticis vénit auxilid, Pausanias came to the 
aid of the Athenians (lit. to the Athenians for aid). 
3. In connection with the Gerundive ; as, — 
decemviri légibus scribundis, decemvirs for codifying the laws ; 
mé gerend6 bell6 ducem creavére, me they have made leader for 
carrying on the war. 
NoTE. — This construction with the gerundive is not common till Livy. 
Dative with Adjectives. 
192. The use of the Dative with Adjectives corresponds 
very closely to its use with verbs. Thus :— 
1. Corresponding to the Dative of Indirect Object it occurs with 
adjectives signifying : friendly, unfriendly, similar, dissimilar, equal, 
near, related to, etc.; as, — 
mihi inimicus, hostile to me; 
sunt proximi GermA4nis, they are next to the Germans}; 
noxiae poena par est6, /et the penalty be equal to the damage.
-P-A-G-E-142
134 Syntax. 
a. For propior and proximus with the Accusative, see 
§ 141, 3. 
2. Corresponding to the Dative of Purpose, the Dative occurs with 
adjectives signifying : sa¢table, adapted, fit ; as, — 
castris idGneus locus, a place fit for a camp; 
apta diés sacrifici6, a day suitable for a sacrifice. 
NOTE. — Adjectives of this last class often take the Accusative with ad. 
Dative of Direction. 
193. In the poets the Dative is occaSionally used to denote the 
direction of motion ; as,— 
it clamor cael6, the shout goes heavenward ; 
cinerés riv6 fluenti jace, cast the ashes toward the flowing stream. 
1. By an extension of this construction the poets sometimes use the 
Dative to denote the dizmzt of motion ; as,— 
dum Lati6é deés inferret, /7// he should bring his gods to Latium. 
; THE GENITIVE. 
194. The Genitive is used with Nouns, Adjectives, and 
Verbs. 
GENITIVE WITH NOUNS. 
195. With Nouns the Genitive is the case which defines 
the meaning of the limited noun more closely. This relation is 
generally indicated in English by the preposition of. There 
are the following varieties of the Genitive with Nouns : — 
Genitive of Origin, Objective Genitive, 
Genitive of Material, Genitive of the Whole, 
Genitive of Possession, Appositional Genitive, 
Subjective Genitive, Genitive of Quality. 
196. Genitive of Origin; as, — 
Marci filius, the son of Marcus. 
197. Genitive of Material; as,— 
talentum auri, a ¢alent of gold; 
acervus friimenti, a ile of grain.
-P-A-G-E-143
The Dative. — The Genitive. 135 
198. Genitive of Possession or Ownership; as, — 
domus CicerGnis, C7cero’s house. 
1. Here belongs the Genitive with causa and gratia. The Geni- 
tive always precedes ; as, — 
hominum causa, for the sake of men; 
meOdrum amic6rum gratia, for the sake of my friends. 
2. Instar (lit. image) also takes the Possessive Genitive; as, — 
equus instar montis, a horse as large as a mountain, 
3. The Possessive Genitive is often used predicatively, especially 
with esse and fieri; as, — 
domus est régis, the house zs the king's ; 
stulti est in errGre manére, 7¢ zs (the part) of a fool to remain in 
error 3 
dé bell6 jiidicium imperatGris est, n6n militum, ‘he decision con- 
cerning war belongs to the general, not to the soldiers. 
  199. Subjective Genitive. This denotes the person who makes 
or produces something or who has a feeling ; as,— 
dicta Platinis, the utterances of Plato ; 
timGrés liber6rum, the fears of the children. 
200. Objective Genitive. This denotes the object of an action 
or feeling } as,— : 
metus de6rum, the fear of the gods ; 
amor libertatis, love of liberty ; 
cdnsuétids bondrum hominum, iztercourse with good men. 
1. This relation is often expressed by means of prepositions ; as, — 
amor erga parentés, Jove toward one’s parents. 
201. Genitive of the Whole. This designates the whole of 
which a part is taken. It is used — 
1. With Nouns, Pronouns, Comparatives, Superlatives, and Ordinal 
Numerals ; as, — 
magna pars hominum, a great part of mankind; 
duo milia peditum, ¢wo thousand foot-soldiers ; 
quis mortalium, who of mortals ? 
major fratrum, the elder of the brothers ; 
géns maxima Germanérum, ¢he largest tribe of the Germans ; 
primus omnium, ¢he first of all.
-P-A-G-E-144
    136 Syntax. 
a, Yet instead of the Genitive of the Whole we often find ex or d6 win 
the Ablative, regularly so with Cardinal numbers and quidam; as,— 
fidélissimus dé servis, the most trusty of the slaves ; 
quidam ex amicis, certain of his friends ; 
tinus ex militibus, ove of the soldiers. 
4. In English we often use of where there is no relation of whole to part. 
In such cases the Latin is more exact, and does not use the Genitive; 
as,— 
quot vos estis, ow many of you are there? 
trecenti conjiravimus, three hundred of us have conspired (i.e. 
we, three hundred in number). 
2. The Genitive of the Whole is used also with the Nomi- 
native or Accusative Singular Neuter of Pronouns, or of Adjectives 
used substantively; also with the Adverbs parum, satis, and partim 
when used substantively; as, — 
quid cénsili, what purpose ? 
tantum cibi, so much food; 
pliis auct6ritatis, more authority; 
minus labGris, /ess labor ; 
satis peciiniae, exough money; 
parum industriae, foo little indust, , 
a. An Adjective of the second declension used substantively may be em- 
ployed as a Genitive of the Whole; as, nihil boni, xothing good. 
4, But Adjectives of the third declension agree directly with the noun they 
limit; as, nihil dulcius, nothing sweeter. 
3. Occasionally we find the Genitive of the Whole dependent upon 
Adverbs of place; as, — 
ubi terrarum? ubi gentium? where in the world? 
a, By an extension of this usage the Genitive sometimes occurs in depend- 
ence upon pridié and postridi6, but only in the phrases pridié 
ejus di6i, on the day before that; postridié ejus diéi, on the day 
after that. 
202. Appositional Genitive. The Genitive sometimes has the 
force of an appositive; as, — 
nomen régis, the name of king; 
poena mortis, éhe penalty of death; 
ars scribendi, che art of writing. 
203. Genitive of Quality. The Genitive modified by an Adjec- 
tive is used to denote quality. This construction presents several 
varieties. Thus it is used —
-P-A-G-E-145
  The Genitive. 137 
1. To denote some internal or permanent characteristic of a person 
or thing ; as, — 
vir magnae virtiitis, 2 man of great virtue ; 
ratidnés ejus modi, conszderations of that sort. 
a. Only a limited number of Adjectives occur in this construction, chiefly 
magnus, maximus, summus, tantus, along with ejus. 
2. To denote measure (4readth, length, etc.) ; as, — 
fossa quindecim pedum, a trench fifteen feet wide (or deep) ; 
exsilium decem ann6rum, az eazle of ten years. 
3. By omission of preti (frice), or some kindred word, tanti, 
quanti, parvi, magni, minGris, minimi, plirimi, maximi are used 
predicatively to denote indefinite value; as, — 
nilla studia tanti sunt, o studies are of so much value ; 
magni opera ejus existimata est, /zs assistance was highly esteemed. 
a. Pliris (not strictly an adjective) follows the same analogy. 
4. By an extension of the notion of value, quanti, tanti, pliris, 
and minGris are also used with verbs of duyzng and selling, to denote 
indefinite price; as, — 
quanti aedés émisti, at how high a price did you purchase the house ? 
5. Any of the above varieties of the Genitive of Quality may be 
used predicatively ; as, — 
tantae mélis erat Romanam condere gentem, of so great difficulty 
was it to found the Roman race. 
GENITIVE WITH ADJECTIVES. 
204. The Genitive is used with many Adjectives, to mit 
the extent of their application. Thus :— 
1. With Adjectives signifying desire, knowledge, familiarity, 
memory, participation, power, fulness, and their opposites ; as, — 
studidsus discendi, deszvous ‘of learning ; \

2. Sometimes with proprius and commiinis ; as, — 
virl propria est fortitid6, bravery 7s characteristic of a man. 
memoria est comminis omnium artium, memory is common to all

when the reference is to living objects; as, — 
filius patris simillimus est, the son 7s exactly like his father. 
mei similis, ke me; vestri similis, “ke you. 
When the reference is to things, both Genitive and Dative occur; as, —

is extended far beyond earlier limits; as, atr6x animi, fierce of temper ; incertus 
cOnsili, undecided in purpose. 
GENITIVE WITH VERBS. 
205. The Genitive is used with the following classes of 
Verbs : —

206. 1. WHEN REFERRING TO PERSONS— 
a. memini always takes the Genitive of personal or reflexive 
pronouns ; as, —

With other words denoting persons memini takes the Accusative, 
rarely the Genitive ; as, —

meministine némina, do you remember the names ? 
reminiscere veteris incommodi, remember the former disaster ; 
reminiscéns acerbitatem, remembering the severity.

in the Accusative; as,—

memini, takes the Genitive; as, — 
civium mihi in mentem venit, / remember the citizens.

207. These verbs, in addition to an Accusative of the 
person, occasionally take a Genitive of the thing; as, —

a. But more frequently (in Cicero almost invariably) these verbs take dé 
with the Ablative; as, — 
dé peciinia mé admonés, you remind me of the money.

the Accusative (178. 1. d) ; as, —

Genitive with Impersonal Verbs. 
209. 1. The Impersonals pudet, paenitet, miseret, taedet, 
piget take the Accusative of the person affected; along with

paenitet mé hiijus facti, 7 repent of this act; 
eum taedet vitae, he is weary of life;

m6 hoc pudet, / am ashamed of this. 
  2. Misereor and miserésc6 also govern the Genitive; as, —

tui, efc., the Latin uses the Ablative Singular Feminine of 
the Possessive, vzz.: mea, tua, efc.; as, — 
mea interest, 7¢ concerns mie.

6) by the Adverbs, magnopere, magis, maximé, ¢fc. ; as, — 
civium minimé interest, concerns the citizens very little. 
c) by the Neuters, multum, pliis, minus, e/c. ; as, — 
multum vestr4 interest, z¢ concerns you much. 
4. Réfert follows interest in its construction, except that it rarely 
takes the Genitive of the person. Thus :— ‘ 
mea réfert, z¢ concerns me}; 
but rarely illtus réfert, 7 concerns him. 
Genitive with Other Verbs. 
212. 1. Verbs of Plenty and Want sometimes govern 
the Genitive ; as, — 
peciiniae indigés, you need money. 
a. These verbs more commonly take the Ablative (§ 214, 1) ; 
indiged is the only verb which has a preference for the 
Genitive. 
2. Potior, though usually followed by the Ablative, sometimes takes 
the Genitive, almost always so in Sallust; and regularly in the phrase: 
potiri rérum, #0 get control of affairs. 
3. In poetry some verbs take the Genitive in imitation of the Greek; as, — 
désine querell4rum, cease your complaints ; 
operum soliti, freed from their tasks.
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 Syntax. 
THE ABLATIVE, 
213, The Latin Ablative unites in itself three cases which 
were originally distinct both in form and in meaning ; viz. — 
The Ablative or from-case. 
The Instrumental or with-case. 
The Locative or where-case. 
The uses of the Latin Ablative accordingly fall into 
Genuine Ablative uses, Instrumental uses, and Locative 
uses. 
GENUINE ABLATIVE USES. 
Ablative of Separation. 
214. The Ablative of Separation is construed sometimes 
with, sometimes without, a preposition. 
1. The following words regularly take the Ablative without a 
preposition : — 
a) The Verbs of freeing: liberé, solvd, levd ; 
6) The Verbs of depriving: privé, spolié, exud, fraudé, 
nud6; 
c) The Verbs of lacking: eged, cared, vacd ; 
d) The corresponding Adjectives, liber, inanis, vacuus, 
niidus, and some others of similar meaning. 
Thus : — 
ciiris liberatus, freed from cares ; 
Caesar hostés armis exuit, Caesar stripped the enemy of 
their arms 3 
caret sénsii commit, he lacks common sense; 
auxilid eget, he needs help ; ‘ 
bonérum vita vacua est metii, the life of the good is free 
Srom fear. 
NOTE 1.— Yet Adjectives and liberd may take the preposition ab, — regu- 
larly so with the Ablative of persons; as, — 
urbem 4 tyrann6 liberarunt, they freed the city from the tyrant. 
NOTE 2.—IndigeG usually takes the Genitive. See § 212, 1, a.
-P-A-G-E-151
  The Ablative. 143 
2. Of Verbs signifying to keep from, to remove, to withdraw, some 
take the preposition, others omit it. The same Verb often admits both 
constructions. Examples : — 
abstinére cib6, fo abstain from food; 
hostés finibus prohibuérunt, they kept the enemy Srom their borders ; 
praedohés ab insula prohibuit, he kept the pirates from the island. 
3. Other Verbs of separation usually take the Ablative with a Prep- 
osition, particularly compounds of dis- and sé-; as, — 
dissentis 4 té, / dissent from you ; 
sécernantur a4 n6bis, let them be separated from us. 
4. The Preposition is freely omitted in poetry. 
Ablative of Source. 
215. The Ablative of Source is used with the participles 
natus and ortus (in poetry also with éditus, satus, and some 
others), to designate parentage or station ; as, — 
Jove natus, son of Jupiter ; : 
summ6 loc6 natus, high-born (lit. born from a very high place) ; 
nodbili genere ortus, Jorn of a noble family. 
1. Pronouns regularly (nouns rarely) take ex; as, 
ex mé natus, strung from me. 
2. To denote remoter descent, ortus ab, or oriundus (with or 
without ab), is used; as, — 
ab Ulixe oriundus, descended from Ulysses. 
Ablative of Agent. 
216. The Ablative accompanied by a (ab) is used with 
passive verbs to denote the personal agent ; as, — 
& Caesare acciisatus est, ie was arraigned by Caesar. 
1. Collective nouns referring to persons, and abstract nouns when 
personified, may be construed as the personal agent. Thus: — 
hostés 4 fortiina déserébantur, the enemy were deserted by Fortune ; 
4 multitidine hostium méntés tenébantur, ‘he mountains were held 
by a multitude of the enemy. 
2. Names of animals sometimes admit the same construction. Thus: — 
& canibus laniatus est, he was torn to pieces by dogs.
-P-A-G-E-152
144 Syntax. 
Ablative of Comparison. 
217. 1. The Ablative is often used with Comparatives 
in the sense of ¢han; as, — 
melle dulcior, sweeter than honey ; 
patria mihi vita carior est, my country is dearer to me than life. 
2. This construction, as a rule, occurs only as a substitute for quam 
(than) with the Nominative or Accusative. In other cases quam must 
be used; as, — 
tui studidsior sum quam illius, / am fonder of you than of him. 
Studidsior ill6 would have meant, / am fonder of you than he ts. 
3. Plis, minus, amplius, longius are often employed as the equiv- 
alents of plis quam, minus quam, efc. Thus :— 
amplius viginti urbés incenduntur, wore than twenty cities are 
Jjired; 
minus quinque milia précessit, he advanced less than five miles. 
4. Note the use of opiniGne with Comparatives ; as, — 
opinione celerius venit, he comes more quickly than expected (lit. than opinion). 
INSTRUMENTAL USES OF THE ABLATIVE. 
Ablative of Means. 
218. The Ablative is used to denote means or instru- 
ment; as, — 
Alexander sagitta vulneratus est, Alexander was wounded by an 
arrow. 
There are the following special varieties of this Ablative : —

a. A Neuter Pronoun or Adjective often stands as subject with 
opus as predicate. Thus:— 
héc mihi opus est, ¢hzs 7s necessary for me. 
é An ordinary substantive rarely stands as subject. Thus dux 
n6bis opus est is a rare form of expression.

est; as,— 
opus est properats, there is need of haste. 
3. With nitor, innixus, and frétus ; as, —

will be done with my dear Tullia ?)

English idiom : — 
proelid contendere, vincere, fo contend, conquer in battle ; 
proelié lacessere, to provoke to battle ; 
eurrii vehi, fo ride in a chariot ; 
pedibus ire, Zo go on foot ; 
castris sé tenére, fo keep in camp. 
8. With Verbs of filling and Adjectives of plenty; as,— 
fossas virgultis complérunt, they filled the trenches with brush. 
a: But plénus more commonly takes the Genitive. See § 204, 1. 
9. Under ‘Means’ belongs also the Ablative of the Way by 
which ; as, — 
vinum Tiberi dévectum, we brought down (by) the Tiber.
-P-A-G-E-154
  146 Syntax. 
Io. The means may be aperson as wellas a thing. Thus: —

Ablative of Cause.

multa gloriae cupiditate fécit, he did many things on account of his 
love of glory.

account of it); 
vict6ria sua gloriantur, they exult over their victory ; 
natira loci cénfidébant, they trusted in the character of their country

sometimes the Dative of the ‘hing. 
2. As Ablatives of Cause are to be reckoned also such Ablatives as 
jussii, dy order of, injussi, without the order, rogati, etc. 
Ablative of Manner. 
220. The Ablative with cum is used to denote manner ;

cum gravitate loquitur, he speaks with dignity. 
1. The preposition may be omitted when the Ablative is modified 
by an adjective; as, — : 
magna gravitate loquitur, he speaks with great dignity.

exerciti, cum duabus legidnibus. 
Ablative of Association.

nated by the Ablative; as, —

1. The Ablatives magn6, plirimé, parvd, minimd (by omission 
of pretid) are used to denote zwdefinite price; as, —

-P-A-G-E-157
  The Ablative. 149 
Ablative Absolute. 
227. The Ablative Absolute is grammatically inde- 
pendent of the rest of the sentence. In its commonest 
form it consists of a noun or pronoun limited by a 
participle ; as, — 
urbe capta, Aenéas fiigit, when the city had been captured, Aeneas 
fled (lit. the city having been captured), 
1. Instead of a participle we often find an adjective or noun; as, — 
viv6 Caesare rés piiblica salva erat, while Caesar was alive the 
state was safe (lit! Caesar being alive) ; 
Tarquinio rége, Pythagoras in Italiam vénit, zz the reign of Tar- 
quin Pythagoras came into Italy (lit. Tarquin being king). 
Cn. Pompej6, M. Crass0 cénsulibus, zz che consulship of Gnaeus 
Pompey and Marcus Crassus (lit. P. and C. being consuls). 
2. The Ablative Absolute is generally used in Latin where in 
English we employ subordinate clauses. Thus the Ablative Absolute 
may correspond to a clause denoting — 
@) Time, as in the foregoing examples. 
6) Condition; as, — 
omnés virtités jacent, voluptate dominante, al/ virtues 
le prostrate, if pleasure is master. . 
¢) Opposition ; as, — 
perditis omnibus rébus, virtiis sé sustentare potest, 
though everything else zs lost, yet Virtue can maintain 
herself. 
d@) Cause; as, — 
nill6 adversante régnum obtinuit, sivce no one opposed 
him, he secured the throne. 
e) Attendant circumstance ; as, — 
passis palmis pacem petivérunt, with hands outstretched 
they sued for peace. 
3. An Infinitive or clause sometimes occurs in the Ablative Absolute 
construction, especially in Livy and later writers; as, — 
audit6 eum figisse, when it was heard that he had fled. 
4. A noun or pronoun stands in the Ablative Absolute construction 
only when it denotes a different person or thing from any in the clause 
in which it stands. Exceptions to this principle are extremely rare.

sition; viz. —

or to denote the point whence distance is measured; as, — 
a Gergovia discessit, he withdrew from the vicinity of Gergovia. 
a Roma X milia aberat, he was ten miles distant from Rome.

struction, particularly annus, vér, aestas, hiems, diés, nox, hora, 
comitia (Zlection Day), Vidi (the Games), etc. 
2. Words not denoting time require the preposition in, unless 
accompanied by a modifier. Thus: — 
in pace, 7 peace ; in bell6, zz war; 
but secund6 bell6 Piinic6, zy the second Punic War. 
‘ 
3. Expressions like in\e6 tempore, in summa senectite, take the 
preposition because they denote sztvation rather than time. 
B. Time within which. 
231. Time within which is denoted by the Ablative 
either wth or without a preposition ; as, — 
stella SaturnT triginta annis cursum cénficit, the planet Saturn

Romae, at Rome ; Corinthi, at Corinth; 
Rhodi, at Rhodes. 
2. In the following special forms : — 
domi, at home ; humi, on the ground; 
belli, 27 war ; militiae, 7x war; 
vesperl, af evening; heri, yesterday. 
3. Note the phrase pendére animi, lit. to de im suspense in one’s 
mind. 
4. For urbs and oppidum in apposition with a Locative, see § 169. 4. 
Cuarter II].— Syntax of Adjectives. 
233. 1. The word with which an Adjective agrees is 
called its Subject. 
2. Attributive and Predicate Adjectives. An Attributive 
Adjective is one that limits its subject directly ; as,— 
vir sapiéns, a wise man. 
A Predicate Adjective is one that limits its subject through 
the medium of a verb (usually esse); as, — 
vir est sapiéns, ‘he man 1s wise; 
vir vidébatur sapiéns, the man seemed wise ; 
vir jidicadtus est sapiéns, he man was judged wise ; 
hunc virum sapientem jiidicavimus, we adjudged this man wise. 
3. Participles and Adjective Pronouns have the construction of 
Adjectives. 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
Agreement of Adjectives. 153 
AGREEMENT OF ADJECTIVES. 
234, Agreement with One Noun. When an Adjective 
limits one noun it agrees with it in Gender, Number, and 
Case. 
1. Two Adjectives in the Singular may limit a noun in the Plural; 
as, prima et vicésima legiGnés, the first and twentieth legions. 
2. A Predicate Adjective may stand in the: Neuter when its Subject 
is Masculine or Feminine and denotes a thing; as,— 
mors est miserum, death is a wretched thing. 
235. Agreement with Two or More Nouns. 
A. AGREEMENT AS TO NUMBER. 
1. When the Adjective is Attributive, it regularly agrees 
in number with the nearest noun; as, — 
pater tuus et mater, your father and mother 3 
eadem alacritas et studium, the same eagerness and zeal. 
2. When the Adjective is Predicative, it is regularly 
Plural; as, — 
pax et concordia sunt pulchrae, peace and concord are glorious. 
B. AGREEMENT AS TO GENDER. 
1. When the Adjective is Attributive, it regularly agrees 
in gender with the nearest noun; as, — 
rés operae multae ac lab6ris, a matter of much effort and labor. 
2. When the Adjective is Predicative — 
@) If the nouns are of the same gender, the Adjective agrees 
with them in gender; as, — 
pater et filius capti sunt, father and son were captured. 
Yet with feminine abstract nouns, the Adjective is more fre- 
quently Neuter; as, — 
stultitia et timiditas fugienda sunt, folly and cowardice 
must be shunned.
-P-A-G-E-162
154 Syntax. 
4) If the nouns are of different gender; then, — 
a) In case they denote persons, the Adjective is Mascu- 
line; as, — 
pater et mater mortui sunt, the father and mother have 
died. 
B) In case they denote things, the Adjective is Neu- 
ter; asj— 
hon6rés et victdriae fortuita sunt, honors and victories 
are accidental. 
y) In case they include both persons and things, the 
Adjective is, — 
aa.) Sometimes Masculine; as, — 
domus, uxor, liberi inventi sunt, ome, wife, and children 
are secured. 
BB) Sometimes Neuter; as, — 
parentés, liberds, domés vilia habére, fo hold parents, 
children, houses, cheap. 
yy) Sometimes it agrees with the nearest noun ; as, — 
populi prévinciaeque liberatae sunt, vations and prov- 
inces were liberated. 
¢) Construction accoréing to Sense. Sometimes an Ad- 
jective does not agree with a noun according to strict gram- 
matical form, but according to sense; as, — 
pars béstiis objecti sunt, Zart (of the men) were thrown 
to beasts. 
ADJECTIVES USED SUBSTANTIVELY. 
236. 1. PLURAL ADJECTIVES USED SUBSTANTIVELY. 
Adjectives are quite freely used as Substantives in the 
Plural. The Masculine denotes persons; the Neuter 
denotes things; as, — 
docti, scholars ; parva, small things 3 
mali, the wicked ; magna, great things 3 
Graeci, the Greeks ; , atilia, useful things ; 
nostri, our men.
-P-A-G-E-163
Adjectives used Substantively. 155 
2. Neuter Plural Adjectives thus used are confined mainly to the 
Nominative and Accusative cases. Such forms as magndrum, om~- 
nium; magnis, omnibus, would ordinarily lead to ambiguity; yet 
where there is no ambiguity, they sometimes occur; as, — 
parva comp6nere magnis, fo compare small things with great. 
Otherwise the Latin says: magnarum rérum, magnis rébus, ¢/c. 
287. SINGULAR ADJECTIVES USED SUBSTANTIVELY. Ad- 
jectives are less freely used as Substantives in the Sin- 
gular than in the Plural. 
1. Masculine Adjectives occur only occasionally in this use; as, — 
probus invidet némini, the honest man envies nobody. 
a. Usually vir, hom6, or some similar word is employed ; as, — 
hom6 doctus, @ scholar ; 
vir R6manus, a Roman. 
6. But when limited by a pronoun any adjective may be so 
used ; as, — 
hic doctus, ¢his scholar ; 
doctus quidam, a certain scholar. 
2. Neuters are likewise infrequent; as, — 
vérum, truth; 
jaistum, justice; 
honestum, virtue. 
a, This substantive use of Neuter Singulars is commonest in the con- 
struction of the Genitive of the Whole, and after Prepositions; as,— 
aliquid v6ri, something true ; 
nihil novi, xothing new; 
in medio, ix the midst. 
238. From Adjectives which, like the above, occasionally admit the 
substantive use, must be carefully distinguished certain others which 
have become nouns; as, — 
adversarius, opponent ; hiberna, w7nter quarters 3 
aequalis, contemporary 3 propinquus, relative ; 
amicus, friend ; socius, partner 3 
cognatus, kinsman 3 sodalis, comrade 3 
vicinus, neighbor 3 etc. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
EO 
156 Syntax. 
ADJECTIVES WITH THE FORCE OF ADVERBS. 
239. The Latin often uses an Adjective where the Eng- 
lish idiom employs an Adverb or an adverbial phrase ; as, — 
senatus frequéns convénit, che senate assembled in great numbers} 
fuit assiduus mécum, 4e was constantly with me. 
COMPARATIVES AND SUPERLATIVES. 
240. .1. The Comparative often corresponds to the English Positive 
with ‘rather, ‘somewhat, ‘too’; as, — 
senectiis est loquacior, old age is rather talkative. 
2. So the Superlative often corresponds to the Positive with 
“very”; as,— 
vir fortissimus, a very brave man. 
3. Strengthening Words. Vel and quam are often used with 
the Superlative as strengthening particles, vel with the force of ‘ very,’ 
and quam with the force of ‘as possible’; as, — 
vel maximus, the very greatest ; 
quam maximae cGpiae, as great forces as possible. 
4. Phrases of the type ‘ more rich than brave’ regularly take the Comparative 
in both members; as, — 
exercitus erat ditior quam fortior, the army was more rich than brave. 
OTHER PECULIARITIES. 
241. 1. Certain Adjectives may be used to denote a part of an object, 
chiefly primus, extrémus, summus, medius, infimus, Imus; as, — 
summus mons, the top of the mountain 3 . 
extréma hieme, 7 the last part of the winter. 
2. Prior, primus, ultimus, and postrémus are frequently equiva- 
lent to a relative clause; as, — 
primus eam vidi, / was the first who saw her 3 
ultimus décessit, e was the last who withdrew. 
3. When multus and another adjective both limit the same noun, 
et is generally used; as, — 
multae et magnae cOgitatiénés, many (and) great thoughts.

Personal Pronouns. — Possessive Pronouns. 157 
Cuapter 1V.— Syntax of Pronouns. 
PERSONAL PRONOUNS. 
242. 1. The Personal Pronouns as subjects of verbs 
are, as a rule, not expressed except for the purpose of 
emphasis, contrast, or clearness. Thus ordinarily : — 
vides, 7 see; amat, he loves. 
But ego té vides, et tii mé vidés, / see you, and you see me, 
2. The Genitives mei, tui, nostri, vestri are used only as Objective 
Genitives; nostrum and vestrum as Genitives of the Whole. Thus: — 
memor tui, mindful of you ; 
désiderium vestri, longing for you ; 
ném6 vestrum, zo one of you. 
a. But nostrum and vestrum are regularly used in place of the Pos- 
sessive in the phrases omnium nostrum, omnium vestrum. 
3. The First Plural is often used for the First Singular of Pronouns 
and Verbs. Compare the Eng. editorial ‘ we.’ 
4. When two Verbs govern the same object, the Latin does not 
use a pronoun with the second, as is the rule in English. Thus :— 
virtiis amicitias conciliat et cOnservat, virtue establishes friend- 
ships and maintains them (not eas cénservat). 
POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS. 
248. 1. The Possessive Pronouns, as a rule, are not 
employed except for the purpose of clearness. _Thus:— 
patrem am6, J love my father ; 
dé filil morte flébas, you weft for the dear of your son. 
But— 
dé morte filil mei flébas, you wept for the death of my son. 
a. When expressed merely for the sake of clearness, the pos- 
sessive usually stands after its noun; but in order to indi- 
cate emphasis or contrast, it precedes; as, — 
sua mani liberés occidit, with his own hand he slew his 
children 3 
med quidem sententia, zz my opinion at least.
-P-A-G-E-166
EE Ee Pere ee a 
158 Syntax. 
2. Sometimes the Possessive Pronouns are used with the force of 
an Objective Genitive ; as, — 
metus vester, fear of you; 
désiderium tuum, longing for you. 
3- For special emphasis, the Latin employs ipsius or ipsérum, in 
apposition with the Genitive idea implied in the Possessive; as, — 
mea ipsius opera, by my own help; 
nostra ipsSrum oper, dy our own help; 
@. So sometimes other Genitives; as,— 
mea tinius opera, dy the assistance of me alone. 
REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS. 
244. 1. The Reflexive Pronoun sé and the Possessive 
Reflexive suus have a double use :— 
I. They may refer to the subject of the clause (either principal or 
subordinate) in which they stand, —‘ Direct Reflexives’; as, — 
sé amant, they love themselves 3 
su6s amic6s adjuvat, he helps his own friends ; 
eum Oravi, ut sé servaret, / besought him to save himself. 
II. They may stand in a subordinate clause and refer to the subject 
of the principal clause, —‘ Indirect Reflexives’; as, — 
mé Gravit ut sé défenderem, he besought me to defend him (lit. that 
L defend himself) ; 
mé Gravérunt, ut fortinadrum suarum défénsiénem susciperem, 
they besought me to undertake the defense of their fortunes. 
a. The Indirect Reflexive is mainly restricted to those clauses 
which express the thought, not of the author, but of the sub- 
ject of the principal clause. 
2. The Genitive sui is regularly employed, like mei and tui, as an 
Objective Genitive, ¢.g. oblitus sul, forgetful of himself; but it occa- 
sionally occurs —- particularly in post-Augustan writers — in place of the 
Possessive suus ; as, fruitur fama sui, he enjoys his own fame. 
3. S& and suus are sometimes used in the sense, one’s self, one’s 
own, where the reference is not to any particular person; as, — 
sé amare, fo love one’s self; 
suum genium propitiare, /o profpitiate one’s own genius.
-P-A-G-E-167
  Reciprocal Pronouns. — Demonstrative Pronouns. 159 
4. Suus sometimes occurs in the meaning Ais own, their own, etc., 
referring not to the subject but to an oblique case ; as, — 
Hannibalem sui civés é civitate éjécérunt, Ais own fellow-citizens 
drove out Hannibal. 
a. This usage is particularly frequent in combination with 
quisque; as, — 
suus quemque error vexat, his own error troubles cach. 
5. The Reflexives for the first and second persons are supplied by 
the oblique cases of ego and ti (§ 85); as, — 
v6s défenditis, you defend yourselves. 
RECIPROCAL PRONOUNS. 
245. 1. The Latin has no special reciprocal pronoun (‘ each other), 
but expresses the reciprocal notion by the phrases: inter nos, inter 
vos, inter sé; as, — 
Belgae obsidés inter sé dedérunt, the Belgae gave each other host- 
ages (lit. among themselves) 3 
amamus inter ns, we love each other 3 
Galli inter sé cohortati sunt, the Gauls exhorted, each other. 
a. Note that the Object is not expressed in sentences of this type, 
DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS. 
Hic, Ile, Iste. 
246. 1. Where hic and ille are used in contrast, hic usually refers 
to the latter of two objects, and ille to the former. 
2. Hic and ille are often used in the sense of ‘the following’ ; as, — 
Themistoclés his verbis epistulam misit, Zemstocles sent a letter 
(couched) in the following words ; 
illud intellegs, omnium Gra in mé conversa esse, 7 understand 
this, that the faces of all are turned toward me. 
3- Ille often means ¢he famous ; as, Soldn ille, the famous Solon. 
4. Iste frequently involves contempt; as, iste hom6, chat fellow! 
5. The above pronouns, along with is, are usually attracted to the 
gender of a predicate noun; as, hic est honor, meminisse officium 
suum, ¢his 7s an honor, to be mindful of one’s duty. 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
160 Syntax. 
Is. 
247. 1. Is often serves as the antecedent of the relative qui. 
Thus : — 
Maximum, eum qui Tarentum recépit, diléxi, / loved Maximus, the 
man who retook Tarentum. 
a. Closely akin to this usage isis in the sense of such (= tlis) ; 
as, — 
n6n sum is qui terrear, 7 am not such a person as to be 
Srightened, 
6. Note the phrase id quod, where id stands in apposition with 
an entire clause ; as, — 
n6n suspicabatur (id quod nunc sentiet) satis multds 
testés ndbis reliqués esse, he did not suspect (a 
thing which he will now perceive) that we had wit- 
nesses enough left. 
Yet quod alone, without preceding id, sometimes occurs in 
this use. 
2. Is also in all cases serves as the personal pronoun of the third 
person, ‘he,’ ‘she,’ ‘it, ‘they, ‘them.’ 
3. When the English uses ‘that of, ‘ those of, to avoid repetition of 
the noun, the Latin omits the pronoun; as, — 
in exerciti Sullae et posted in Crassi fuerat, he had been in the 
army of Sulla and afterward in that of Crassus ; 
nillae mé fabulae délectant nisi Plauti, xo plays delight me except 
those of Plautus. 
4. Note the phrases et is, et ea, efc.,in the sense: and that too; as,— 
-vincula, et ea sempiterna, émprisonment, and that too permanently. 
Idem. 
248. 1, Idem in apposition with the subject or object often has the 
force of also, likewise: as, — 
quod idem mihi contigit, which likewise happened to me (lit. which, 
the same thing) ; 
bonus vir, quem eundem sapientem appellamus, @ good man. 
whom we call also wise. 
2. For idem atque (ac), the same as, see § 341. 1. ¢. 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
    
Demonstrative Pronouns. — Relative Pronouns. 16% 
Ipse. 
249. 1. Ipse, literally seJf, acquires its special force from the con- 
text; as,— 
€6 ipsd dié, on that very day; 
ad ipsam ripam, close to the bank ; 
ips6 terrGre, by mere fright ; 
valvae sé ipsae aperuérunt, /ie doors opened of their own accord; 
ipse aderat, he was present in person. 
2. The reflexive pronouns are often emphasized by the addition of 
ipse, but ipse in such cases, instead of standing in apposition with the 
reflexive, more commonly agrees with the subject ; as, — 
sécum ipsi loquuntur, they talk with themselves ; 
sé ipse continére n6n potest, e cannot contain himself. 
3. Ipse is also used as an Indirect Reflexive for the purpose of 
marking a contrast or avoiding an ambiguity ; as, — 
Persae pertimuérunt né Alcibiadés ab ipsis déscisceret et cum 
suis in gratiam rediret, ‘He Persians feared that Alcibiades 
would break with them and become reconciled with his countrymen. 
ea molestissimé ferre débent hominés quae ips6rum culpa con- 
tracta sunt, zen ought to chafe most over those things which have 
been brought about by their own fault (as opposed to the fault of 
others). 
RELATIVE PRONOUNS. 
250. Agreement. 1. The Relative Pronoun agrees with 
its antecedent in Gender, Number, and Person, but its case 
is determined by its construction in the clause in which 
it stands; as, — 
mulier quam vidébamus, ¢he woman whom we saw ; 
bona quibus fruimur, the blessings which we enjoy. 
2. Where the antecedent is compound, the same principles for 
number and gender prevail as in case of predicate adjectives under 
similar conditions (see § 235. B. 2). Thus: — 
pater et filius, qui capti sunt, ¢e father and son who were captured; 
stultitia et timiditas quae fugienda sunt, folly and cowardice which 
must be shunned 3 
honGrés et victdriae quae sunt fortuita, honors and victories which 
are accidental.
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 Syntax. 
3- The Relative regularly agrees with a predicate noun (either 
Nominative or Accusative) instead of its antecedent; as, — 
carcer, quae lautumiae vocantur, the prison, which is called Lau- 
tumiae 3 
Celtae, quae est tertia pars, the Celts, who are the third part. 
4. Sometimes the Relative takes its gender and number from the 
meaning of its antecedent; as, — 
pars qui béstiis objecti sunt, a fart (of the men) who were thrown 
to beasts. 
5- Occasionally the Relative is attracted into the case of its ante- 
cedent ; as,— 
natus e6 patre qu6 dix, dorn of the father that J said. 
251. Antecedent. 1. The antecedent of the Relative is 
sometimes omitted ; as, — 
qui natiram sequitur sapiéns est, he who follows Nature ts wise. 
2. The antecedent may be implied in a possessive pronoun (or 
rarely an adjective) ; as, — 
nostra qui remansimus caedés, the slaughter of us who remained ; 
servili tumultii, qués tisus ac disciplina sublevarunt, at ‘he up- 
rising of the slaves, whom experience and discipline assisted 
(servili = servGrum). 
3. Sometimes the antecedent is repeated with the Relative; as, — 
erant itinera duo, quibus itineribus, there were two routes, by which 
(routes). 
4. Incorporation of Antecedent in Relative Clause. The 
antecedent is often incorporated in the relative clause. Thus:— 
a) When the relative clause stands first; as, — 
quam quisque névit artem in hac sé exerceat, let cach 
one practice the branch which he knows. 
5) When the antecedent is an appositive; as, — 
nén longé 4 Tolésatium finibus absunt, quae civitas 
est in prévincia, they are not far from the borders of 
the Tolosates, a state which ts in our province. 
¢) When the logical antecedent is a superlative ; as, — 
Themistoclés dé servis suis, quem habuit fidélissimum, 
misit, 7hemistocles sent the most trusty slave he had. 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  Relative Pronouns. — Indefinite Pronouns. 163 
@) In expressions of the following type — 
qua es priidentia; quae tua est priidentia, such zs your 
prudence (lit. of which prudence you are; which is your 
prudence). 
5. The Relative is never omitted in Latin as it is in English. Thus 
the boy I saw must be puer quem vidi. 
6. The Relative is used freely in Latin, particularly at the beginning 
of a sentence, where in English we employ a demonstrative; as, — 
qué factum est, by this it happened; 
quae cum ita sint, szzce this zs so; 
quibus rébus cognitis, when these things became known. 
7. The Relative introducing a subordinate clause may belong 
grammatically to a clause which is subordinate to the one it intro- 
duces ; as, — 
numquam digné satis laudari philosophia poterit, cui qui 
pareat, omne tempus aetatis sine molestia possit dégere, 
philosophy can never be praised enough, since he who obeys her 
can pass every period of life without annoyance (lit. he who obeys 
which, etc.). 
Here cui introduces the subordinate clause possit and connects it 
with philosophia; but cui is governed by pareat, which is subordi- 
nate to possit. 
INDEFINITE PRONOUNS. 
252. 1. Quis, any one, is the weakest of the Indefinites, and stands 
usually in combination with si, nisi, né, num; as, — 
sI quis putat, 7f amy one thinks. 
2. Aliquis (adj. aliqui) is more definite than quis, and corre- 
sponds usually to the English some one, somebody, some; as,— 
nune aliquis dicat mihi, xow let somebody tell me; 
utinam modo agatur aliquid, of that something may be done. 
3- Quidam, a certain one, is still more definite than aliquis; as, — 
homé quidam, a certain man (7.2. one whom I have in mind). 
a. Quidam (with or without quasi, as if) is sometimes used in the 
sense: a sort of, kind of; as,— 
quaedam cognati6, a sort of relationship ; 
mors est quasi quaedam migrati6, death is a hind of transfer, 
as it were. 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
164 Syntax. 
4. Quisquam, any one, any one whoever (more general than quis), 
and its corresponding adjective tillus, ay, occur mostly in negative 
and conditional sentences, in interrogative sentences implying a nega- 
tive, and in clauses of comparison; as, — 
jastitia numquam nocet cuiquam, justice never harms anybody ; 
si quisquam, Cat6 sapiéns fuit, 7f anybody was ever wise, Cato was; 
potestne quisquam sine perturbatione animi irascli, caw anybody 
be angry without excitement ? 
si 0116 modG fieri potest, 7f zt can be donein any way ; 
taetrior hic tyrannus fuit quam quisquam superiGrum, se was a 
viler tyrant than any of his predecessors. 
5. Quisque, each one, is used especially under the following circum- 
stances : — 
a) Inconnection with suus. See § 2/4. 4. a. 
6) In connection with a Relative or Interrogative Pronoun; 
as, — 
quod cuique obtigit, id teneat, what falls to each, that let 
him hold. 
¢) In connection with superlatives ; as, — 
optimus quisque, all the best (lit. each best one). 
@) With ordinal numerals; as, — 
quint6 quoque ann6, every four years (lit. each fifth year). 
6. N&ém46, wo one, in addition to its other uses, stands regularly with 
adjectives used substantively ; as, — 
  ném6 mortalis, z0 mortal; 
ném6 Rémanus, xo Roman. 
PRONOMINAL ADJECTIVES. 
253. 1. Alius, another, and alter, the other, are often used correl- 
atively ; as, — 
aliud loquitur, aliud sentit, Ze says one thing, he thinks another ; 
alii resistunt, alii fugiunt, some resist, others flee ; 
alter exercitum perdidit, alter véndidit, one ruined the army, the 
other sold it: 
alterI sé in montem recépérunt, alteri ad impedimenta sé contu- 
lérunt, ‘ie one party retreated to the mountain, the others betook 
themselves to the baggage. 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  Agreement of Verb with Subject. 165 
2. Where the English says one does one thing, another another, the 
Latin uses a more condensed form of statement; as, — 
alius aliud amat, ove likes one thing, another another ; 
aliud aliis placet, ove thing pleases some, another others. 
a. So sometimes with adverbs; as, — 
alii alid fugiunt, some flee in one direction, others in another. 
3. The Latin also expresses the notion ‘each other’ by means of 
alius repeated; as, — 
Galli alius alium cohortati sunt, ‘ie Gauls encouraged each other. 
4. C&teri means ¢he rest, all the others ; as, — 
céteris praestare, fo be superior to all the others. 
5. Reliqui means ‘he others in the sense of the rest, those remain- 
ing, —hence is the regular word with numerals ; as, — 
reliqui sex, the six others. 
6. Nescio quis forms a compound indefinite pronoun with the 
force of some one or other ; as, — 
causidicus nescio quis, some pettifogger or other; 
‘. . § 
misit nescio quem, he sent some one or other ; 
nescio qué pact6, somehow or other. 
CuarTerR V.— Syntax of Verbs. 
AGREEMENT. 
With One Subject. 
254. 1. Agreement in Number and Person. A Finite 
Verb agrees with its subject in Number and Person; as, — 
vos vidétis, you see; 
pater filidés instituit, the father trains his sons. 
2. Agreement in Gender. In the compound forms of the verb 
the participle regularly agrees with its subject in gender; as, — 
séditis repressa est, the mutiny was checked.
-P-A-G-E-174
166 Syntax. 
3- But when a predicate noun is of different gender or number from 
its subject, the verb usually agrees with its nearest substantive; as, — 
Tarquinil materna patria erat, Zarguinii was his native country 
on his mother’s side; 
n6n omnis error stultitia est dicenda, not every error is to be called 
folly. 
a. Less frequently the verb agrees with an appositive; as, — 
Corioli, oppidum Volsc6rum, captum est, Corioli, a town of the 
Volsci, was captured. 
4. Construction according to Sense. Sometimes the verb 
agrees with its subject according to sense instead of strict grammatical 
form. Thus:— 
@) In Number; as,— 5 
multitidS hominum convénerant, a crowd of men had 
e gathered. 
6) In Gender; as,— 
duo milia crucibus adfixi sunt, two thousand (men) were 
crucified. 
With Two or More Subjects. 
255. I. Agreement in Number. With two or more sub- 
jects the verb is regularly plural; as, — 
pater et filius mortui sunt, the father and son died. 
2. But sometimes the verb agrees with the nearest subject; vzz.,— 
a) When the verb precedes both subjects or stands between 
them; as, — 
mortuus est pater et filius ; 
pater mortuus est et filius. 
6) When the subjects are connected by aut; aut... aut; 
vel... vel; neque... neque; as,— 
neque pater neque filius mortuus est, zezther father nor 
son died. 
3. When the different subjects are felt together as constitutin: 
whole, the singular is used; as, — ga 
temeritas igndratidque vitidsa est, rashness and ignorance are bad. 
a. This is regularly the case in senatus populusque ROmanus, 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  Voices. — Tenses. 167 
4. Agreement in Person. With compound subjects of different 
persons the verb always takes the first person rather than the second, 
and the second rather than the third; as, — 
si ti et Tullia valétis, ego et Cicerd valémus, 7/ you and Tullia 
are well, Cicero and J are well. 
5. Agreement in Gender. With subjects of different genders the 
participle in the compound tenses follows the same principles as laid 
down for predicate adjectives. See § 235, B, 2. 
VOICES. 
256. 1. The Passive Voice sometimes retains traces of its original 
middle or reflexive meaning; as, — 
ego non patiar eum défendi, / shall not allow him to defend himself. 
2. In imitation of Greek usage many perfect passive participles are 
used by the poets as indirect middles, 2.2. the subject is viewed as act- 
ing not upon himself, but as doing something 27 Azs own interest ; as, — 
vélatus tempora, having veiled his temples. 
a. Occasionally finite forms of the verb are thus used; as, — 
tunica indicitur artis, he covers his limbs with a tunic. 
3. Intransitive Verbs may be used impersonally in the passive ; as, — 
eurritur, people run (lit. it is run) ; 
ventum est, he (they, etc.) came (lit. zt was come). 
TENSES. 
TENSES OF THE INDICATIVE. 
257. 1. The Latin tenses express two distinct no- 
tions : — 
@) The period of time to which the action belongs: 
Present, Past, or Future. 
6) The kind of action: Undefined, Going on, or 
Completed. 
The Latin with its six tenses is able to express each of the three kinds 
of action for each of the three periods of time (making practically nine 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  168 Syntax. 
tenses). It does this by employing certain tenses in more than one 
way, as may be seen by the following table : — 
PERIOD OF TIME. 
Pes ha ee Bee Meee eels ek 
  PRESENT. Past. Furure.

UNDEFINED. | Present: Historical Perfect: | Future:

& | CoMPLETED.| Present Perfect: Pluperfect : Future Perfect : 
M scripsi, 7 have | scripseram, 7 scripser6, tf 
written, had written, | shall have writ- 
ten. U |   
2. It will be seen that the Present may express Undefined action 
or action Going on; so also the Future. The Perfect likewise has a 
double use, according as it denotes action Completed in present time 
(Present Perfect) or Undefined action belonging to past time (Historical 
Perfect). 
Principal and Historical Tenses. 
258. Tenses which denote Present or Future time are 
called Principal (or Primary) Tenses; those which denote 
Past time are called Historical (or Secondary). 
The Principal Tenses of the Indicative are: Present, 
Future, Present Perfect, Future Perfect. 
The Historical Tenses are: Imperfect, Historical Per- 
fect, Pluperfect. 
Present Indicative. 
259. Besides the two uses indicated in the table, the 
Present Indicative presents the following peculiarities : — 
1. It is used to denote a general truth, i.e. something true not 
merely in the present but at all times (‘Gnomic Present’) ; as, — 
virttis conciliat amicitias et cénservat, wirtue establishes ties of 
Sriendship and maintains them (i.e. always does so). 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  Tenses. 169 
2. It is used of an attempted action (‘Conative Present’); as, — 
dum vitant vitia, in contraria currunt, while they try to avoid 
(vitant) vices, they rush into opposite ones. 
3. In lively narration the Present is often used of a past action 
(‘Historical Present’) ; as, — 
Caesar Haeduis obsidés imperat, Caesar demanded hostages of the 
Haedui (lit. demands). 
4. In combination with jam, jam did, jam pridem, and similar 
words, the Present is frequently used of an action originating in the 
past and continuing in the present; as, — 
jam dit cupid té visere, / have long been desiring to visit you (z.e. 1 
desire and have long desired). 
Imperfect Indicative. 
260. 1. The Imperfect primarily denotes action going on 
tn past time ; as, — 
librum legébam, / was reading a book. 
a. This force makes the Imperfect especially adapted to serve 
as the tense of description (as opposed to mere zarration). 
2. From the notion of action going on, there easily develops the 
notion of repeated or customary action; as, — 
légat6s interrogabat, he kept asking the envoys ; 
puer C. Duilium vidébam, as a boy J often used to see Gaius Duilius. 
3. The Imperfect often denotes an attempted action (‘Conative Im- 
perfect’) or an action as beginning (‘ Inceptive Imperfect’) ; as, — 
hostés nostr6s intra miinitidnés progredi prohibébant, the enemy 
tried to prevent (prohibébant) our men from advancing within 
the fortifications (‘ Conative’) ; 
ad proelium sé expediébant, ‘hey were beginning to get ready for 
battle (‘Inceptive’). 
4. The Imperfect, with jam, jam dit, jam diidum, e/c., is some- 
times used of an action which had been continuing some time; as, — 
domicilium Rémae multés jam annés habébat, he had had his 
residence at Rome for many years (z.e. he had it at this time 
and had long had it). 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
170 Syntax. 
Future Indicative. 
261. 1. The Latin is much more exact in the use of the Future than 
is the English. We say: ‘ Zf he comes, / shall be glad, where we really 
mean: ‘/f he shall come, etc. In such cases the Latin rarely admits 
the Present, but generally employs the Future. 
2. Sometimes the Future has Imperative force; as, dicés, say! 
Perfect Indicative. 
262. A. PRESENT PERFECT. Several Present Perfects denote the 
state resulting from a completed act, and so seem equivalent to the 
Present ; as, — 
n6vi, cognivi, / know (lit. [have become acquainted with) ; 
cénsuévi, / az wont (lit. J have become accustomed). 
&. HIsTORICAL PERFECT. The Historical Perfect is the tense of 
narration (as opposed to the Imperfect, the tense of description); as, — 
Régulus in senatum vénit, mandata exposuit, reddi captiviés 
negavit esse fitile, Regulus came into the Senate, set forth his 
commission, said it was useless for captives to be returned. 
1. Occasionally the Historical Perfect is used of a general truth (‘Gnomic 
Perfect"). 
Pluperfect Indicative. 
263. The Latin Pluperfect, like the English Past Per- 
fect, denotes an act completed in the past ; as, — 
Caesar Rhénum transire décréverat, sed navés deerant, Caesar 
had decided to cross the Rhine, but had no boats. 
a. In those verbs whose Perfect has Present force (§ 262, 4), 
the Pluperfect has the force of an Imperfect; as, — 
noveram, / knew. 
Future Perfect Indicative. 
264. The Future Perfect denotes an action completed in 
Suture time. Thus:— 
scribam epistulam, cum redieris, / will write the letter when you 
have returned (lit. when you shall have returned). 
a, The Latin is much more exact in the use of the Future Per- 
fect than the English, which commonly employs the Present 
Perfect instead of the Future Perfect. 
4. In those verbs whose Perfect has Present force (§ 262, A) 
“the Future Perfect has the force of a Future; as, — 
néver6, J shall know. 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  Sequence of Tenses. 171 
Epistolary Tenses. 
265. In letters the writer often uses tenses which are not appro- 
priate at the time of writing, but which will be so at the time when his 
letter is received; he thus employs the Imperfect and the Perfect for 
the Present, and the Pluperfect for the Present Perfect; as, — 
nihil habébam quod scriberem, neque enim novi quidquam 
audieram et ad tuads omnés epistulas jam rescripseram, 7 
have nothing to write, for [ have heard no news and have 
already answered all your letters. 
TENSES OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE. 
266. A. In Independent Sentences. See §{ 272-280. 
B. In Dependent Sentences. In dependent sentences the 
tenses of the subjunctive usually conform to the so-called 
Sequence of Tenses. 
267. 1. In the Subjunctive the Present and Perfect are 
Principal tenses, the Imperfect and Pluperfect, Historical. 
2. By the Sequence of Tenses Principal tenses are fol- 
lowed by Principal, Historical by Historical. Thus :— 
PRINCIPAL SEQUENCE, — 
vided quid facias, 7 sce what you are doing. 
vidéb6 quid facias, / shall see what you are doing. 
vider6 quid facias, / shall have seen what you are doing. 
vides quid féceris, / see what you have done. 
vid&b6 quid féceris, / shall see what you have done. 
viders quid féceris, / shall have seen what you have done. 
HIsTORICAL SEQUENCE, — 
vidébam quid facerés, / saw what you were doing. 
vidi quid facerés, / saw what you were doing. 
videram quid facerés, / had seen what you were doing. 
vidébam quid fécissés, / saw what you had done. 
vidi quid fécissés, / saw what you had done. 
videram quid fécissés, / had seen what you had done. 
The Present and Imperfect Subjunctive denote incomplete 
Be the Perfect and Pluperfect completed action, exactly as in the 
Indicative.
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 Syntax. 
Peculiarities of Sequence. 
268. 1. The Perfect Indicative is usually an historical tense (even 
when translated in English as a Present Perfect), and so is followed by 
the Imperfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive; as, — 
déménstravi quaré ad causam accéderem, / have shown why I 
took the case (lit. I showed why, etc.). 
2. A dependent Perfect Infinitive is treated as an historical tense 
wherever, if resolved into an equivalent Indicative, it would be his- 
torical ; as, — 
videor ostendisse qualés dei essent, / seem to have shown of what 
nature the gods are (ostendisse here corresponds to an Indic- 
ative, ostendi, / showed ). 
3. The Historical Present is sometimes regarded as a principal 
tense, sometimes as historical. Thus :— 
Sulla sués hortatur ut forti animé sint, Sw//a exhorts his soldiers 
to be stout-hearted ; 
Gallds hortatur ut arma caperent, he exhorted the Gauls to take 
arms. 
4. Conditional sentences of the ‘contrary-to-fact’ type are not 
affected by the principles for the Sequence of Tenses; as, — 
honestum tale est ut vel si ign6rarent id hominés sua tamen 
pulchritiidine laudabile esset, virtue is such a thing that 
even if men were ignorant of it, it would still be worthy of 
praise for its own loveliness. ; 
5. In conditional sentences of the ‘contrary-to-fact’ type the Imper- 
fect Subjunctive is usually treated as an Historical tense; as, — 
si s6l6s eds dicerés miserés, quibus moriendum esset, néminem 
ti quidem edrum qui viverent exciperés, 7f you called only 
those wretched who must die, you would except no one of those 
who live. 
6. In clauses of Result and some others, the Perfect Subjunctive is 
sometimes used as an historical tense. Thus :— 
réx tantum m6tus est, ut Tissaphernem hostem jiidicarit, the 
king was so much moved that he adjudged Tissaphernes an 
enemy. 
This construction is rare in Cicero, but frequent in Nepos and sub- 
sequent historians. The Perfect Subjunctive in this use represents a
-P-A-G-E-181
  Sequence of Tenses. 173. 
result simply as a fact without reference to the continuance of the act, 
and therefore corresponds to an Historical Perfect Indicative of direct 
statement. Thus, jidicdrit in the above example corresponds to 
a jiidicavit, he adjudged. To denote a result as something continuous, 
all writers use the Imperfect Subjunctive after historical tenses. 
7. Sometimes perspicuity demands that the ordinary principles of 
Sequence be abandoned altogether. Thus: — 
@) We may have the Present or Perfect Subjunctive after an 
historical tense; as, — 
Verrés Siciliam ita perdidit ut ea restitul nGn possit, 
Verres so ruined Sicily that it cannot be restored 
(Direct statement; n6n potest restitui) ; 
ardébat Horténsius dicendi cupiditate sic, ut in nillo 
flagrantius studium viderim, Hortensius burned so 
with eagerness to speak that I have seen in no one a 
greater desire (Direct statement: in niill6 vidi, / have 
seen in no one). 
Norte. — This usage is different from that cited under 6, Here, by neglect of 
Sequence, the Perfect is used shonehy a principal tense ; there the Perfect was used 
as an historical tense. 
5) We may have a principal tense followed by the Perfect Sub- 
junctive used historically ; as, — 
nescid quid causae fuerit cir nillas ad mé litteras 
darés, / do not know what reason there was why you 
did not send me a letter. 
Here fuerit is historical, as is shown by the following Im- 
perfect Subjunctive. 
Method of Expressing Future Time in the Subjunctive. 
269. The Future and Future Perfect which are lacking 
to the Latin Subjunctive are supplied in subordinate 
clauses as follows : — 
I. @) The Future is supplied by the Present after principal tenses, 
by the Imperfect after historical tenses. 
6) The Future Perfect is supplied by the Perfect after principal 
tenses, by the Pluperfect after historical tenses. 
This is especially frequent when the context clearly shows, 
by the presence of a future tense in the main clause, that the 
reference is to future time. Thus :—
-P-A-G-E-182
{ 
174 Syntax. 
Galli pollicentur sé factirés, quae Caesar imperet, the Gazls 
promise they will do what Caesar shall order ; | 
Galli pollicébantur sé factiirds, quae Caesar imperaret, the Gauls 
promised they would do what Caesar should order ; 
Galli pollicentur sé factiir6s quae Caesar imperaverit, tie Gauls 
promise they will do what Caesar shall have ordered ; 
Galli pollicébantur sé factiirds quae Caesar imperavisset, the 
Gauls promised they would do what Caesar should have ordered. 
2. Even where the context does not contain a Future tense in the 
main clause, Future time is often expressed in the subordinate clauses 
by the Present and Imperfect Subjunctive. Thus :— 
times né veniat, / am afraid he will come ; 
Caesar exspectabat quid cGnsili hostés caperent, Caesar was 
waiting to see what plan the enemy would adopt.   3. Where greater definiteness is necessary the periphrastic forms 
in -irus sim and -iirus essem are employed, especially in clauses of 
Result, Indirect Questions, and after n6n Gubité quin; as, — 
n6n dubit6 quin pater ventiirus sit, / do not doubt that my father 
will come; 
n6n dubitabam quin pater ventiirus esset, / did not doubt that 
my father would come. 
4. Where the verb has no Future Active Participle, or where it 
stands in the passive voice, its Future character may be indicated by 
the use of the particles mox, brevi, statim, éfc., in connection with 
the Present and Imperfect Subjunctive; as, — 
n6én dubit6 quin té mox hiijus rei paeniteat, / dv not doubt that 
you will soon repent of this thing ; 
n6n dubitabam quin haec rés brevi cdnficerétur, 7 did not doubt 
that this thing would soon be finished. 
TENSES OF THE INFINITIVE. 
270. 1. The tenses of the Infinitive denote time not 
absolutely, but wth reference to the verb on which they 
depend. Thus:— 
a) The Present Infinitive represents an act as contemporaneous 
with the time of the verb on which it depends; as, — 
vidétur honGrés adsequi, he seems to be gaining honors ; 
vidébatur honGrés adsequl, Xe seemed to be gaining honors.
-P-A-G-E-183
  Tenses of the Ynfinitive. 175 
6) The Perfect Infinitive represents an act as Prior fo the time 
of the verb on which it depends; as, — 
vidétur honGrés adseciitus esse, he seems to have gained 
honors ; 
visus est honGrés adseciitus esse, he seemed to have 
gained honors. 
¢) The Future Infinitive represents an act as subsequent to that 
of the verb on which it depends; as, — 
vidétur honGrés adsecitiirus esse, he seems to be about to 
gain honors ; 
visus est hon6drés adsecitiirus esse, he seemed to be about 
to gain honors. ‘ 
2. Where the English says ‘ ought to have done, ‘might have done, 
etc., the Latin uses débui, oportuit, potul (débébam, oportébat, 
poteram), with the Present Infinitive; as,— 
débuit dicere, he ought to have said (lit. owed it to say); 
oportuit venire, he ought to have come; 
potuit vidére, he might have seen. 
a, Oportuit, vol6,n6516 (and in poetry some other verbs), may take a 
Perfect Infinitive instead of the Present; as, — 
hdc jam pridem factum esse oportuit, ‘his ought long ago to 
have been done. 
3. PERIPHRASTIC FUTURE INFINITIVE. Verbs that have no Parti- 
cipial Stem express the Future Infinitive Active and Passive by fore 
ut or futiirum esse ut, with the Subjunctive; as, — 
spér6 fore ut té paeniteat levitatis, / hofe you will repent of your 
Jickleness (lit. hope it will happen that you repent) ; 
spér6 futirum esse ut hostés arceantur, / hope that the enemy will 
be kept off. 
a. The Periphrastic Future Infinitive is often used, especially in the 
Passive, even in case of verbs which have the Participial Stem; as, — 
sp6r6 fore ut hostés vincantur, / hope the enemy will be con- 
quered. 
4. Passives and Deponents sometimes form a Future Perfect Infini- 
tive with fore; as, — 
spér6 epistulam scriptam fore, / hope the letter will have been 
written 3 
put6 mé omnia adeptum fore, / ¢hink that I shall have gained 
everything.

THE MOODS. 
MOODS IN INDEPENDENT SENTENCES. 
The Indicative in Independent Sentences. 
271. The Indicative is used for the statement of facts, 
the supposition of facts, or inquiry after facts. 
1. Note the following idiomatic uses : — 
@) With possum; as, — 
possum multa dicere, / might say much; 
poteram multa dicere, / might have said much (§ 270, 2). 
6) In such expressions as longum est, aequum est, melius 
est, difficile est, itilius est, and some others; as, — 
longum est ea dicere, zt would be tedious to tell that ; 
difficile est omnia persequi, 7 would be difficult to enu- 
merate everything. 
The Subjunctive in Independent Sentences. 
272. The Subjunctive is used in Independent Sentences 
to express something — 
I. As willed — Volitive Subjunctive ; 
2. As desired —Optative Subjunctive; 
3. Conceived of as possible — Potential Subjunctive. 
VOLITIVE SUBJUNCTIVE. 
273. The Volitive Subjunctive represents the action as 
willed. It always implies authority on the part of the 
speaker, and has the following varieties :— 
A, HORTATORY SUBJUNCTIVE, 
274. The Hortatory Subjunctive expresses an exhor- 
tation. This use is confined to the first person plural, 
of the Present. The negative is né. Thus :— 
eamus, let us go; 
amémus patriam, Jet us love our country 3 
né déspérémus, /et us not despair.
-P-A-G-E-185
     
     
        
      
        
           The Volitive Subjunctive. 177 
   B, JUSSIVE SUBJUNCTIVE. 
275. The Jussive Subjunctive expresses a command. 
The Jussive stands regularly in the Present Tense, and 
is used.— 
1. Most frequently in the third singular and third plural; as, — 
dicat, det him tell; 
dicant, /et themz tell ; 
quaré sécédant improbi, wherefore let the wicked depart! 
2. Less frequently in the second person, often with indefinite 
force; as, — vd 
ist bond itare, use that advantage 3 
modesté vivas, live temperately. 
C. PROHIBITIVE SUBJUNCTIVE, 
276. The Subjunetive is used in the second and third 
persons singular and plural, with né, to express a prohibi- 
tion. Both Present and Perfect occur, and without appre- 
ciable difference of meaning; as, — 
né repugnétis, do not resist ! 
tii vér6d istam né reliqueris, don’t leave her! 
impii né placare audeant des, /et not the impious dare to 
appease the gods! 
a, Neither of these constructions is frequent in classical prose. 
6. Acommoner method of expressing a prohibition in the second 
person is by the use of n6li (ndlite) with a following infini- 
tive, or by cavé or cavé né with the Subjunctive ; as, — 
n6li héc facere, don’t do this (lit. be unwilling to do)! 
n6lite mentiri, do not le! 
cavé igndscas, cavé té misereat, do not forgive, do not 
aty ! : 
bale a haec facias, do not do this (lit. take care lest 
you do)! 
D, DELIBERATIVE SUBJUNCTIVE. 
277. The Deliberative Subjunctive is used 7 questions 
and exclamations implying doubt, indignation, the impos- 
sibility of an act, obligation, or propriety. The Present is 
   
-P-A-G-E-186
   
          
  178 Syntax. 
  used referring to present time, the Imperfect referring 
to past. The negative is nin. Thus:— 
quid faciam, what shall [ do? 
ego redeam, / go back! 
huic cédamus ! hijus condiciénés audiamus! are we to 
bow to him! are we to listen to his terms! 
quid facerem, w/at was / to do? 
hunc ego non diligam, should / not cherish this man ? 
a. These Deliberative Questions are usually purely Rhetorical in char- 
acter, and do not expect an answer. 
£. CONCESSIVE 
  JUNCTIVE.   
278. The Subjunctive is used to indicate something as 
granted or conceded for the sake of argument. The Present 
is used for present time, the Perfect regularly for past. 
The negative is né. Thus:— 
sit h6c vérum, / grant that this zs true (lit. let this be true); 
né sint in senectiite virés, / grant there is not strength in old age. 
fuerit malus civis aliis; tibi quandé esse coepit, / grant that he 
was a bad citizen to others ; when did he begin to be so toward you? 
OPTATIVE SUBJUNCTIVE. 
279. The Optative Subjunctive occurs in expressions of 
wishing. The negative is regularly né. 
1. The Present Tense, often accompanied by utinam, is used where 
the wish is conceived of as fosszble. 
di istaec prohibeant, may the gods prevent that! 
falsus utinam vatés sim, of that J may be a false prophet! 
né veniant, may they not come! 
2. The Imperfect expresses, in the form of a wish, the regret that 
something is not so now; the Pluperfect that something was not so zn 
the past. The Imperfect and Pluperfect are regularly accompanied by 
utinam ; as,— 
utinam istud ex animé dicerés, would that you were saying that in 
earnest, (.e. 1 regret that you are not saying it in earnest) ; 
Pélidés utinam vitasset Apollinis arctis, would that Achilles had 
escaped the bow of Apollo; 
utinam né natus essem, would that J had not been born.     
   
-P-A-G-E-187
  The Potential Subjunctive. 179 
POTENTIAL SUBJUNCTIVE. 
280. The Potential Subjunctive expresses a fossibility. 
The negative isndn. The following uses are to be noted: — 
1. The ‘May’ Potential. — The Potential Subjunctive may desig- 
nate a mere possibility (English auxiliary may). Both Present and 
Perfect occur, and without appreciable difference of meaning. Thus:— 
dicat aliquis, some one may say ; 
dixerit aliquis, some one may say. 
a. This construction is by no means frequent, and is confined 
mainly to a few phrases like those given as examples. 
2. ‘Should’-‘ Would’ Potential.— The Potential Subjunctive 
may represent something as depending upon a condition expressed or 
understood (English auxiliary should, would). Both Present and Per- 
fect occur, and without appreciable difference of meaning. Thus :— 
fortiinam citius reperias quam retineas, ove would more quickly find 
Fortune than keep it (z.e. if one should make the trial) ; 
crédiderim, / should believe. 
a. Here belongs the use of velim, m&lim, nélim, as softened 
forms of statement for vol6, mal6, n616. Thus: — 
velim mihi ignéscas, / wish you would forgive me; 
n6lim putés mé jocari, / don’t want you to think I’m joking. 
&. When the condition is expressed, we get one of the regular 
types of Conditional Sentences (see § 303); as, — 
diés déficiat, si cOner 6numerdre causas, “ime would 
fail if I should attempt to enumerate the reasons. 
3. ¢Can’-‘Could’ Potential.—In the Present and Imperfect the 
Potential occurs in the second person singular (with zdefinite force ; 
§ 356, 3) of a few verbs of perceiving, seeing, thinking, and the like ; as,— 
videds, cernas, ove can see, one can perceive; 
eréderés, one could believe ; 
vidérés, cernerés, ove could see, perceive ; 
putarés, one could imagine. 
4. The Imperfect and Pluperfect in the Apodosis of conditional 
sentences of the contrary-to-fact type (see § 304) are also Potential in 
character. By omission of the Protasis, such an Apodosis sometimes 
stands alone, particularly vellem, néllem, mallem ; as, — 
vellem id quidem, / should wish that (i.e. were I bold 
enough). 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  180 Syntax. 
The Imperative. 
281. The Imperative is used in commands, admonitions, 
and entreaties (negative né); as, — 
&gredere ex urbe, depart from the city ; 
mihi ignésce, pardon me ; 
valé, farewell. 
1. The Present is the tense of the Imperative most commonly used, 
but the Future is employed — 
a) Where there is a distinct reference to future time, especially 
in the apodosis of conditional sentences ; as, — 
rem vobis prépénam; vés eam penditote, / will lay the 
matter before you; do you (then) consider it ; 
si bene disputabit, tribuit6 litteris Graecis, if he shall 
speak well, attribute it to Greek literature. 
6) In laws, treaties, wills, maxims, e¢c. ; as, — 
cénsulés summum jiis habenté, the consuls shall have 
supreme power ; 
hominem mortuom in urbe né sepelité, o one shall bury 
a dead body in the city ; 
amicitia régi Antioch6 cum popul6 R6man6 his légi- 
bus et condiciGnibus est6, let there be friendship be- 
tween Antiochus and the Roman people on the following 
terms and conditions ; 
quartae est6 partis Marcus hérés, /e¢ Marcus be heir to 
a fourth (of the property) 3 
ignGscit6 saepe alteri, numquam tibi, forgive your neigh- 
bor often, yourself never. 
2. Except with the Future Imperative the negative is not used in 
classical prose. Prohibitions are regularly expressed in other ways. 
See § 276, 4 
3. Questions in the Indicative introduced by quin (why not?) are 
often equivalent to an Imperative or to the Hortatory Subjunctive; as, —    
  quin abis, go away! (lit. why don’t you go away?) ; 
quin vécem continétis, keep still! (lit. why dowt you stop your 
voices ?) 3 
quin equés cénscendimus, det us mount our horses (lit. why do we 
not mount our horses ?). 2

Clauses of Purpose. 181 
MOODS IN DEPENDENT CLAUSES. 
Clauses of Purpose. 
1. Clauses of Purpose are introduced most com- 
monly by ut (uti), qué (Zhat, 7x order that), nb (in order that 
not, lest), and stand in the Subjunctive; as, — 
edimus, ut vivamus, we cat that we may live ; 
adjita mé qu6 hoc fiat facilius, help me, in order that this may be 
done more easily ; : 
portas clausit, né quam oppidani injiiriam acciperent, he closed 
the gates, lest the townspeople should receive any injury. 
a Qué, as a rule, is employed only when the purpose clause 
contains a comparative or a comparative idea. Occasional 
exceptions occur; as, — 
haec faciunt qué Chremétem absterreant, they are doing 
this in order to frighten Chremes. 
Ut né is sometimes found instead of né. Thus:— F 
ut né quid neglegenter agamus, zz order that we may not 
do anything carelessly. 
Ut n6n (not né) is used where the negation belongs to some 
single word, instead of to the purpose clause as a whole. 
Thus : — 
ut n6n éjectus ad aliénés, sed invitatus ad tu6s vide- 
Gre, that you may seem not driven out among strangers, 
but invited to your own friends. 
To say ‘and that not? or ‘or that not, the Latin regularly 
uses néve (new) ; as, — 
ut efrum rérum vis minuerétur, neu ponti nocérent, 
that the violence of these things might be lessened, and 
that they might not harm the bridge ; 
profiigit, né caperétur néve interficerétur, he fied, that he 
might not be captured or killed. 
But neque (for néve) is sometimes used in a second Purpose Clause 
when ut stands in the first, and, after the Augustan era, even when the 
first clause is introduced by né, 
Purpose Clauses sometimes stand in apposition with a preceding noun 
or pronoun; as,— 
hac causa, ut pacem habé6rent, on this account, that they might 
have peace.
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 Syntax. 
2. A Relative Pronoun (qui) or Adverb (ubi, unde, qu6) is fre- 
quently used to introduce a Purpose Clause; as, — 
Helvétii légatds mittunt, qui dicerent, she Helvetiz sent envoys to 
say (lit. who should say) 3 
haec habui, dé senectiite quae dicerem, / had these things to say 
about old age; 
non habébat qu6 fugeret, he had no place to which to flee (lit. whither 
he might flee). 
a. Qui in such clauses is equivalent to ut is, ut ego, efc.; ubi to ut 
ibi; unde to ut inde; qué to ut ed. 
3- Relative clauses of purpose follow dignus, indignus, and ido- 
neus ; as, — 
id6neus fuit ném6 quem imitarére, there was no one suitable for 
you to imitate (cf. ném6 fuit quem imitarére, there was no 
one for you to imitate) ; 
dignus est qui aliquand6 imperet, he zs worthy to rule sometime. 
4. Purpose Clauses often depend upon something to be supplied 
from the context instead of upon the principal verb of their own sen- 
tences ; as, — 
ut haec omnia omittam, abiimus, fo fass over ail this, ({ will say 
that) we departed. 
Clauses of Characteristic. ~ 
283. 1. A relative clause used to express a quality or 
characteristic of a general or indefinite antecedent is called 
a Clause of Characteristic, and usually stands in the 
Subjunctive ; as, — 
multa sunt, quae mentem acuant, ¢here are many things which 
sharpen the wits. 
Clauses of Characteristic are opposed to those relative clauses which 
are used merely to state some fact about a definite antecedent, and 
which therefore take the Indicative; as, — 
Caté, senex jiicundus, qui Sapiéns appellatus est, Ca/o, a delight- 
Sul old man, who was called ‘The Wise. 
The Clause of Characteristic implies ‘a person of the sort that does 
something’ ; the Indicative relative clause implies ‘a particular person 
who does something.
-P-A-G-E-191
  Clauses of Characteristic. 183 
2. Clauses of Characteristic are used especially after such expressions 
as, est qui; sunt qui; ném6 est qui; nillus est qui; tnus est 
qui; sdlus est qui; quis est qui; is qui; ec. Thus:— 
  sunt qui dicant, ¢here are (some) who say; 
ném6 est qui putet, there is nobody who thinks; 
sapientia est ina quae maestitiam pellat, p/zlosophy is the only 
thing that drives away sorrow 3 
quae civitas est quae nén éverti possit, what state is there that 
cannot be overthrown ? 
n6én is sum qui improbés laudem, / am not the sort of man that 
praises the wicked. | 
a, Sometimes (very rarely in Cicero and Caesar) the clause of characteris- 
tic is used after comparatives; as,— 
n6n longius hostés aberant quam qué télum adigi posset, 
the enemy were not too far off for a dart to reach them (lit. further 
off than [a point] to which a dart could be cast). 
3- The Clause of Characteristic often conveys an accessory notion 
of cause (since) or opposition (although). Thus:— 
@) Cause. The relative is then frequently accompanied by ut 
quippe, utpote; as,— “ 
6 fortiinate aduléscéns, qui tuae virtitis Homérum 
praec6nem invéneris, O fortunate man, since you 
have found a Homer as the herald of your valor 3 
ut qui optimSd jire eam pr6vinciam obtinuerit, sce 
he held that province by excellent right. 
4) Opposition : — 
egomet qui sér6 Graecas litteras attigissem, tamen 
complirés diés Athénis commoratus sum, /, a/- 
though I had taken up Greek literature late in life, 
nevertheless tarried several days at Athens. 
4. Clauses of Characteristic may also be introduced by quin = qui 
(quae, quod) n6én; as, — 
ném6 est quin saepe audierit, ‘here is no one who has not often 
heard; 
ném6 fuit militum quin vulnerarétur, éhere was no one of the soldiers 
who was not wounded. 
5. Related to Clauses of Characteristic are also phrases of the type: 
quod sciam, so far as J know; quod audierim, so far as J have 
heard.

184 Syntar, | 3 
Clauses of Result. 
284. 1. Clauses of Result are usually introduced by ut 
(that, so that), negative ut nén (so that not), and take the 
Subjunctive. The main clause often contains tantus, talis, 
tot, is (= talis), tam, ita, sic, sgteo, or some similar word. 
Thus :— : 
quis tam déméns est ut sua voluntate maereat, who zs so senseless 
as to mourn of his own volition ? 
Siciliam ita vastavit ut restitul in antiquum statum n6n possit, 
he has so ravaged Sicily that it cannot be restored to its former 
condition ; 
m6ns altissimus impendébat, ut facile perpauci prohibére pos- 
sent, a very high mountain overhung, so that a very few could 
easily stop them; 
n6n is es ut té pudor umquam 4 turpitiidine avocarit, you are not 
( so constituted that shame ever called you back from baseness. 
2. A Result Clause is often introduced by a Relative Pronoun or 
Adverb, qui (= ut is), qu6 (= ut e6), e/c. ; as, — 
ném6 est tam senex qui sé annum n6n putet posse vivere, nobody 
zs so old as not to think he will live a year 3 
habétis eum coOnsulem qui parére vestris décrétis nén dubitet, 
you have a consul such as does not hesitate to obey your decrees. 
a. These Relative Clauses of Result are closely related to the Clause of 
Characteristic, and sometimes it is difficult to distinguish the two con- 
structions. It is best to class the relative clause as one of Characteristic, 
unless the result idea is clear and unmistakable. 
3. Result clauses may also be introduced by quin = ut n6n; as, — 
nihil tam difficile est quin quaerend6 invéstigari possit, nothing 
ts so-difficult that it cannot be discovered by searching ; 
ném6 est tam fortis quin rei novitate perturbétur, zo ove zs so 
steadfast as not to be thrown into confusion by a strange 
occurrence. Re 
4. Note the use of quam ut (sometimes quam alone) to denote Result 
after comparatives; as, — 
urbs erat miinitior quam ut primé impetii capi posset, the city was too 
strongly fortified to be taken at the first attack (lit. more strongly a 
than (so] that it could be taken, etc.).
-P-A-G-E-193
  Causal Clauses. 185 
Causal Clauses. 
285. Causal clauses are introduced chiefly by the fol- 
lowing particles :— 
I. Quod, quia, quoniam, 
2. Cum, 
3- Quand. 
286. The use of moods is as follows: — 
I. Quod, quia, quoniam take the Indicative when the 
reason is that of the writer or speaker; they take the Sub- 
junctive when the reason is viewed as that of another. 
Thus: — 
Parthés timed quod diffid6 cdpiis nostris, 7 fear the Parthians, 
because I distrust our troops. 
Themistoclés, quia n6n titus erat, Corcyram démigravit, Z/he- 
mistocles, since he was not safe, moved to Corcyra. 
neque mé vixisse paenitet, quoniam bene vixi, / do not regret 
having lived, since I have lived well. 
SScratés acciisatus est quod corrumperet juventiitem, Socrates 
was arraigned on the ground that he was corrupting the young. 
(Here the reason is not that of the writer but of the accuser. 
Hence the Subjunctive.) 
Haedui Caesari gratias égérunt, quod sé periculd liberavisset, 
the Haedui thanked Caesar because he had delivered them from 
danger. (The reason of the Haedui.) 
quoniam Miltiadés dicere nén posset, verba pr6 e6 fécit Ti- 
sagoras, sézce Miltiades could not speak, Tisagoras spoke for 
him. (The reason of Tisagoras.) 
noctii ambulabat Themistoclés, quod somnum capere n6n pos- 
set, Themistocles used to walk at night because (as he said) he 
+ couldn't sleep. 
a. Verbs of thinking and saying often stand in the Subjunctive 
in causal clauses as though the act of thinking or saying, 
and not the contents of the thought or language, constituted 
the reason. Thus: — 
Bellovaci suum numerum n6n complévérunt, quod sé 
su6 ndmine cum R6mAanis bellum gestiirds dice- 
rent, the Bellovact did not furnish their complement,
-P-A-G-E-194
186 Syntax. 
because they said they were going to wage war with the 
Romans on their own account. 
6. N6n quod, nén qué (by attraction for n6n eG quod), nén 
quia, not that, not because; and nén quod n6én, ndn qué 
)n6n, n6n quin, wot that... not; not because... not; 
not but that, are usually employed merely to introduce a 
hypothetical reason, and hence take the Subjunctive ; as, — 
id féci, ndn quod vés hanc défénsidnem désiderare 
arbitrarer, sed ut omnés intellegerent, ¢hzs J did, 
not because I thought you needed this defense, but that 
all might perceive 3 
Crass6 commendati6nem n6én sum pollicitus, nén quin 
eam valitiram apud té arbitrarer, sed egére mihi 
commendati6ne nin vidébatur, / did not promise a 
recommendation to Crassus, not that I did not think it 
would have weight with you, but because he did not seem 
to me to need recommendation. 
¢. But clauses introduced by nén quod, nén quia take the 
Indicative 7 they state a fact, even though that fact is denied 
to be the reason for something; as, — 
hGc ita sentid, n6n quia sum ipse augur, sed quia sic 
existimare nds est necesse, this / think, not because I 
am myself an augur (which I really am), but because it 
ts necessary for us to think so. 
2. Cum causal regularly takes the Subjunctive; as, — 
quae cum ita sint, since this zs so; 
cum sis mortalis, quae mortalia sunt, ciira, szwce you are mortal, 
care for what is mortal. 
@. Note the phrase cum praesertim (praesertim cum), 
especially since; as, — 
Haedu6s accisat, praesertim cum edrum precibus ad- 
ductus bellum suscéperit, Ze blamed the Haedui, 
especially since he had undertaken the war at their 
entreaties. 
3- Quand6 (less frequent than the other causal particles) governs 
the Indicative; as, — 
id omitt6, quand6 vibis ita placet, / pass over that, since you so 
wish. 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  Clauses with Postquam, Ubi, efc. 187 
Temporal Clauses introduced by Postquam, Ut, Ubi, 
Simul ac, etc. 
287. 1. Postquam (postedquam), after; ut, ubi, when ; 
cum primum, simul, simul ac (simul atque), as soon as, when 
used to refer 40 a single past act regularly take the Perfect 
Indicative ; as, — 
Epamin6ndas postquam audivit vicisse BoeStiss, ‘Satis’ inquit 
‘vixi, Epaminondas, after he heard that the Boeotians had con- 
quered, said, ‘I have lived enough ;’ 
id ut audivit, Corcyram démigravit, when he heard this, he moved 
to Corcyra; 
Caesar cum primum potuit, ad exercitum contendit, Caesar, as 
soon as he could, hurried to the army 3 
ubi dé Caesaris adventi certiGrés facti sunt, légat6s ad eum 
mittunt, when they were informed of Caesar's arrival, they 
sent envoys to hint. 
a. The Historical Present may take the place of the Perfect in this con- 
struction, 
2. To denote the repeated occurrence of an act, ut, ubi, simul 
atque, as often as, when following an historical tense, take the Plu- 
perfect Indicative (compare §§ 288, 3; 302, 3); as,— 
ut quisque Verris animum offenderat, in lautumias statim coni- 
ciébatur, whenever anybody had offended Verres’s feelings, he 
was forthwith put in the stone-quarry 3 
hostés, ubi aliqu6s égredientés cGnspexerant, adoriébantur, 
whenever the enemy had seen any men disembarking, they 
attacked them. 
a. In Livy and succeeding historians the Imperfect and Pluperfect Sub- 
junctive are used to denote this repeated occurrence of an act (‘ Indefi- 
nite Frequency’); as,— 
id ubi dixisset, hastam mittébat, whenever he had said that, he 
hurled a spear. 
3. Occasionally the above ‘conjunctions are followed by the Pluper- 
fect Indicative of a single occurrence. This is regularly the case with 
postquam in expressions denoting a definite interval of time (days, 
months, years, e/c.), such as post tertium annum quam, triennid 
postquam. Thus:— 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
188 Syntax. 
quinque post diébus quam Liica discesserat, ad Sardiniam vénit, 
jive days after he had departed from Luca he came to Sar- 
dinia; 
postquam occupatae Syrdciisae erant, profectus est Cartha- 
ginem, after Syracuse had been seized, he set out for Carthage. 
4. The Imperfect Indicative also sometimes occurs to denote a continued 
state ; as,— 
postquam ROmam adventabant, sena&tus consultus est, after they were 
on the march towards Rome, the Senate was consulted ; 
postquam striicti utrimque stabant, after they had been drawn up on both 
sides and were in position, 
5. Rarely postquam, posteaquam, following the analogy of cum, take 
the Subjunctive, but only in the historical tenses; as, ~ 
posteaquam simptudsa fleri finera coepissent, lége sublata sunt, 
after funerals had begun to be elaborate, they were done away with by law. 
Temporal Clauses introduced by Cum. 
A, Cum REFERRING TO THE PAST. 
288. 1. Cum, when referring to the past, takes — 
A. The Indicative (Imperfect, Historical Perfect, or 
Pluperfect) to denote the point of time at which something 
occurs. 
B. The Subjunctive (Imperfect or Pluperfect) to de- 
note the situation or circumstances under which something 
occurs. 
Examples : — 
INDICATIVE. 
an tum eras cénsul, cum in Palatis mea domus ardébat, or were 
you consul at the time when my house burned up on the Palatine? 
créd6 tum cum Sicilia florébat opibus et cépiis magna artificia 
fuisse in ea insula, / deleve that at the time when Sicily was 
powerful in riches and resources there were great crafts in that 
island ; 
ed tempore paruit cum parére necesse erat, ie obeyed at the time 
when it was necessary to obey ; 
ill6 dié, cum est lata léx dé mé, on that day when the law concern- 
ing me was passed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  
Cum-Clauses. 189 
SUBJUNCTIVE. 
Lysander cum vellet Lyciirgi légés commitare, prohibitus est, 
when Lysander desired to change the laws of Lycurgus, he was 
prevented ; 
Pythagoraés cum in gedmetria quiddam novi invénisset, Misis 
bovem immolasse dicitur, when Pythagoras had discovered 
something new in geometry, he is said to have sacrificed an ox to 
the Muses. C 
a. Note that the Indicative is much less frequent in such clauses 
than the Subjunctive, and is regularly confined to those cases 
where the main clause has tum, e6 dié, eS ann6, ed tem- 
pore or some similar correlative of the cum. Sometimes it 
depends entirely upon the point of view of the writer whether 
he shall employ the Indicative or Subjunctive. 
2. When the logical order of the clauses is inverted, we find cum 
with the Perfect Indicative or Historical Present, in the sense of when, 
when suddenly. The main clause in such cases often has jam, vix, 
aegré, n6ndum ; as, — 
jam Galli ex oppid6 fugere apparabant, cum matrés familiae 
repente pr6currérunt, the Gauls were already preparing to 
flee, when suddenly the matrons rushed forth (logically, the ma- 
trons rushed forth as the Gauls were preparing to flee) ; 
Tréviri Labiénum adoriri parabant, cum duas legi6nés vénisse 
cognéscunt, the Treviri were preparing to attack, when (sud- 
denly) they learned that two legions had arrived. 
3. To denote a recurring action in the past, cum is followed by the In- 
dicative, particularly of the Pluperfect (compare §§ 287, 2 ; 302, 3) ; as, — 
cum ad aliquod oppidum vénerat, eddem lectica ad cubiculum 
déferébatur, whenever he had arrived at some town, he was 
(always) carried in the same litter to his room 3 
cum equitatus noster sé in agrés 6jécerat, essedarids ex silvis 
&mittébat, whenever our cavalry had advanced into the fields, 
he would send his chartoteers out from the woods. 
a. Sometimes the Imperfect or Pluperfect Subjunctive is thus used; as, — 
saepe cum aliquem vidéret minus bene vestitum, suum 
amiculum dedit, often, whenever he saw some one more poorly 
clothed, he gave him his own mantle ; 
cum proécucurrissent, Numidae effugiébant, as often as they 
had advanced, the Numidians ran away. 
This construction is frequent in Livy and subsequent historians.
-P-A-G-E-198
} , ET LE TYEE 
190 Syntax. 
B. Cum REFERRING TO THE PRESENT OR FUTURE. 
289. When cum refers to the Present or Future it regu. 
larly takes the Indicative; as, — 
tum tua rés agitur, pariés cum proximus 4rdet, your own interests 
are at stake when your neighbor's house is burning 3 
cum vidébis, tum sciés, when you see, then you will know. 
a. The Indicative of the Present or Future may denote also a recurring 
action ; as,— 
stabilitas amicitiae cOnfirmari potest, cum hominés cu- 
Pidinibus imper&bunt, firm friendship can be established 
whenever men shall control their desires. 
C. OTHER USEs oF Cum, 
290. 1. Cum Explicative. ‘Cum, with the Indicative, is some- 
times used to indicate the identity of one act with another; as, — 
cum tacent, clamant, ‘heir silence is a shout (lit. when they are 
silent, they shout). 
2. Cum...tum. When cum... tum mean doth... and, 
the cum-clause is in the Indicative; but when cum has the force of 
while, though, it may take the Subjunctive; as, — 
cum té semper diléxerim, tum tuis factis incénsus sum, while / 
have always loved you, at the same time I am incensed at 
your conduct. 
Clauses introduced by Antequam and Priusquam. 
A, WITH THE INDICATIVE. 
291. Antequam and priusquam (often written ante .. 
quam, prius . . . quam) take the Indicative to denote ax 
actual fact. j 
1. Sontetimes the Present or Future Perfect; as, — 
prius respondés quam rogé, you answer before J ask; 
nihil contra disputab6 priusquam dixerit, / will say nothing in 
opposition, before he speaks. 
2. Sometimes the Perfect, especially after negative clauses; as, — 
n6n prius jugulandi finis fuit, quam Sulla omnés suds divitiis 
explévit, there was no end of murder until Sulla satisfied all 
his henchmen with wealth.
-P-A-G-E-199
Clauses with Dum, Donec, etc. IQ 
B, WITH THE SUBJUNCTIVE, 
292. Antequam and priusquam take the Subjunctive to 
denote an act as anticipated. 
1. Thus the Subjunctive may denote — 
a) Anact in preparation for which the main act takes place ; as,— 
priusquam dimicarent, foedus ictum est, z.c. 77 anticipa- 
tion of the fight, a treaty was struck. 
By an extension of this usage, the Subjunctive is sometimes used of general 
truths, where the anticipatory notion has faded out; as, — 
tempestas minatur antequam surgat, che tempest threatens before it rises. 
5) An act anticipated and forestalled ; as, — 
7 priusquam télum adicI posset, omnis aciés terga vertit, 
before a spear could be hurled, the whole army fled. 
c) Anact anticipated and deprecated ; as, — 
animum omittunt priusquam locé démigrent, they die 
rather than quit their post. 
2. After historical tenses the Imperfect Subjunctive is used, espe- 
cially by post-Augustan writers, where the notion of anticipation has 
practically vanished ; as, — 
861 antequam'sé abderet fugientem vidit Ant6nium, the sux before 
it set saw Antony fleeing. 
Clauses introduced by Dum, Donec, Quoad. 
293. I. Dum, whzle, regularly takes the Indicative of 
the Historical Present; as, — 
Alexander, dum inter primGrés pugnat, sagitta Ictus est, d/ex- 
ander, while he was fighting in the van, was struck by an arrow}; 
dum haec geruntur, in finés Venell6rum pervénit, w/zle these 
things were being done, he arrived in the territory of the Venelli. 
II. Dum, dénec, and.quoad, as long as, take the Indica- 
tive; as, — 
dum anima est, spés est, as long as there is life, there is hope; 
Lacedaemoniérum géns fortis fuit, dum Lycirgi légés vigébant, 
the race of the Lacedaemonians was powerful, as long as the laws 
of Lycurgus were in force $ 
Caté, quoad vixit, virtiitum laude crévit, Cato, as long as he lived, 
increased in the fame of his virtues.
-P-A-G-E-200
192 Syntax. 
III. Dum, dénec, and quoad, wil, take: — 
1. The Indicative, to denote az actual event ; as, — 
dénec rediit, fuit silentium, there was silence till he came ; 
ferrum in corpore retinuit, quoad reniintiatum est Boedtids 
vicisse, he kept the iron in his body until word was brought that 
the Boeotians had conquered. 
a. In Livy and subsequent historians dum and d6nec in this sense often 
take the Subjunctive instead of the Indicative; as, — 
trepidatisnis aliquantum 6débant ddnec timor quiétem 
fécisset, they showed some trepidation, until fear produced quiet. 
2. The Subjunctive, to denote anticipation or expec- 
tancy ; as, — 
exspectavit Caesar dum navés convenirent, Caesar waited for the 
ships to assemble 3 
dum hostés veniant, morabor, / shall wazt for the enemy to come. 
Substantive Clauses. 
294. A Substantive Clause is one which as a whole 
serves as the Subject or Object of a verb, or stands in some 
other case relation. 
A. Substantive Clauses Developed from the Volitive. 
295. Substantive Clauses Developed from the Volitive 
are used with the following classes of verbs : — 
1. With verbs signifying 2o admonish, request, command, urge, per- 
suade, induce, etc. (conjunctions ut, né, or ut né) ; as, — 
postulé ut fiat, 7 demand that it be done (dependent form of the 
Jussive fiat, Zet zt be done!) ; 
Grat, né abeas, he begs that you will not go away 3 
milités cohortatus est ut hostium impetum sustinérent, fe e2- 
horted his soldiers to withstand the attack of the enemy ; 
Helvétiis persuasit ut exirent, le persuaded the Helvetii to march 
Sorth. 
a, Jubed, command, order, regularly takes the Infinitive. 
  
  1 Especially: moned, admone 
fiagits ; mand6, imperG, praecip: 
suade6, impelld, ; rog6, 6rd, pet6, postuld, precor, 
; Suade6d, hortor, cohortor; per:

ent form of the Jussive ea praetereat, let him pass that by!) ; 
cdnsuli permissum est ut duds legidnés scriberet, che consil was

Jinishing the lustrum (dependent form after past tense of né 
liistrum perficiat, let him not finish, etc.) ; 
prohibuit quéminus in tinum coirent, he prevented them from com- 
ing together ; 
nec quin érumperet, prohibéri poterat, or could he be prevented 
Srom rushing forth. 
a. Quin is used only when the verb of hindering is accompanied by a 
negative, or stands in a question implying a negative; it is not meces- 
sarily used even then, 
4. With verbs of deciding, resolving,’ etc. (conjunctions ut, né, or 
ut né) ; as,— 
cénstitueram ut pridié Idis Aquini manérem, / had decided to 
remain at Aguinum on the 12th; 
décrévit senatus ut Opimius vidéret, the Senate decreed that Opi- 
mius should see to it 3 
convénit ut iinis castris miscérentur, 7 was agreed that they should 
be united in one camp. 
5. With verbs of striving, etc. (conjunctions ut, né, or ut né) ; as, — 
fac ut eum ex6rés, see fo it that you prevail upon him! 
ciira ut vir sis, see to it that you are a man! 
lab6rabat ut reliquas civitatés adjungeret, he was striving to join 
the remaining states to him.” 
a, CGnor, try, always takes the Infinitive. 
NOTE. — Verbs of all the above classes also admit the Infinitive, especially in 
poetry. 
  
1 Especially: permitt6, concéd6, non patior. 
2 Especially: prohibed, impedis, déterres. 
8 Especially: cOnstitu6, décernG, cénse5, placuit, convenit, paciscor, 
4 Especially; laboro, do operam, id ag6, contend6, impetrs.

-P-A-G-E-202
  194 Syntax. 
6. With a few other expressions, such as necesse est, reliquum 
est, sequitur, licet, oportet; as, — 
reliquum est ut doceam, 7 remains for me to show ; 
licet redeas, you may return ; 
oportet loquamur, we must speak. 
On the absence of ut with licet and oportet, see paragraph 8. 
7. Here also belong phrases of the type: niilla causa est cir, 
quin; non est ciir, e/c.; nihil‘est ciir, ec. ; as, — 
  nilla causa est ciir timeam, /here zs no reason why I should fear 
(originally Deliberative: why should [fear ? There's no reason) ; 
nihil est quin dicam, there is no reason why I should not say. 
8. Many of the above classes of verbs at times take the simple Sub- 
junctive without ut. In such cases we must not recognize any omis- 
sion of ut, but simply an earlier form of expression which existed 
before the ut-clause arose. This is regularly the case with necesse 
est, licet, and oportet; see 6.. Other examples are: — 
e6s moned désinant, / warn them to stop; 
huic imperat adeat civitatés, he orders him to visit the states. 
B. Substantive Clauses Developed from the Optative. 
296. Substantive Clauses Developed from the Optative 
Occur :— 
1. With verbs of wishing, desiring, especially cupid, optd, volé, 
mal6 (conjunctions ut, né, ut né); as, — 
opts ut in hdc jidicis ném6 improbus reperiatur, / hope that in 
this court no bad man may be found (here ut reperiatur repre- 
sents a simple optative of direct statement, véz. reperiatur, may 
no bad man be found!) ; 
cupi6é né veniat, / desire that he may not come. 
a. The simple Subjunctive (without wt) sometimes occurs with verbs of 
this class. (See § 295, 8.) Examples are: velim scribas, / wish 
you would write; vellem scripsisset, / wish he had written. 
2. With expressions of fearing (timed, metud, vereor, etc.). 
Here né means ¢hat, lest, and ut means ¢hat not; as, — 
times né veniat, / fear that he will come (originally : may he not come! 
Lm afraid [he will); 
times ut veniat, 7 fear that he will not come (originally : may he come! 
Lm afraid [he won't)).
-P-A-G-E-203
  Substantive Clauses. 195 '. 
a. N& ndn sometimes occurs instead of ut, especially where the verb of 
fearing has a negative, or where the writer desires to emphasize some 
particular word in the dependent clause; as, — 
non vereor né hoc non fiat, / am not afraid that this will not 
happen ; 
vereor né exercitum firmum habére n6n possit, / fear that 
he is unable (nOn possit) to have a strong army. 
C. Substantive Clauses of Result. 
297. Substantive Clauses of Result (introduced by ut, 
ut nén) are a development of pure Result clauses, and 
occur with the following classes of words :— - 
1. As object clauses after verbs of doing, accomplishing (especially 
faci, efficid, cénficis). Thus: — 
gravitas morbi facit ut medicina egeamus, ¢he severity of disease 
makes us need medicine. 
2. As the subject of several impersonal verbs, particularly fit, effici- 
tur, accidit, évenit, contingit, accédit, fierI potest, fore, sequitur, 
relinquitur. Thus:— 
ex qu6 efficitur, ut voluptas n6n sit summum bonum, from which 
it follows that pleasure zs not the greatest good ; 
ita fit, ut ném6 esse possit beatus, thus it happens that no one can 
be happy 3 
accédébat ut navés deessent, another thing was the lack of ships 
(lit. 2 was added that ships were lacking). ~ 
3. As predicate or appositive after expressions like jis est, mds 
est, cOnsuétid6 est; also after neuter pronouns, h6c, illud, ec. 
Thus : — 
est més hominum ut n6lint eundem pliribus rébus excellere, 
it is the way of men not to wish the same person to excel in 
many things. 
D. Substantive Clauses Introduced by Quin. 
298. Substantive Clauses introduced by quin (used some- 
times as subject, sometimes as object) occur after negative 
and interrogative expressions of doubt, omission, and the 
like, particularly after ndn dubitd, 7 do not doubt; quis 
yee
-P-A-G-E-204
  196 Syntax. 
dubitat, who doubts? ; ndn (haud) dubium est, there is no 
doubt. The mood is the Subjunctive. Examples : — 
quis dubitat quin in virtiite divitiae sint, who doubts that in virtue 
there are riches ? 
nén dubium erat quin ventirus esset, there was no doubt that he 
was about to come. 
a. In Nepos, Livy, and post-Augustan writers an Infinitive sometimes 
takes the place of the quin-clause after nén dubit6; as, — 
non dubitaémus inventés esse, we do not doubt that men were found. 
8. NGn dubit6, / do not hesitate, is regularly followed by the Infinitive, 
though sometimes by a quin-clause. 
£, Substantive Clauses Introduced by Quod. 
299. 1. Quod, the fact that, that, introduces Substan- 
tive Clauses in the Indicative. This construction occurs 
especially — ( 
a) In apposition with a preceding demonstrative, as héc, id, 
illud, illa, ex eG, inde, e/c. Thus:— 
illud est admirati6ne dignum, quod captiv6s retinen- 
dds cénsuit, ¢his zs especially worthy of admiration, 
that he thought the prisoners ought to be kept ; 
hGc in6 praestamus vel maximé feris, quod colloqui- 
mur inter nés, 77 this one respect we are especially 
superior to the beasts, that we talk with each other. 
6) After bene fit, bene accidit, male fit, bene facere, miror, 
etc. 3; as,— 
bene mihi accidit, quod mittor ad mortem, 7 zs well for 
me that I am sent to death; 
bene fécisti quod mansisti, you did well in remaining. 
2. Quod at the beginning of the sentence sometimes has the force 
of as regards the fact that. Thus: — 
quod multitidinem Germanérum in Galliam tradiic6, id mei 
miiniendi causa faci6, as regards the fact that [ am trans- 
porting a multitude of Germans into Gaul, I am doing it for 
the sake of strengthening myself ; 
quod mé Agamemnona aemulari putas, falleris, as regards your 
thinking that I emulate Agamemnon, you are mistaken.

  F. Indirect Questions. 
300. 1. Indirect Questions are Substantive Clauses used 
after verbs of asking, inquiring, telling, and the like. They 
take their verb in the Subjunctive.1 Like Direct Questions 
(see § 162) they may be introduced — 
a) By Interrogative Pronouns or Adverbs ; as, — 
dic mihi ubi fueris, quid féceris, ¢e// me where you were, 
what you did; 
oculis jidicarI n6n potest in utram partem fluat Arar, 
it cannot be determined by the eye in which direction the 
Arar flows 3 
bis bina quot essent, nesciébat, he did not know how 
many two times two were. 
Nore. — Care should be taken to distinguish Indirect Questions 
from Relative Clauses. The difference between the two appears clearly 
in the following : — 
effugere ném6 id potest quod futiirum est, xo one can escape what 
zs destined to come to pass ; but 
saepe autem ne iitile quidem est scire quid futirum sit, but often 
it ts not even useful to know what is coming to pass. 
6) By num or -ne, without distinction of meaning; as,— 
Epamin6ndas quaesivit num salvus esset clipeus, or 
salvusne esset clipeus, Efaminondas asked whether 
his shield was safe 3 
disputatur num interire virtiis in homine possit, che 
question ts raised whether virtue can die in a man; 
ex Sdcrate quaesitum est nodnne Archeladum beatum 
putaret, the question was asked of Socrates whether he 
did not think Archelaus happy. 
Nore.—N6nne in Indirect Questions occurs only after quaerG, as in the 
last example above. 
2. Often the Indirect Question represents a Deliberative Subjunctive 
of the direct discourse ; as, — 
nesci6 quid faciam, / do not know what to do. (Direct: quid faciam, 
what shall I do!) 
  
+ 
1Exclamations, also, upon becoming indirect, take the Subjunctive, as cOn- 
sideraé quam variae sint hominum cupidinés, consider how varied are the 
desires of men, (Direct: quam variae sunt hominum cupidinés!)
-P-A-G-E-206
  198 Syntax. 
3. After verbs of expectation and endeavor (exspectd, cdnor, 
experior, tempt) we sometimes find an Indirect Question intro- 
duced by si ; as, — 
ednantur si perrumpere possint, they try whether they can break 
through. 
a. Sometimes the governing verb is omitted; as, — 
pergit ad proximam spéluncam si forte e6 véstigia fer- 
rent, he proceeded to the nearest cave (to see) if the tracks led 
thither, 
4. Indirect Double Questions are introduced in the main by the 
same particles as direct double questions (§ 162, 4) ; véz.:— 
utrum ... an; 
NC 2). sh le an; 
—.... an; 
—.... ne, 
Examples : — 
quaer6 utrum vérum an falsum sit, 
quaer6 vérumne an falsum sit, 
quaer6 vérum an falsum sit, 
quaer6 vérum falsumne sit, Laskwhether it ts true or false? 
a. ‘Or not’ in the second member of the double question is ordinarily 
expressed by necne, less frequently by an nén; as, — : 
di utrum sint necne, quaeritur, itis asked whether there are gods 
or not. 
5. Haud sci6 an, nesci6 an, by omission of the first member of 
the double question, occur with the Subjunctive in the sense: / am 
inclined to think, probably, perhaps ; as,— 
haud sci6 an héc vérum sit, / am inclined to think this zs true. 
6. In early Latin and in poetry the Indicative is sometimes used in 
Indirect Questions. 
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES. 
301. Conditional Sentences are compound sentences 
(§ 164) consisting of two parts, the Protasis (or con- 
dition), usually introduced by si, nisi, or sin, and the 
Apodosis (or conclusion). There are the following types 
of Conditional Sentences : —
-P-A-G-E-207
  Conditional Sentences. 199 
First Type.—Nothing Implied as to the Reality of the Sup- 
posed Case. 
802. 1. Here we regularly have the Indicative in both 
Protasis and Apodosis. Any tense may-be used ; as, — 
si hdc crédis, erras, 7f you believe this, you are mistaken ; 
natiiram si sequémur, numquam aberrabimus, 7f we follow 
Nature, we shail never go astray ; 
si hdc dixisti, errasti, 7/ you said this, you were in error. 
2. Sometimes the Protasis takes the Indefinite Second Person Singu- 
lar (§ 356, 3) of the Present or Perfect Subjunctive, with the force of 
the Indicative; as, — 
memoria minuitur, nisi eam exerceas, memory is impaired unless 
you exercise it. 
3. Here belong also those conditional sentences in which the Prot- 
asis denotes a repeated action (compare §§ 287, 2; 288, 3); 
  si quis equitum déciderat, pedités circumsistébant, zf any one 
of the horsemen fell, the foot-soldiers gathered about him. 
a, Instead of the Indicative, Livy and subsequent writers employ the 
Subjunctive of the Historical tenses in the Protasis to denote repeated 
action; as,— 
Si dicend6 quis diem eximeret, if (ever) anybody consumed a day 
in pleading ; Siquandé adsidéret, if ever he sat by. 
4. Where the sense demands it, the Apodosis in conditional sen- 
tences of the First Type may be an Imperative or one of the Inde- 
pendent Subjunctives (Hortatory, Deliberative, e¢c.) ; as, — 
si hic créditis, tac&te, ¢f you believe this, be silent ; 
si h6c crédimus, taceamus, 7/ we believe this, let us keep silent. 
Second Type. —‘Should’-‘ Would’ Conditions. 
303. Here we regularly have the Subjunctive (of the Pres. 
ent or Perfect tense) in both Protasis and Apodosis; as, — 
si hdc dicas, errés, af you should say this, you would be mis- 
si h6c dixeris, erraveris, } taken. 
si velim Hannibalis proelia omnia déscribere, diés mé déficiat, 
if I should wish to describe all the battles of Hannibal, time 
would fail me;
-P-A-G-E-208
200 Syntax. 
mentiar, si negem, J should lie, if I should deny it ; 
haec si técum patria loquatur, ndnne impetrare débeat, zf your 
country should plead thus with you, would she not deserve to 
obtain her request ? 
a, The Subjunctive in the Apodosis of conditional sentences of this type 
is of the Potential variety. 
4. Sometimes we find the Indicative in the Apodosis of sentences of the 
Second Type, where the writer wishes to assert the accomplishment of 
a result more positively; as, — 
aliter si faciat, ntillam habet auctéritatem, if re should do 
otherwise, he has no authority. 
Third Type.— Supposed Case Represented as Contrary to 
Pact. 
304. 1. Here we regularly have the Subjunctive in both 
Protasis and Apodosis, the Imperfect referring to present 
time, and the Pluperfect referring ¢o past ; as, — 
si amici mei adessent, opis n6n indigérem, if my friends were here, 
1 should not lack assistance 3 
si hdc dixissés, errassés, if you had said this, you would have 
erred; 
sapientia non expeterétur, si nihil efficeret, philosophy would not 
be desired, if it accomplished nothing ; 
consilium, ratid, sententia nisi essent in senibus, n6n summum 
c6nsilium maj6rés nostri appellassent senatum, wmless de- 
liberation, reason, and wisdom existed in old men, our ances- 
tors would not have called their highest deliberative body a 
senate. 
2. Sometimes the Imperfect Subjunctive is found referring to the 
past, especially to denote @ continued act, or a state of things still exist- 
ing; as, — ; 
Laelius, Fiirius, Caté, si nihil litteris adjuvarentur, numquam sé 
ad efrum studium contulissent, Laelius, Furius, and Cato 
would never have devoted themselves to the study of letters, 
unless they had been (constantly) helped by them; 
num igitur si ad centésimum annum vixisset, senectitis eum 
suae paenitéret, 7f he had lived to his hundredth year, 
would he have regretted (and now be regretting) his old 
age? 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  Conditional Sentences. 201 
3. The Apodosis in conditional sentences of this type sometimes 
stands in the Indicative (Imperfect, Perfect, or Pluperfect), vz. — 
a) Frequently in expressions of adzlity, obligation, or necessity ; 
as, — 
nisi f 
  icitas in sGcordiam vertisset, exuere jugum 
potuérunt, wzless their prosperity had turned to folly, 
they could have thrown off the yoke ; 
NoTE. — In sentences of this type, however, it is not the posszdility that is repre- 
sented as contrary-to-fact, but something to be supplied in thought from the context, 
Thus in the foregoing sentence the logical apodosis is et exuissent understood 
(and they would have shaken it of). When the fossibility itself is conditioned, the 
Subjunctive is used. 
eum patris loc6 colere débébas, si iilla in té pietas 
esset, you ought to revere him as a father, of you had 
any sense of devotion. 
4) With both the Periphrastic Conjugations ; as, — 
si Pompejus occisus esset, fuistisne ad arma itiiri, 7f 
Pompey had been slain, would you have proceeded to 
arms 2 
si inum diem morati essétis, moriendum omnibus. 
fuit, 7f you had delayed one day, you would all have 
had to die. 
Protasis expressed without Si. 
305. 1. The Protasis is not always expressed by a clause with si, 
but may be implied in a word, a phrase, or merely by the context; 
as, — 
alidqui haec nGn scriberentur, otherwise (ze. if matters were other- 
wise) these things would not be written ; 
n6n potestis, voluptate omnia dirigentés, retinére virtitem, yow 
cannot retain virtue, if you direct everything with reference to 
pleasure. 
2. Sometimes an Imperative, or a Jussive Subjunctive, serves as 
Protasis. Thus :— 
eras petits, dabitur, 7f you ask to-morrow, it shall be given you (lit. 
ask to-morrow, etc.) ; 
haec reputent, vidébunt, 7f they consider this, they will see (lit. let 
them consider, etc.) 3 
rogés Arist6nem, respondeat, zf you should ask Aristo, he would 
answer,
-P-A-G-E-210
202 Syntax. 
Use of Nisi, SI Non, Sin. 
306. 1. Nisi, wx/ess, negatives the entire protasis ; sI nén nega- 
tives a single word; as, — 
ferreus essem, nisi té amarem, / should be hard-hearted unless I 
loved you; but — 
ferreus essem, si té n6n amarem, / should be hard-heayted if [ did 
NOT love you. 
In the first example, it is the notion of loving you that is negatived, 
in the second, the notion of loving. 
2. Sin6n (si minus) is regularly employed: — 
@) When an apodosis with at, tamen, certé follows; as, — 
dolérem si n6n potuers frangere, tamen occultabé, if 
I cannot crush my sorrow, yet I will hide it. 
6) When an affirmative protasis is repeated in negative form; 
as, — 
si féceris, magnam habéb6 gratiam; si n6n féceris, 
ignéscam, if you do it, J shall be deeply grateful; if you 
do not do it, I shall pardon you. 
a, But if the verb is omitted in the repetition, only si minus or sin 
minus is admissible; as, — 
hoc si assectitus sum, gauded; si minus, mé cSnsdlor, if / 
have attained this, | am glad; if not, I console myself. 
3. Sin. Where one protasis is followed by another opposed in 
meaning, but affirmative in form, the second is introduced by sin ; as, — 
hunc mihi tim6rem éripe; si vérus est, né opprimar, sin falsus, 
ut timére désinam, relieve me of this fear; of it is well 
Sounded, that I may not be destroyed; but of it is groundless, 
that I may cease to fear. 
4. Nisi has a fondness for combining with negatives (n6n, némG, 
nihil) ; as, — 
nihil cdgitavit nisi caedem, he had no thought but murder. 
a, N6n and nisi are always separated in the best Latinity. 
5. Nisi forte, nisi vér6, nisi si, wuless perchance, unless indeed 
(often with ironical force), take the Indicative; as, — 
nisi vér6, quia perfecta rés n6n est, nén vidétur piinienda, 
unless indeed, because an act is not consummated, it does not 
seem to merit punishment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  Clauses of Comparison. — Adversative Clauses. 203 
Conditional Clauses of Comparison. 
307. 1. Conditional Clauses of Comparison are intro- 
duced by the particles, ac si, ut si, quasi, quam si, tamquam 
si, velut si, or simply by velut or tamquam. They stand in 
the Subjunctive mood and regularly involve an ellipsis (see 
§ 374, 1), as indicated in the following examples :— 
tantus patrés metus cépit, velut si jam ad portas hostis esset, as 
great fear seized the senators as (would have seized them) if the 
enemy were already at the gates ; 
sed quid ego his testibus iitor quasi rés dubia aut obsciira sit, 
but why do I use these witnesses, as (1 should do) of the matter 
were doubtful or obscure 3 
serviam tibi tamquam si émeris mé argent6, / will serve you as 
though you had bought me for money. 
2. Note that in sentences of this kind the Latin observes the regu- 
lar principles for the Sequence of Tenses. Thus after principal tenses 
the Latin uses the Present and Perfect (as in the second and third exam- 
ples), where the English uses the Past and the Past Perfect. 
Concessive Clauses. 
308. The term ‘Concessive’ is best restricted to those 
clauses developed from the Jussive Subjunctive which 
have the force of granted that, etc. ; as, — 
sit fiir, sit sacrilegus, at est bonus imperator, granted that he is a 
thief and a robber, yet he is a good commander ; 
ut hdc vérum sit, granted that this is true; 
né sit summum malum dolor, malum certé est, granted that pain 
zs not the greatest evil, yet it zs certainly an evil. 
Adversative Clauses with Quamvis, Quamquam, etc. 
309. Clauses introduced by quamvis, quamquam, etsi, 
tametsi, cum, although, while often classed as ‘Conces- 
sive,’ are yet essentially different from genuine Concessive 
clauses. As a rule, they do not grant or concede any- 
thing, but rather state that something is true iz spite of 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
        
          Syntax. 
  something else. They accordingly emphasize the adver- 
sative idea, and are properly Subordinate Adversative 
Clauses. The different particles used to introduce these 
clauses have different meanings and take different con- 
structions, as follows :—    
I. Quamvis, however much, although, does not introduce a state- 
ment of fact, but represents an act merely as conceived, It is followed 
by the Subjunctive, usually of the present tense; as, — 
hominés quamvis in turbidis rébus sint, tamen interdum animis 
relaxantur, in however stirring events men may engage, yet at 
times they relax their energies 3 
n6n est potestas opitulandi rei piiblicae quamvis ea prematur 
periculis, ‘here zs no opportunity to succor the state, though it 
be beset by dangers. 
2. Quamquam, etsi, tametsi, although, introduce a statement of 
fact, and are followed by the Indicative (of any tense) ; as, — 
quamquam omnis virtiis n6és allicit, tamen jistitia id maximé 
efficit, although all virtue attracts us, yet justice does so espe- 
cially ; 
Caesar, etsi n6ndum cGnsilium hostium cognéverat, tamen id 
quod accidit suspicabatur, Caesar, though he did not yet know 
the plans of the enemy, yel was suspecting what actually occurred. 
a. Etsi, although, must be distinguished from etsi, even if The latter 
is a conditional particle and takes any of the constructions admissible 
for SI. (See §§ 302-304.) 
3. Cum, although, is followed by the Subjunctive; as, — 
Atticus honérés n6n petiit, cum ef patérent, Afticus did not seek 
honors, though they were open to him. 
4. Licet sometimes loses its verbal force (see § 295, 6) and sinks to 
the level of a conjunction with the force of although. It takes the 
Subjunctive, Present or Perfect ; as,— 
licet omnés terrdrés impendeant, succurram, ‘hough all terrors 
hang over me, (yet) I will lend aid, 
5. Quamquam, with the force and yet, is often used to introduce 
principal clauses; as, — 
quamquam quid loquor, and yet why do I speak?
-P-A-G-E-213
Clauses of Proviso.— Relative Clauses. 205 
6. In post-Augustan writers quamquam is freely, construed with the Sub- 
junctive, while quamvis is often used to introduce statements of fact, and takes 
either the Indicative or the Subjunctive. Thus: — 
quamquam movérétur his v6cibus, although he was moved by these words ; 
quamvis multi opinarentur, though many thought ; 
quamvis infést6 anim6 pervéneras, though you had come with hostile intent, 
Clauses with Dum, Modo, Dummodo, denoting a Wish 
or a Proviso. 
310. These particles are followed by thé , Subjunctive 
(negative né) and have two distinct uses ; — 
I. They are used to introduce clauses embodying a wish 
entertained by the subject of the leading verb; as, — 
multi honesta neglegunt dummodo potentiam cénsequantur, 
many neglect honor in their desire to obtain power (of only they 
may attain) 3 
omnia postposul, dum praeceptis patris parérem, / made everything 
else secondary, in my desire to obey the injunctions of my father ; 
nil obstat tibi, dum né sit ditior alter, nothing hinders you in your 
desire that your neighbor may not be richer than you. 
Il. They are used to express a proviso (‘provided 
that’); as,— 
Sderint, dum metuant, let them hate, provided they fear 3 
manent ingenia senibus, modo permaneat studium et industria, 
old men retain their faculties, provided only they retain their 
interest and vigor 3 
niibant, dum né dés fiat comes, Let them marry, provided no dowry 
goes with it. 
Relative Clauses. 
311. Relative Clauses are introduced by Relative Pro- 
nouns, Adjectives, or Adverbs. 
312. 1. Relative clauses usually stand in the Indicative Mood, 
especially clauses introduced by those General Relatives which are 
doubled or have the suffix -cunque ; as, — 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
ee 
206 Syntax. 
quidquid id est, timed Danaés et déna ferentés, whatever it is, 7 
Sear the Greeks even when they offer gifts ; 
quidquid oritur, qualecunque est, causam 4 natira habet, what- 
ever comes into being, of whatever sort it is, has its primal cause 
in Nature. 
2. Any simple Relative may introduce a conditional sentence of 
any of the three types mentioned in §§ 302-304; as,— 
qui héc dicit, errat, 4e who says this is mistaken (First Type) ; 
qui hdc dicat, erret, he would be mistaken who should say this 
(Second Type) ; 
qui hdc dixisset, errasset, the man who had said this would have 
r been mistaken. 
INDIRECT DISCOURSE (ORATIO OBLIQUA). 
313. When the language or thought of any person is 
reproduced without change, that is called Direct Discourse 
(Oratio Récta); as, Caesar said, ‘The die is cast.’ When, 
on the other hand, one’s language or thought is made to 
depend upon a verb of saying, thinking, etc., that is called 
Indirect Discourse (Oratié Obdligua),; as, Caesar said that 
the die was cast; Caesar thought that his troops were 
victorious. 
a. For the verbs most frequently employed to introduce Indirect 
Discourse, see § 331. : 
MOODS IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE. 
Declarative Sentences. 
314. 1. Declarative Sentences upon becoming Indirect 
change their main clause to the Infinitive with Subject 
Accusative, while all subordinate clauses take the Subjunc- 
tive; as, — 
Régulus dixit quam didi jire jirand6 hostium tenérétur n6n esse 
sé senatérem, Regulus said that as long as he was held by his 
pledge to the enemy he was not a senator. (Direct: quam dit 
teneor n6n sum senator.)  
-P-A-G-E-215
  Indirect Discourse. 207 
2. The verb of saying, thinking, etc., is sometimes to be inferred 
from the context ; as, — 
tum Rémulus légatGs circa vicinas gentés misit qui societatem 
coniibiumque peterent: urbés quoque, ut cétera, ex 
Infim6 nasci, then Romulus sent envoys around among the 
neighboring tribes, to ask for alliance and the right of inter- 
marriage, (saying that) cities, like everything else, start from a 
modest beginning. 
3- Subordinate clauses which contain an explanatory statement of 
the writer and so are not properly a part of the Indirect Discourse, or 
which emphasize the fact stated, take the Indicative ; as, — 
niintiatum est Ariovistum ad occupandum Vesonti6nem, quod 
est oppidum maximum SéquanGrum, contendere, z¢ was re- 
ported that Ariovistus was hastening to seize Vesontio, which is 
the largest town of the Sequant. 
4. Sometimes a subordinate clause is such only in its external form, 
and in sense is principal. It then takes the Infinitive with Subject 
Accusative. This occurs especially in case of relative clauses, where 
qui is equivalent to et hic, nam hic, efc.; as, — 
dixit urbem Athéniénsium pr6pugnaculum oppositum esse bar- 
baris, apud quam jam bis classés régias fécisse naufra- 
gium, he sazd the city of the Athenians had been set against the 
barbarians like a bulwark, near which (= and near it) the fleets 
of the King had twice met disaster. 
5. The Subject Accusative of the Infinitive is sometimes omitted 
when it refers to the same person as the subject of the leading 
verb, or can easily be supplied from the context; as, — 
cum id nescire Mag6 diceret, when Mago said he did not know 
this (for 86 nescire). 
Interrogative Sentences. 
315.1. Real questions of the Direct Discourse, upon 
becoming indirect, are regularly put in the Subjunc- 
tive; as, — 
Ariovistus Caesari respondit: sé prius in Galliam vénisse quam 
populum R6manum. Quid sibivellet? Cir in suas pos- 
sessiOnés veniret, Ariovistus replied to Caesar that he
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 Syntax. 
had come into Gaul before the Roman people. What did he 
(Caesar) mean? Why did he come into his domain? (Direct: 
quid tibi vis? ciir in meas possessiGnés venis ?) 
2. Rhetorical questions, on the other hand, being asked 
merely for effect; and being equivalent in force to emphatic 
statements, regularly stand in the Infinitive in Indirect Dis- 
course. ‘Thus :— 
quid est levius (lit. what zs more trivial, = nothing is more trivial) 
of the Direct Discourse becomes quid esse levius in the In- 
direct. 
3. Deliberative Subjunctives of the Direct Discourse remain un- 
changed in mood in the Indirect ; as, — 
quid faceret, what was he to do? (Direct: quid faciat?) 
Imperative Sentences. 
$16. All Imperatives or Jussive Subjunctives of the 
Direct Discourse appear as Subjunctives in the In- 
direct ; as, — 
milités certidrés fécit paulisper intermitterent proelium, e 
\ told the soldiers to stop the battle for a little. (Direct: 
intermittite.) 
a. The Negative in such sentences is né ; as, — 
né suae virtiti tribueret, /et iim not attribute it to his own 
valor ! 
TENSES IN INDIRECT DiSCOURSE. 
A. Tenses of the Infinitive. 
317. These are used in accordance with the regular 
principles for the use of the Infinitive as given in § 270. 
a. The Perfect Infinitive may represent any past tense of the 
Indicative of Direct Discourse. Thus : — 
scid té haec égisse may mean — 
L know you were doing this. (Direct: haec agébas.) 
L know you did this. (Direct: haec égisti.) 
Lknow you had done this. (Direct : haec égeras.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
Indirect Discourse. 209 
B. Tenses of the Subjunctive. 
318. These follow the regular principle for the Sequence 
of Tenses, being Principal if the verb of saydng is Princi- 
pal; Historical if it is Historical. Yet for the sake of 
vividness, we often find the Present Subjunctive used 
after an historical tense (Repraesentatio) ; as, — 
Caesar respondit, si obsidés dentur, sésé pacem esse factirum, 
Caesar replied that, if hostages be given, he would make peace. 
a. For the sequence after the Perfect Infinitive, see § 268, 2. 
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE. 
Conditional Sentences of the First Type. 
319. A. Tue Apoposis. Any tense of the Indicative 
is changed to the corresponding tense of the Infinitive 
(§§ 270; 317, @). B. Tue Prorasis. The protasis takes those tenses of 
the Subjunctive which are required by the Sequence 
of Tenses. 
Examples : — 
Direct. Inprrecr. 
shacortaa ees, {Sh cane es dicd, si hoc crédas, té erratirum esse; si hdc crédés, errabis 2 OA Rae Gg gue cg eS 2 % dixi, si hoc créderés, té erratirum esse. 
esse 5 
dixi, st hic crédidissés, té erratirum 
esse. si hdc crédideris, errabis, 
dico, si hdc créderés, té erravisse ; si hoc crédébas, erravisti,; 4, 7 ea - ” | dixi, si hoc créderés, té erravisse. ta si hdc crédideris, té erratirum 
a. Note thata Future Perfect Indicative of the Direct Discourse 
regularly appears in the Indirect as a’Perfect Subjunctive after 
a principal tense, and as a Pluperfect Subjunctive after an his- 
torical tense.
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 Syntax. 
Conditional Sentences of the Second Type. 
320. A. THe Apoposis. The Present Subjunctive of 
the Direct Discourse regularly becomes the Future Infini- 
tive of the Indirect. 
B. Tue Protasis. The Protasis takes those tenses of 
the Subjunctive demanded by the sequence of tenses. 
Examples :— 
si hc cr8das, errés, bs si hoc orédas, té eaetorum esse; 
dixi, si hoc créderés, té erratirum esse. 
Conditional Sentences of the Third Type. 
$21. A. THE Apoposis. 
1. The Imperfect Subjunctive of the Direct Discourse 
becomes the Future Infinitive. 
a. But this construction is rare, being represented in the clas- 
sical Latinity by a single example (Caesar, V. 29. 2). Some 
scholars question the correctness of this passage. 
2. The Pluperfect Subjunctive of the Direct Discourse 
becomes : — 
@) In the Active Voice the Infinitive in -dirus fuisse. 
4) In the Passive Voice it takes the form futirum fuisse ut 
with the Imperfect Subjunctive. 
B. Tue Prorasis. The protasis in Conditional Sen- 
tences of this type always remains unchanged. ‘ 
Examples : — 
si hoc créderés, errarés, dicé (dixi), si hoc créderés, té er- 
rattirum esse; 
si hoc crédidissés, erravissés, dicd (dixi), si hdc crédidissés, té 
erratirum fuisse ; 
si héc dixissés, piinitus essés, dicd (dixi), si hoc dixissés fiti- 
rum fuisse ut piniréris. 
322. When an apodosis of a conditional sentence of the Third 
Type referring to the past is at the same time a Result clause, or a
-P-A-G-E-219
  Indirect Discourse. : 211 
quin-clause (after nén dubité, efc.), it stands in the Perfect Sub- 
junctive in the form -irus fuerim ; as, — 
ita territi sunt, ut arma trdditiiri fuerint,! nisi Caesar subitd 
advénisset, they were so frightened that they would have given 
up their arms, had not Caesar suddenly arrived ; 
n6n dubité quin, si hdc dixissés, erratiirus fueris,! 7 do not doubt 
that, if you had said this, you would have made a mistake. 
a. This peculiarity is confined to the Active Voice. In the 
Passive, such sentences, when they become dependent, 
remain unchanged; as, — 
ndn dubitd quin, si hdc dixissés, vituperatus essés, 7 
do not doubt that, if you had said this, you would have 
been blamed. 
&. When an Indirect Question becomes an apodosis in a con- 
ditional sentence of the Third Type, -iirus fuerim (rarely 
-irus fuissem) is used; as, — 
quaer6, num, si hdc dixissés, erratiirus fueris (or 
fuissés). 
¢. Potui, when it becomes a dependent apodosis in sentences of this 
Type, usually changes to the Perfect Subjunctive; as, — 
concursii totius civitatis défénsi sunt, ut frigidissimds 
quoque GratG6rés populi studia excitare potuerint, 
they were defended before a gathering of all the citizens, so that the 
interest of the people would have been enough to excite even the 
most apathetic orators. 
IMPLIED INDIRECT DISCOURSE. 
323. The Subjunctive is often used in subordinate clauses whose 
Indirect character is merely implied by the context ; as, — 
dém6nstrabantur mihi praeterea, quae Sdcratés dé immortali- 
tate animorum disseruisset, there were explained to me be- 
sides, the arguments which Socrates had set forth concerning thé 
immortality of the soul (i.e. the arguments which, it was said, 
Socrates had set forth) ; 
Paetus omnés librés qués pater suus reliquisset mihi d6navit, 
Paetus gave me all the books which (as he said) his father had left. 
  
1 Traditiiri fuerint and erratiirus fueris are to be*regarded as repre- 
senting traditiri fuérunt and errattirus fuisti of Direct Discourse. (See 
§ 304. 3. 2.)
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 . Syntax. 
SUBJUNCTIVE BY ATTRACTION. 
324. 1. Subordinate clauses dependent upon the Sub- 
junctive are frequently attracted ‘into the same mood, 
especially when they do not express a fact, but constitute 
an essential part of one complex idea; as, — 
ném6 avarus adhiic inventus est, cui, quod habéret, esset satis, 
no miser has yet been found who was satisfied with what he 
had; 
cum diversas causas afferrent, dum f6rmam sui quisque et 
animi et ingeni redderent, as they brought forward different 
arguments, while each mirrored his own individual ype of 
mind and natural bent ; 
quod ego fatear, pudeat? should I be ashamed of a thing which I 
admit 2 
2. Similarly a subordinate clause dependent upon an Infinitive 
is put in the Subjunctive when the two form one closely united 
whole; as, — 
més est Athénis quotannis in cOntidne laudari eds qui sint in 
proeliis interfecti, z¢ 7s the custom at Athens every year jor 
those to be publicly eulogized who have been killed in battle. 
(Here the notion of ‘praising those who fell in battle’ forms 
an inseparable whole.) 
NOUN AND ADJECTIVE FORMS OF THE VERB. 
325. These are the Infinitive, Participle, Gerund, and 
Supine. All of these partake of the nature of the Verb, 
on the one hand, and of the Noun or Adjective, on the 
other. Thus :— 
As Verbs, — 
@) They may be limited by dagettist 
6) They admit an object; 
c) They have the properties of voice and tense. 
As Nouns or Adjectives, — 
@) They are declined ; 
6) They take Noun or Adjective constructions.
-P-A-G-E-221
  Noun and Adjective Forms of the Verb. 213 
THE INFINITIVE. 
Infinitive without Subject Accusative. 
$26. This is used chiefly as Subject or Object but also as 
Predicate or Appositive. 
Nore. — The Infinitive was originally a Dative, and traces of this are still to be 
seen in the poetical use of the Infinitive to express purpose ; as, nec dulcés occur- 
rent Gscula nati praeripere, and no sweet children will run to snatch kisses. 
A. As Subject. 
327. 1. The Infinitive without Subject Accusative is 
used as the Subject of esse and various impersonal verbs, 
particularly opus est, necesse est, oportet, juvat, délectat, 
placet, libet, licet, praestat, decet, pudet, interest, e/c. ; as, — 
dulce et dec6rum est pr6é patria mori, z¢ zs sweet oud noble to die 
Sor one’s country ; 
virdrum est fortium toleranter dolorem pati, zt 7s the part of brave 
men to endure pain with patience ; 
senatuil placuit légatds mittere, the Senate decided (lit. it pleased the 
Senate) to send envoys. 
2. Even though the Infinitive itself appears without Subject, it may 
take a Predicate Noun or Adjective in the Accusative; as, — 
aliud est iracundum esse, aliud iratum, 7 zs one thing to be trasci- 
ble, another to be angry; 
impiine quaelibet facere,id est régem esse, fo do whatever you 
please with impunity, that zs to be a king. 
a, But when licet is followed by a Dative of the person, a Predicate 
Noun or Adjective with esse is attracted into the same case ; as, 
licuit esse G6tidsS6 Themistocli, lit. i¢ was permitted to Themisto- 
cles to be at leisure. So sometimes with other Impersonals. 
B. As Object. 
328. 1. The Infinitive without Subject Accusative is 
used as the Object of many verbs, to denote another action 
of the same subject, particularly after — 
vol6, cupid, mal6, n6dlé; cdgitd, meditor, purpose, intend; 
débed, ought ; neglegé, neglect ; 
status, constitus, decide ; vereor, timed, fear ;
-P-A-G-E-222
214 Syntax. 
auded, dare; matir6, festind, proper6, con- 
studed, contends, strzve ; tend6, hasten ; 
pars, prepare (so paratus) ; assuésc6, cOnsuésc6, accustom 
incipiG, coepi, institus, degin ; myself (so assuétus, insuétus, 
perg6, continue ; assuéfactus) ; 
désin6, désisté, cease ; discs, learn ; 
possum, can ; scid, know how; 
cdnor, try; sole6, am wont; as, — 
ti hés intuéri audés, do you dare to look on these men? 
Démosthenés ad fliictiis maris déclamare solébat, Demosthenes 
used to declaim by the waves of the sea. 
2. A Predicate Noun or Adjective with these Infinitives is attracted 
into the Nominative ; as, — 
beatus esse sine virtiite ném6 potest, mo one can be happy without 
virtue ; 
Cat6 esse quam vidéri bonus mAalébat, Calo preferred to be good 
rather than to seem so. 
Infinitive with Subject Accusative. 
$29. This is used chiefly as Subject or Object but also 
as Predicate or Appositive. 
A. As Subject. 
330. The Infinitive with Subject Accusative (like the 
simple Infinitive) is used as Subject with esse and Imper- 
sonal verbs, particularly with aequum est, itile est, turpe 
est, fama est, spés est, fas est, nefas est, opus est, necesse 
est, oportet, cénstat, praestat, licet, e/c.; as, — 
nihil in bell oportet contemni, nothing ought to be despised in war 3 
apertum est sibi quemque natiira esse carum, zt 7s manifest that 
by nature everybody is dear to himself. 
B. As Object. 
331. The Infinitive with Subject Accusative is used as 
Object after the following classes of verbs: 
  I. Most frequently after verbs of saying, thinking, knowing, per- 
ceiving, and the like (Verba Sentiendi et Déclarandi). This is the 
   
-P-A-G-E-223
  Noun and Adjective Forms of the Verb, 215 
regular construction of Principal Clauses of Indirect Discourse. Verbs 
that take this construction are, among others, the following: senti6, 
audi6, vided, cogndsc6; puts, jiidicd, spér6, cdnfidd; scié, 
memini; dic, affirm6, negd (say that. . . not), trad6, narré, 
fateor, responde6, scrib6, pr6mitt6, glorior. Also the phrases: 
certiGdrem facié (2z/form), memoria tenes (remember), etc. 
Examples : — 
Epiciréi putant cum corporibus simul animGs interire, the Efi- 
cureans think that the soul perishes with the body ; 
Thalés dixit aquam esse initium rérum, 7hales said that water was 
the first principle of the universe 3 
Démocritus negat quicquid esse sempiternum, Democritus says 
nothing ts everlasting 3 
spér6 eum ventirum esse, / hope that he will come. 
Il. With jubes, order, and vets, forbid; as, — 
Caesar milités pontem facere jussit, Caesar ordered the soldiers to 
make a bridge. 
a, When’ the name of the person who is ordered or forbidden to do 
something is omitted, the Infinitive with jube6 and veto is put in 
the Passive; as, Caesar pontem fieri jussit. 
III. With patior and sin6, permit, allow 3 as,— 
nilld sé implicari neg6tis passus est, he did not permit himself to 
be involved in any difficulty. 
IV. With vol6, nd16, mal6, cupid, when the Subject of the Infini- 
tive is different from that of the governing verb; as, — 
nec mihi hunec err6rem extorquéri vol6, nor do [wish this error to 
be wrested from me ; 
eas rés jactari ndlébat, ke was unwilling that these matters should be 
discussed 3 
té tuis divitiis frul cupimus, we desire that you enjoy your wealth. 
a, When the Subject of both verbs is the same, the simple Infinitive is 
regularly used in accordance with § 328.1. But exceptions occur, es- 
pecially in case of esse and Passive Infinitives; as, — 
cupid mé esse clémentem, / desire to be lenient ; 
Timoledn méaluit sé diligi quam metui, Timoleon preferred to 
be loved rather than feared. 
8, Vol6 also admits the Subjunctive, with or without ut; nG16 the Sub- 
junctive alone. (See § 296. 1. a.)
-P-A-G-E-224
216 Syntax. 
V. With Verbs of emotion (joy, sorrow, regret, etc.), especially 
gaude6, laetor, doled ; aegré fer6, molesté fer6, graviter fer6, am 
annoyed, distressed ; miror, queror, indignor ; as, — 
gauded té salvum advenire, / rejoice that you arrive safely; 
non molesté ferunt sé libidinum vinculis laxatés esse, they are 
not troubled at being released from the bonds of passion ; 
miror té ad mé nihil scribere, / wonder that you write me nothing. 
a. Instead of an Infinitive these verbs also sometimes admit a quod- 
clause as Object. (See § 299.) Thus: — 
miror quod non loqueris, / wonder that you do not speak. 
VI. Some verbs which take two Accusatives, one of the Person and 
the other of the Thing (§ 178, 1), may substitute an Infinitive for the 
second Accusative; as, — 
c6g6 té hoc facere, / compel you to do this (cf. té hdc cdgd) ; 
docui té contentum esse, / /aught you to be content (cf. té modes- 
tiam docul, / taught you temperance). 
Passive Construction of the Foregoing Verbs. 
332. Those verbs which in the Active are followed by 
the Infinitive with Subject Accusative, usually admit the 
personal construction in the Passive. This is true of the 
following and of some others :— 
@) jubeor, vetor, sinor; as, — 
milités pontem facere jussi sunt, rhe soldiers were ordered 
to build a bridge ; 
pons fierl jussus est, a bridge was ordered built ; 
milités castris exire vetiti sunt, the troops were forbidden 
to go out of the camp ; 
Séstius Clodium acciisdre n6n est situs, Sestius was 
not allowed to accuse Clodius. 
5) videor, / am seen, I seem; as,— 
vidétur comperisse, he seems to have discovered. 
¢) dicor, putor, existimor, jiidicor (in all persons) ; as, — 
dicitur in Italiam vénisse, e zs said to have come into 
Ltaly ; 
Roémulus primus réx R6m4anG6rum fuisse putatur, Romu- 
lus is thought to have been the first king of the Romans. 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
Noun and Adjective Forms of the Verb. 217, 
@) fertur, feruntur, traditur, traduntur (only in the third 
person) ; as, — 
fertur Homérus caecus fuisse, Homer ts said to have been 
blind ; 
carmina Archilochi contuméliis referta esse traduntur, 
Archilochus’s poems are reported to have been full of 
abuse. 
NoTE.— In compound tenses and periphrastic forms, the last two classes of 
verbs, ¢), 2), more commonly take the impersonal construction; as, — 
traditum est Homérum caecum fuisse, the story goes that Homer was 
blind, 
Infinitive with Adjectives. 
333. The Infinitive with Adjectives (except paratus, assuétus, 
etc.; see § 328, 1) occurs only in poetry and post-Augustan prose 
writers ; as, — 
contentus dém6nstrasse, contented to have proved; 
audax omnia perpeti, old for enduring everything. 
Infinitive in Exclamations. 
334, The Infinitive is used in Exclamations implying scorn, indig- 
nation, or regret. An intensive -ne is often attached to some word in 
the clause. Examples: — 
huncine sdlem tam nigrum surréxe mihi, ¢o think that to-day’s sun 
rose with such evil omen for me! 
sedére t6tds diés in villa, fo stay whole days at the villa! 
Historical Infinitive. 
335. The Infinitive is often used in historical narrative instead of the 
Imperfect Indicative. The Subject stands in the Nominative ; as, — 
interim cottidié Caesar HaeduGs frimentum flagitare, meanwhile 
Caesar was daily demanding grain of the Haedui. 
PARTICIPLES. 
Tenses of the Participle. 
336. 1. The tenses of the Participle, like those of the 
Infinitive (see § 270), express time not absolutely, but with 
reference to the verb upon which the Participle depends.
-P-A-G-E-226
218 Syntax. 
2. The Present Participle denotes action contemporary with that of 
the verb. Thus :— 
audio té loquentem = you ARE speaking and I hear you; 
audiébam té loquentem = you WERE speaking and I heard you; 
audiam té loquentem = you WILL BE speaking and I shall hear you. 
a. The Present Participle is sometimes employed with Conative 
force; as, — 
assurgentem régem resupinat, as the king was trying to 
rise, he threw him down. 
3. The Perfect Passive Participle denotes action frior to that of 
the verb. Thus :— 
lociitus tace6 = 7 HAVE spoken and am silent; 
lociitus tacui = 7 HAD spoken and then was silent ; 
lociitus tacéb6 = / SHALL sfeak and then shall be silent. 
  4. The absolute time of the action of a participle, therefore, is 
determined entirely by the finite verb with which it is connected. 
5. Certain Perfect Passive Participles of Deponent and Semi- 
Deponent Verbs are used as Presents , vz. arbitratus, ausus, ratus, 
gavisus, solitus, iisus, cOnfisus, diffisus, seciitus, veritus 
Use of Participles. 
337. As an Adjective the Participle may be used either 
as an attributive or predicate modifier of a Substantive. 
1. Attributive Use. This presents no special peculiarities. Ex- 
amples are : — 
gloria est cOnsentiéns laus bon6rum, glory is the unanimous praise 
of the good ; 
Con6n mirés 4 Lysandr6é dirutés reficit, Conon restored the walls 
destroyed by Lysander. 
2. Predicate Use. Here the Participle is often equivalent to a 
subordinate clause. Thus the Participle may denote : — 
@) Time; as,— 
omne malum n&scéns facile opprimitur, every evil 7s 
easily crushed at birth. 
6) A Condition; as, — 
mente iti ndn possumus cib6 et pétidne compléti, 7f 
gorged with food and drink, we cannot use our intellects.
-P-A-G-E-227
  Noun and Adjective Forms of the Verb. 219 
c) Manner; as, — 
Solon senéscere sé dicébat multa in diés addiscentem, 
Solon said he grew old learning many new things daily. 
d) Means; as,— 
861 oriéns diem cGnficit, the sun, by ats rising, makes the 
day. 
é) Opposition (‘though’) ; as, — 
mendaci homini né vérum quidem dicenti crédimus, 
we do not believe a liar, though he speaks the truth. 
J) Cause; as, — 
perfidiam veritus ad suds recessit, sizce he feared 
treachery, he returned to his own troops. 
3. Vided and audi, besides the Infinitive, take the Present Par- 
ticiple in the Predicate use ; as, — 
vided té fugientem, / see you fleeing. 
a. So frequently faci6, fingd, indticG, erc. ; as, — 
eis Cat6nem respondentem facimus, we represent Cato reply- 
ing to them ; 
Homérus Laértem colentem agrum facit, Homer represents 
Laértes tilling the field. 
4. The Future Active Participle (except futiirus) is regularly con- 
fined to its use in the Periphrastic Conjugation, but in poets and later 
writers it is used independently, especially to denote purpose ; as, — 
vénérunt castra oppugnatiri, ¢hey came to assault the camp. 
5. The Perfect Passive Participle is often equivalent to a coérdi- 
nate clause; as, — 
urbem captam diruit, he captured and destroyed the city (lit. he de- 
stroyed the city captured). 
6. The Perfect Passive Participle in combination with a noun is 
sometimes equivalent to an abstract noun with a dependent Genitive ; 
as, — 
post urbem conditam, after the founding of the city ; 
Quinctius défénsus, the defense of- Quinctius ; 
quibus animus occupatus, the preoccupation of the mind with which. 
7. Habe6 sometimes takes a Perfect Passive Participle in the Predi- 
cate construction with a force not far removed from that of the Perfect 
or Pluperfect Indicative ; as, — 
copias quas coactas habébat, the forces which he had collected.
-P-A-G-E-228
220 Syntax. 
8. The Gerundive denotes obligation, necessity, etc. Like other Par- 
ticiples it may be used either as Attributive or Predicate. 
a) Less frequently as Attributive. Thus :— 
liber legendus, a book worth reading ; 
légés observandae, laws deserving of observance. 
6) More frequently as Predicate. 
1) In the Passive Periphrastic Conjugation (amandus 
est, efc.). In this use Intransitive Verbs can be used only 
impersonally, but admit their ordinary case-construction 
(Gen., Dat., Abl.) ; as, — 
veniendum est, z¢ zs necessary to come ; 
obliviscendum est injiriarum, one must forget injuries ; 
numquam proditG6ri crédendum est, you must never trust 
@ traitor ; 
su6 cuique iitendum est jidici6, every man must use his 
own judgment. 
2) After ciiré, Arovide for; d6, tradG, give over ; relin- 
qué, /eave; concédd, hand over; and some other verbs, 
instead of an object clause or to denote purpose ; as, — 
Caesar péntem in Arari faciendum ciiravit, Caesar pro- 
vided for the construction of a bridge over the Arar ; 
imperator urbem militibus diripiendam concessit, che 
general handed over the city to the soldiers to plunder.

THE GERUND. 
838. As a verbal noun the Gerund admits noun con- 
structions as follows :— 
1. Genitive. The Genitive of the Gerund is used — 
@) With Nouns, as Objective or Appositional Genitive (see 
§§ 200, 202); as, — 
cupiditas dominandi, desire of ruling ; 
ars scribendi, the art of writing. 
6) With Adjectives; as, — 
cupidus audiendi, desirous of hearing. 
c) With causa, gratia; as,— 
discendi causa, sor the sake of learning. 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  Noun and Adjective Forms of the Verb. 221 
2. Dative. The Dative of the Gerund is used — 
a) With Adjectives ; as, — 
aqua iitilis est bibend6, water zs useful for drinking. 
6) With Verbs (rarely) ; as, — 
adfui scribend6, / was present at the writing. 
3- Accusative. The Accusative of the Gerund is used only with 
Prepositions, chiefly ad and in to denote purpose ; as, — 
hom6 ad agendum natus est, man zs born for action. 
4. Ablative. The Ablative of the Gerund is used — 
@) Without a Preposition, as an Ablative of Means, Cause, ec. 
(see §§ 218, 219) ; as, — 
méns discend6 alitur et cdgitands, the mind is nourished 
by learning and reflection. 
Themistoclés maritimés praed6nés cOnsectand6 mare 
tiitum reddidit, Themistocles made the sea safe by fol- 
lowing up the pirates. 
6) After the prepositions a, dé, ex, in; as, — 
summa voluptas ex discend6 capitur, the keenest pleas- 
ure ts derived from learning 3 
multa dé bene beatéque vivends6 4 Platone disputata 
sunt, there was much discussion by Plato on the subject 
of living well and happily. 
5. As a rule, only the Genitive of the Gerund and the Ablative 
(without a preposition) admit a Direct Object. 
Gerundive Construction instead of the Gerund. 
339. 1. Instead of the Genitive or Ablative of the Gerund with a 
Direct Object, another construction may be, and very often is, used. 
This consists in putting the Direct Object in the case of the Gerund 
(Gen. or Abl.) and using the Gerundive in agreement with it. This 
is called the Gerundive Construction. Thus :— 
Gerunp ConsTRUcTION. GrrunpivE ConsTRUCTION. 
cupidus urbem videndi, desirous 
of seeing the city; 
délector Grdtdrés legendé, 7 am 
charmed with reading the orators. foupiaus urbis videndae ; 
} astector 6ratéribus legendis,
-P-A-G-E-230
  222 Syntax. 
2. The Gerundive Construction must be used to avoid a Direct 
Object with the Dative of the Gerund, or with a case dependent upon 
a Preposition ; as, — 
locus castris miiniendis aptus, a place adapted to fortifying acamp ; 
ad pacem petendam vénérunt, they came to ask peace; 
multum temporis cdnsiim6 in legendis poétis, 7 spend much time 
in reading the poets. 
3. In order to avoid ambiguity (see § 236, 2), the Gerundive Con- 
struction must not be employed in case of Neuter Adjectives used 
substantively. Thus regularly — 
philosophi cupidi sunt vérum invéstigandi, pidlosophers are eager 
Sor discovering truth (rarely véri invéstigandi) +4 
studium pliira cogndscendi, a desire of knowing more (not plirium 
cognéscendoérum). 
4. From the nature of the case only Transitive Verbs can be used 
in the Gerundive Construction; but itor, fruor, fungor, potior (orig- 
inally transitive) regularly admit it; as, — 
hostés in spem potiundérum castr6rum vénerant, the enemy had 
conceived the hope of gaining possession of the camp. 
5. The Genitives mei, tui, sui, nostri, vestri, when used in the 
Gerundive Construction, are regularly employed without reference to 
Gender or Number, since they were originally Neuter Singular Adjec- 
tives used substantively. Thus :— 
mulier sui servandi causa aufigit, the woman fled for the sake of 
saving herself ; 
légati in castra vénérunt sui piirgandi causa, rhe envoys came into 
camp for the purpose of clearing themselves. 
So nostri servandi causa, for the sake of saving ourselves. 
6. Occasionally the Genitive of the Gerundive Construction is used 
to denote purpose; as,— 
quae ille cépit légum ac libertatis subvertundae, which he under- 
took for the purpose of overthrowing the laws and liberty. 
7. The Dative of the Gerundive Construction occurs in some ex- 
pressions which have the character of formulas; as, — 
decemviri légibus scribundis, decemvirs for codifying the laws ; 
quindecimviri sacris faciundis, guwindecemvirs for performing the 
sacrifices. 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  
Codrdinate Conjunctions. 223 
THE SUPINE. 
340. 1. The Supine in-um is used after Verbs of motion to express 
purpose; as,— 
légati ad Caesarem gratulatum convénérunt, envoys came to Cae- 
sar to congratulate him. 
a. The Supine in -um may take an Object; as, — 
pacem petitum 6rat6rés R6mam mittunt, ¢hey send en- 
voys to Rome to ask for peace. 
4. Note the phrase: — 
dé (collocS) filiam niptum, / give my daughter in mar- 
riage. 
2. The Supine in -i is used as an Ablative of Specification with 
facilis, difficilis, incrédibilis, jicundus, optimus, efc.; also with 
fas est, nefas est, opus est; as, — 
haec rés est facilis cognitii, ¢his thing is easy to learn; 
hic est optimum factiy, Zhzs zs best to do. 
a. Only a few Supines in -a are in common use, chiefly auditi, 
cognitii, dictii, facti, visi. 
6. The Supine in -& never takes an Object. 
Cuapter VI.— Particks. 
COORDINATE CONJUNCTIONS. 
341. Copulative Conjunctions. These jozz one word, 
phrase, or clause to another. 
I. @) et simply connects. 
6) -que joins more closely than et, and is used especially where 
the two members have an internal connection with each 
other; as, — 
parentés liberique, Zarents and children; 
cum hominés aestii febrique jactantur, when people are 
tossed about with heat and fever.  
-P-A-G-E-232
  224 Syntax. 
¢) atque (ac) usually emphasizes the second of the two things 
connected, — and also, and indeed, and in fact. After words 
of “ékeness and difference atque (ac) has the force of as, 
than. Thus: — 
ego idem senti6 ac ti, / think the same as you; 
haud aliter ac, not otherwise than. 
d) neque (nec) means and not, neither, nor. 
2. @) -que is an enclitic, and is appended always to the second of 
two words connected. Where it connects phrases or clauses 
it is appended to the first word of the second clause; but 
when the first word of the second clause is a Preposition, 
-que is regularly appended to the next following word; as, — 
ob eamque rem, avd on account of that thing. 
4) atque is used before vowels and consonants ; ac never before 
vowels, and seldom before ec, g, qu. 
¢) et nGn is used for neque when the emphasis of the negative 
rests upon a special word; as,— 
vetus et n6n igndébilis 6rator, az old and not ignoble orator. 
ad) For and nowhere, and never, and none, the Latin regularly 
said nec isquam, nec umquam, nec illus, e/c. 
3. Correlatives. Copulative Conjunctions are frequently used 
correlatively ; as, — 
    et... et, doth... and; 
neque (nec) .. . neque (nec), meither .. . nor; 
cum... tum, while . . . at the same time; 
tum... tum, zot only .. . but also. 
Less frequently : — 
et... neque; neque... et. 
a. Note that the Latin, with its tendency to emphasize antithetical relations, 
often uses correlatives, especially et .. . et, et... meque, neque 
- - . @t, where the English employs but a single connective. 
4. In enumerations — 
a) The different members of a series may follow one another 
without connectives (Asyndeton; see § 346). Thus: — 
ex cupiditatibus odia, discidia, discordiae, séditidnés, 
bella nascuntur, from covetous desires spring up 
hatred, dissensions, discord, sedition, wars. 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  Coordinate Conjunctions. 225s 
6) The different members may severally be connected by et 
(Polysyndeton). Thus: — 
hérae cédunt et diés et ménsés et anni, hours and days 
and years and months pass away. 
c) The connective may be omitted between the former members, 
while the last two are connected by -que (rarely et) ; as, — 
Caesar in Carnutés, Andés Turonésque legiGnés dédii- 
cit, Caesar leads his legions into the territory of the 
Carnutes, Andes, and Turones. 
342. Disjunctive Conjunctions indicate an alternative. 
I. @) aut must be used when the alternatives are mutually ex- 
clusive ; as, — 
cita mors venit aut victGria laeta, (either) swift death or 
glad victory comes. 
6) vel, -ve (enclitic) imply a choice between the alterna- 
tives ; as, — 
qui aethér vel caelum néminatur, which is called aether 
or heaven. 
2. Correlatives. Disjunctive Conjunctions are often used correla- Rites : tively; as, aut .... aut, either... or; 
wel ) viccwels ert her ks ors 
sive!. « .IVe, 7g... 2s Or sf. 
343. Adversative Conjunctions. These denote ofpo- 
sition. 
I. a) sed, dut, merely denotes opposition. 
6) vérum, dx, is stronger than sed, but is less frequently used. 
¢) autem, but on the other hand, however, marks a transition. 
It is always post-positive. 
DEFINITION. A post-positive word is one that cannot begin a sen- 
tence, but is placed after one or more words. 
d) at, dut, is used especially in disputation, to introduce an 
opposing argument. 
é) atqui means dut yet. 
f) tamen, yet, usually stands after the emphatic word, but not 
always. 
£) vér6, however, indeed, in truth, is always post-positive. 
Q 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
226 Syntax. 
2. Note the correlative expressions : — 
n6n sdlum (n6n modo) . . . sed etiam, not only .. . but also;, 
non modo nén...sed né... quidem, wot only not, but not 
even; as,— 
n6n modo tibi nén irascor, sed né reprehend6 quidem factum 
tuum, / not only am not angry with you, but I do not even blame 
your action. 
a. Butwhen the sentence has but one verb, and this stands with the second 
member, ndn modo may be used for n6n modo nbn; as, — 
adsentati6 ndn modo amic6 sed né liberd quidem digna 
est, flattery is not only not worthy of a frientl, but not even of a 
Sree man. 
344, Illative Conjunctions. These represent the state- 
ment which they introduce as following from or as in con- 
formity with what has preceded. 
I. a) itaque = and so, accordingly. 
6) ergé = therefore, accordingly, 
c) igitur (regularly post-positive !) = therefore, accordingly. 
2. Igitur is never combined with et, atque, -que, or neque. 
345. Causal Conjunctions. These denote cause, or give 
an explanation. They are nam, namque, enim (post-positive), 
etenim, for. 
346. Asyndeton. The conjunction is sometimes omitted be- 
tween codrdinate members, particularly in lively or impassioned 
narration. Thus :— 
a) A Copulative Conjunction is omitted; as, — 
avaritia Infinita Insatiabilis est, avarice 7s boundless 
(and) insatiable ; 
Cn. Pompej6, M. Crass6 cdnsulibus, zw the consulship of 
Gnaeus Pompey (and) Marcus Crassus. 
The conjunction is regularly omitted between the names of 
consuls when the praenomen (J/arcus,Gazus, etc.) is expressed. 
6) An Adversative Conjunction may be omitted; as, — 
ratiOnés défuérunt, tibertas Sratidnis n6n défuit, argu- 
ments were lacking, (but) abundance of words was not.

  Adverbs. —Word-Order. 227 
ADVERBS. 
347. 1. The following particles, sometimes classed as 
Conjunctions, are more properly Adverbs : — 
etiam, also, even. 
quoque (always post-positive), a/so. 
quidem (always post-positive) lays stress upon the preceding word. 
It is sometimes equivalent to the English zzdeed, in fact, but 
more frequently cannot be rendered, except by vocal emphasis. 
né ... quidem mears zof even ; the emphatic word or phrase always 
stands between ; as, né ille quidem, ot even he. 
tamen and véré, in addition to their use as Conjunctions, are often 
employed as Adverbs. 
2. Negatives. Two Negatives are regularly equivalent to an 
affirmative as in English, as nén ni@lli, some; but when nén, némé, 
nihil, numquam, ¢fc., are accompanied by neque .. . neque, nén 
. nén, ndn modo, or né . . . quidem, the latter particles simply 
take up the negation and emphasize it; as, — 
habed hic néminem neque amicum neque cognatum, J have here 
no one, neither friend nor relative. 
n6n enim praetereundum est né id quidem, for not even that must 
be passed by. 
a. Haud in Cicero and Caesar occurs almost exclusively as a modifier 
of Adjectives and Adverbs, and in the phrase haud sci6 an, Later 
writers use it freely with verbs, 
Cuapter VII.— Word-Order and Sentence- 
Structure. 
‘A. WORD-ORDER. 
348. In the normal arrangement of the Latin sentence 
the Subject stands at the beginning of the sentence, the 
Predicate at the end; as, — 
Darius classem quingentarum navium comparavit, Darius got 
ready a fleet of five hundred ships. 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
228 Syntax. 
349. But for the sake of emphasis the normal arrange- 
ment is often abandoned, and the emphatic word is put 
at the beginning, less frequently at the end of the sen. 
PenCG,: aS) 
magnus in héc bell6 Themistoclés fuit, GREAT was Themistocles *n 
this war 3 
aliud iter habémus nillum, other course we have NONE. 
SPECIAL PRINCIPLES. 
350. 1. Nouns. A Genitive or other oblique case regularly fol- 
lows the word upon which it depends. Thus :— 
@) Depending upon a Noun :— 
tribiinus plébis, /vibune of the plebs 3 
filius régis, so of the king ; 
vir magni animi, a man of noble spirit. 
Yet always senatiis cénsultum, plébis scitum. 
6) Depending upon an Adjective : — 
ignarus rérum, zgnorant of affairs; 
digni amicitia, worthy of friendship ; 
pliis aequo, more than (what is) fair. 
2. Appositives. An Appositive regularly follows its Subject; 
as, — 
Philippus, réx Macedonum, Piilip, king of the Macedonians ; 
adsentati6, vitisrum adjitrix, fattery, promoter of evils. 
Yet flimen Rhénus, ¢he River Rhine; and always in good prose 
urbs Roma, the city Rome. 
3- The Vocative usually follows one or more words; as, — 
audi, Caesar, hear, Caesar! 
4. Adjectives. No general law can be laid down for the posi- 
tion of Adjectives. On the whole they precede the noun oftener 
than they foilow it. 
a. Adjectives of guantity (including numerals) regularly pre- 
cede their noun; as, — 
omnés hominés, a// men; 
septingentae navés, seven hundred vessels. 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  Word-Order. 229 
&. Note the force of position in the following : — 
media urbs, the middle of the city ; 
urbs media, the middle city ; 
extrémum bellum, ¢he end of the war ; 
bellum extrémum, ¢he last war. 
¢. R6manus and Latinus regularly follow; as, — 
senatus populusque Rémanus, the Roman Senate and 
People ; 
ladi R6mani, the Roman games ; 
fériae Latinae, the Latin holidays. 
d@. When a Noun is modified both by an Adjective and by a Geni- 
tive, a favorite order is: Adjective, Genitive, Noun; as, — 
summa omnium rérum abundantia, éhe greatest abun- 
dance of all things. 
5. Pronouns. 
a. The Demonstrative, Relative, and Interrogative Pronouns 
regularly precede the Noun; as, — 
hic hom6, ¢hzs man ; 
ille hom6, chat man ; 
erant duo itinera, quibus itineribus, efc., there were two 
routes, by which, etc. 
qui hom6? what sort of a man? 
4. But ille in the sense of ‘that well known,’ ‘that famous, 
usually stands after its Noun; as, — 
testula illa, that well-known custom of ostracism 3 
Médéa illa, that famous Medea. 
¢ Possessive and Indefinite Pronouns usually follow their 
Noun; as, — 
pater meus, my father ; 
hom6 quidam, a certain man}; 
mulier aliqua, some woman. 
But for purposes of contrast the Possessive often precedes 
its Noun; as, — 
meus pater, My father (.¢. as opposed to yours, his, etc.). 
@. Where two or more Pronouns occur in the same sentence, 
the Latin is fond of putting them in close proximity; as, — 
nisi forte ego vébis cessare videor, unless perchance 1 
seem to you to be doing nothing. 
   
-P-A-G-E-238
  230 Syntax. 
6. Adverbs and Adverbial phrases regularly precede the word they 
modify ; as, — 
valdé diligéns, extremely diligent; 
saepe dixi, / have often said ; 
té jam did hortamur, we have long been urging you; 
pauls post, a Little after. 
7. Prepositions regularly precede the words they govern. 
a. But limiting words often intervene between the Preposition 
and its case ; as, — 
dé commini hominum memoria, concerning the common 
memory of men ; 
ad beaté vivendum, /or living happily. 
6. When a noun is modified by an Adjective, the Adjective is 
often placed before the preposition; as, — 
magn6 in dolore, zz great grief; 
summa cum laude, with the highest credit ;~ 
qua dé causa, for which cause; 
hance ob rem, 07 account of this thing. 
¢. For Anastrophe, by which a Preposition is put after its case, see § 144, 3. 
8. Conjunctions. Autem, enim, and igitur regularly stand in 
the second place in the sentence, but when combined with est or 
sunt they often stand third; as, — 
ita est enim, for so it zs. 
9. Words or Phrases referring to the preceding sentence or tosome 
part of it, regularly stand first; as, — 
id ut audivit, Corcyram démigravit, when he heard that (referring 
to the contents of the preceding sentence), he moved to Corcyra; 
ed cum Caesar vénisset, timentés cénfirmat, when Caesar had 
come thither (i.e. to the place just mentioned), e encouraged the 
timid. 
10. The Latin has a fondness for putting side by side words which 
are etymologically related; as, — 
ut ad senem senex dé senectiite, sic h6c libr6 ad amicum 
amicissimus dé amicitia scripsi, as /, aw old man, wrote to 
an old man, on old age, so in this book, as a fond friend, [ have 
written to a friend concerning friendship. 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
Word-Order. 231 
11. Special rhetorical devices for indicating emphasis are the 
following :— 
a) Hypérbaton, which consists in the separation of words that 
regularly stand together; as, — 
septimus mihi Originum liber est in manibus, the 
seventh book of my ‘ Origines? is under way ; 
recept6 Caesar Oricd proficiscitur, having recovered 
Oricus, Caesar set out. 
6) Andphora, which consists in the repetition of the same word 
or the same word-order in successive phrases ; as, — 
sed pléni omnés sunt libri, plénae sapientium vGcés, 
pléna exemplérum vetustas, dut all books are full of 
it, the voices of sages are full of it, antiquity is full of 
examples of it. 
c) Chiasmus,! which consists in changing the relative order 
of words in two antithetical phrases ; as, — 
multés défendi, laesi néminem, many have [ defended, [ 
have injured no one ; 
horribilem illum diém aliis, ndbis faustum, ‘iat day 
dreadful to others, for us fortunate. 
d) Synchysis, or the interlocked arrangement. This is mostly 
confined to poetry, yet occurs in rhetorical prose, especially 
that of the Imperial Period; as, — 
simulatam Pompejanarum gratiam partium, pretended 
interest in the Pompeian party. 
12. Metrical Close. At the end of a sentence certain cadences 
were avoided ; others were much employed. Thus : — 
@) Cadences avoided. 
BOO) eS as, esse vidétur (close of hexameter). 
PT as, esse potest (close of pentameter). 
6) Cadences frequently employed. 
BEES as, auxerant. 
Se GE as, comprobavit. 
—vUvVY_v; as, esse videatur. 
ee as, rogati tud. 
  
1So named from a fancied analogy to the strokes of the Greek letter X (chz). 
Thus : — multds_ laesi 
défendi néminem
-P-A-G-E-240
232 Syntax. 
B. SENTENCE-STRUCTURE. 
351. 1. Unity of Subject.—In complex sentences the Latin 
regularly holds to unity of Subject in the different members; as, — 
Caesar primum su6, deinde omnium ex cénspectii remétis 
equis, ut aequat6 pericul6 spem fugae tolleret, cohor- 
tatus sués proelium commisit, Caesar having first removed 
his own horse from sight, then the horses of all, in order, by 
making the danger equal, to take away hope of flight, encouraged 
his men and joined battle. 
2. A word serving as the common Subject or Object of the main 
clause and a subordinate one, stands before both; as, — 
Haedui cum sé défendere nG6n possent, légatés ad Caesarem 
mittunt, since the Haedui could not defend themselves, they sent” 
envoys to Caesar ; 
ille etsi flagrabat bellandi cupiditate, tamen paciI serviendum 
putavit, although he was burning with a desire to fight, yet he 
thought he ought to aim at peace. 
a. The same is true also 
1) When the Subject of the main clause is Object 
(Direct or Indirect) of a subordinate clause ; as, — 
Caesar, cum hGc ei nintiatum esset, matirat ab urbe 
proficisci, when this had been reported to Caesar he 
hastened to set out from the city. 
2) When the Subject of a subordinate clause is at the 
same time the Object (Direct or Indirect) of the main 
clause ; as, — 
L. Manlid, cum dictator fuisset, M. PompG6nius tri- 
biinus plébis diem dixit, 1/7. Pomponius, tribune of 
the people, instituted proceedings against Lucius Man- 
lius though he had been dictator. 
3. Of subordinate clauses, temporal, conditional, and adversative 
clauses more commonly precede the main clause; indirect questions 
and clauses of purpose or result more commonly follow; as, — 
postquam haec dixit, profectus est, after he said this, he set out; 
si quis ita agat, impriidéns sit, 7f any one should act so, he would 
be devoid of foresight ; 
accidit ut ina nocte omnés Hermae déicerentur, ‘t happened 
that in a single night all the Hermae were thrown down.
-P-A-G-E-241
  Sentence-Structure. — Hints on Style. 233 
4. Sometimes in Latin the main verb is placed within the sub- 
ordinate clause ; as, — 
si quid est in mé ingeni, quod senti6 quam sit exiguum, ¢f there 
zs any talent in me, and [ know how little it zs. 
5. The Latin Period. The term Period, when strictly used, 
designates a compound sentence in which the subordinate clauses are 
inserted within the main clause; as, — 
Caesar etsi intellegébat qua dé causa ea dicerentur, tamen, né 
aestatem in Tréveris cOnsiimere cégerétur, Indutiomarum 
ad sé venire jussit, though Caesar perceived why this was 
said, yet, lest he should be forced to spend the summer among 
the Treveri, he ordered Indutiomarus to come to him. 
In the Periodic structure the thought is suspended until the end of 
the sentence is reached. Many Roman writers were extremely fond of 
this sentence-structure, and it was «well adapted to the inflectional 
character of their language; in English we generally avoid it. 
6. When there are several subordinate clauses in one Period, the 
Latin so arranges them as to avoid a succession of verbs. Thus:— 
At hostés cum misissent, qui, quae in castris gererentur, cog- 
noéscerent, ubi sé déceptés intelléxérunt, omnibus cépiis 
subseciti ad flimen contendunt, dut the enemy when they 
had sent men to learn what was going on in camp, after dis- 
covering that they had been outwitted, followed with all their 
Sorces and hurried to the river.- 
Cuarter VIII.— Hints on Latin Style. 
352. In this chapter brief consideration is given to 
a few features of Latin diction which belong rather to 
style than to formal grammar. 
NOUNS. 
353. 1. Where a distinct reference to several persons or things is 
involved, the Latin is frequently mach more exact in the use of the 
Plural than is the English; as, —
-P-A-G-E-242
  234 Syntax. 
domGs eunt, they go home (i.e. to their homes) ; 
GermAni corpora ciirant, the Germans care for the body ; 
anim6s militum recreat, he renews the courage of the soldiers ; 
diés noctésque timére, Zo Je in a state of fear day and night. 
2. In case of Neuter Pronouns and Adjectives used substantively 
the Latin often employs the Plural where the English uses the Singu 
lar; as, — 
omnia sunt perdita, everything zs lost ; 
quae cum ita sint, szwce this 7s so; 
haec omnibus pervulgata sunt, ¢hzs is very well known to all. 
3. The Latin is usually #orve concrete than the English, and espe- 
cially ess bold in the personification of abstract qualities. Thus :— 
4 puer6, 4 pueris, from boyhood ; 
Sulla dictatore, z7 Swlla’s dictatorship ; 
mé duce, under my leadership; 
Romani cum Carthaginiénsibus pacem fécérunt = Rome madé 
peace with Carthage ; 
liber doctrinae plénus = a dearned book ; 
pridentia Themistoclis Graecia servata est = Themistocles’s fore- 
sight saved Greece. 
4. The Nouns of Agency in -tor and -sor (see § 147. 1) denote a 
permanent or characteristic activity; as, — 
accisatorés (professional) accusers ; 
Gratdrés, pleaders ; 
cantérés, singers ; 
Arminius, Germaniae liberator, Arminius, liberator of Germany 
a. To denote single instances of an action, other expressions are 
commonly employed; as, — 
Numa, qui ROmul6 successit, Numa, successor of Romulus ; 
qui mea legunt, my readers ; 
qui mé audiunt, my auditors. 
5. The Latin avoids the use of prepositional phrases as modifiers of 
a Noun. In English we say: ‘ Zhe war against Carthage’ ; ‘a journey 
through Gaul’; ‘cities on the sea’; ‘the book in my hands’ ; ‘ the fight 
at Salamis’ ; etc. The Latin in such cases usually employs another 
mode of expression. Thus :— 
@) A Genitive; as, — 
dolor injiridrum, resentment at injuries.
-P-A-G-E-243
  FTints on Style. 235 
6) An Adjective ; as, — 
urbés maritimae, cities on the sea; 
pugna Salaminia, che fight at Salamis. 
c) A Participle; as, — 
pugna ad Cannas facta, ¢he battle at Cannae. 
@) A Relative clause; as, — 
liber qui in meis manibus est, the book in my hands. 
Nore. — Yet within certain limits the Latin does employ Prepo- 
sitional phrases as Noun modifiers. This is particularly frequent 
when the governing noun is derived from a verb. The following are 
typical examples : — 
transitus in Britanniam, the passage to Britain ; 
excessus 6 vita, departure from life ; 
odium erga R6mAan6s, hatred of the Romans ; 
liber dé senectiite, che book on old age; 
amor in patriam, love for one’s country. 
ADJECTIVES. 
354. I. Special Latin Equivalents for English Adjec- 
tives are — 
a) A Genitive; as, — 
virtités animi = moral virtues i 
dol6rés corporis = bodily ills. 
4) An Abstract Noun; as,— 
novitas rel = the strange circumstance 3 
asperitas viarum = rough roads. 
¢) Hendiadys (see § 374, 4); as,— 
rati6 et 6rd6 = systematic order 3 
ardor et impetus = eager onset. 
d@) Sometimes an Adverb; as, — 
omnés circa popull, al/ the surrounding tribes ; 
suds semper hostés, their perpetual foes. 
2. Often a Latin Noun is equivalent to an English Noun modified 
by an Adjective; as, — 
doctrina, theoretical knowledge ; pridentia, practical knowledge ; 
oppidum, walled town ; libellus, /ittle book.
-P-A-G-E-244
236 Syntax. 
3. Adjectives are not used in immediate agreement with proper 
names; but an Adjective may limit vir, hom, ille, or some other 
word used as-an Appositive of a proper name; as,— 
  Socratés, hom6 sapiéns = the wise Socrates ; 
Scipis, vir fortissimus = che doughty Scipio ; 
Syraciisae, urbs praeclarissima = famous Syracuse. 
4. An Adjective may de equivalent to a Possessive or Subjective 
Genitive; as — 
pastor régius, the shepherd of the king ; 
tumultus servilis, the uprising of the slaves. 
PRONOUNS. 
355. In Compound Sentences the Relative Pronoun has a fondness 
for connecting itself with the subordinate clause rather than the main 
one; as,— 
& qué cum quaererétur, quid maximé expediret, respondit, when 
it was asked of him what was best, he replied. (Less commonly, 
qui, cum ab e6 quaererétur, respondit.) 
2. Uterque, amb6. Uterque means each of two; ambd means 
both; as,— 
uterque frater abiit, cach of the two brothers departed (t.e. sepa- 
rately) ; 
amb6 fratrés abiérunt, z.c. the two brothers departed together. 
a. The Plural of uterque occurs — 
1) With Nouns used only in the Plural (see § 56); as, — 
in utrisque castris, 77 each camp. 
2) Where there is a distinct reference to two groups of 
persons or things; as, — 
utrique ducés clari fuérunt, the generals on each side (sev- 
eral in number) were famous. 
VERBS. 
356. 1. In case of Defective and Deponent Verbs, a Passive is 
supplied : — 
a) By the corresponding verbal Nouns in combination with 
esse, ef¢.; as, — 
in odi6d sumus, we are hated; 
in invidia sum, / am envied;
-P-A-G-E-245
  
  Hints on Style. 287, 
admirationi est, Ze zs admired; 
obliviéne obruitur, he zs forgotten (lit. 2s overwhelmed by 
oblivion) 3 
in isi esse, Zo be used. 
5) By the Passive of Verbs of related meaning. Thus: — 
agitari as Passive of persequi; 
temptari as Passive of adoriri. 
2. The lack of the Perfect Active Participle in Latin is supplied — 
@) Sometimes by the Perfect Passive Participle of the Depo- 
nent; as, — 
adhortatus, having exhorted ; 
veritus, having feared. 
6) By the Ablative Absolute; as, — 
hostium agris vastatis Caesar exercitum redixit, iav- 
ing ravaged the country of the enemy, Caesar led back 
his army. 
¢) By subordinate clauses ; as, — ’ 
ed cum advénisset, castra posuit, having arrived there, 
he pitched a camp ; 
hostés qui in urbem irriiperant, the enemy having burst 
into the city. 
3. The Latin agrees with English in the stylistic employment of 
the Second Person Singular in an indefinite sense (= ‘one’). Cf. 
the English ‘You can drive a horse to water, but you can’t make him 
drink. But in Latin this use is mainly confined to certain varieties of 
the Subjunctive, especially the Potential (§ 280), Jussive (§ 275), De- 
liberative (§ 277), and the Subjunctive in conditional sentences of the 
sort included under § 302, 2, and 303. Examples : — 
vidérés, you could see; 
iitare viribus, use your strength ; 
quid hdc homine facias, what are you to do with this man ? 
méns quoque et animus, nisi tamquam limini oleum instillés, 
exstinguuntur senectiite, the zutellect and mind too are ex- 
tinguished by old age, unless, so to speak, you keep pouring oil 
into the lamp; 
tant6 amdre possessi6nés suas amplexiI tenébant, ut ab eis 
membra divelli citius posse dicerés, they clung to their pos- 
sessions with such an affectionate embrace, that you would have 
said their limbs could sooner be torn from their bodies.
-P-A-G-E-246
238 Syntax. 
PECULIARITIES IN THE USE OF THE ACCUSATIVE. 
357. 1. To denote ‘so many years, etc., afterwards or before’ the 
Latin employs not merely the Ablative of Degree of Difference with 
post and ante (see § 223), but has other forms of expression. Thus: — 
post quingque ann6s, five years afterward; 
paucés ante diés, a few days before ; 
ante quadriennium, four years before ; 
post diem quartum quam ab urbe discesseramus, four days after 
we had left the city ; 
ante tertium annum quam décesserat, three years before he had 
died. 
2. The Latin seldom combines both Subject and Object with the 
same Infinitive; as, — 
R6mian6s Hannibalem vicisse cénstat. 
Such a sentence would be ambiguous, and might mean either that the 
Romans had conquered Hannibal, or that Hannibal had conquered the 
Romans. Perspicuity was gained by the use of the Passive Infini-- 
tive; as, — 
R6manés ab Hannibale victés esse cdnstat, z¢ 7s well established 
that the Romans were defeated by Hannibal. 
PECULIARITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF 
THE DATIVE. 
358.1. The English for does not always correspond to a Dative s 4) P' 
notion in Latin, but is often the equivalent of pr6 with the Ablative, 
viz. in the senses — 
a) In defense of 3 as, — 
pro patria mori, 0 die for one’s country. 
6) Instead of, in behalf of ; as, — 
finus pr6é omnibus dixit, ove spoke for all; 
haec pr6 lége dicta sunt, these things were said for the 
law. 
¢) In proportion to; as,— 
pr6 multitidine hominum eGrum finés erant angusti, 
Sor the population, their territory was small. 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  
ffints on Style. 239 
2. Similarly, English fo when it indicates motion is rendered in 
Latin by ad. 
a. Note, however, that the Latin may say either scribere ad 
aliquem, or scribere alicui, according as the idea of motion 
is or is not predominant. So in several similar expressions. ‘ 
3. In the poets, verbs of mingling with, contending with, joining, 
clinging to, etc., sometimes take the Dative. This construction is a 
Grecism. Thus: — 
sé miscet viris, he mingles with the men ; 
contendis Homér6, you contend with Homer ; 
dextrae dextram jungere, o clasp hand with hand. 
PECULIARITIES IN THE USE OF THE GENITIVE. 
359. 1. The Possessive Genitive gives emphasis to the possessor, 
the Dative of Possessor emphasizes ¢he fact of possession ; as, — 
hortus patris est, the garden is my father’s ; 
mihi hortus est, / Jossess a garden. 
2. The Latin can say either stulti or stultum est dicere, 7¢ zs 
foolish to say; but Adjectives of one ending permit only the Geni- 
tive; as, — 
sapientis est haec sécum reputare, zz is the part of a wise man to 
consider this.

PROSODY.

360. Prosody treats of metres and versification. 
361. Latin Verse. Latin Poetry was essentially different 
in character from English. In our own language, poetry is 
based upon accent, and poetical form consists essentially in 
a certain succession of accented and unaccented syllables. 
Latin poetry, on the other hand, was based not upon 
accent, but upon gvantity, so that with the Romans poeti- 
cal form consisted in a certain succession of long and short 
syllables, z.e. of long and short intervals of time. 
This fundamental difference in the character of English 
and Latin poetry is a natural result of the difference in 
character of the two languages. English is a strongly 
accented language, in which quantity is relatively subordi- 
nate. Latin, on the other hand, was a quantitative lan- 
guage, in which accent was relatively subordinate. 
QUANTITY OF VOWELS AND SYLLABLES. 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES. 4 
362. The general principles for the quantity of vowels 
and syllables have been given above in § 5. The following 
peculiarities are to be noted here : — 
1. A vowel is usually short when followed by ‘another vowel 
(§ 5. A. 2), but the following exceptions occur: — 
240
-P-A-G-E-249
  Quantity of Vowels and Syllables. 241 
a) In the Genitive termination -Ius (except alterius) ; as, illius, 
t6tius. Yet the i may be short in poetry; as, illius, totius. 
4) In the Genitive and Dative Singular of the Fifth Declension ; 
as, diéi, aciéi. But fidéi, réi, spi (§ 52, 1). 
c) In fi6, excepting fit and forms where i is followed by er. 
Thus : fiébam, fiat, fiunt; but fieri, fierem. 
d) In a few other words, especially words derived from the 
Greek; as, dius, Aenéas, Darius, hérGes, ¢e/c. 
  
v A diphthong is usually long ($ 5. B. 2), but the preposition 
prae in composition is often shortened before a vowel; as, praéaciitus. 
3. A syllable containing a short vowel followed by two consonants 
(§ 5. B. 2) is long, even when one of the consonants is in the follow- 
ing word; as, terret populum. Occasionally the syllable is long 
when both consonants are in the following word; as, pr6 segete 
spicas. 
4. Compounds of jaci6, though written inicit, adicit, efc., have 
the first syllable long, as though written inj-, adj-. 
5. Before j, 4 and € made a long syllable, e.g. in major, pejor, 
ejus, ejusdem, Pompejus, rejécit, e¢c. These were pronounced, 
mai-jor, pei-jor, ei-jus, Pompei-jus, rei-jécit, cfc. So also some- 
times before i, ¢.g. Pompe-i, pronounced Pompei-i; re-icid, pro- 
nounced rei-icis. 
Quantity of Final Syllables. 
A. Final Syllables ending in a Vowel. 
363. 1. Final a is mostly short, but is long: — 
a) In the Ablative Singular of the First Declension; as, porta. 
6) In the Imperative; as, lauda. 
¢) In indeclinable words (except it&, quia) ; as, triginta, con- 
tra, posted, interea, efc. 
2. Final e is usually short, but is long — 
a) In the Ablative Singular of the Fifth Declension; as, 
dié, r6; hence hodié, quaré. Here belongs also famé 
(§ 59-2. 8)- 6) In the Imperative of the Second Conjugation; as, mon& 
habé, efc.; yet occasionally cavé, valé. . 
¢) In Adverbs derived from Adjectives of the Second Declen- 
sion, along with feré and fermé. Ben&, malé, temeré, 
saepé have e. 
ad) Iné, dé, mé%, té, sé, n& (not, lest), né (verily). 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  242 Prosody. 
3. Final i is usually long, but is short in nisi and quasi. Mihi, 
tibi, sibi, ibi, ubi, have regularly i, but sometimes 1; yet always 
ibidem, ibique, ubique. 
4. Final o is regularly long, but is short — 
a) Ineg6, dud, modd (only), citd. 
6) Rarely in the First Person Singular of the Verb, and in 
Nominatives of the Third Declension; as, am6, led. 
c) In a few compounds beginning with the Preposition pro, 
especially before f; as préfundere, prOficisci, prdfugere. 
5. Final u is always long. 
B. Final Syllables ending in a Consonant. 
364. 1. Final syllables ending in any other consonant than s are 
short. The following words, however, have a long vowel: s4l, s61, 
Lar, par, vér, fiir, dic, diic, én, n6n, quin, sin, sic, cir, hic! 
(this). Also adverbs in c; as, hic, hiic, istic, illiic, efc. 
2. Final syllables in -as are long ; as, terras, amas. 
3. Final syllables in -es are regularly long, but are short — 
     
@) In the Nominative and Vocative Singular of dental stems 
(§ 33) of the Third Declension which have a short penult in 
the Genitive; as, segés (segetis), obsés (obsidis), milés, 
divés. But a few have -6s; vz. pés, ariés, abiés, pari 
4) In &s (thou art), penés. 
  4. Final -os is usually long, but short in 5s (ossis), compd;, 
impéds. 
5. Final -is is usually short, but is long — 
a) In Plurals; as, portis, hortis, n6bis, v6bis, nibis (Acc.). 
6) In the Second Person Singular Perfect Subjunctive Ac- 
tive, as amaveris, monueris, audiveris, cfc. Yet occasional 
exceptions occur. 
¢) In the Second Person Singular Present Indicative Active of 
the Fourth Conjugation; as, audis 
d@) In vis, force; 1s, thou goest; fis; sis; velis; ndlis; vis, 
thou wilt (mavis, quamvis, quivis, efc.).   
  6. Final -us is usually short, but is long — 
a) In the Genitive Singular and in the Nominative, Accusative, 
and Vocative Plural of the Fourth Declension ; as, friictiis. 
1 Rarely hic, 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  Verse-Structure. 243 
4) In the Nominative and Vocative Singular of those nouns of 
the Third Declension in which the u belongs to the stem; 
as, paliis (-iidis), servitiis (-fitis), telliis (-iiris). 
365. Greek Nouns retain in Latin their original quantity; as, 
Aenéa, epitomé, Délos, Pallas, Simois, Salamis, Didiis, Paridi, 
aér, aethér, cratér, hérGas. Yet Greek nouns in -wp regularly 
shorten the vowel of the final syllable; as, rhétér, Hector. 
VERSE-STRUCTURE. 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES. 
366. 1. The metrical unit in versification is a short syllable, tech- 
nically called a mora (UV). A long syllable (_.) is regarded as equiva- 
lent to two morae. 
2. A Foot isa group of syllables. The following are the most 
important kinds of fundamental feet :— 
Feet or Taree Morar. Fest or Four Morag. 
os Oe iroehse, —vuv_ Dactyl. 
vu — Iambus. uu — Anapaest. 
3. A Verse is a succession of feet. 
4. The different kinds of verses are named Trochaic, Iambic, Dac- 
tylic, Anapaestic, according to the foot which forms the basis of their 
structure. 
5. Ictus. In every fundamental foot the long syllable naturally re- 
ceives the greater prominence. This prominence is called ictus.! It is 
denoted thus: ZU U3; Zu. 
6. Thesis and Arsis. The syllable which receives the ictus is 
called the thesis ; the rest of the foot is called the arsis. 
7. Blision. Final syllables ending in a vowel, a diphthong, or -m 
are regularly elided before a word beginning with a vowel or h. In 
reading, we ordinarily omit the elided syllable entirely. Probably the 
ancients slurred the words together in some way. This may be indi- 
cated as follows: corporé in ind; multum ille et; ménstrum hor- 
rendum ; causae irarum. 
  a, Omission of elision is called Hiatus. It occurs especially before and 
after monosyllabic Interjections; as, O et praesidium. 
  
1 Ictus was not accent,—neither stress accent nor musical accent, —but was 
simply the quantitative prominence inherent in a long syllable,

      244 Prosody. 
8. The ending of a word within a foot is called a Caestira (cutting). 
Every verse usually has one prominent caesura. The ending of a word 
and foot together within the verse is called a diaeresis. 
g. Verses are distinguished as Catalectic or Acatalectic. A-.Cata- 
lectic verse is one in which the last foot is not complete, but lacks one 
or more syllabl 
1o. At the end ofa verse a slight pause occurred. Hence the final 
syllable may be either long or short (syllaba anceps), and may ter- 
minate in a vowel or m, even though the next verse begins with 
a vowel. 
11. Iambic, Trock and Anapaestic verses are further designated 
as dimeter, trimeter, tetrameter, according to the number of dipodies 
(pairs of feet) which they contain. Dactylic verses are measured dy 
single feet, and are designated as tetrameter, pentameter, hexameter, 
accordingly. 
    an Acatalectic verse has its last foot complete. 
    SPECIAL PECULIARITI 
367. 1. Synizésis (Synaéresis). Two successive vowels in the 
interior of a word are often united into a long syllable; as, — 
aureis, deinde, anteire, deesse. 
  2. Didstole. A syllable usually short is 
  sometimes long; as, — 
vidét, audit. 
3: SYstole. A syllable usually long is sometimes short ; as, — 
stetérunt. 
  a. Diastole and Systole are not mere arbitrary processes. They 
usually represent an earlier pronunciation which had passed 
out of vogue in the ordinary speech. 
  4. After a consonant, i and u sometimes become j and v. The 
preceding syllable then becomes long; as, — 
abjete for abiete ; genva for genua. 
  Sometimes v becomes u; as, — 
silua for silva; dissolué for dissolvd. 
6. Sometimes a verse has an extra syllable. Such a verse is 
called an Hypérmeter. The extra syllable ends in a vowel, or 
-m, and is united with the initial vowel or h of the next verse by 
Synaphéia. Thus:— 
wee ee ees igndri hominumque loc6Grumque~ 
erramus.
-P-A-G-E-253
  Verse-Structure. 245 
7. Tmesis (cutting). Compound words are occasionally separated 
into their elements ; as, — 
quo mé cunque rapit tempestas, for quécunque, e/c. 
8. S¥ncope. A short vowel is sometimes dropped between two 
consonants ; as, — 
repostus for repositus. 
THE DACTYLIC HEXAMETER. 
368. 1. The Dactylic Hexameter, or Heroic Verse, 
consists theoretically of six dactyls. But in all the feet 
except the fifth, a spondee (_ _) may take the place of 
the dactyl. The sixth foot may be either a spondee or a 
trochee, since the final syllable of a verse may be either 
long or short (syllaba anceps). The following represents 
the scheme of the verse : — 
L090; 230; 250; 20, 2M, Zy. 
2. Sometimes we find a spondee in the fifth foot. Such verses are 
called Spondaic. A dactyl usually stands in the fourth place, and the 
fifth and sixth feet are generally made up of a quadrisyllable ; as, — 
armatumque aur6 circumspicit Oriéna 
cara deum subolés, magnum Jovis incrémentum. 
3. Caesura. 
@) The favorite position of the caesura in the Dactylic Hexam- 
eter is after the thesis of the third foot; as,— 
arma virumque can6 || Trdjae qui primus ab Gris. 
6) Less frequently the caesura occurs after the thesis of the 
fourth foot, usually accompanied by another in the second 
foot; as, — 
inde tor6 || pater Aenéas || sic Grsus ab altd est. 
c) Sometimes the caesura occurs between the two short syl- 
lables of the third foot; as, — 
O passi gravidra || dabit deus his quoque finem. 
This caesura is called Feminine, as opposed to the caesura 
after a long syllable, which is called Masculine (as under 
a@and 6).
-P-A-G-E-254
246 Prosody. 
d@) A pause sometimes occurs at the end of the fourth foot. 
This is called the Bucolic Diaeresis, as it was borrowed by 
the Romans from the Bucolic poetry of the Greeks. Thus :— 
sdlstitium pecori défendite; || jam venit aestas. 
DACTYLIC PENTAMETER. 
369. 1. The Dactylic Pentameter consists of two parts, 
each of which contains two dactyls, followed by a long 
syllable. Spondees may take the place of the dactyls 
in the first part, but not in the second. The long syllable 
at the close of the first half of the verse always ends a 
word. The scheme is the following : — 
LZRLZPLNAR Fey 
2. The Pentameter is never used alone, but only in connection with 
the Hexameter. The two arranged alternately form the so-called Ele- 
giac Distich. Thus:— 
Vergilium vidi tantum, nec amara Tibull6 
Tempus amicitiae fata dedére meae. 
IAMBIC MEASURES. 
370. 1. The most important Iambic verse is the Iambic 
Trimeter (§ 366. 11), called also Senarius. This is an acata- 
lectic verse. It consists of six Iambi. Its pure form is : — 
VR VV eV eV ee Ue 
Beatus ille qui procul neg6tiis. 
The Caesura usually occurs in the third foot; less fre- 
quently in the fourth. 
2. In place of the Iambus, a Tribrach (U UU) may stand in any 
foot but the last. In the odd feet (first, third, and fifth) may stand a 
Spondee, Dactyl, or Anapaest, though the last two are less frequent. 
Sometimes a Proceleusmatic (UW U u u) occurs. 
3. In the Latin comic writers, Plautus and Terence, great free- 
dom is permitted, and the various equivalents of the Iambus, vz. 
the Dactyl, Anapaest, Spondee, Tribrach, Proceleusmatic, are freely 
admitted in any foot except the last.

I. JULIAN CALENDAR. 
371. 1. The names of the Roman months are: Janudrius, Februa- 
rius, Martius, Aprilis, Majus, Jinius, Jilius (Quintilis? prior to 
46 B.C.), Augustus (Sextilis ! before the Empire), September, Octé- 
ber, November, December. These words are properly Adjectives 
in agreement with ménsis understood. 
2. Dates were reckoned from three points in the month : — 
a) The Calends, the first of the month. 
6) The Nones, usually the fifth of the month, but the seventh 
in March, May, July, and October. 
¢) The Ides, usually the thirteenth of the month, but the fif- 
teenth in March, May, July, and October. 
3. From these points dates were reckoned backward; consequently 
all days after the Ides of any month were reckoned as so many days 
before the Calends of the month next following. 
4. The day before the Calends, Nones, or Ides of any month is 
designated as pridié Kalendas, Nonas, Idis. The second day be- 
fore was designated as dié tertis ante Kalendas, NénAs, e/c. Simi- 
larly the third day before was designated as dié quart6, and so on. 
These designations are arithmetically inaccurate, but the Romans 
reckoned both ends of the series. The Roman numeral indicating the 
date is therefore always larger by one than the actual number of days 
before Nones, Ides, or Calends. 
5. In indicating dates, the name of the month is added in the form 
of an Adjective agreeing with Kalendas, Nonas, Idiis. Various forms 
of expression occur, of which that given under @) is most common: — 
a) dié quinté ante Idiis Martias; 
4) quinté ante Idiis Martias ; 
¢) quints (V) Idiis Martias ; 
d@) ante diem quintum Idis Martias. 
1 Originally the Roman year began with March. This explains the names 
Quintilis, Sextilis, September, ec., fifth month, sixth month, etc.

II. PROPER NAMES. 
373. 1. The name of a Roman citizen regularly consisted of three 
parts: the praendmen (or given name), the ndmen (name of the gens 
or clan), and the cognémen (family name). Such a typical name is 
exemplified by Marcus Tullius Cicer6, in which Marcus is the prae- 
némen, Tullius the n6men, and Ciceré the cogndmen. Sometimes 
a second cogn6men (in later Latin called an agndmen) is added — 
especially in honor of military achievements; as, — 
G4dius Cornélius Scipis Africanus. 
2. ABBREVIATIONS OF PROPER NAMES. 
   
   
   A. = Aulus. Mam. = Mamercus. 
App. = Appius. N. = Numerius. 
C. = Gaius. P. = Piblius. 
Cn. = Gnaeus. Q. = Quintus. 
D. = Decimus. Sex. = Sextus. 
K. = Kaesé. = Servius. 
L. = Liicius. = Spurius.

  Ill. FIGURES OF SYNTAX AND RHETORIC. 
A. Figures of Syntax. 
374. .1. Ellipsis is the omission of one or more words; as, —

2. Brachylogy is a brief or condensed form of expression ; as, ~ 
ut ager sine cultira friictudsus esse nén potest, sic sine doc- 
trina animus, as a field cannot be productive without cultiva- 
tion, so the mind (cannot be productive) without learning. 
Special varieties of Brachylogy are — 
@) Zeugma, in which one verb is made to stand for two; as, — 
minis aut blandimentis corrupta = (/erriied) by threats 
or corrupted by flattery. 
6) Compendiary Comparison, by which a modifier of an 
object is mentioned instead of the object itself; as, — 
dissimilis erat Charés edrum et factis et mGribus, lit.

3. Pléonasm is an unnecessary fullness of expression; as, — 
prius praedicam, lit. / well first say in advance. 
4. Hendiadys (ev a dvolv, one through two) is the use of two 
nouns joined by a conjunction, in the sense of a noun modified by a 
Genitive or an Adjective; as, — 
febris et aestus, the heat of fever ; 
celeritate cursiique, dy swift running. 
5. Prolépsis, or Anticipation, is the introduction of an epithet 
in advance of the action which makes it appropriate; as, — 
submersas obrue puppés, lit. overwhelm their submerged ships, 
z.e. overwhelm and sink their ships. 
a. The name Prolepsis is also applied to the introduction of a noun 
or pronoun as object of the main clause where we should expect 
it to stand as subject of a subordinate clause. Thus :— 
nésti Marcellum quam tardus sit, you know how slow 
Marcellus is (lit. you know Marcellus, how slow he is). 
Both varieties of Prolepsis are chiefly confined to poetry.

  of grammatical cor 
  tency in the con- 
    
tum Anci filil. . . impénsius eis indignitas créscere, then the sons 
of Ancus . . . their indignation increased all the more. 
7. Hysteron Préteron consists in the inversion of the natural 
order of two words or phrases ; as,— 
moriamur et in media arma ruamus = /et ws rush into the midst of 
arms and die.

as, sénsim sine sénsii aetas senéscit. 
4. Onomatope@ia is the suiting of sound to sense; as, —

THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
I. RACIAL PREJUDICES 
Proup of his wonderful achievements, civilized man 
looks down upon the humbler members of mankind. He 
has conquered the forces of nature and compelled them 
to serve him. He has transformed inhospitable forests 
into fertile fields. The mountain fastnesses are yielding 
their treasures to his demands. The fierce animals 
which are obstructing his progress are being exterminated, 
while others which are useful to him are made to increase 
a thousand-fold. The waves of the ocean carry him 
from land to land, and towering mountain-ranges set 
him no bounds. His genius has moulded inert matter 
into powerful machines which await a touch of his hand 
to serve his manifold demands. 
With pity he looks down upon those members of the 
human race who have not succeeded in subduing nature; 
who labor to eke a meagre existence out of the products 
of the wilderness; who hear with trembling the roar of 
B t
-P-A-G-E-11
2 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
the wild animals, and see the products of their toils | 
destroyed by them; who remain restricted by ocean, | 
river, or mountains; who strive to obtain the necessities 
of life with the help of few and simple instruments. 
Such is the contrast that presents itself to the observer. 
What wonder if civilized man considers himself a being 
‘of higher order as compared to primitive man, if he 
claims that the white race represents a type higher than | 
all others ! 
Before accepting this conclusion which places the | 
stamp of eternal inferiority upon whole races of man, } 
we may well pause, and.subject the basis of our opinions 4 
regarding the aptitude of different peoples and races to 1 
a searching analysis. The naive assumption of the i 
superiority of the European nations and their descend- 
ants is obviously based upon their wonderful achieve- 4 
ments. We conclude that, as the civilization is higher, 4 
the aptitude for civilization is also higher; and, as the 
aptitude for civilization presumably depends upon the q 
perfection of the mechanism of body and mind, the in- j 
ference is drawn that the white race represents the 
highest type of perfection. In this conclusion, which is | 
reached through a comparison of the social status of j 
civilized man with that of primitive man, the tacit i 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
RACIAL PREJUDICES 3 
assumption is made that achievement depends solely, or 
at least primarily, upon the aptitude for an achievement. 
The assertion of a higher aptitude of the European 
nations leads at once to a second inference relating to the 
significance of difference in type between the European 
race and the races of other continents, or even of dif- 
ferences between various European types. The line of 
thought which we unconsciously pursue is about as 
follows. Since the aptitude of the European is highest, 
his physical and mental type is also highest, and every 
deviation from the white type necessarily represents a 
characteristic feature of a lower type. 
That this unproved assumption underlies our judg- 
ments of races, appears from the fact, that, other condi- 
tions being equal, a race is commonly described as the 
lower, the more fundamentally it differs from the white 
race. Its effect may also be noticed in the long-con- 
tinued discussions of the occurrence of anatomical pecul- 
iarities in primitive man which would characterize him 
as a being of lower order in the zodlogical series, and 
in the emphasis laid upon the non-occurrence of such 
traits in primitive man and their occurrence in the Euro- 
pean race. , 
The subject and form of these discussions show that

   the idea dwells in the minds of investigators that we 
should expect to find in the white race the highest type 
of man. 
In drawing inferences from social distinctions, the same 
point of view is frequently held. It is assumed, that, ag 
the mental development of the white race is the highest, 
it also has the highest aptitude in this direction, and 
therefore its mind is supposed to have the most subtilg 
organization. As the ultimate psychical causes are nog 
80 apparent as anatomical characteristics, the judgment 
of the mental status of a people is generally guided by, 
the difference between its social status and our own! 
the greater the difference between their intellectual 
emotional, and moral processes and those which are found 
in our civilization, the harsher the judgment on the peopled

who probably had a pitying smile for-the dreamer whd 
clung to the ideas of a time which they had left faq 
behind. 
"In order to understand clearly the relations betweetl 
race and civilization, the two unproved assumptions al 
which I have referred must be subjected to a searching
-P-A-G-E-14

analysis. We must investigate in how far we are justi- 
fied in assuming that achievement is primarily due to 
exceptional aptitude, and in how far we are justified in 
assuming that the European type — or, taking the notion 
in its extreme form, that the North European type — 
represents the highest development of mankind. It will 
be advantageous to clear up these points before we take 
up the detailed inquiry. 
In regard to the former point, it might be said, that, 
although achievement is not necessarily a measure of 
aptitude, it seems admissible to judge the one by the 
other. Have not most races had the same chances for 
development? Why, then, did the white race alone 
develop a civilization which is sweeping the whole world, 
and compared to which all other civilizations appear as 
feeble beginnings cut short in early childhood, or arrested 
and petrified in an early stage of development? Is it 
not, to say the least, probable that the race which 
attained the highest stage of civilization was the most 
gifted one, and that those races which remained at the 
bottom of the scale were not capable of rising to higher 
levels ? 
In order to find an answer to these questions, let 
us consider briefly the general outlines of the history

   6 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
of civilization; let our minds go back a few thousand | 
years, until we reach the time when the civilizations of | 
eastern and of western Asia were in their infancy. As }} 
time passed on, these civilizations were transferred from }f 
one people to another; some of those who had repre- 
sented the highest type of culture sinking back into j 
obscurity, while others took their places. During the 
dawn of history we see civilization cling to certain 
districts, in which it is taken up, now by one people, 4 
now by another. In the numerous conflicts of these} 
times the more civilized people were often vanquished. |! 
The conqueror, however, learned the arts of life from t 
the conquered, and carried on the work of civilization. [ 
Thus the centres of civilization were shifting to andj 
fro over a limited area, and progress was slow andf| a 
i 
| halting. At the same period the ancestors of the rac 
     that are now among the most highly civilized were 
no way superior to primitive man as we find him nowf 
in regions that have not come into contact with modernfi 
civilization. . 
Was the civilization attained by these ancient peopleéf 
of such character as to allow us to claim for them 
genius superior to that of any other race ? 
First of all, we must bear in mind that none of the
-P-A-G-E-16
RACIAL PREJUDICES 7 
civilizations was the product of the genius of a single 
people. Ideas and inventions were carried from one to 
the other; and, although intercommunication was slow, 
each people which participated in the ancient develop- 
ment contributed its share to the general progress. 
Proofs without number have been forthcoming which 
show that ideas have been disseminated as long as people 
have come into contact with one another, and that neither 
race nor language nor distance limits their diffusion. As 
all have worked together in the development of the 
ancient civilizations, we must bow to the genius of all, 
whatever group of mankind they may represent, — 
Hamitic, Semitic, Aryan, or Mongol. 
We may now ask, Did no other races develop a culture 
of equal value? It would seem that the civilizations of 
ancient Peru and of Central America may well be com- 
pared with the ancient civilizations of the Old World. In 
both we find a high stage of political organization: we 
find division of labor and an elaborate ecclesiastical or- 
ganization, Great architectural works were undertaken, 
requiring the co-operation of many individuals. Ani- 
mals and plants were domesticated, and the art of writing 
had been invented. The inventions and knowledge of 
the peoples of the Old World seem to have been somewhat

  8 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
more numerous and extended than those of the races of { 
the New World, but there can be no doubt that the] 
general status of their civilization was nearly equally } 
high! This will suffice for our consideration. 
What, then, is the difference between the civilization ( 
of the Old World and that of the New World? It is i 
essentially a difference in-time. The one reached a cer- | 
tain stage three thousand or four thousand years sooner 
than the other. i 
Although much stress has been laid upon this greater} 
rapidity of development in the Old World, I think that it# 
is not by any means proof of greater ability of the races} 
of the Old World, but that it is adequately explained by} 
the laws of chance. When two bodies run through thel 
same course with variable rapidity, sometimes quickly, 
sometimes slowly, their relative position will be more 
likely to show accidental differences, the longer the course} 
which they run. Thus two infants a few months old will 
be much alike in their physiological and psychical de-4 
velopment ; two youths of equal age will differ much more jf 
and two old men of equal age may, the one still be in full 
possession of his powers, the other on the decline, due 
mainly to the accidental acceleration or retardation of i

-P-A-G-E-18
RACIAL PREJUDICES 9 
their development. The difference in period of develop- 
ment does not signify that the one is by heredity structu- 
rally inferior to the others. 
Apprying the same reasoning to the history of mankind, 
we may say that the difference of a few thousand years is 
insignificant as compared to the age of the human race. 
The time required to develop the existing races is entirely 
a matter of conjecture, but we may be sure that it is long. 
We also know that man existed in the Eastern and 
Western Hemispheres at a time that can be measured by 
geological standards only. Penck’s recent investigations 
on the glacial age in the Alps have led him to the conclu- 
sion that the age of man must be measured by a span of 
time exceeding one hundred thousand years, and that 
the highly specialized civilization of the Magdalenian is 
not Jess than twenty thousand years old. There is no 
reason to believe that this stage was reached by mankind 
the world over at the same period, but we must assume 
as the initial point the remotest times in which we find 
traces of man. What does it mean, then, if one group of 
mankind reached the same stage at the age of a hundred 
thousand years as was reached by the other at the age of 
a hundred and four thousand years? Would not the life- 
history of the people, and the vicissitudes of its history,
-P-A-G-E-19
10 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
be fully sufficient to explain a delay of this character, 
without necessitating us to assume a difference in their 
aptitude to social development? (See Waitz.) This 
retardation would be significant only if it could be shown 
that it occurs independently over and over again in the 
same race, while in other races greater rapidity of develop- 
ment was found repeatedly in independent cases. 
The fact deserves attention, however, that at present 
practically all the members of the white race participate | 
to a greater or less degree in the advance of civilization, 
while in none of the other races has the civilization that 
has been attained at one time or another been able to 
reach all the tribes or peoples of the same race. This 
does not necessarily mean that all the members of the 
white race had the power of originating and developing the’ 
germs of civilization with equal rapidity; for there is no 
evidence that the cognate tribes which have all developed 
under the influence of a civilization originated by a few 
members of the race, would not, without this help, have | 
required a much longer time to reach the high level which + 
they now occupy. It seems to show, however, a remark- 
able power of assimilation, which has not manifested itself | 
*to an equal degree in any other race. | 
Thus the problem presents itself of discovering the j 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
RACIAL PREJUDICES II 
reason why the tribes of ancient Europe readily assimi- 
lated the civilization that was offered to them, while at 
present we see primitive people dwindle away and become 
degraded before the approach of civilization, instead of 
being elevated by it. Is not this a proof of a higher or- 
ganization of the inhabitants of Europe? 
I believe the reasons for this fact are not far to seek, and 
do not necessarily lie in a greater ability of the races of 
Europe and Asia. First of all, in appearance these people _ 
were alike to civilized man of their times. Therefore 
the fundamental difficulty for the rise of primitive people 
—namely, that an individual who has risen to the level 
of the higher civilization is still looked upon as belonging 
to an inferior race — did not prevail. Thus it was pos- 
sible that in the colonies of ancient times society could 
grow by accretion from among the more primitive people. 
Furthermore, the devastating influences of diseases 
which nowadays begin to ravage the inhabitants of terri- 
tories newly opened to the whites were not so strong, on 
account of the permanent contiguity of the people of the 
Old World, who were always in contact with one another, 
and therefore subject to the same influences. The in- 
vasion of America and Polynesia, on the other hand, was 
accompanied by the introduction of new diseases among
-P-A-G-E-21
12 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
the natives of these countries. The suffering and devas- 
tation wrought by epidemics which followed the discovery 
are too well known to be described in full. In all cases § 
in which a material reduction in numbers occurs ina © 
thinly settled area, the economic life, as well as the social 
structure, is almost completely destroyed. 
In addition to this, it may be said that the contrast * 
between the culture represented by the modern white and (7 
that of primitive man is far more fundamental than that 
between the ancients and the people with whom they | 
came in contact. Particularly, the methods of manufac- | 
ture have developed so enormously, that the industries 1 
of the primitive people of our times are exterminated by 
the cheapness and large quantity of the products im- | 
ported by the white trader, because primitive man is ‘ 
unable to compete with the power of production of the 
machines of the whites, while in olden times the supe- 
rior hand-product rivalled the hand-product of a lower 
type. When a day’s work suffices for obtaining efficient 
tools or fabrics from the trader, while the manufacture of 
the corresponding implement or material by the native . 
himself would have required weeks, it is but natural that 
the slower and more laborious process should be given | 
up speedily. It must also be considered that in several | 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
RACIAL PREJUDICES 13 
regions, particularly in America and in parts of Siberia, 
the primitive tribes are swamped by the numbers of the 
immigrating race, which is crowding them so rapidly out 
of their old haunts that no time for gradual assimilation 
is given. In olden times there was certainly no such im- 
mense inequality in numbers as we observe in many 
regions nowadays. 
We conclude, therefore, that the conditions for assimila- 
tion in ancient Europe were much more favorable than in 
those countries where in our times primitive people come 
into contact with civilization. Therefore we do not 
need to assume that the ancient Europeans were more 
gifted than other races which have not. become exposed 
to the influences of civilization until recent times (Ger- 
land, Ratzel). 
: This conclusion may be corroborated by other facts. 
In the middle ages the civilization of the Arabs had 
reached a stage which was undoubtedly superior to that 
of many European nations of that period. Both civiliza- 
tions had sprung largely from the same sources, and must 
be considered branches of one tree. The Arabs who were 
the carriers of civilization were by no means members of 
the same race as the Europeans, but nobody will dispute 
their high merits. It is of interest to see in what manner
-P-A-G-E-23

          they influenced the negro races of the Soudan. At af 
early time, principally between the second half of the} 
eighth century and the eleventh century of our era, the} 
Soudan was invaded by Hamitic tribes, and Mohamme- 
danism was spreading rapidly through the Sahara and the : 
western Soudan. We see that since that time large em-'§ 
pires have been formed, and have disappeared again in| 
struggles with neighboring states, and that a relatively j 
high degree of culture has been attained. The invaders, 
intermarried with the natives; and the mixed races, 4 
some of which are almost purely negro, have risen high | 
above the level of other African negroes. The history of 4 
Bornu is perhaps one of the best examples of this kind. § 
Barth and Nachtigal have made us acquainted with the'} 
history of this state, which has played a most important 
part in the history of North Africa. 
Why, then, have the Mohammedans been able to civilize} 
these tribes, and to raise them to nearly the same standard | 
which they had attained, while the whites have not been! 
capable of influencing the negro in Africa to any considet-§ 
able extent? Evidently on account of the different 
method of introduction of culture. While the Moham- 
medans influence the people in the same manner in which4 
the ancients civilized the tribes of Europe, the whites
-P-A-G-E-24
RACIAL PREJUDICES 15 
send only the products of their manufactures and a few 
of their representatives into the negro country. A real 
amalgamation between the more highly educated whites 
and the negroes has never taken place. The amalgama- 
tion of the negroes by the Mohammedans is facilitated 
particularly by the institution of polygamy, the conquer- 
ors taking native wives, and raising their children as 
members of their own family. 
The spread of the Chinese civilization in eastern Asia 
may be likened to that of the ancient civilization in 
Europe. Colonization and amalgamation of kindred 
tribes, and in some cases extermination of rebellious sub- ° 
jects, with subsequent colonization, have led to a remark- 
able uniformity of culture over a large area. 
When, finally, we consider the inferior position held by 
the negro race of the United States, although the negro 
lives in the closest contact with modern civilization, we 
must not forget that the old race feeling of the inferiority 
of the colored race is as potent as ever, and is a formidable 
obstacle to its advance and progress, notwithstanding 
that schools and universities are open to them. We 
might rather wonder how much has been accomplished 
in a short period against heavy odds. It is hardly 
possible to say what would become of the negro if he

   were able to live with the whites on absolutely equal, 
terms. Miss Ovington’s discussion of the opportunities 
of the negro in the United States is a convincing proof of 
the inequality of the conditions of economic advance 
of the negro and of the white, even after the abolition 
of legal inequality. 
Our conclusion drawn from the foregoing considerations 
is the following: Several races have developed a civiliza-| 
tion of a type similar to the one from which our own had j 
its origin. A number of favorable conditions facilitated 4 
the rapid spread of this civilization in Europe. Among 
these, common physical appearance, contiguity of habi- 
tat, and moderate difference in modes of manufacture, 
were the most potent. When, later on, civilization begat. 
to spread over other continents, the races with which 
modern civilization came into contact were not equally: 
favorably situated. Striking differences of racial types, 
the preceding isolation which caused devastating epi 
demics in the newly discovered countries, and the greatet, 
advance in civilization, made assimilation much morg| 
difficult. The rapid dissemination of Europeans over the! 
whole world destroyed all promising beginnings which 
had arisen in various regions. Thus no race except that} 
of eastern Asia was given a chance to develop an inded
-P-A-G-E-26
RACIAL PREJUDICES 1 
pendent civilization. The spread of the European race 
cut short the growth of the existing independent germs 
without regard to the mental aptitude of the people 
among whom it was developing. On the other hand, we 
have seen that no great weight can be attributed to the 
earlier rise of civilization in the Old World, which is 
satisfactorily explained as a chance. In short, histori- 
cal events appear to have been much more potent in 
leading races to civilization than their faculty, and it 
follows that achievements of races do not warrant us in 
assuming that one race is more highly gifted than the 
other. , 
After having thus found an answer to our first problem, 
We turn to the second one: In how far aré we justified 
in considering those anatomical traits in regard to which 
foreign races differ from the white-race as marks of in- 
feriority? In one respect the answer to this question is 
easier than ihat to the former. We have recognized 
that achievement alone does not justify us in assuming 
greater mental ability for the white race than for others, 
unless we can sustain our claim by other proofs. It 
follows from this, that differences between the white race 
and other races must not be interpreted to mean supe- 
tiority of the former, inferiority of the latter, unless this 
. c
-P-A-G-E-27
8 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
relation can be proved by anatomical or physiological 
considerations. 
It may not be amiss to illustrate by an example the 
logical error which is committed with great ease and 
great frequency. In a painstaking investigation made a 
few years ago, Mr. R. B. Bean demonstrated certain 
characteristic differences between the form of the whole 
and of the parts of the brain of the Baltimore negro and 
of the Baltimore white, —- differences which consist in the 
form and relative size of the frontal and occipital lobes 
and in the size of the corpus callosum. The interpretation 
of the difference is, that the smaller size of the anterior 
lobes and of the callosum indicates a lower mental! develop- 
ment, a conclusion which has been refuted by Franklin P. 
Mali. It may suffice here, where we are interested chiefly 
in the logical fallacy of such conclusions, to call attention 
to the fact that a comparison of long-headed and short- 
headed individuals of the same race — or, let us say, of 
long-headed North French and of short-headed Central 
French -- would result in similar differences, but that in 
a case of this kind the inference regarding greater or 
lesser ability would not be made with the same readiness. 
There is, of course, no doubt that great differences exist 
in the physical characteristics of the races of man. The _
-P-A-G-E-28
RACIAL PREJUDICES 19 
color of the skin, the form of the hair, and the configura- 
tion of lips and nose, distinguish the African clearly from 
the European. The question to decide is, What relations 
have these features to the mental aptitude of a race? 
Two points of view may be brought forward in relation 
to this question. First, we may claim that a race in 
. which peculiarities are found that are characteristic of 
lower stages in the animal series will be in all respects of 
an inferior type. Secondly, we may direct our attention 
primarily to the central nervous sytem, and investigate 
whether the anatomical structure in one race is superior 
to that found in another race. 
To illustrate the former viewpoint, I will mention a few 
of the formations in man which have been described as 
characterizing lower races, because they are found as 
typical developments in animals. One of these is a varia- 
tion in the form of the temporal bone, which in man is 
ordinarily separated from the frontal bone by the sphe- 
noid and parietal bones. It has been found that in some 
individuals the temporal bone encroaches upon the 
sphenoid and parietal, and comes into contact with the 
frontal bone. This formation is the prevalent one 
among the apes. It has been proved that this variation 
is found among all races, but with unequal frequency.
-P-A-G-E-29
20 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
The peculiar formation of the tibia known as platycne- 
mism (lateral flatness) has been observed in skeletons of 
the oldest remains of man in Europe, and also in the skele- 
tons of various races. Other characteristics which re 
mind us of lower forms are peculiarities in the formation 
of the articular surfaces of tibia and femur, which have 
been found in a number of human types; the os Ince, 
or interparietal bone, which occurs among all races, but 
most frequently among the Peruvians and the inhabi- 
tants of the ancient pueblos; the smallness of the nasal 
bones and their synostosis with the maxilla; the so-called 
pre-nasal fossze ; and certain variations in the arrangement _ 
of arteries and of muscles. All these variable features are 
found among all races, but the degree of variability is not 
everywhere the same. Presumably such variations may 
be considered human characteristics which have not yet 
had time to become stable, and which in this sense may be 
considered as still in process of evolution. If this inter- 
pretation be correct, it might seem that we can consider 
those races in which the characteristic human features 
are more stable as those which are more highly organized. 
It is. also possible to arrange the races according to 
various typical features in such a manner that one ap- 
pears farthest removed from the types of higher animals,
-P-A-G-E-30
RACIAL PREJUDICES ar 
others less so. In all these arrangements the gap be- 
tween man and animal is a wide one, and the variations 
between the races are slight as compared to it. Thus we 
find, that, in comparison to the skull, the face of the negro 
is larger than that of the American, whose face is, in 
turn, larger than that of the white. The lower portion 
of his face has larger dimensions. The alveolar arch is 
pushed forward, and thus gains an appearance which re- 
minds us of the higher apes. There is no denying that 
this feature is a most constant character of the black 
races, and that it represents a type slightly nearer the 
animal than the European type. The same may be said 
of the broadness and flatness of the noses of the negro 
and the Mongol. 
If we accept the general theories of Klaatsch, Stratz, 
and Schoetensack, who consider the Australian as the 
oldest and most generalized type of man, we might also 
call attention to the slenderness of the vertebre, the un- 
developed curvature of the vertebral column, to which 
Cunningham first called attention, and the traits of the 
foot, which recall the needs of an animal living in trees, 
and whose feet had to serve the purpose of climbing from 
branch to branch. 
Tn relation to the interpretation of all these observa-
-P-A-G-E-31
22 ' THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
tions, it must be strongly emphasized that the races 
which we are accustomed to call “higher races” do not 
by any means stand in all respects at the end of the series, 
and are farthest removed from the animal. The Euro- 
pean and the Mongol have the largest brains; the Euro- 
pean has a small face and a high nose; — all features 
farther removed from the probable animal ancestor of 
man than the corresponding features of other races. On 
the other hand, the European shares lower character- 
istics with the Australian, both retaining in the strongest 
degree the hairiness of the animal ancestor, while the 
specifically human development of the red lip is developed 
most markedly in the negro. The proportions of the 
limbs of the negro are also more markedly distinct from 
the corresponding proportions in the higher apes than are 
those of the European. 
When we interpret these data in the light of modem 
biological concepts, we may say that the specifically 
human features appear with varying intensity in various 
races, and that the divergence from the animal ancestor 
has developed in varying directions. 
When all these differences between races are given, the 
question arises, whether they have any significance in 
regard to mental faculty. I may be permitted to dis- y
-P-A-G-E-32
RACIAL PREJUDICES 23 
regard for the moment differences in the size and structu- 
ral development of the nervous system, and confine my- 
self to the mental significance of other traits. The 
general analogy of mental development of animals and of 
man prompts us to associate lower mental traits with 
theromorphic features. In our naive, every-day parlance, 
brutish features and brutality are closely connected. We 
must distinguish here, however, between the anatomical 
characteristics of which we have been speaking and the 
muscular development of the face, trunk, and limbs, due 
to habitual activity. The hand, which is never employed 
in activities requiring those refined adjustments which 
are characteristic of psychologically complex actions, will 
lack the modelling brought about by the development of 
each muscle. The face whose muscles have not re- 
sponded to the innervations accompanying deep thought 
and refined sentiment will lack in individuality and re- 
finement. The neck that has supported heavy loads, 
and has not responded to the varied requirements of 
delicate changes of position of head and body, will ap- 
pear massiveandclumsy. Thesephysiognomic differences 
must not mislead us in our interpretations. But even 
without them, we are inclined to draw inferences in re- 
gard to mentality from a receding forehead, a heavy jaw,
-P-A-G-E-33
24 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
large and heavy teeth, perhaps even from an inordinate 
length of arms or an unusual development of hairiness. 
From a strictly scientific point of view, these inferences 
seem to be open to the most serious doubt. Only a few 
investigations have been made in relation to these prob- 
lems, but their results have been entirely negative. Most 
important among them is the elaborate attempt made by 
Karl Pearson to investigate the relationship of intelli- 
gence to size and shape of the head. His conclusions are 
so significant that I will repeat them here: ‘The onus 
of proof that other measurements and more subtle psy- 
chological observations would lead to more definite results 
may now, I think, be left to those who a priori regard such 
an association as probable. Personally, the result of the 
present inquiry has convinced me that there is little re- 
lationship between the external physical and the psy- 
chical character in man.” TI think all the investigations 
that have been made up to the present time compel us to 
assume that the characteristics of the osseous, muscular, 
visceral, or circulatory system, have practically no direct 
relation to the mental ability of man (Manouvrier). 
We will now turn to the important subject of the size 
of the brain, which seems to be the one anatomical fea- 
ture which bears directly upon the question at issue. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
RACIAL PREJUDICES 25 
seems plausible that the greater the central nervous sys- 
tem, the higher the faculty of the race, and the greater its 
aptitude to mental achievements. Let us review the 
known facts. Two methods are open for ascertaining 
the size of the central nervous system, — the determina- 
tion of the weight of the brain and that of the capacity _ 
of the cranial cavity. The first of these methods is the 
one which promises the most accurate results. Natu- 
rally, the number of Europeans whose brain-weights have 
been taken is much larger than that of individuals of 
other races. There are, however, sufficient data available 
to establish beyond a doubt the fact that the brain-weight 
of the whites is larger than that of most other races, par- 
ticularly larger than that of the negroes. That of the 
white male is about 1360 grams. The investigations of 
cranial capacities are quite in accord with these results. 
According to Topinard, the capacity of the skull of males 
of the neolithic period in Europe is about 1560 cc. (44 
cases) ; that of modern Europeans is the same (347 cases) ; 
of the Mongoloid race, r510 cc. (68 cases); of African 
negroes, 1405 cc. ($3 cases) ; and of negroes of the Pacific 
Ocean, 1460 cc. (46 cases). Here we have, therefore, a 
decided difference in favor of the white race. 
In interpreting these facts, we must ask, Does the in- 
  MMDOLE TERNESSEE Gi COLLEGE 
MURFREESBORO, TERNESSEE
-P-A-G-E-35
26 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
crease in the size of the brain prove an increase in faculty? 
This would seem highly probable, and facts may be ad- 
duced which speak in favor of this assumption. First 
among these is the relatively large size of the brain among 
the higher animals, and the still larger size in man. 
Furthermore, Manouvrier has measured the capacity of 
the skulls of thirty-five eminent men. He found that 
they averaged 1665 cc. as compared to 1560 cc. general 
average, which was derived from r1o individuals. On the 
other hand, he found that the cranial capacity of forty-five 
murderers was 1580 cc., also superior to the general 
average. The same result has been obtained through 
weighings of brains of eminent men. The brains of 
thirty-four of these showed an average increase of 93 
grams over the average brain-weight of 1357 grams. An- 
other fact which may be adduced in favor of the theory 
that greater brains are accompanied by higher faculty is 
that the heads of the best English students are larger 
than those of the average class of students (Galton). 
The force of the arguments furnished by these observa 
tions must, however, not be overestimated. 
First of all, the brains of not all eminent men are un- 
usually large. On the contrary, a few unusually small 
brains have been found in the series. Furthermore, ' 
\
-P-A-G-E-36
RACIAL PREJUDICES 27 
most of the brain-weights constituting the general series 
are obtained in anatomical institutes; and the individ- 
uals who find their way there are poorly developed, on ac- 
count of malnutrition and of life under unfavorable cir- 
cumstances, while the eminent men represent a much 
better nourished class. As poor nourishment reduces 
the weight and size of the whole body, it will also reduce 
the size and weight of the brain. It is not certain, there- 
fore, that the observed difference is entirely due. to the 
higher ability of the eminent men. This may also ex- 
- plain the larger size of the brains of the professional classes 
as compared to those of unskilled laborers (Ferraira). An 
additional number of restricting facts must be enumer- 
ated. The most important among these is the difference 
in brain-weight between men and women. When men 
and women of the same stature are compared, it is found 
that the brain of woman is much lighter than that of man. 
Nevertheless the faculty of woman while perhaps quali- 
tatively different from that of man, cannot be deemed to 
be of an inferior character. This is therefore a case in 
which smaller brain-weight is accompanied throughout by 
equal faculty. We conclude from this fact that it is not 
impossible that the smaller brains of males of other 
races should do the same work as is done by the larger
-P-A-G-E-37
  28 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
brain of the white race. But this comparison is not quite 
on equal terms, as we may assume that there is a certain 
structural difference between male and female, which 
causes the difference in size between the sexes; so that 
comparison between male and female is not the same as - 
comparison between male and male. 
Notwithstanding these restrictions, the increase of the 
size of the brain in the higher animals, and the lack of de- 
velopment in microcephalic individuals, are fundamental 
facts which make it more than probable that increased 
size of the brain causes increased faculty, although the 
relation is not quite as immediate as is often assumed. 
The reason for a lack of close correlation between brain- 
weight and mental faculties is not far to seek. The func- 
tioning of the brain depends upon the nerve cells and 
fibres, which do not constitute, by. any means, the whole 
mass of the brain. A brain with many cells and complex 
connections between the cells may contain less connec- 
tive tissue than another one of simpler nervous structure. 
In other words, if there is a close relation between form 
and ability, it must be looked for rather in the mor- 
phological traits of the brain than in its size. A correla 
tion exists between size of brain and number of cells 
and fibres, but the correlation is weak (Donaldson).
-P-A-G-E-38
RACIAL PREJUDICES . a9 
Notwithstanding the numerous attempts that have 
been made to find structural differences between the 
brains of different races of man that could be directly in- 
terpreted in psychological terms, no conclusive results of 
any kind have been attained. The status of our present 
knowledge has been well summed up by Franklin P. Mall, 
to whose investigation I referred before. He holds, that, © 
on account of the great variability of the individuals con- 
stituting each race, racial differences are exceedingly diffi- 
cult to discover, and that up to the present time none 
have been found that will endure serious criticism. 
We may now sum up the results of our preliminary 
inquiry. We have found that the unproved assumption 
of identity of cultural achievement and of mental ability 
is founded on an error of judgment; that the variations 
in cultural development can as well be-explained by a 
consideration of the general course of historical events 
without recourse to the theory of material differences of 
mental faculty in different races. We have found, 
furthermore, that a similar error underlies the common . 
, assumption that the white race represents physically 
the highest type of man, but that anatomical and 
physiological considerations do not support these views.
-P-A-G-E-39
Il. INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON 
HUMAN TYPES 
AFTER having seen that the high estimate of our civili- 
zation does not necessarily imply that the carriers of this 
civilization have an anatomical organization superior to 
that of all other races, we may turn our attention toa 
closer investigation of the characteristics of different 
divisions of mankind. It is clear that our investigations 
cannot be based on vague descriptions of travellers, — 
who remark upon the enormous digestive organs of primi- 
tive man, or on his small size, or on the lack of develop- 
ment of his limbs, or even upon his resemblance to apes,— 
but on serious studies of anatomical characteristics. 
Two problems may be distinguished here which have 
too often been confounded in discussions of the mental 
characteristics of civilized man and of primitive man. 
The one relates to the distinctions between races; thé 
other, to distinctions between the social strata of the same 
race. According to the meaning of the terms “civilized” 
and “primitive,” it is perfectly conceivable that there 
30  
-P-A-G-E-40
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 3r 
may be civilized groups belonging to different races (like 
the Chinese and Europeans), and civilized aswell as primi-- 
tive groups, both belonging to the same race (like the 
Yukaghir of Siberia and the Chinese, or like the group of 
educated negroes in the United States and the primitive 
tribes of the coasts of Africa). The problems presented 
by the differences between the various races of man, and 
by the differences between social groups in the same races, 
are, of course, entirely distinct, and each requires sepa- 
rate treatment. 
There is one peculiarity common to both problems, 
which must be described before we can properly take up 
their treatment. When we compare the individuals 
comprising any one racial or social type, we find that they 
are not by any means uniform, but exhibit considerable 
variation. When we try to think of a Norwegian and of 
a negro, two entirely distinct types will be present to 
our minds, — the Norwegian, tall, with blond and some- 
what wavy hair, blue eyes, light complexion, delicate face 
and nose; the negro, of medium stature, with black and 
frizzly hair, dark eyes, dark skin, projecting jaw, and 
heavy flat nose. Still, these pictures are only abstractions 
of what we think we have noticed most commonly in each 
type. When we compare the Norwegians among them-
-P-A-G-E-41
  32 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
selves, or the negroes among themselves, we find that 
each individual in each series has his peculiarities, which 
the others do not share. There are tall and short Nor- 
wegians; their hair is blond or dark, straight or wavy; 
their eyes vary from brown to blue; their complexion is 
light or dark, their faces more or less delicate. And so 
with the negroes. The degree of blackness, the amount of 
projection of the chin, the flatness of the nose, — all show 
very considerable variations. Experience has demon- 
strated that in all cases of this kind, one certain type, one 
certain combination of features, is most common; and 
that deviations in either direction from this type become 
the rarer, the greater their amount. Thus the Norwe- 
gians showa prevalence of a certain blondcolor. Individ- 
uals with a color of hair much lighter than the most com- 
mon color are the rarer, the greater the difference of theif 
hair-color from the most common one; and in the same 
way individuals with a color of hair much darker than the 
most common color are the rarer, the greater the devia- 
tion of their color of hair from the common one. The 
extent to which such variations occur is not always the 
same. In some cases the individuals constituting the 
group show a remarkable similarity or uniformity of 
type; in other cases the diversity of types occurring in
-P-A-G-E-42
‘INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 33 
the same community is quite remarkable. We call a 
series the more variable, the more frequently deviating 
types occur in it; so that the average amount of differ- 
ences between the individuals constituting the series 
and the most common type may be used ‘as a measure of 
the variability of the series. 
These considerations are of prime importance in all 
attempts to compare different races. In some cases 
differences are found which are’ sufficiently fundamental 
to distinguish easily and definitely one from another. 
Thus the color of the skin, color and form of the hair, and 
configuration of lips and nose, distinguish the African 
negro definitely from the North European. When, how- 
ever, we compare all the races and types of man, we find 
that innumerable transitions exist, which would make it 
difficult to state that any one particular feature belongs 
to all the individuals of one type, to the exclusion of all 
others. Thus it would not be difficult to find among 
members of the American race, for instance, lips and nose 
which approach in form those of the negro. The same 
may be said of color. This indefiniteness of distinctions 
between different types is due to the variability of the 
types, which has been described before, and to the com- 
paratively small differences between the types. 
D
-P-A-G-E-43
34 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
To give an instance. Negroes have thick lips. Never: 
theless the thickness is not the same among all of them. 
In some cases it is quite small, in others very large. Eu- 
ropeans have thin lips, but we can find individuals whose 
lips have very considerable thickness. Thus it happens 
that there are some negroes whose lips deviate from the 
normal type in being unusually thin, and whose lips are 
therefore similar to those of Europeans whose lips are 
unusually thick. The less distinct two types are, the 
greater will be the number of individuals in both groups 
that are alike. It follows also, from what has been said, 
that the greater the variability of each type, the greater 
will be the probability that some individuals of the two 
types compared will be alike. We may perhaps best ex- 
press this by saying that the varieties constituting each 
race overlap. In many cases, and in some of those that 
are most important for our inquiry, this overlapping is 
extended. Thus I have pointed out the differences in 
average brain-weight between different races. Brain- 
weights are, however, so variable, that a considerable 
overlapping occurs, and that even the average sizes of 
the brains of the white race are numerously represented 
among other races. Medium-sized brains of whites may 
be represented by the group of individuals having skull
-P-A-G-E-44
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 35 
capacities of from 1450 cc. to 1650 cc. This group em- 
braces 55 per cent of the Europeans, 58 per cent of the 
African negroes, and 58 per cent of the Melanesians. The 
same result appears when we compare the number of in- 
dividuals having great cranial capacities. We find that 
50 per cent of all whites have a capacity of the skull 
greater than 1550 cc., while 27 per cent of the negroes 
and 32 per cent of the Melanesians have capacities above 
this value. If we were to assume a direct relation be- 
tween size of brain and ability, — which, as we have seen 
before, is not admissible, — we might, at most, anticipate 
a lack of men of high genius, but should not expect any 
great lack of faculty among the great mass of negroes 
living among the whites, and enjoying the advantages of 
the leadership of the best men of that race. 
On the other hand, we find characteristics in different 
races so far apart and so little variable, that an overlap- 
ping is entirely or practically excluded. Examples of 
these are the frizzly hair of the negro as compared with 
the straight hair of the Mongol; the elevation and 
narrowness of the nose of the Armenian, and the flat- 
ness of the negro nose; the differences in pigmentation 
of the North European and of the Central African. 
Investigations on the character of variability, which
-P-A-G-E-45
eee 36 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
have been based on the measurements of the body, on 
social and economic phenomena, and also on variable 
physical phenomena, such as meteorological data, have 
resulted in the discovery that almost always the same law 
nearly covers the distribution of the numerical values of 
the observations (Lock, Bowley). 
It has been shown that the values which represent the 
phenomenon are so distributed that certain numerical 
values occur very frequently, and that the greater the 
difference between an observation and the value at which 
the greatest number of cases are found, the less will be the 
number of these observations. The character of this

distribution is shown in Fig. 1, in which the horizontal 
line represents the numerical values of the observations,

both series, and who are shown in the surface enclosed 
between both curves, are found in both series ; and only 
the others, who are outside of this surface, and who belong 
to one of the groups, are not found in the other one. 
Bearing in mind these facts relating to types and varia- 
bility, we are in a position to turn to a consideration of the 
characteristics of primitive man and of civilized man, and 
of members of distinct races. 
We will first direct our attention to the differences be- 
tween civilized man and primitive man, both being mem- 
bers of the same race. For the white race this difference 
can no longer be observed, because there are no primitive 
white men in the strict sense of the term. Nevertheless 
we may discover certain analogues. Some of the peasants 
in the remote mountain districts of southeastern Europe 
do not live in a manner so very different from the way of 
living of what we ordinarily call primitive people; for 
the mode of life of the agricultural Indians of North 
America at the time of Columbus, or that of some agri- 
cultural negro tribes, is, so far as nutrition and occupation 
are concerned, quite similar to theirs. Also some of the 
fishermen on the coast of Europe may well be compared, 
in their mode of life, with the fishermen of America or 
Asia. More direct comparisons may be made among the
-P-A-G-E-49
40 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
people of eastern Asia, where we may contrast the cul- 
tured Chinese and the primitive Amur River tribes, the 
northern Japanese and the Ainu, the civilized Malay and 
the mountain tribes of Sumatra or the Philippines. , Simi- 
lar comparisons are possible for the negro race when we 
contrast the small educated class of negroes in America 
and the African tribesmen; and for the American race 
when we compare the educated Indians, particularly of 
Spanish America, and the tribes of the prairies and of the 
virgin forests. 
It is obvious that in all these cases we are comparing 
groups of the same descent, but living in distinct economic, 
social, and other environmental conditions. If we find dif- 
ferences among them, they can only be due, directly or in- 
directly, to environment. Thus the fundamental problem 
presents itself, In how far are human types stable, in 
how far variable under the influences of environment? 
It is difficult to take up this inquiry on the basis of a 
direct comparison between primitive and civilized types 
belonging to the same races, partly because material is 
hard to obtain, partly because the homogeneity of the 
race is often open to doubt; but it is at once apparent 
that every inquiry into the variability of human types 
living under the effect of different types of environment
-P-A-G-E-50
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 41 
will help us to gain an insight into the question at issue, 
so that we are led to a more general discussion of the 
problem of the stability or variability of the form of the 
human body. , 
The principles of biological science forbid us to assume 
a permanent stability of bodily form. Our whole mod- 
ern concept of the development of varieties and of species 
is based on the assumption of cumulative or sudden 
variation. The variations that have been found in the 
human body are quite in accordance with this view, and 
I may quote here a few words from. Wiedersheim’s ad- 
mirable treatise on the structure of man as an index of his 
past history: “In the course of Phylogeny the body of 
Man has undergone a series of modifications which still in 
part find expression in his ontogeny. There are indica- 
tions that changes in his organization are still continuing, 
and that the Man of the future will be different from the 
Man of to-day.” The best illustrations of those changes 
are found in the forms of organs which are undergoing 
teduction. Thus we may observe that in modern man 
the little toe is often two-jointed, a phenomenon pre- 
sumably due to lack of functional use. This condition 
has been observed in races going barefooted as well as in 
those wearing shoes, so that it cannot be ascribed to arti-
-P-A-G-E-51
  42 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
ficial causes. The teeth also show a tendency to gradual 
reduction, especially in the variable size of the molars 
and of the upper outer incisors. The third molar, or 
wisdom tooth, is often retained, and is in most races con- 
siderably reduced in size. Retention or slight develop- 
ment of the upper outer incisor is also of frequent occur- 
rence. A similar reduction may be observed at the 
lower end of the thorax, where the development of ribs 
and sternum shows great variations. 
The significance of these phenomena lies in the fact that 
in the evolutionary series the abnormal occurrences, 
which are found in different races in varying frequency, 
appear as new developments, which, if they should be- 
come normal, would increase the differentiation between 
man and the lower forms. The actual proof of increasing 
frequency of these features, and of their becoming pet- 
manent characteristics, has not been given, but seems 
more than plausible. 
This inference is strongly supported by the occurrence 
of rudimentary, functionless organs, and by the tempo- ~ 
rary appearance of lower features during ontogenetic 
development. 
It has been shown that some of these reductions — like 
the retention of outer-incisors— are hereditary,. and
-P-A-G-E-52
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 43 
thus liable to perpetuate themselves. To a certain ex- 
tent this explains the observation that certain varia- 
tions occur with greater frequency among primitive 
tribes than in civilized man. Most primitive tribes are 
very small in numbers, or for long periods, during which 
they increased in numbers, have had little intercourse 
with foreign people. If in such a group any of the origi- 
nal families showed a certain peculiarity, it must now 
be found more frequently than in any other tribes. A 
case of this kind is the frequency of supernumerary 
vertebre among the Indians of Vancouver Island, and 
probably also the frequency of the torus palatinus among 
the Lapps. It may be left an open question, whether the 
frequent occurrence of the os Ince among the Pueblo 
Indians and Peruvians may be explained by the same con- 
sideration. Therefore it may be that the greater varia- 
bility of certain races, in regard to these phenomena, is not 
an expression of a lower or higher degree of development 
of the whole group, as the case may be, but of the presence 
of a great number of members of a family which possessed 
the peculiar character. We do not deal in these cases 
with spontaneous variations, but with their hereditary 
re-appearance. In other words, if we are to admit the 
conclusion that greater variability means a lower or higher
-P-A-G-E-53
44 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN | 
stage of development, it will be necessary first to prove 
that these variations appear spontaneously in any 
member of the group, and do not belong to certain fami- 
lies in which the feature is hereditary. Otherwise it will¢ 
be necessary to prove that in larger groups of mankind | 
the families exhibiting the particular anomaly had a. 
greater probability of surviving than others. : 
However this may be, the occurrence of these variations 
shows that man cannot be assumed.to have a stable form. 
It is of course an entirely open question, how long a time 
may be required to fix any one of the variations that we | 
are here discussing. 
The general tendency of anthropological inquiry has 
been to assume the permanence of the anatomical char- + 
acteristics of the present races, beginning with the Ew 1 
  ropean races of the early neolithic times. Kollmann, | 
the most pronounced advocate of this theory, claims that 
the oldest remains of man found in the neolithic deposits I ( 
of Europe represent types which are still found unchanged 
among the moder civilized population of the continent. 
He has tried to identify all the varieties found in the neo- 
lithic prehistoric population with those living at the pres- 
poe 
ent time. { 
All studies of the distribution of head-formsand of othet 
4
-P-A-G-E-54
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 45 
anthropometric traits have shown uniformity over con- 
siderable continuous areas and through long periods; 
and the natural inference has been that heredity controls 
anthropometric forms, and that these are therefore 
stable (Deniker). . 
There is only one exception to this rule. In all cases in 
which the anthropometric traits undergo very consider- 
able changes during the period of growth, the influence 
of favorable or unfavorable causes makes itself felt. The 
investigations conducted by Gould and Baxter during the 
war of the Rebellion have shown that the representatives 
of European, nationalities born in America have statures 
higher than the representatives of the same nationalities , 
born in Europe; and it has been assumed that better 
nutrition, or perhaps better hygienic and economic con- 
ditions in general, might increase the stature of a people. 
These conclusions were confirmed by Bowditch’s measure- 
‘ments of the school-children of Boston, and by Peck-. 
ham’s anthropometric work in Milwaukee. These 
changes in stature, due to changed conditions, have re- 
cently been demonstrated also in Europe, where Ammon 
has shown that the population of Baden has materially 
increased in size during the last thirty years. Other 
corroborative evidence has been obtained from the study
-P-A-G-E-55
46 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN & 
of various social classes, in which Bowditch found an in- 
crease of stature, beginning with the children of unskilled 
laborers, and increasing among those of skilled laborers, 
members of the mercantile class and of the professional 
class; and from the observations showing a correlation 
between the character of streets occupied by the well-to- 
do and the poor, and the stature of their inhabitants 
(Ripley). Nevertheless these changes of stature were 
not interpreted as changes in type, because they may well 
be understood to be due to the elimination of retarding 
influences, which prevent many individuals from attain- 
ing their normal growth. 
‘The results of the observations on stature are substan- 
tiated by other anthropometrical studies of various oc- 
cupations. The best-authenticated fact, because based 
on the greatest number of observations, is the difference 
in type between sailors and soldiers who were measured 
during the war of the Rebellion. It was found that 
sailors had legs as long as those of the negroes, and cor- 
respondingly.a shorter trunk, while their arms were 
equally as long as those of the soldiers of the army. We 
may also call to mind the investigations carried on in 
the gymnasiums of our colleges, which show that a series 
of measurements which depend largely upon the functions
-P-A-G-E-56
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 47 
of groups of muscles change very rapidly under the in- 
fluence of practice. It will be acknowledged at once that 
differences in the use of muscles during childhood, and 
continued in later life, must result in differences of struc- 
ture, either permanent, or at least temporary. 
A study of the conditions of growth shows how such 
changes in the form of the body must develop. Setting 
aside the prenatal development, we find that at the time 
of birth some parts of the body are so fully developed that 
they are not far removed from their final size, while others 
are quite undeveloped. Thus the skull is, comparatively 
speaking, large at the time of birth, grows rapidly for a 
short time, but very soon approaches its full size, and then 
continues to grow very slowly. The limbs, on the other 
hand, grow rapidly for many years. Other organs do 
not begin their rapid development until much later in life. 
Thus it happens that retarding or accelerating influences 
acting upon the body at different periods of growth may 
have quite different results. After the head has nearly 
completed its growth, retarding influences may still in- 
fluence the length of the limbs. The face, which grows 
rapidly for a longer period than the cranium, can be in- 
fluenced later than the latter. In short, the influence of 
environment may be the more marked, the less developed
-P-A-G-E-57

48 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
the organ that is subject to it. Data on the unequal 
rate of growth of different parts of the body have been 
furnished by Weissenberg. / 
The influence of retardation, so far as it has been 
studied, seems to be lasting. In other words, a retarda- 
tion in development is never completely made good by 
long-continued development. When a child, through un- 
favorable influences, has grown slowly during a number. 
of years, it will probably continue to grow longer than 
other, normal children ; but the total amount of its growth 
will always remain too small (Boas and Wissler). On 
the other hand, children whose development has been ac- 
celerated will reach the adult stage early, but nevertheless 
the total amount of their growth will be relatively great. 
It follows from this consideration of the effect of retarda- 
tion and of difference in period, that not only the absolute 
size, but also the relative proportions, of the body, must 
be influenced by periods of retardation or acceleration. 
The while trend of the studies of growth thus emph?- 
sizes the importance of the effect of rate of development 
upon the final form of the body. Illness in early child- 
hood, malnutrition, lack of fresh air and physical exer- 
cise, are so many retarding causes, which bring it about 
that the growing individual of a certain age is in its 
nn pe
-P-A-G-E-58
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 49 
physiological development younger than the healthy, 
well-nourished individual, who has plenty of fresh air, 
and who puts his muscular system to good use. Re- 
tardation or acceleration has, however, the effect of 
modifying the later course of development ; so that the. 
final stage will be the more favorable, the less the retard- 
ing causes. 
It seems more than likely, judging from the course of 
development of a few simple mental activities that have 
been made the subject of study, that mental develop- 
ment follows laws quite analogous to those of physical 
development (Meumann). 
These facts relating to growth are of fundamental im- 
portance for a correct interpretation of the oft-discussed 
phenomena of early arrest of growth. We have seen that 
among members of the same race a prolonged period of 
growth goes hand in hand with unfavorable development, 
while an abbreviated period of growth results in larger 
dimensions of all physical measurements, and in a su- 
periority of mental activity. In this statement patho- 
logical cases of complete premature arrest of development, 
or of over-development, are of course excluded, — cases of 
dwarfish growth or of microcephaly, as well as cases of 
hypertrophic growth of organs. It follows, that, in judg- 
x 
.
-P-A-G-E-59
50 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
ing the physiological value of arrest of growth, the mere 
fact that growth ceases in one race at an earlier time than 
in another cannot be considered as significant in itself 
without observations on the rapidity of growth. 
So far, the question still remains open, in how far there 
may be changes in the types of man that cannot be ex- 
plained by acceleration or retardation of growth. 
An attempt has been made by Rieger to explain differ- 
ences in head-form as due to the effect of physiological 
and mechanical conditions, and Engel emphasizes the effect 
of pressure of the muscles upon the forms of the head. 
Walcher tries to explain different head-forms by the con- 
sideration of the position of the infant in the cradle. He 
believes that position on the back produces round heads; 
position on the side, long heads. It would seem, howevet, 
that the difference of head-form in large areas of Europe, 
in which infants are treated in the same manner, are too 
great to make this explanation acceptable. 
A number of observations have been made, however, 
which demonstrate ‘conclusively a difference betwee 
urban and rural types. These observations were first 
made by Ammon, who showed that the urban population 
in Baden differs from the rural population in head-form, 
stature, and pigmentation. He accepts the conclusion that
-P-A-G-E-60
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 51 
we have here an actual change in type; due, however, not 
to a direct effect of environment, but rather to an elimina- 
tion of certain types in city life: in other words, an effect 
of natural selection. This observation is in accord with 
observations made by Livi in the cities of Italy, which 
show also a difference when compared to the surrounding 
country. Comparisons of the normal and hospital popu- 
lations of London, made by Shrubsall, are not unfavorable 
‘to the assumption of a certain amount of correlation be- 
tween morbidity and physical type, although the homo- 
geneity of material from a metropolis like London, drawn . 
_ from different social strata of a large city, remains always 
open to doubt. 
Another explanation, given by Livi, seems to account 
adequately for the difference between city and country 
population, without necessitating the assumption of any 
considerable effect of natural selection, which presupposes 
an improbable correlation between mortality and fertility 
on the one hand, and traits like head-form and pigmenta- 
tion on the other. The change of type in cities, so far as 
it kas been observed, is of ‘such character, that the city 
always shows greater resemblance to the average type of 
the whole large district inwhich it is located. If the local 
rural population is markedly short-headed, the general type
-P-A-G-E-61
. 52 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
over a larger area from which the city population is drawn 
more long-headed, then the city population will be more 
long-headed, and vice versd. Unless selection can be 
demonstrated to occur in a sufficient number of definite 
families, this explanation seems simpler and adequate. 
Up to quite recent times no evidence of actual changes 
of type was available, except the observations by Ammon 
and those by Livi on the physical characteristics of rural 
and urban populations, to which I have just referred, and 
some others on the influence of altitude upon physical 
form. In the discussions of the distribution of different 
types of man in Europe, peculiarities of body-form ia 
‘certain areas — as in the mountains of central France, in 
parts of Tuscany, in the province of Zealand in Holland, 
in southwestern Norway — have been explained as due 
to the survival of old racial types, to the influence of natu- 
tal selection, or to the direct influence of environment, 
according as the necessities of the case prompted the in- 
vestigator to adduce the one cause or the other, or a com 
bination of any two or of all, as a convenient exp!»nation 
of the difficult phenomenon (Ripley). It goes without 
saying that haphazard application of unproved though 
possible theories cannot serve as proof of the effectiveness 
of selection or of environment in modifying types, The
-P-A-G-E-62
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 53 
effectiveness of selection can be proved only by an investi- 
gation of the surviving members of a type as compared 
to those eliminated by death, or of a shifting of popula- 
tion connected with the selection of a certain type. 
influence of environment requires the direct compazigon 
of parents living under one environment with children 
living under another environment. 
I cannot give any example in which the influence of 
selection has been proved beyond cavil. It seems plau- 
sible that in the criminal colonies of earlier periods, and in 
the settling of the West by the most vigorous members 
of our Eastern population, and in the complementary 
weeding-out of strong elements in some parts of New 
England, this principle may have been active; but we 
have no actual data which would connect with physical 
types the selection that has undoubtedly taken place. 
On the other hand, it has been my good fortune to be 
able to demonstrate the existence of a direct influence of 
environment upon the bodily form of man by a compari- 
son of immigrants born in Europe and their descendants 
born in New York City (Boas). I have investigated four 
groups of people, — the South Italians, representing the 
Mediterranean type of Europe, which is characterized 
by short stature, elongated head, dark complexion and
-P-A-G-E-63
ON Te 54 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
hair; the Central European type, which is characterized 
by medium stature, short head, light hair and lighter 
complexion; the Northwest European type, which is 
characterized by tall stature, elongated head, light com- 
plexion, and blond hair. Furthermore, I have investi- 
gated an extended series of East European Hebrews, who 
resemble in some respects the Central European group. 
The traits which I selected for examination are head- 
measurements, stature, weight, and hair-color. Among 
these, only stature and weight are closely related to the 
rate of growth, while head-measurements and hair-color 
are only slightly subjected to these influences. Differ- 
ences in hair-color and head-development do not belong 
to the group of measurements of which I spoke before, 
which depend in their final values upon the physiological 
conditions during the period of growth. From all we 
know, they are primarily dependent upon heredity. 
The results of our inquiry have led to the unexpected 
result that the American-born descendants of these types 
differ from their parents; and that these differences de- 
velop in early childhood, and persist throughout life. It 
is furthermore remarkable that each type changes in a pe 
culiar way. The head of the American-born Sicilian be- 
comes rounder than that of the foreign-born. ES 
t+
-P-A-G-E-64
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 55 
due to a loss in length and an increase in width. The face 
becomes narrower, the stature and weight decrease. The 
"head of the American-born Central European loses both 
in length and width, more so in width, and thus becomes 
more elongated. The face decreases very much in 
width; stature and weight increase. The modifications 
of the American-born descendants of the Scotch type are 
not marked, except that stature and weight increase. 
The American-born Hebrew has a longer and narrower 
head than the European-born ; the head is therefore con- 
siderably more elongated. His face is narrower ; stature 
and weight are increased. In none of the types have 
marked differences in color of hair between American- 
born and foreign-born been found, 
In order to understand the causes which bring about 
these alterations of type, it is necessary to know how long 
a time must have elapsed since the immigration of the 
parents before a noticeable change of type of the offspring 
is brought about. This investigation has been carried out 
mainly for the cephalic index, which, during the period 
of growth of the individual, undergoes only slight modi- 
fications. The investigation of the Hebrews shows very 
clearly that the cephalic index of the foreign-born is prac- 
tically the same, no matter how old the individual at the
-P-A-G-E-65
56 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
time of immigration. This might be expected when the 
immigrants are adult or nearly mature ; but it is of inter- 
est to note that even children who come here when one 
year or a few years old develop the cephalic index charac- 
teristic of the foreign-born. This index ranges around 83. 
When we compare the value of this index with that of the 
index of the American-born, according to the time elapsed 
since their immigration, we find a sudden change. The 
value drops to about 82 for those born immediately after 
the immigration of their parents, and drops to 79 in the 
second generation; i.e., among the children of American- 
born children of immigrants. In other words, the effect 
of American environment makes itself felt immediately, 
and increases slowly with the increase of time elapsed be- 
tween the immigration of the parents and the birth of the 
child. 
The conditions among the Sicilians and Neapolitans 
are quite similar to those observed among the Hebrews. 
The cephalic index of the foreign-born remains through- 
out on almost the same level. Those born in America 
immediately after the arrival of their parents show an in- 
crease of the cephalic index. In this case, the transition, 
although rapid, is not quite so sudden as among the He- 
brews, probably because among those born a year before
-P-A-G-E-66
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 57 
or after immigration there is some doubt as to the place of 
their birth. These uncertainties are due to the habit of 
the Italians to migrate back and forth between Italy and 
America before finally settling here, and to the indefinite- 
ness of their answers in regard to the places of birth of the 
child, which sometimes had to be inferred from the age of 
the child and the year of immigration of the mother. As 
long as this uncertainty exists, which is hardly present at 
all in the data relating to the Hebrews, it does not seem 
necessary to assume any other cause for the more gradual 
change of the cephalic index about the time of immigra- 
tion. 
The Italian immigration is so recent, that individuals 
who were born many years after the arrival of their par- 
ents in America are very few in number, and no individ- 
uals of the second generation have been observed. For 
this reason it is hardly possible to decide whether the in- 
crease of the cephalic index continues with the length of 
time elapsed between the immigration of the parents and 
the birth of the child. 
The explanation of these remarkable phenomena is not 
easy. Whatever their causes may be, the change in form 
cannot be doubted. It might, however, be claimed that 
the changes are not due to deep physiological causes, but
-P-A-G-E-67
58 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
to the changes of certain external factors. The com- 
position of the immigrant population might be such that 
the people who came here at different periods had distinct 
physical characteristics, and that these are now reflected 
in the descendants of the older generations when com- 
pared with the more recent immigrants. It canbeshown, 
however, that the differences between the Hebrews who 
immigrated at different ‘periods between 1860 and 1909 
are so slight that they cannot account for the type of the 
descendants of immigrants. This important point can 
be elucidated more definitely by the application of a 
different method. For this purpose I have compared the 
cephalic index of all immigrants of a certain year with that 
of their descendants. It appears from these comparisons 
that the differences which are exhibited by the whole ' 
series exist also between the immigrants who arrived here 
in a certain year and their descendants. This purely 
statistical explanation of the phenomenon may therefore 
be dismissed. 
More difficult to investigate is the hypothesis that the 
mechanical treatment of infants may have a decided 
influence upon the form of the head, and that the changes 
in cradling and bedding which are made by some immi 
grants almost immediately after their arrival in America — . 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 59 
account for the changes of head-form. If this were true, 
the continued changes among the Hebrews might indicate 
merely that the American method of cradling is used the 
more frequently, the longer the family has resided in this 
country. A number of investigators have claimed that 
the position of the child on the’ back tends to produce 
_ short-headedness, and that the position on the side tends 
to produce long-headedness (Walcher). There is good 
evidence that a flattening of the occiput occurs when a 
very hard pillow is used and the child lies permanently 
on its back. This is the case, for instance, among many 
Indian tribes, and similar results might obtain if a> 
swathed child were to lie permanently on its back. The 
prevalence of rachitis in New York would favor distortion 
due to pressure. 
While I cannot disprove the existence of such influences, 
I think weighty considerations are against their accept- 
ance. If we assume that among the Hebrews the children 
born abroad have a lesser length of head than those born 
here because they are swathed and lie more permanently 
on their backs than the American-born children, who can 
move about freely, we must conclude that there is a cer- 
tain compensatory decrease in the other diameters of the 
head of the American-born. Since this compensation is
-P-A-G-E-69
60 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
distributed in all directions, its amount in any one direc. 
tion will be very small (Boas). 
The decrease in the width of head that has been ob- 
served is so large that it cannot be considered simply as an 
efféct of compensation; but we have to make the addi- 
tional hypothesis that the American-born children lie so 
much on their sides that a narrowing of the head is 
brought about by mechanical pressure. The same con- 
siderations hold good in all the other types. If, therefore, 
in one case the greater freedom of position of the child 
increases the length of its head, it is difficult to see why, 
among the Bohemians, the same causes should decreasé 
both horizontal diameters of the head, and why, among 
the Sicilians, the length should decrease, the width increase. 
The development of the width of the face seems to my , 
mind to show most clearly that it is not the mechanical - 
treatment of the infant that brings about the changes it 
question. The cephalic index suffers a very slight de 
crease from the second year to adult life. It is thete - 
fore evident that children who arrive in America very 
young cannot be much affected by American envirot- 
ment in regard to their cephalic index. On the other 
hand, if we consider a measurement that increases appre- 
cjably during the period of growth, we may expect that in  
-P-A-G-E-70
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 6x 
children born abroad but removed to America when 
young, the total growth may be modified by American en- 
vironment. The best material for this study is presented 
by the Bohemians, among whom there are relatively 
many full-grown American-born individuals. The width 
of face of Bohemians, when arranged according to their 
ages at the time of immigration, shows that there is a 
loss among those who came here as young children, — 
the greater, the younger they were. Continuing this com- 
parison with the Americans born one, two, and more 
years after the arrival of their mothers, the width of face 
is seen to decrease still further. It appears, therefore, 
that the American environment causes a retardation-ef 
the growth of the width of face at a period when me- . 
. chanical influences are no longer_possible. 
T have not carried through the analogous investigation 
for stature, because in this case the increase might simply 
be ascribed to the better nutrition of most of the north 
and central European immigrants after their immigra- 
tion into this country. 
There is another hypothesis which might account for 
the observed changes of type. If it were assumed that 
among the descendants of immigrants born in America 
there are an appreciable number who are in reality chil-
-P-A-G-E-71
62 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
dren of American fathers, not of their reputed fathers, a 
general assimilation by the American type would occur. 
Socially this condition is not at all plausible; but, on ac- 
count of the importance of the phenomenon that we are 
discussing, it should be considered. I do not think that 
any of the observations that have been made are in favor 
of this theory. The changes that occur in the Bohemians 
who arrive here as young children, the different directions 
of the changes in distinct types, particularly the shorten- 
ing of the head of Bohemians and of Italians, do not 
favor the assumption. Furthermore, if the modifications 
were due to race-mixture, the similarity between fathers 
and American-born children should be less than the 
similarity between fathers and foreign-born children, but 
there is no indication that this is the case. 
This hypothesis is also shown to be untenable by the 
comparisons of fathers and mothers with their own foreign- 
born children. These comparisons show that the differ- 
ences are the same in the case of fathers and children, and 
of mothers and children ; so that obviously the same con- 
ditions must control the relations between fathers and 
their children, and mothers and their children. In other 
words, the fathers must be considered as the true fathers 
of their children.
-P-A-G-E-72
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 63 
Earnest advocates of the theory of selection might 
claim that all these changes are due to the effects of changes 
in death-rate among foreign-born and American-born ; 
that either abroad or here individuals of certain types 
are more liable to die, and that thus these changes are 
gtadually brought about. On the whole, it seems to my 
mind, the burden of proof would lie entirely on those who 
claim such a correlation between head-index, width of 
face, etc., and death-rate, — a correlation which I think 
is highly improbable, and which could be proposed only 
to sustain the theory of selection, not on account of any 
available facts. I grant the desirability of settling the 
question by actual observations; but, until these are 
available, we may point out that the very suddenness of 
the changes after immigration, and the absence of changes 
due to selection by mortality among the adult foreign- 
born, would require such a complicated adjustment of 
cause and effect in regard to the correlation of mortality 
and bodily form, that the theory would become improb- 
able on account of its complexity. 
It would be saying too much to claim that all the dis- 
tinct European types become the same in America, with- 
out mixture, solely by the action of the new environment. 
First of all, I have investigated only the effect of one
-P-A-G-E-73
64 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
environment, and there is every reason to believe that a 
number of distinct types are developing in America; but 
we will set aside this point, and discuss only our New York 
observations. Although the long-headed Sicilian be- 
comes more round-headed in New York, the round- 
headed Bohemian and Hebrew more long-headed, the 
approach to a uniform general type cannot be established, 
because we do not know yet how long the changes con- 
tinue, and whether they would all lead to the same result. 
I confess, I do not consider such a result as likely, because 
the proof of the plasticity of types does not imply that 
the plasticity is unlimited. The history of the British 
types in America, of the Dutch in the East Indies, of the 
Spaniards in South America, favors the assumption of a 
strictly limited plasticity. Certainly our discussion should 
be based on this more conservative basis until an unex- 
pectedly wide range of variability of types can be proved. 
It is one of the most important problems that arise out of 
this investigation, to determine how far the instability 
or plasticity of types may extend. 
Whatever the extent of these bodily changes may be, 
if we grant the correctness of our inferences in regard to 
the plasticity of human types, we are necessarily led to 
grant also a great plasticity of the mental make-up of
-P-A-G-E-74
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 65 
human types. We have observed that features of the 
body which have almost obtained their final form at the 
time of birth show modifications of great importance in 
new surroundings. We have seen that others which 
increase during the whole period of growth, and are 
therefore subject to the continued effect of the new en- 
vironment, are modified even among individuals who 
arrived here during their childhood. From these facts we 
must conclude that the fundamental traits of the mind, 
which are closely correlated with the physical condition 
of the body, and whose development continues over many 
years after physical growth has ceased, are the more sub- 
ject to far-reaching changes. It is true that this is a con- 
clusion by inference; but if we have succeeded in proving 
‘changes in the form of the body, the burden of proof will 
rest on those who, notwithstanding those changes, con- 
tinue to claim the absolute permanence of other forms 
and functions of the body. 
In order to gain a correct understanding of the impor- 
tance of changes in the frame of the human body, it 
seems desirable to view the type of modern man from a 
somewhat different standpoint. 
It is quite a number of years since Fritsch, in his studies 
of the anthropology of South Africa, pointed out that a 
F
-P-A-G-E-75
66 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
peculiar difference exists in the form of the body of the 
Bushman and the Hottentot as compared to that of Euro- 
peans, in that the former exhibit slenderer forms cf the 
bones, that the bone is very solid in its structure; while in 
the European the skeleton appears heavier, but of more 
open structure. Similar differences may be observed ina 
comparison between’ the skeletons of wild animals and 
those of domesticated animals; and this observation 
has led to the conclusion that the Bushmen are in their 
physical habitus to a certain extent like wild animals, 
while the Europeans resemble in their structure domes- 
ticated animals. 
This point of view — namely, that the human race in 
its civilized forms must be compared, not with the forms 
of wild animals, but rather with those of domesticated 
animals — seems to me a very important one; and 3 
somewhat detailed study of the conditions in which vari- 
ous races are found suggests that at the present time, 
even among the most primitive types of man, changes in- 
cident to domestication have taken place almost all over 
the world. 
There are three different types of changes due to do- 
mestication which must he clearly distinguished. On the 
one hand, the bodies of domesticated animals undergo
-P-A-G-E-76
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 67 
considerable transformations, owing to the change in nu- 
trition and use of the body. , On the other hand, selection 
and crossing have played an important part in thedevelop- 
ment of races of domesticated animals. 
Some changes of the former class are due to the more 
regular and more ample nutrition; other changes are 
due to modifications of the kinds of food which the 
domesticated animal uses when compared with the 
wild animal of the same species; still others are due 
to the different manner in which the muscular and the 
nervous systems are put into use. These changes are not 
quite the same among carnivorous and among herbivo- 
rous animals. Thedog and the cat, for instance, are fairly 
regularly fed when they are found in domestication; but 
the food which is given to them is of a quite different 
character from the food which the wild dog and cat eat. 
Even among people whose diet consists almost entirely 
of meat, dogs are generally fed with boiled meat, or rather 
with the boiled, less nutritious parts of animals; while, 
among other tribes which utilize to a great extent vege- 
table food, dogs are often fed with mush and other vege- 
table material. The same is true of our cats, whose 
diet is not by any means entirely a meat diet. The 
exertions which wild carnivorous animals undergo to
-P-A-G-E-77
68 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
obtain food are incomparably greater than those of 
domesticated carnivorous animals; and it is obvious that 
for this reason the muscular system and the central ner- 
vous system may undergo considerable changes. 
The muscular exertions of herbivorous animals, so far 
as they are fed on pastures, are not so materially changed. 
The grazing habits of cattle and sheep in domestication 
are about the same as the grazing habits of wild animals 
of the same class; but the rapid movements and the 
watchfulness required for protecting the herd against 
carnivor nimals have completely disappeared. 
Stable-fe als live under highly artificial condi- 
tions, and material changes may occur in them. 
I think the changes due to these causes may be 
observed in the oldest types of domesticated animals, 
such as are found in the neolithic villages of Europe, ia 
which native European species appear in domesticated 
form (Keller). They may also be observed in the 
dogs of the various continents, which differ markedly 
from the wild species from which they are derived. 
Even the Eskimo dog, which is a descendant of the 
gray wolf and still interbreeds with the gray wolf, differs 
in bodily form from the wild animal (Beckmann). 
Modifications may also be observed in newly domesti- i
-P-A-G-E-78
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 69 
cated animals, like the Chukchee reindeer, which differs 
in type from the wild reindeer of the same area (Bogoras). 
I think it very unlikely, judging from our knowledge of 
the methods of domestication of tribes like the Eskimo 
and Chukchee, that any material amount of selection has 
contributed to the modifications of form which are found 
in these races of primitive domesticated animals. Their 
uniformity is still fairly well marked, although they have 
assumed types different from the wild species. 
A more marked differentiation of domesticated forms 
does not seem to occur until man begins t and to 
isolate, more or less consciously, particul: ds. Op- 
portunity for such isolation has been the greater, the older 
the domestication of any particular species. We find, 
therefore, that the number of distinct breeds have come 
to be greatest in those animals which have been under 
domestication for the longest periods. ‘ 
The number of varieties of domesticated species has 
also been increased by unintentional or intentional cross- 
ing of different species, from which are derived many 
breeds whose ancestry it is often so difficult to unravel. 
It appears, therefore, that there are three distinct 
causes which bring about the development of different 
types in domesticated animals: first, the influence of
-P-A-G-E-79
"70 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
change of nutrition and mode of life; secondly, conscious 
selection; and, thirdly, crossing. 
Among these causes, the first and the third have been 
most strongly active in the development of the races of 
man. The conditionof the tribes of man the world over is 
such, that there are only very few whose mode of nutrition 
is analogous to that of wild animals, and a consideration 
of the stages of human culture shows that similar con- 
ditions have prevailed for a long period. I think we may 
safely say that in all those cases in which man practises 
agriculture, when he is the owner of herds of domesti- 
cated animals which are used for food, the food-supply has 
become regular, and is obtained by an application of the 
muscular system in highly specialized directions. Ex- 
amples of this condition are, for instance, the central 
African negroes, who have their gardens near their vil- 
lages, the cultivation of the gardens being essentially the 
work of the women, while the men are engaged in vati- 
ous specialized industrial pursuits. Neither is the man- 
ner of the use of the body which is applied by wild animals 
for protection against enemies found among these tribes. 
The manner of combat is. one in which muscular strength 
alone is not decisive, but where excellence of weapons and 
strategy count as much as mere strength and agility.  
-P-A-G-E-80
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT nm 
The conditions among the American agricultural Indians 
of the Mississippi Valley or of those of the South Ameri- 
can forests are similar in character. 
As an example of a pastoral people among whom con- 
siderable regularity in nutrition obtains, we might men- 
tion the reindeer-breeders of Siberia or the cattle-breeders 
of Africa. 
We know, of course, that among all these people, periods 
of starvation occur, due to a failure of the crops or to epi- 
demics in the herds; but the normal condition is one of 
fairly regular and ample food-supply. 
The conditions among fishing tribes are not very differ- 
ent; and we find that, owing to methods of storing pro- 
visions, and to the superabundance of food-supply ob- 
tained in one season and sufficient to last for the rest of 
the year, the nutrition of these people is also fairly regular. 
In this case, also, the kind of muscular exertion required 
for obtaining food is specialized, and differs from that 
required from the simple pursuit of game. 
The only modern tribes among which the effects of civili- 
zation on bodily activities are slight are those who, like 
the Bushmen of South Africa, the Australians, the Eskimo 
of Arctic America, the Veddahs of Ceylon, obtain their 
livelihood by the constant, daily-repeated pursuit of ani-
-P-A-G-E-81
42 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
mals, or by the gathering of plants or small invertebrates 
which grow scattered over a wide area. 
Connected with these conditions are also the charac- 
teristic selections of food-stuffs by different tribes Mi 
as the exclusive meat diet of some tribes (perhaps most 
pronounced among the Eskimo) and the exclusiyg vege- 
table diet of others, well developed, for instance, 6... 
em Asia. Both of these have, in probability, a far- 
“reaching effect upon the bodily form of these races. 
The second group of causes which is most potent in 
developing distighFaces of ‘domesticated animals — 
namely, conscious selection — has probably never been 
very active in the races of man. We do not know ofa 
single case in which it can be shown that intermarriage 
between distinct types of the same descent was prohibited; 
and whatever selection there may have been in the de- 
velopment of primitive society seems to have been rather 
that type of natural selection which encourages the mat- 
ing of like with like, or such intricate selection as is due 
to the social laws of intermarriage, which prevented in- 
termarriages of relatives of certain grades, and often also 
of members of different generations. Thus a very com- 
mon form of marriage restriction brings it about that 
among certain tribes the children of brother and sister  
-P-A-G-E-82
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 73 
intermarry, while the children of brothers and the children 
of sisters are not allowed to intermarry.. Similar re- 
. strictions are found in great number, and may possibly 
ad a certain selective effect, although their opera- 
tion can hardly be assumed to have had very marked re- 
sults upon the form of the human body (Pearson). 
Tn 4. cases social laws have had the indirect effect of 
perpetuating distingns between separate parts of a pop- 
ulation, or at least of retarding their complete amalgama- 
tion. This is the case where laws of endogamy relate to 
groups of distinct descent, and rfp. observed, for 
instance, among the castes of Bengal, where the low castes 
are of the characteristic South Indian type, while the 
highest castes preserve the type of the tribes of north- 
western India (Risley and Gait). The pumerous inter- 
mediate castes show, however, that the laws of endogamy, 
even where they are as stringent as those of India, cannot 
prevent blood-mixture. Whether or not in extreme cases 
endogamy in small groups, as among the ancient Egyp- 
tians, has led to the development of well-defined types, is 
a question that cannot be answered ; but it is certain that 
none of these types, when found in a large population, 
have survived. 
The third element of domestication, on the other hand,
-P-A-G-E-83
74 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
has probably been very important in the development of 
the races of man. Crossings between distinct types are 
so markedly common in the history of primitive people, 
and so markedly rare in the history of wild animals, that 
in this case the analogy between domesticated animals 
and man becomes very clear. Cases of hybrid forms in 
nature are almost everywhere rare; while, as I have 
pointed out before, domesticated animals have been 
crossed and recrossed without end. Crossings between 
the most distinct types of man are also of very common 
occurrence. As an instance, I might mention the inter- 
marriages between the Hamitic tribes of the Sahara and 
the:negro tribes of the Soudan (Nachtigal) ; the mixtures 
between the Negritos and Malay, which are of such 
common occurrence in the Malay Peninsula (Martin), 
and which are probably to a great extent the cause of the 
peculiar distribution of types in the whole Malay Archi- 
pelago; the mixtures which have taken place in Fiji; 
that of the Ainu and Japanese in the northern part of 
Japan ; of European and Mongol in eastern Europe; not 
to speak of the more recent mixtures between Europeal 
and other races which were incident to the gradual 
distribution of the European race over the whole world. 
This point of view — namely, the consideration of man
-P-A-G-E-84
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT 75 
as a domesticated being (with the sole exception, perhaps, 
of a few hunting tribes) — is also of great importance for 
a clear understanding of his mental activities. The be- 
havior of primitive domesticated animals, like that of the 
Eskimo dog or of the Chukchee reindeer, is decidedly dif- 
ferent from the behavior of wild animals. We might 
perhaps say that the range of mentality. of the domesti- 
cated forms seems to be, on the whole, wider, and this con- 
dition increases with increasing degree of domestication. 
Cases in which the mental activities of domesticated 
animals are more deficient than those of the wild animals, 
do occur, but are not as frequent as the reverse cases. An 
example of this kind is furnished by sheep. 
We are thus led to the conclusion that environment has 
an important effect upon the anatomical structure and 
physiological functions of man; and that for this reason 
differences of type and action between primitive and 
civilized groups of the same race must be expected. It 
seems plausible that one of the most potent causes of 
these modifications must be looked for in the progressive 
domestication of man incident to the advance of civiliza- 
tion,
-P-A-G-E-85
il. INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY UPON 
HUMAN TYPES 
WE will now turn to the consideration of another ele- 
ment which determines the physical type of man. Al- 
though we have seen that environment, particularly 
domestication, has a far-reaching influence upon the 
bodily form of the taces of man, these influences are of 2 
quite secondary character when compared to the far- 
teaching influence of heredity. Even granting the'great- 
est possible amount of influence to environment, it is 
readily seen that all the essential traits of man. are due 
primarily to heredity. The descendants of the negro 
will always be negroes; the descendants of the whites, 
whites; and we may go even considerably further, and 
may recognize that the essential detailed characteristics 
of a type will always be reproduced in the descendants, al- 
though they may be modified to a considerable extent by 
the influence of environment. I am inclined to believe 
that the influence of environment is of such a character, 
that, although the same race may assume a different type 
76
-P-A-G-E-86
INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY 7 
when removed from one environment to another, it will 
revert to its old type when replaced in its old environment. 
This point has not been proved by actual anthropological 
evidence; but it seems reasonable to make this assump- 
tion by analogy with what we know of the behavior of 
plants and animals. It would, of course, be highly desira- 
ble to clear up this question by appropriate investigations. 
In order to obtain a clearer understanding of the racial 
problem, it seems necessary to describe more definitely the 
characteristics of heredity. In the discussion of modern 
anthropology, two theories have been advocated relating 
to the manner in which parental traits are inherited by 
children. Francis Galton and his adherents have as- 
sumed that the form of the body of an individual is de- 
termined by the racial type to which the parents belong, 
modified, however, by the tendency of reversion to a type 
intermediate between the special variations presented 
by the parents. When, for instance, the father of an in- 
dividual is unusually tall, his mother somewhat taller 
than the average, it is assumed that the tendency of the 
children would be to develop a stature which is somewhat 
near the general type, but at the same time dependent 
upon the intermediate value located between the stature 
of the mother and that of the father. On the other hand,
-P-A-G-E-87
“48 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
the development of the Mendelian doctrine (Lock, 
Bateson) of heredity has led other investigators to assume 
that the offspring of two distinct types may be a mixed 
type, but that his descendants will tend to revert either 
to one parental type or to the other, or that one of the 
parental types may’ dominate over the influence of the 
other parental type. Investigations relating to this prob- 
lem are not very numerous; but, on the whole, it would 
appear that the results so far obtained are in favor 
rather of a modified form of Mendelian inheritance than 
of an inheritance characterized by reversion of the chil- 
dren to a middle type between the parents, or to a type 
dependent upon such a middle type. 
A number of years ago T had an opportunity to invest 
gate a considerable number of Indian half-bloods; that 
is to say, of descendants of Indian mothers and white 
fathers. The most characteristic difference between the 
American Indian race and the European race, so far a8 
these differences can be expressed in metrical form, is 
found in the width of the face. An extensive series of 
measurements of width of face made among half-bloods 
showed conclusively that the width of face does not tend” 
to range around a certain intermediate value located be- 
tween the width of face of the white race and that of the
-P-A-G-E-88
INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY 79 
Indian race, but there was a decided tendency in the chil- 
dren to resemble either the Indian race or the white race; 
in other words, that feature of Mendelian inheritance 
which brings about the occurrence of mixed character- 
istics in the first hybrid generation was not found, but in- 
stead of this a decided tendency of reversion to either type, 
and to comparative rarity of intermediate forms. The 
results seem also to indicate that the Indian form in this 
mixture seems to dominate over the white form, but not 
in the Mendelian sense, which would require the presence 
of dominant features in a certain definite number of in- 
dividuals, but only in the sense that the Indian type was 
a little more frequent than the European type, with the 
effect that the average width of face of the whole series 
was a little nearer to the Indian group than to the white 
group. 
While this single observation is not by any means suffi- 
cient to determine fully the characteristic traits of hered- 
ity which govern the phenomenon in question, they indi- 
cate decidedly and beyond cavil that, in this case at least, 
we find what has been called by Karl Pearson “alternat- 
ing inheritance.” It is worth remarking that not all the 
features of the body of the half-blood Indian exhibit the 
same tendency; that, for instance, in the case of stature,
-P-A-G-E-89
80 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
a general increase in the stature of the mixed people over 
that of the pure races may be observed. 
Attention has been called by Felix von Luschan toa 
similar phenomenon which occurs in the mixed population 
of southern Asia Minor, where he believes to have found 
an alternating inheritance of the head-form, particularly 
of the proportions between width and length of head; 
some of the people retaining the short, high head-forms 
of the Armenoid type of the interior of Asia Minor, while 
the others have the long, low head of the Semites of Syria. 
For a clear understanding of the laws of heredity, it 
seems important to know whether a similar alternating 
inheritance occurs in marriages of members of the same 
type. Ihave been enabled to investigate this question by 
a study of the East European Hebrews living in New 
York. A simple consideration shows, that, if the children 
tend to follow a type intermediate between the type of 
their parents, then the children of one family will show 
the same degree of resemblance among themselves, 00 
matter how great the difference between the parents; 
for, if they simply tend to reproduce a middle type, it 
would not make any difference whether the mother is 
excessively short and the father excessively tall, or 
whether both parents are of middle stature. In both of
-P-A-G-E-90
INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY 81 
these cases the intermediate value would be the same, 
and we should therefore expect that the effect upon the 
children would be the same. If, on the other hand, there 
is any kind of alternation in inheritance, the effect upon 
the family would be quite different. We should expect, 
in a family of which both parents are near the typical 
average, to find the children also to be near this average. 
On the other hand, if the mother is excessively short and 
the father excessively tall, we should expect some of the 
children to follow the mother in regard to shortness of 
stature, others to follow the father in regard to tallness. 
It will therefore be seen that in the case of alternating 
inheritance, we must expect an increased variability 
among the children. The compilation of material ob- 
tained from several thousand families shows very defi- 
nitely that the variability among childreri both of whose 
parents belong to the same racial type, even to the same 
local type, increases quite considerably with the increased 
difference of the parents; so that we may assume a de- 
cided tendency to alternating inheritance in these cases. 
There is, however, no evidence whatever of the dom- 
inance of one type over another. 
Quite a number of investigations have been made in 
Telation to the intensity of heredity of parents and of 
G
-P-A-G-E-91
82 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
grandparents ; and, notwithstanding the uncertainty of the 
quantitative result, it seems reasonably certain that the 
intensity of heredity for each parent may be expressed 
by the value of about one-third (Pearson, Boas). It is 
somewhat difficult to explain clearly the significance of 
this value. I may, however, briefly indicate it in the 
following manner. Provided the mother differs in her 
stature by an amount of 9 cm. from the racial norm, + 
for instance, if she is 9 cm. taller than the average in- 
dividual, — then we may expect the child to be one-third, 
of 9 cm., or 3 cm., above the average. It will thus be 
seen that if both parents differ in the same direction from _ 
the average, the effect of both will be cumulative; and 
if both differ from the average of their people by the same 
amount, the joint effect of the two parents may be ex 
pressed by the coefficient of about two-thirds. In case, 
for instance, both father and mother should be g cm. 
above the type average, we should expect the child 
to be about two-thirds of 9 cm., or 6 cm., above the 
average. 
Although definite information on the amount of hered- 
ity of previous generations is not yet available, the prob- 
ability seems to be that the grandparents have jointly a0 
influence of about two-ninths, the great-grandparents
-P-A-G-E-92
INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY 83 
jointly of about two twenty-sevenths, etc.,,upon the 
ofispring. 
When we study these problems according to statistical 
theories, and take into consideration the observations on 
the resemblance of brothers and sisters, it can be shown 
that the theory of alternating inheritance cannot be taken 
too literally; for, if there were an absolute reversion of 
any one trait to pure ancestral types, we might say that 
the probability would be very small that two brothers 
should happen to repeat the bodily form of the same 
ancestor, because the number of ancestors in remote 
generations is very large. In other words, there must be 
an additional cause of resemblance between brothers and 
sisters. It is possible to show, that in case the inheritance 
has the strength denoted before, and if bodily form of a 
certain generation were due only to alternating inheri- 
tance acting from parents, grandparents, great-grand- 
parents, and so on, and directly upon the generation in 
question, and without an occurrence of the same individ- 
uals in various places in the line of ancestors, then the 
Tesemblance between brothers and sisters, or, as we say, 
between the members of a fraternity, would result in a 
degree of resemblance which is much lower than the one 
actually observed. When the total nuntser, of ancestors
-P-A-G-E-93
84 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
is small, the recurrence of the same forms would become 
more probable, and the similarity of the series would in- 
crease, On the whole, the data seem to be best explained 
if we assume that there is not only alternating inheritance, 
but also a direct dependence upon the combination of the 
two parental types. 
I should like to repeat here that these results have not 
been obtained with absolute certainty, and that it seems 
improbable that the laws of heredity in regard to various 
ancestral traits are the same. I do not enter into a dis- 
cussion of the question of in how far these traits follow the 
laws of Mendelian inheritance, — a question that cannot 
be answered definitely at the present time (Davenport). 
These problems have a fundamental importance for 
a clearer interpretation of the conditions which prevail 
in the form of local types of man. 
Ina large population which is as little stable in its hab- 
its as that of modern Europe and modern America, the 
number of ancestors of a single person increases very 
rapidly, the number of parents being two; of grand- 
parents, four; of great-grandparents, eight; the theo- 
retical number of ancestors twenty generations back 
would be over a millon, or, more accurately, 1,048,576. 
Twenty ~ ~dions represent, according to the rate of 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY 85 
increase of modern times, about seven hundred years; 
according to the rate of increase of older times, about 
four hundred years as a minimum. These figures would 
apply to the series of generations represented by first- 
born males; for first-born females the respective numbers 
would be about five hundred years and three hundred 
and fifty years. If we consider, however, the actual de- 
scent of families, including individuals later born, we 
might perhaps assume that twenty generations in 
Europe would represent from, eight hundred to nine 
hundred years, and among primitive peoples perhaps 
only little less, since in former times the differences be- 
tween the rapidity of successive generations in Europe 
and among primitive peoples was not very great. This 
makes it obvious that it is entirely impossible that as 
great a number of ancestors as the theory requires can 
have contributed to the development of the individuals 
of the present generation. The reason for this is plain. 
Owing to intermarriages between the same families, large 
numbers of ancestors will be duplicated in different pa- 
ternal and maternal lines; and in this way the real an- 
cestry of each individual appears to be much more com- 
plex than the purely arithmetical treatment would 
suggest. The calculation for the ancestor table of the

INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY 87 
When we compare these conditions in the thickly popu- 
lated parts of modern Europe and of America, with their 
unstable population, with the conditions among primitive 
tribes, it becomes at once apparent that the total number 
of ancestors of each type in small communities must be 
much less than the number of ancestors in the modern 
states just referred to. A characteristic example is pre- 
sented by the Eskimo of Smith Sound in North Green- 
land. From all we know, it seems extremely unlikely 
that this community ever consisted of more than a few 
hundred individuals. From what we know about the 
history of Eskimo communities, we might much rather 
assume that originally it consisted of a very few families 
only. The community has been cut off from the outer 
world for very long periods; and while there may have 
been accessions of new individuals from outside once each 
century, on the whole it has remained completely iso- 
lated. It is therefore obvious that the ancestry of this 
group cannot contain anything like the million of people 
required by the theory, but that all the individuals must 
be interrelated through their remote ancestry. 
Considering, now, the laws of inheritance as outlined 
before, it would appear that in a community of this type, 
the members of which number little more than two hun-
-P-A-G-E-97
88 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
dred individuals, the ancestor of every single individual 
from the eighth generation back must have been the same, 
because the eighth generation would require theoretically 
two hundred and fifty-six individuals, — a greater num- 
ber than are actually found in the community; and the 
occurrence of any individuals who have not a good many 
near and remote ancestors in common with the whole rest 
of the community is highly improbable, if not impossible. 
It follows from this at once that the variability of the 
whole series around its typical average must be rather 
small, because all the members of the group will have a 
certain amount of family resemblance. This uniformity 
of type will, of course, be the greater, the more uniform 
the ancestral group. 
On the other hand, these conditions bring abot an- 
other peculiar characteristic of the isolated group. Ow- 
ing to the constant recurrence of the same ancestral types 
among the whole group, the type of the whole people 
becomes very similar to the characteristic traits of the 
small ancestral group; and the smaller this group, the 
stronger will be the probability of the type of the local 
group being quite distinct from the type of the whole 
people to which they belong. 
It seems to my mind that these conditions explain toa
-P-A-G-E-98
INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY 89 
- considerable extent the occurrence of distinct local types 
in primitive races. When we find, for instance, that in 
North America a very marked type belongs to the Arctic 
cost of the continent, that a quite distinct type is found 
in the Mackenzie basin, still others in well-defined locali- 
ties on the Pacific coast, again others in the Mississippi 
basin, one in the southeast, and one along the Rio Grande 
and in Mexico, —it seems plausible to ascribe their 
origin to the increase of small isolated groups, which, as 
we have seen, must necessarily lead to differentiation of 
type. 
This view of the origin of local races is quite in accord’ 
with the remarkable results obtained by Johannsen in his 
studies of heredity. He repeated artificially the con- 
dition which prevail in a small community, and exag- 
gerated them by selecting types of equal form, and by 
Propagating them by self-fertilization. He raised in this 
way bean-plants from beans of equal weight, and was able 
to restrict variation of the type, so that practically any 
kind of bean of particular weight and particular form 
could be bred true to the type of its ancestor, and without 
perpetuating the accidental variations of the ancestors. 
Tn cases where the ancestry goes back to a limited num- 
ber of individuals, as among our isolated tribes, the varia-
-P-A-G-E-99
90 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
tion will, ofeourse, not be restricted to the same extent; 
but the characteristic development of a stable type is 
quite analogous to the experiment made by Johannsen. 
Another phenomenon may be pointed out here which 
is still little investigated, but which deserves careful at- 
tention. We have seen that in stable communities in 
sparsely settled countries the relationship between mem- 
bers of a tribe will be quite close, and that this relation- 
ship will necessarily affect the type and its variability. 
In course of time two areas whose population has thus 
developed may be thrown into contact, and numerous in- 
termarriages may occur. It will be seen at once, that, al- 
though the differences between the two types may be ap- 
parently only slight, a complete disturbance in the forms 
of heredity will result, because a great number of individ- 
uals of distinct ancestry are thrown together. To give 
anexample. The South Italians and the Spaniards repre- 
sent two types not very distinct in physical features, but 
separated for centuries. The small village communities 
of Italy, as well as those of Spain, have all the character- 
istics of communities in which endogamic marriages have 
been continued for a long period. In the Argentine Re- 
public these two types come into contact and intermarry 
frequently. We have no observations on the result of this  
-P-A-G-E-100
INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY or 
mixture upon physical characteristics, bu‘vit has been 
noted that the distribution of male and. female births is 
quite different from that prevailing in families in which 
both parents are either Spanish or Italian (Pearl). It is 
also conceivable that this may be one of the elements 
bringing about the change of type of urban popula- 
tions when compared to rural populations in Europe, 
and that it may have been active in the change 
of type observed among the descendants of European im- 
migrants in America ; for, although the observations have 
been made on pure types, in America cases of inter- 
marriages of natives of different villages are much more 
common than in Europe. 
After we have thus considered the influences of heredity 
and environment, so far as they determine the character- 
istics of distinct types of man, it remains to add a few 
words on the individuals constituting each type, and on 
the different distribution of individuals in distinct types. 
I have had to refer repeatedly to the phenomena of 
variation in the races of man ; and I have pointed out be- 
fore, that, so far as individual features are concerned, we 
find that the range of variations in each human type is so 
great, that overlapping of the range of variation in differ- 
ent types is of constant occurrence. We have seen, for
-P-A-G-E-101
92 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
instance, that the medium brains of the Europeans occur 
with considerable frequency among negroes, and that 
only the excessively small negro brains have no parallel 
formsamong the Europeans; and correspondingly that the 
excessively large European brains have no parallel forms 
among the brains of the negroes. The amount of varia- 
bility in regard to various physical traits differs very con- 
siderably in different races. Most of the European types, 
for instance, are remarkable for their high variability. 
The same is true of the Polynesians and of some negro 
tribes. On the other hand, people like the European He- 
brews, and, even more so, the North American Indians, 
are characterized by, comparatively speaking, much . 
greater uniformity. The amount of variability differs 
considerably with regard to different physical features. 
It is, for instance, obvious that the hair-color and hair- 
form of North Europeans is much more variable than 
" the hair-color and hair-form of the Chinese. In Europe 
the colors vary from flaxen to black, with a con- 
siderable number of individuals with red hair, and the 
form varies from straight to high degrees of waviness. 
Among the Chinese, on the other hand, we do not find 
equal variations in the darkness of color, since blondes 
and curly-haired individuals are absent. Similar ob-
-P-A-G-E-102
INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY 3 
servations may be made in regard to stature, head-form, ~ 
or any other feature of the body that can be expressed by 
measurements. 
The reason for the differences in variability is partly 
given in our previous remarks. We have seen, when a 
people is descended from a small uniform group, that 
then its variability will decrease; while on the other 
hand, when a group has a much-varied origin, or when the 
ancestors belong to entirely distinct types, the variability 
may be considerably increased. In all cases which have 
been investigated, even in those in which the variability 
is small, there still remain considerable differences in 
bodily appearance among the individuals constituting a 
tribal or national or other social unit; and what is true 
of the physical traits is obviously no less true of the 
mental traits, but it is difficult to express mental charac- 
’ teristics in numerical terms of variability. - An acquaint- 
ance with tribes which are apparently on the simplest 
level socially, however, shows the existence of certain 
individuals of most diverse types of disposition and in- 
tellect; and as might be expected, if we consider mental 
condition as dependent upon bodily form, the great 
variability, even in the most uniform group, of the struc- 
ture of the body, particularly of the brain, makes it
-P-A-G-E-103
04 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
> plausible that very large differences in individual dis- 
position may be expected. 
What we have said before in regard to the overlapping 
f variations among different races and types, and the 
reat range of variability in each type, may also be ex- 
ressed by saying that the differences between different 
ypes of man are, on the whole, small as compared to the 
ange of variation in each type. 
The importance of these observations in the domain 
of mental development will be the subject of our future 
discussions.

IV. THE MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE 
MAN AND OF CIVILIZED MAN 
In the preceding chapters we have discussed the bio- 
logical conditions of various races and of different social 
groups, in so far as they form the basisof mental activity. 
We must now turn our attention to the psychological 
characteristics of mankind under the varying conditions 
of race and environment. 
When we consider our problem from a purely psycho- 
logical point of view, we have to follow out the same lines 
of thought which we pursued in our discussion of the ana- 
tomical problem. We must try to enumerate clearly the 
typical differences between the human mind and the ani- 
mal mind, which must serve as the background of our dis- 
cussions. In the treatment of the psychic differences 
between civilized man and primitive man, we must distin- 
guish the two problems of differences in cultural state of 
members of the same race, and differences in character- 
istics of different races; in other words, the problems of 
environmental influences and of influences of heredity. 
95
-P-A-G-E-105
96 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
For the purposes of our investigation, we do not need 
to enter deeply into a discussion of the first-named prob- 
lem, the differences between the minds of the animal and 
of man. The differences are so striking that little or no 
diversity of opinion exists. The two outer traits in which 
the distinction between the minds of animal and of man 
finds expression are the existence of organized articulate 
language in man, and the use of utensils of varied applica- 
tion. Bothof these are common to the whole of mankind. 
No tribe has ever been found that does not possess a well- 
organized language; no community that does not know 
the use of instruments for breaking, cutting, or drilling, 
the use of fire and of weapons with which to defend them- 
selves and to obtain the means of living. Although 
means of communication by sound exist in animals, and 
although even lower animals seem to have means of bring- 
ing about co-operation between different individuals, we 
do not know of any case of true articulate language from 
which the student can extract abstract principles of classi- 
fication of ideas. It may also be that higher apes employ 
now and then limbs of trees or stones for defence, but the 
use of complex utensils is not found in any representative 
of the animal series. Only in the case of habitations do 
we find an approach to more complex activities, which,
-P-A-G-E-106
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN _ 97 
however, remain absolutely stable in each species,— as 
we say, instinctive, — and bear no evidence of any in- 
dividual freedom of use, which constitutes the primary 
character of human inventions. The origin of the in- 
stinctive activities of animals which lead to the construc- 
tion of complex mechanical devices is still a hidden secret ; 
but the relation of the individual of the species to these 
activities differs from that of man to his inventions in the 
complete lack of freedom of control. , 
We are accustomed to say that the essential character- 
istic of the mental processes of man is the power of reason- 
ing. While animals as well as man may perform actions 
suited to an end, based on memery of the results of pre- 
vious actions, and suitable selection of actions fitting a 
certain purpose, we have no evidence whatever that 
would show that the abstract concepts accompanying the 
action can be isolated by animals, while all groups of man, 
from the most primitive to the most highly developed, 
Possess this faculty. 
' These few remarks on the common mental traits of 
man will suffice. When we turn to a consideration of the 
racial and social characteristics of the human mind, we 
find ourselves confronted by a peculiar difficulty. In all 
our thoughts we think in terms of our own social envi- 
a
-P-A-G-E-107
98 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
ronment. But the activities of the human mind exhibit 
an infinite variety of form among the peoples of the world, 
In order to understand these clearly, the student must en- 
deavor to divest himself entirely of opinions and emotions 
based upon. the peculiar social environment into which he 
is born. He must adapt his own mind, so far as feasible, 
to that of the people whom he is studying. The more 
successful he is in freeing himself from the bias based on 
the group of ideas that constitute the civilization in which 
he lives, the more successful he will be in interpreting the 
beliefs and actions of man. He must follow lines of 
thought that are new to him. He must participate in 
new emotions, and understand how, under unwonted 
conditions, both lead to actions. Beliefs, customs, and 
the response of the individual to the events of daily life, 
give us ample opportunity to observe the manifestations 
of the mind of man under varying conditions. 
Apparently the thoughts and actions of civilized man, 
and those found in more primitive forms of society, prove, 
that, in various groups of mankind, the mind responds 
quite differently when exposed to the same conditions. 
Lack of logical connection in its conclusions, lack of con-. 
trol of will, are apparently two of its fundamental charac- 
teristics in primitive society. In the formation of opin-
-P-A-G-E-108
€ 
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN 99 
ions, belief takes the place of logical demonstration. 
The emotional value of opinions is great, and conse- 
quently they quickly lead to action. The will appears 
unbalanced, there being a readiness to yield to strong 
emotions and a stubborn resistance in trifling matters. © 
Unfortunately the descriptions of the state of mind of 
primitive people, such as are given by most travellers, are 
too superficial to be used for psychological investigation. 
Very few travellers understand the language of the people 
they visit; and how is it possible to judge a tribe solely 
by the descriptions of interpreters, or by observations of 
disconnected actions the incentive of which remains un- 
known? But even when the language of the people is 
known to the visitor, he is generally an unappreciative 
listener to their tales. The missionary has his strong 
bias against the religious ideas and customs of primitive 
people, and the trader has no interest in their beliefs and 
in their barbarous arts. The observers who seriously 
tried to enter into the inner life of a people, the Cushings, 
Callaways, and Greys, are few in number, and may be 
counted on one’s fingers. Nevertheless the bulk of the 
argument is always based on the statements of hasty and 
superficial observers. 
Numerous attempts have been made to describe the
-P-A-G-E-109
100 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
peculiar psychological characteristics of primitive man. 
Among these I would mention those of Klemm, Carus, De 
Gobineau, Nott and Gliddon, Waitz, Spencer, and 
Tylor. Their investigations are of merit as descriptions 
of the characteristics of primitive people, but we cannot 
claim for any of them that they describe the psychological 
characters of races independent of their social surround- 
ings. Klemm and Wuttke designate the civilized races 
as active, all others as passive, and assume that all ele- 
ments and beginnings of civilization found among primi- 
tive people — in America or on the islands of the Pacific 
Ocean — were due to an early contact with civilization. 
Carus divides mankind into “peoples of the day, hight 
and dawn.” De Gobineau calls the yellow race the male 
element, the black race the female element, and calls 
only the whites the noble and gifted race. Nott and 
Gliddon ascribe animal instincts only to the lower races, 
while they declare that the white race has a higher in- 
stinct which incites and directs its development. 
The belief in the higher hereditary powers of the white 
race has gained a new life with the modern doctrine of the 
prerogatives of the master-mind, which have found their ; 
_ boldest expression in Nietzsche’s writings. | 
All such views are generalizations which either do not  
-P-A-G-E-110
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN tor 
sufficiently take into account the social conditions of 
races, and thus confound cause and effect, or were dic- 
tated by scientific or humanitarian bias, by the desire to 
justify the institution of slavery, or to give the greatest 
freedom to the most highly gifted. 
Tylor and Spencer, who give an ingenious analysis of 
the mental life of primitive man, do not assume that 
these are racial characteristics, although the evolution- 
ary standpoint of Spencer’s work often seems to convey 
this impression. 
Quite distinct from these is Waitz’s point of view. He 
says, “According to the current opinion the stage of 
culture of a people or of an individual is largely or exclu- 
sively a product of his faculty. We maintain that the 
reverse is at least just as true. The faculty of man does 
not designate anything but how much and what he is 
able to achieve in the immediate future and depends upon 
the stages of culture through which he has passed and the 
one he has reached.” 
The views of these investigators show that in the do- 
main of psychology a confusion prevails still greater than 
in anatomy, as to the characteristics of primitive races, 
and that no clear distinction is drawn between the racial 
and the social problem. In other words, the evidence
-P-A-G-E-111
“102 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
is based partly on the supposed mental characteristics of 
races, no matter what their stage of culture; partly on 
those of tribes and peoples on different levels of civiliza- 
tion, no matter whether they belong to the same race or 
to distinct races. Still these two problems are entirely 
distinct. The former is a problem of heredity ; the latter, 
a problem of environment. 
Thus we recognize that there are two possible explana- 
tions of the different manifestations of the mind of man. 
It may be that the minds of different races show differ- 
ences of organization; that is to say, the laws of mental 
activity may not be the same for all minds. But it may 
also be that the organization of mind is practically iden- - 
tical among all races of man; that mental activity follows 
the same laws everywhere, but that its manifestations 
depend upon the character of individual experience that is 
subjected to the action of these laws. 
It is quite evident that the activities of the human mind 
depend upon these two elements. The organization of 
the mind may be defined as the group of laws which deter- 
mine the modes of thought and of action, irrespective of 
the subject-matter of mental activity. Subject to such 
laws are the manner of discrimination between percep- 
tions, the manner in which perceptions associate them-
-P-A-G-E-112
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN 103 
selves with previous perceptions, the manner in which a 
stimulus leads to action, and the emotions produced by 
stimuli. These lawsdetermine to a great extent the mani- 
festations of the mind. In these we recognize hereditary 
causes. 
But, on the other hand, the influence of individual 
experience can easily be shown to be very great. The 
bulk of the experience of man is gained from oft-repeated 
impressions. It is one of the fundamental laws of psy- 
chology that the repetition of mental processes increases 
the facility with which these processes are performed, 
and decreases the degree of consciousness that accom- 
panies them. This law expresses the well-known phe- 
nomena of habit. When a certain perception is fre- 
quently associated with another previous perception, the 
one will habitually call forth the other. When a certain 
stimulus frequently results in a certain action, it will 
tend to call forth habitually the same action. If a stimu- 
lus has often produced a certain emotion, it will tend to 
teproduce it every time. These belong to the group of 
environmental causes. 
The explanation of the activity of the mind of man, 
therefore, requires the discussion of two distinct problems. 
The first bears upon the question of unity or diversity
-P-A-G-E-113
104 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
of organization of the mind, while the second bears upon 
the diversity produced by the variety of contents of the 
mind as found in the various social and geographical en- 
vironments. The task of the investigator consists largely 
in separating these two causes, and in attributing to each 
its proper share in the development of the peculiarities 
of the mind. 
We will first devote our attention to the question, Do 
differences exist in the organization of the human mind? 
Since Waitz’s thorough discussion of the question of the 
unity of the human species, there can be no doubt that in 
the main the mental characteristics of man are the same 
all over the world; but the question remains ope, 
whether there is a sufficient difference in grade to allow 
us to assume that the present races of man may be con- 
sidered as standing on different stages of the evolutionary 
series, whether we are justified in ascribing to civilized 
man a higher place in organization than to primitive 
man. 
The chief difficulty encountered in the solution of this 
problem has been pointed out before. It is the uncer- 
tainty as to which of the characteristics of primitive man 
are causes of the low stage of culture, and which are 
caused by it; or which of the psychological characteris-
-P-A-G-E-114
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN tos 
tics are hereditary, and would not be wiped out by the 
effects of civilization. The fundamental difficulty of col- 
lecting satisfactory observations lies in the fact that no 
large groups of primitive man are brought nowadays into 
conditions of real equality with whites. The gap be- 
tween our society and theirs always remains open, and 
for this reason their minds cannot be expected to work 
in the same manner as ours. The same phenomenon 
which led us to the conclusion that primitive races of 
our times are not given an opportunity to develop 
their abilities, prevents us from judging their innate 
faculty. 
It seems advantageous to direct our attention first of . 
all to this difficulty. If it can be shown that certain men-- 
tal traits are common to all members of mankind that 
are on a primitive stage of civilization, no matter what 
their racial affinities may be, the conclusion will gain 
much in strength, that these traits are primarily social, or 
based on physical characteristics due to social environ- 
ment. 
I will select a few only among the mental characteristics 
of primitive man which will illustrate our point, — in- 
hibition of impulses, power of attention, power of original 
thought. 
a
-P-A-G-E-115
106 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
We will first discuss the question, in how far primitive 
man is capable of inhibiting impulses (Spencer). 
It is an impression obtained by many travellers, and 
also based upon experiences gained in our own country, 
that primitive man of all races, and the less educated of 
our own race, have in common a lack of control of emo- 
tions, that they give way more readily to an impulse than 
civilized man and the highly educated. I believe that 
this conception is based largely upon the neglect to con- 
sider the occasions on which a strong control of impulses 
is demanded in various forms of society. 
Most of the proofs for this alleged peculiarity are 
based on the fickleness and uncertainty of the disposition 
of primitive man, and on the strength of his passions 
aroused by seemingly trifling causes. I will say right here 
’ that the traveller or student measures the fickleness of 
the people by the importance which he attributes to the 
actions or purposes in which they do not persevere, and 
he weighs the impulse for outbursts of passion by his 
standard. Let me give an example. A traveller desit- 
ous of reaching his goal as soon as possible engages men 
to start on a journey at a certain time. To him time is 
exceedingly valuable. But what is time to primitive 
man, who does not feel the compulsion of completing a
-P-A-G-E-116
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN 107 
definite work at a definite time? While the traveller is 
fuming and raging over the delay, his men keep up their 
merry chatter and laughter, and cannot be induced to 
exert themselves except to please their master. Wouldnot 
they be right in stigmatizing many a traveller for his im- 
pulsiveness and lack of control when irritated by a trifling 
cause like loss of time? Instead of this, the traveller 
complains of the fickleness of the natives, who quickly lose 
interest in the objects which the traveller has at heart. 
The proper way to compare the fickleness of the savage 
and that of the white is to compare their behavior in 
undertakings which are equally important to each. 
More generally speaking, when we want to give a true 
estimate of the power of primitive man to control im- 
pulses, we must not compare the control required on cer- 
tain occasions among ourselves with the control exerted 
by primitive man on the same occasions. If, for instance, 
our social etiquette forbids the expression of feelings of 
personal discomfort and of anxiety, we must remember 
that personal etiquette among primitive men may not 
require any inhibition of the same kind. We must rather 
look for those occasions on which inhibition is required 
by the customs of primitive man. Such are, for instance, 
the numerous cases of taboo, — that is, of prohibitions
-P-A-G-E-117
108 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
of the use of certain foods, or of the performance of cer- 
tain kinds of work, — which sometimes require a con- 
siderable amount of self-control. When an Eskimo com- 
munity is on the point of starvation, and their religious 
proscriptions forbid them to make use of the seals that are 
basking on the ice, the amount of self-control of the whole 
community which restrains them from killing these seals 
is certainly very great. Other examples that suggest 
themselves are the perseverance of primitive man in the 
manufacture of his utensils and weapons ; his readiness to 
undergo privations and hardships which promise to fulfil 
his desires, — as the Indian youth’s willingness to fast in 
the mountains, awaiting the appearance of his guardian 
spirit; or his bravery and endurance exhibited in order 
to gain admittance to the ranks of the men of his tribe; 
or, again, the often-described power of endurance ex 
hibited by Indian captives who undergo torture at the 
hands of their enemies. 
It has also been claimed that lack of control is exhibited 
by primitive man in his outbursts of passion occasioned 
. by slight provocations. I think that in this case also the 
difference in attitude of civilized man and of primitive 
man disappears if we give due weight to the social con- 
ditions in which the individual lives.
-P-A-G-E-118
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN tog 
What would a primitive man say to the noble passion 
which preceded and accompanied the war of the Rebel- 
lion? Would not the rights of slaves seem to him a most 
irrelevant question? On the other hand, we have ample 
proof that his passions are just as much controlled as 
ours, only in different directions. The numerous cus- 
toms and restrictions regulating the relations of the sexes 
may serve as an example. The difference in impulsive- 
ness may be fully explained by the different weight of mo- 
tives in both cases. In short, perseverance and control 
of impulses are demanded of primitive man as well as of 
civilized man, but on different occasions. If they are 
not demanded as often, the cause must be looked for, 
not in the inherent inability to produce them, but in the 
social status which does not demand them to the same 
extent. 
Spencer mentions as a particular case of this lack of 
control the improvidence of primitive man. I believe it 
would be more proper to say, instead of improvidence, 
optimism. ‘Why should I not be as successful to-mor- 
Tow as I was to-day ?”’ is the underlying feeling of primi- 
tive man. This feeling is, I think, no less powerful in 
civilized man. What builds up business activity but the 
belief in the stability of existing conditions? Why do
-P-A-G-E-119
170 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
the poor not hesitate to found families without being 
able to lay in store beforehand? We must not forget 
that starvation among most primitive people is an excep- 
tional case, the same as financial crises among civilized 
people; and that for times of need, such as occur regu- 
larly, provision is always made. Our social status is 
more stable, so far as the acquiring of the barest necessi- 
ties of life is concerned, so that exceptional conditions 
do not prevail often; but nobody would maintain that 
the majority of civilized men are always prepared to meet 
emergencies. We may recognize a difference in the de- 
gree of improvidence caused by the difference of social 
Status, but not a specific difference between lower and 
higher types of man. 
Related to the lack of power of inhibition is another 
trait which has been ascribed to primitive man of all 
races, — his inability of concentration when any demand 
is made upon the more complex faculties of the intellect. 
I will mention an example which seems to make clear the 
error committed in this assumption. In his description 
of the natives of the west coast of Vancouver Island, 
Sproat says, “The native mind, to an educated man, 
seemhs generally to be asleep... . On his attention 
being fully aroused, he often shows much quickness in
-P-A-G-E-120
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN i11 
reply and ingenuity in argument. But a short con- 
versation wearies him, particularly if questions are 
asked that require efforts of thought or memory on his 
part. The mind of the savage then appears to rock to 
and fro out of mere weakness.” Spencer, who quotes 
this passage, adds a number of others corroborating this 
point. I happen to know through personal contact the 
tribes mentioned by Sproat. The questions put by the 
traveller seem mostly trifling to the Indian, and he natu- 
rally soon tires of a conversation carried on in a foreign 
language, and one in which he finds nothing to interest 
him. As a matter of fact, the interest of those natives 
can easily be raised to a high pitch, and I have often been 
the one who was wearied out first. Neither does the 
management of their intricate system of exchange prove 
mental inertness in matters which concern the natives. 
Without mnemonic aids, they plan the systematic distri- 
bution of their property in such a manner as to increase 
their wealth and social position. These plans require 
great foresight and constant application. 
Finally I wish to refer to a trait of the mental life of 
primitive man of all races which has often been adduced 
as the primary reason why certain races cannot rise to 
higher levels of culture; namely, their lack of originality.
-P-A-G-E-121
112 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
It is said that the conservatism of primitive man is so 
strong, that the individual never deviates from the tradi- 
tional customs and beliefs (Spencer). While there is cer- 
tainly truth in this statement in so far as more customs ate 
binding than in civilized society, at least in its most highly 
developed types, originality is a trait which is by no means 
lacking in the life of primitive people. I will call to mind 
the great frequency of the appearance of prophets among 
newly converted tribes as well as among pagan tribes. 
Among the latter we learn quite frequently of new dog- 
mas which have been introduced by such individuals. It 
is true that these may often be traced to the influence of 
the ideas of neighboring tribes, but they are modified by 
the individuality of the person, and grafted upon the cut- 
rent beliefs of the people. It is a well-known fact that 
myths and beliefs have been disseminated, and undergo 
changes in the process of dissemination (Boas). Us- 
doubtedly this has often been accomplished by the i- 
dependent thought of individuals, as may be observed in 
the increasing complexity of esoteric doctrines intrusted 
to the care of a priesthood. I believe one of the best ex 
amples of such independent thought is furnished by the 
history of the ghost-dance ceremonies in North America 
(Mooney). The doctrines of the ghost-dance prophets 
  a, 
wy

were new, but based on the ideas of their own people, 
their neighbors, and the teachings of missionaries. The 
notion of future life of an Indian tribe of Vancouver Is- 
land has undergone a change in this manner, in so far as 
the idea of the return of the dead in children of their own 
family has arisen. The same independent attitude may 
be observed in the replies of the Nicaraguan Indians to 
the questions regarding their religion as were put to 
them by Bobadilla, and which were reported by Oviedo. 
It seems to my mind that the mental attitude of in- 
dividuals who thus develop the beliefs of a tribe is ex- 
actly that of the civilized philosopher. The student of 
the history of philosophy is well aware how strongly the 
mind of even the greatest genius is influenced by the cur- 
rent thought of his time. This has been well expressed 
by a German writer (Lehmann), who says, “The charac- 
ter of a system of philosophy is, just like that of any other 
literary work, determined first of all by the personal- 
ity of its originator. Every true philosophy reflects the 
life of the philosopher, as well as every true poem that 
of the poet. Secondly, it bears the general marks of the 
period to which it belongs; and the more powerful the 
ideas which it proclaims, the more strongly it will be per- 
meated by the currents of thought which fluctuate in the 
I
-P-A-G-E-123
114 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
life of the period. Thirdly, it is influenced by the par- 
ticular bent of philosophical thought of the period.” 
If such is the case among the greatest minds of all times, 
why should we wonder that the thinker in primitive so- 
ciety is strongly influenced by the current thought of his 
time? Unconscious and conscious imitation are factors 
influencing civilized society, not less than primitive so- 
ciety, as has been shown by G. Tarde, who has proved 
that primitive man, and civilized man as well, imitates 
not such actions only as are useful, and for the imitation 
of which logical causes may be given, but also others for 
the adoption or preservation of which no logical reason 
can be assigned. 
I think these considerations illustrate that the differ- 
ences between civilized man and primitive man are in 
Imany cases more apparent than real; that the social con- 
ditions, on account of their peculiar characteristics, easily 
convey the impression that the mind of primitive man 
acts in a way quite different from ours, while in reality 
the fundamental traits of the mind are the same. 
This does not mean that no differences exist or can be 
found, only that the method of investigation must be dif- 
ferent. It does not seem probable that the minds of 
races which show variations in their anatomical structure
-P-A-G-E-124
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE-MAN 11g 
should act in exactly the same manner. Differences of 
structure must be accompanied by differences of function, 
physiological as well as psychological; and, as we found 
clear evidence of difference in structure between the races, 
so we must anticipate that differences in mental character- 
istics will be found. Thus, a smaller size or lesser num- 
ber of nervous elements would probably entail loss of 
mental energy, and paucity of connections in the central 
nervous system would produce sluggishness of the mind. 
As stated before, it seems probable that some slight differ- 
ences of this character will be found between the white 
and the negro, for instance, but they have not yet been 
proved. As all structural differences are quantitative, we 
must expect to find mental differences to be of the same 
description; and as we found the variations in structure 
to overlap, so that many forms are common to individ- 
uals of all races, so we may expect that many individuals 
will not differ in regard to their faculty, while a statistical 
inquiry embracing whole races would reveal certain differ- 
ences. Furthermore, as certain anatomical traits are 
found to be hereditary in certain families, and hence in 
tribes, and perhaps even in peoples, in the same manner 
mental traits characterize certain families, and may pre- 
vail among tribes. It seems, however, an impossible
-P-A-G-E-125
116 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
' undertaking to separate in a satisfactory manner the 
social and the hereditary features. Galton’s attempt 
to establish the laws of hereditary genius, and later 
endeavors in the same direction, point out a way of treat- 
ment for these questions which will prove useful in so far 
as it opens a method of determining the influence of hered- 
ity upon mental qualities, 
After we have thus found that the alleged specific differ- 
ences between civilized and primitive man, so far as they 
are inferred from complex psychic responses, cam be re 
duced to the same fundamental psychical forms, we have 
the right to decline as unprofitable a discussion of the 
hereditary mental traits of various branches of the white 
race. Much has been said of the hereditary character- 
istics of the Jews, of the Gypsies, of the French and Irish, 
’ but I do not see that the external and social causes which 
have moulded the character of members of these people 
have ever been eliminated satisfactorily ; and, moreover, 
I do not see how this can be accomplished. A number 
of external factors that influence body and mind may 
easily be named, ~— climate, nutrition, occupation, —- 
but as soon as we enter into a consideration of social 
factors and mental conditions, we are unable to tel 
definitely what is cause and what is effect. An appar
-P-A-G-E-126
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN 117 
ently excellent discussion of external influences upon the 
character of a people has been given by A. Wernich in his 
description of the character of the Japanese. He finds” 
some of their peculiarities caused by the lack of vigor of 
the muscular and alimentary systems, which in their turn 
are due to improper nutrition; while he recognizes as he- 
reditary other physiological traits which influence themind. 
And still, how weak appear his conclusions, after the 
energy and endurance exhibited by the Japanese in their 
modern development and in their conflict with Russia ! 
Effects of malnutrition continued through many gen- 
erations might be expected to affect the mental life of 
the Bushmen and the Lapps (Virchow) ; and still, after 
the experience just quoted, we may well hesitate before we 
express any definite conclusions. 
It would seem, therefore, that we have no right to 
explain difference in mental attitude of different groups 
of people, particularly of closely related ones, as due to 
hereditary causes, until we have been able to prove that 
physiological and the correlated psychological traits are 
hereditary, regardless of social and natural environment 
A beginning in work of this kind has been made in the 
experimental investigations of school-children in regard 
to simple mental activities and simple physiological pro-
-P-A-G-E-127
118 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
cesses; in the work of the Cambridge Scientific Expedi- 
tion to Torres Strait (Rivers), in which the first systematic 
attempt has been made to study the simple psychical re- 
actions of primitive people ; and in the investigations car- 
ried on systematically by Dr. Woodworth on the primitive 
people exhibited at the World’s Fair of St. Louis. Up to 
this time the results are, on the whole, not favorable to 
the theory of the occurrence of very fundamental differ- 
ences between different races. 
One additional point of our inquiry into the organic 
basis of mental activity remains to be investigated; 
namely, the question, Has the organic basis for the faculty 
of man been improved by civilization, and particularly 
may that of primitive races be improved by this 
"agency? We must consider both the anatomical and the 
psychological aspects of this question. I have already 
pointed out that civilization causes anatomical changes 
of the same description as those accompanying the do- 
mestication of animals. Itislikely that changesof mental 
\ Character go hand in hand with them. The observed 
“anatomical changes are, however, limited to this group of 
‘phenomena. We cannot prove that any progressive 
changes of the human organism have taken place; and 
particularly no advance in the size or complexity of the
-P-A-G-E-128
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN 119 
structure of the central nervous system, caused by the 
cumulative effects of civilization, can be proved. 
The difficulty of proving a progress of faculty is still 
greater. It seems to me that the probable effect of civil- 
ization upon an evolution of human faculty has been 
much overestimated. The psychical changes which are 
the immediate consequence of domestication or civiliza- 
tion may be considerable. They are changes due to the 
influence of environment. It is doubtful, however, if any 
progressive changes, or such as are transmitted by hered- 
ity, have taken place. The number of generations sub- 
jected to this influence seems altogether too small. For 
large portions of Europe we cannot assume more than 
forty or fifty generations; and even this number is prob- 
ably considerably too high, inasmuch as in the middle 
ages the bulk of the population lived on very low stages 
of civilization. 
Besides this, the tendency of human multiplication is 
such, that the most highly cultured families tend to dis- 
appear, while others which have been less subjected to the 
influences regulating the life of the most cultured class 
take their place. Therefore it is much less likely that 
advance is hereditary than that it is transmitted by 
means of education.
-P-A-G-E-129
“0 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
Tn illustrating the improving effects of civilization 
through transmission, much weight is generally laid upon 
/ cases of relapse of individuals belonging to primitive 
races who have been educated. These relapses are in- 
terpreted as proofs of the inability of the child of a lower 
-Yace to adapt itself to our high civilization, even if the 
best advantages are given to it. It is true that a consid- 
erable number of such cases are on record. Among these 
I.will mention Darwin’s Fuegian, who lived in England 
for a few years and returned to his home, where he fell 
back into the ways of his primitive countrymen ; and 
the West Australian girl who was married to a white man, 
but suddenly fled to the bush after killing her husband, 
and resumed life with the natives. Cases of this kind are 
true, but not one of them has been described with suffi- 
cient detail, The social and mental conditions of the 
individual have never been subjected to a searching analy- 
sis, I should judge that even in extreme cases, notwith- 
standing their better education, their social position was 
always one of isolation, while the ties of consanguinity 
formed a connecting link with their uncivilized brethren. 
The power with which society holds us and does not give 
us a chance to step out of its limits cannot have acted as 
strongly upon them as upon us. On the other hand, the
-P-A-G-E-130

station obtained by many negroes in our civilization 
seems to me to have just as much weight as the few cases 
of relapse which have been collected with much care and 
diligence. I should place side by side with them the 
cases of white men who live alone among native tribes, 
and who sink almost invariably to a semi-barbarous po- 
sition, and the members of well-to-do families who prefer 
unbounded freedom to the fetters of society, and flee to 
the wilderness, where many lead a life in no way superior 
to that of primitive man. 
Tn the study of the behavior of members of foreign 
races educated in European society, we should also bear 
in mind the influence of habits of thought, feeling, and 
action acquired in early childhood, and of which no recol- 
lection is retained. If S. Freud is right in assuming that 
these forgotten incidents remain a living force throughout 
life, — the more potent, the more thoroughly they are 
forgotten, — we should have to conclude that many of the 
small traits of individuals which we ordinarily believe to 
be inherited are acquired by the influence of the individ- 
uals among whom the child spends the first five years of its 
life. All observations on the force of habit and the inten- 
sity of resistance to changes of habit are in favor of this 
theory.
-P-A-G-E-131
: 122 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
Our brief consideration of some of the mental activities 
-of man in civilized and in primitive society has led us to 
the conclusion that these functions of the human mind 
ire common to the whole of humanity. It may be well to 
state here, that, according to our present method of 
considering biological and psychological phenomena, 
we must assume that these have developed from lower 
conditions existing at a previous time, and that at one 
time there certainly must have been races and tribes in 
which the properties here described were not at all, or 
only slightly, developed; but it is also true that among 
the present races of man, no matter how primitive they 
may be in comparison with ourselves, these faculties are 
highly developed. 
It is not impossible that the degree of development of 
these functions may differ somewhat among different 
types of man; but I do not believe that we are able at the 
present time to form a just valuation of the hereditary 
“mental powers of the different races. A comparison n of 
their languages, customs, and activities suggests that 
their faculties may be unequally developed ; but the dif- 
ferences are not sufficient to justify us to ascribe ma- 
terially lower stages to some peoples, and higher stages to 
others. The conclusions reached from these considera-
-P-A-G-E-132
MENTAL TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE MAN 123 
tions are therefore, on the wholeynegative. We are not 
inclined to consider the mental organization of different 
races of man as differing in fundamental points. Al- 
though, therefore, the distribution of faculty among the 
races of man is far from being known, we can say this 
much: the average faculty of the white race is found to 
the same degree in a large proportion of individuals of 
all other races, and, although it is probable that some of 
these races may not produce as large a proportion of great 
men as our own race, there is no reason to suppose that 
they are unable to reach the level of civilization repre- 
sented by the bulk of our own people.
-P-A-G-E-133
  V. RACE AND LANGUAGE 
    (~ Yw the last chapter I tried to show that the principal 
"..) characteristics of the mind of primitive man occur among 
“ | “primitive tribes of all races, and that therefore the in- 
‘ference must not be drawn that these traits of the mind 
\ ate racial characteristics. ‘This negative conclusion, 
“which is based entirely on the consideration of a few se- 
_lected points that occur with great regularity in the descrip- 
tion of primitive tribes, does not give us, however, proof 
positive of the lack of all correlation between mental life 
and racial descent, and we must direct our attention to 
those cases in which an immediate relationship between 
the two may be and has been claimed. 
This has occurred particularly in regard to language 
and racial types. Indeed, the opinion is still held by 
some investigators that linguistic relationships and racial 
relationships are in a way interchangeable terms. An 
example illustrating this point of view may be seen in the 
long-continued discussions of the home of the ‘Aryan 
race,” in which the blond northwest European type is 
124, 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
RACE AND LANGUAGE 125 
identified with the ancient people among whom the Indo- 
European or Aryan languages developed. 
If it could be shown that distinct languages belong. to 
distinct racial types, and_that these languages _exhibit 
different levels of development or indicate different types 
of thought, we should have gained a sound basis which ee a a nn a 
would allow us to discuss the genius of each people as —" a, ee mmm 
teflected in its language If, furthermore, we could show < pecans hi etcrontassacir a 
that “certain “cultural types belong to certain races and 
are foreign to the genius of others, our conclusions would 
be founded on much firmer ground. 
Thus we are led to a consideration of the all-important 
questior: whether types, languages, and cultures are so ene eee nectar eA ALT, 
intimately connected that each human race is_ charac; terized by a certain combination of physical type, lan- 
guage, and culture. 
It is obvious, that, if this correlation should exist in a 
strict sense, attempts to classify mankind from any one 
of the three points of view would necessarily lead to the 
same results; in other words, each point of view could be 
used independently or in combination with the other ones, 
to study the relations between the different groups of 
mankind. As a matter of fact, attempts of this kind 
have often been made. A number of classifications of the
-P-A-G-E-135
126 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
races of man are based wholly on anatomical character- 
istics, yet often combined with geographical considera- 
tions; others are based on the discussion of a com- 
bination of anatomical and cultural traits which are 
considered as characteristic of certain groups of man- 
kind; while still others are based primarily on the 
study of the languages spoken by people representing a 
certain anatomical type. 
The attempts that have thus been made have led to 
entirely different results (Topinard). Blumenbach, one 
of the first scientists who attempted to classify mankind, 
distinguished five races, —the Caucasian, Mongolian, 
Ethiopian, American, and Malay. It is fairly clear that 
this classification is based as much on geographical as on 
anatomical considerations, although the description of 
each race is primarily an anatomical one. Cuvier dis- 
tinguished three races, — the white, yellow, and black. 
Huxley proceeded more strictly on a biological basis. 
He combined part of the Mongolian and American races 
of Blumenbach into one, assigned part of the South Asi- 
atic peoples to the Australian type, and subdivided the 
European race into a dark and a light division. The nu- 
merical preponderance of the European types evidently 
led him to make finer distinctions in this race, which he
-P-A-G-E-136
RACE AND LANGUAGE 127 
divided into the xanthochroic or blond, and melano- 
chroic or dark races. It would be easy to make subdivi- 
sions of equal value in other races. Still clearer is the 
influence of cultural points of view in classifications like 
those of Gobineau and of Klemm, the latter of whom dis- 
tinguished the active and passive races according to the 
cultural achievements of the various types of man. 
The most typical attempt to classify mankind from a 
consideration of both anatomical and linguistic points of 
view is that of Friedrich Miiller, who takes as the basis of 
his primary divisions the form of hair, while all the minor 
divisions are based on linguistic considerations. 
An attempt to correlate the numerous classifications 
uiley COANION and Contradiction; so that we are led 
tay not be closely and permanently connected. We 
must therefore consider the actual development of these 
various traits among the existing races. 
At the present period we may observe many cases in 
which_a complete change of language and culture takes - 
place without a corresponding change in physical type. 
This is true, for instance among the North American 
hegroes, a people by descent largely African; in culture see eee ee
-P-A-G-E-137
128 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
and language, however, essentially European. While if 
is true that certain survivals of African ure an 
guage are found among our American negroes, their 
ture is “essentially tat of he uneducated of 
peopteamong whom they live, and their language is on 
She WISE HERG AH eect dh saute a 
prevalent language in various parts of the continent. It 
might be objected that the transportation of the African 
race to America was an artificial one, and that in earlier 
timésextended migrations and transplantations of this 
kind have not taken place. 
" [the history of mediaeval Europe, however, demonstrates 
that extended changes in language and culture have 
taken place many times without corresponding changes 
in blood, 
Recent investigations of the physical types of Europe 
have shown with great clearness that the distribution of 
types has remained the same for a long period] Without 
considering details, it may be said that an Alpine type can 
easily be distinguished from a North European type of 
the one hand, and a South European type on the other 
(Ripley). The Alpine type appears fairly uniform over a 
large territory, no matter what language may be spoken a

and what national culture may prevail in the partic- 
war district. The Central European Frenchmen, Ger- 
mans, Italians, and Slavs are so nearly of the same 
type, that we may safely assume a considerable degree 
of blood-relationship, notwithstanding their linguistic 
differences. 
[instances of similar kind, in which we find permanence 
of blood with far-reaching modifications of language and 
culture, are found in other parts of the world. As an ex- 
ample may be mentioned the Veddah of Ceylon, a people 
fundamentally different in type from the neighboring 
Singhalese, whose language they seem to have adopted, 
and from whom they have also evidently borrowed a 
number of cultural traits (Sarasin). Still other examples 
are the Japanese of the northern part of Japan, who are 
undoubtedly, to a considerable extent, Ainu in blood 
(Balz); and the Yukaghir of Siberia, who, while retain- 
ing to a great extent the old blood, have been assimilated 
in culture and language by the neighboring Tungus 
(Jochelson). 
While it Is therefore evident that in many cases a people, 
without undergoing a considerable change in type by 
mixture, has changed completely its language and cul- 
ture, still other cases may be adduced in which it can be

shown that a people has retained its language while 
undergoing material changes in blood and culture, or in 
both) fAs an example of this may be mentioned the 
Magyar of Europe, who have retained their old language, 
but have become mixed with people speaking Indo-Euro- 
pean languages, and who have, to all intents and purposes, 
adopted European culture)? 
Similar conditions must have prevailed among the Atha- 
pascans, one of the great linguistic families of North 
America. The great body of people speaking languages 
belonging to this linguistic stock live in the northwestem 
part of America, while other dialects are spoken by small 
tribes in California, and still others by a large body of 
people in Arizona and New Mexico.! The relationship 
between all these dialects is so close that they must be 
considered as branches of one large group, and it must be 
assumed that all of them have sprung from a language 
once spoken over a continuous area. At the present time 
the people speaking these languages differ fundamentally 
in type, the inhabitants of the Mackenzie River region 
being quite different from the tribes of California, and 
these, again, differing from the tribes of New Mexico

(Boas). The forms of culture in these different regions 
are also quite distinct: the culture of the California 
Athapascans resembles that of other Californian tribes, 
while the culture of the Athapascans of New Mexico and 
Arizona is influenced by that of other peoples of that area 
(Goddard). It seents most plausible to assume in this 
case that branches of this stock migrated from one part of 
this large area to another, where they intermingled with 
the neighboring people, and thus changed their physical 
characteristics, while at the same time they retained 
their speech. Without historical evidence, this process 
cannot, of course, be proved. 
These two phenomena, — retention of type with 
change of language, and retention of language with change 
of type, — apparently opposed to each other, are still 
very closely related, and in many cases go hand in hand.) 
[An example of this is, for instance, the distribution of the 
Arabs along the north coast of Africa. On the whole, the 
Arab element has retained its language; but at the same 
time intermarriages with the native races were common, 
so that the descendants of the Arabs have often retained 
their old language, and have changed their type) (On the 
other hand, the natives have to a certain extent given up 
their own languages, but have continued to intermarry

among themselves, and have thus preserved their typal 
So far as any change of this kind is connected with inter- 
mixture, both types of changes must always occur at the 
same time, and will be classed as a change of type ora 
change of language, as our attention is directed to the one 
people or the other, or, in some cases, as the one or the 
other change is more pronounced. Cases of complete 
assimilation without any mixture of the people involved 
seem to be rare, if not entirely absent. 
ases of permanence of type and language and of 
change of culture are much more numerous. As a mat 
ter of fact, the whole historical development of Europe, 
from prehistoric times on, is one endless series of examples 
of this process, which seems to be much easier, since a& 
similation of cultures occurs everywhere without actual 
blood-mixture, as an effect of imitation. Proof of difft- 
sion of cultural elements may be found in every single 
cultural area which covers a district in which many la0- 
guages are spoken. In North America, California offersa 
good example of this kind; for here many languages ate 
spoken, and there is a certain degree of differentiation of 
type, but at the same time a considerable uniformity of 
culture prevails (Kroeber). Another case in point is 
the coast of New Guinea, where, notwithstanding strong
-P-A-G-E-142
RACE AND LANGUAGE 133 
local differentiations, a certain fairly characteristic type 
of culture prevails, which goes hand in hand with a strong 
differentiation of languages. Among more highly civil- 
ized peoples, the whole area which is under the influence 
of Chinese culture might be given as an example. 
[These considerations make it fairly clear that, at least 
at the present time, anatomical type, language, and cul- 
ture have not necessarily the same fates; that a people 
may remain constant in type and language, and change 
in culture; that it may remain constant in type, but 
change in language; or that it may remain constant in 
language, and change in type and culture. It is obvious, 
therefore, that attempts to classify mankind, based on 
the present distribution of type, language, and culture, 
must lead to different results, according to the point of 
view taken; that a classification based primarily on type 
alone will lead to a system which represents more or less 
accurately the blood-relationships of the people, which 
do not need to coincide with their cultural relationships ; 
and that in the same way classifications based on lan- 
guage and culture do not need at all to coincide with a 
biological classification, 
Tf this be true, then a problem like the Aryan problem, 
to which I referred before, really does not exist, because
-P-A-G-E-143
134 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
the problem is primarily a linguistic one, relating to the 
history of the Aryan languages; and the assumption that 
a certain definite people whose members have always been 
related by blood must have been the carriers of this lan- 
guage throughout history, and the other assumption, that 
a certain cultural type must have always belonged to this 
people, — are purely arbitrary ones, and not in accord 
with the observed facts. 
Nevertheless it must be granted that in a theoretical 
consideration of the history of the types of mankind, of 
languages, and of cultures, we are Jed back to the assump- 
tion of early conditions, during which each type was much 
more isolated from the rest of mankind than it is at the 
present time. For this reason the culture and the lan- 
guage belonging to a single type must have been much 
more sharply separated from those of other types than we 
find them to be at the present period. It is true that such 
a condition has nowhere been observed; but the knowl 
edge of historical developments almost compels us to 
assume its existence at a very early period in the devel- 
opment of mankind. If this is true, the question would 
arise, whether an isolated group at an early period 
was necessarily characterized by a single type, a single 
language, and a single culture, or whether in such a group
-P-A-G-E-144
RACE AND LANGUAGE 135 
different types, different languages, and different cultures 
may have been represented. 
The historical development of mankind would afford a 
simpler and clearer picture if we were justified in assum- 
ing that in primitive communities the three phenomena 
had been intimately associated. No proof, however, of 
such an assumption, can be given. On the contrary, the 
present distribution of languages, as compared with the 
distribution of types, makes it plausible that even at the 
earliest times the biological units may have been wider 
than the linguistic units, and presumably also wider than 
the cultural units. I believe it may be safely said that all 
over the world the biological unit — disregarding 
minute local differences — is much larger than the lin- 
guistic unit; in other words, that groups of men who are 
so closely related in bodily appearance that we must con- 
sider them as representatives of the same variety of man- 
kind, embrace a much larger number of individuals than 
the number of men speaking languages which we know to 
be genetically related. Examples of this kind may be 
given from many parts of the world. Thus, the Euro- 
pean race —- including under this term roughly all those 
individuals who are without hesitation classed by us as 
members of the white race — would include peoples

   éaking Indo-European, Basque, and Ural-Altaic lan- 
guages. West African negroes would represent individuals 
ofa certain negro type, but speaking the most diverse 
Janguages; and the same would be true, among Asiatic 
. types, of Siberians ; among American types, of part of 
fe “the Californian Indians. 
‘So far as our historical evidence goes, there is no reason 
to believe that the number of distinct languages hasat any 
time been less than it is now. On the contrary, all out 
evidence goes to show that the number of apparently 
unrelated languages was much greater in earlier times 
than at present. On the other hand, the number of types 
that have presumably become extinct seems to be rathet 
small, so that there is no reason to suppose that at an 
early period there should have been a nearer correspond- 
ence between the number of distinct linguistic and ana 
tomical types (Gna we are thus led to the conclusion that 
presumably at an ‘early time each human type may have 
existed in a number of small isolated groups, each of 
which may have possessed a language and culture of its

result of a gradual pressing-back of remnants of tribes 
into inaccessible districts, but appears rather as a survival 
of an older general condition of mankind, when every 
continent was inhabited by smaller groups of people 
speaking distinct languages. The present conditions 
would have developed through the gradual extinction of 
many of the old stocks and their absorption or extinction 
by others, which thus came to occupy a more extended 
territory. 
However this may be, the probabilities are decidedly in 
favor of the assumption that there is no necessity to as- 
sume that originally each language and culture were 
confined to a single type, or that each type and culture 
were confined to one language; in short, that there has 
been at any time a close correlation between these three 
phenomena. 
[the assumption that type, language, and culture were 
originally closely correlated would entail the further as- 
sumption that these three traits developed approximately 
at the same period, and that they developed conjointly 
for a considerable length of time}, This assumption does 
not seem by any means plausible. The fundamental 
types of man which are represented in the negroid race 
and in the mongoloid race must have been differentiated

long before the formation of those forms of speech that 
are now recognized in the linguistic families of the world. 
I think that even the differentiation of the more impor- 
tant subdivisions of the great races antedates the forma- 
tion of the existing linguistic families. At any rate, the 
biological differentiation and the formation of speech 
were, at this early period, subject to the same causes that 
are acting upon them now, and our whole experience 
shows that these causes may bring about great changes in 
language much more rapidly than in the human body. 
~ In this consideration lies the principal reason for the 
=: theory of lack of correlation of type and language, even 
during the period of formation of types and of linguistic 
families! 
What is true of language is obviously even more true    
    “(Of culture. In other words, if a certain type of man 
migrated over a considerable area before its language 
assumed the form which can now be traced in related lin- 
. guistic groups, and before its culture assumed the definite 
type the further development of which can now be recog’ 
1This must not be understood to mean that every primitive language 
is in-a constant state of rapid modification. There are many evidences 
of a great permanence of languages. When, however, owing to certain 
outer or inner causes, changes set in, they are apt to bring about 4 
thorough modification of the form of speech.
-P-A-G-E-148
RACE AND LANGUAGE 139 
nized, there would be no possibility of ever discovering a 
correlation of type, language, and culture, even if it had 
ever existed; but it is quite possible that such correlation 
has really never occurred. 
It is quite conceivable that a certain racial type may 
have scattered over a considerable area during a formative 
period of speech, and that the languages which developed 
among the various groups of this racial type came to be so 
different that it is now impossible to prove them to be 
genetically related. In the same way, new developments 
of culture may have taken place which are so entirely 
disconnected with older types that the older genetic rela- 
tionships, even if they existed, can no longer be discovered. 
If we adopt this point of view, and thus eliminate the 
hypothetical assumption of correlation between primitive 
type, primitive language, and primitive culture, we recog- 
nize that any attempt at classification which includes 
more than one of these traits cannot be consistent. 
It may be added that the general term “culture,” 
which has been used here, may be subdivided from a con- 
siderable number of points of view; and different results 
again might be expected when we consider the inventions, 
the types of social organization, or beliefs, as leading 
points of view in our classification.
-P-A-G-E-149
140 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
After we have thus shown that language, culture, and 
type cannot be considered as constantly associated, and 
after we have recognized that the same type of man has 
developed distinct languages, the question still remains 
open, whether the languages developed by any one stock 
bear marks of superiority or inferiority. It has been 
claimed, for instance, that the highly developed inflected 
languages of Europe are much superior to the cumber- 
some agglutinative or polysynthetic languages of north- 
em Asia and of America (Gabelentz). We have also 
been told that lack of phonetic discrimination, lack of 
power of abstraction, are characteristics of primitive 
languages. It is important to show whether these traits 
"are really associated with any languages of primitive man. 
In a way this consideration leads us back to the study of 
alleged mental characteristics of distinct human types. 
The view of the lack of phonetic differentiation is 
based on the fact that certain sounds of primitive Jan- 
guages are interpreted by the European sometimes as one 
of our familiar sounds, sometimes as another ; they have 
been called alternating sounds. A better knowledge of 
_ Phonetics has shown in all these cases, however, that the 
sounds are quite definite, but that owing to the man- 
ner of their production they are intermediate between
-P-A-G-E-150
RACE AND LANGUAGE 141 
sounds familiar to us. Thus an m produced by a very 
weak closing of the lips, and with half-open nose, sounds 
to our ear a little like m, a little like }, and a little like w; 
and according to slight accidental changes, it is sometimes 
heard as one of these sounds, sometimes as another, with- 
out, however, being in reality more variable than our m. 
Cases of this kind are quite numerous, but it would be a 
misinterpretation to adduce them as proof of lack of defi- 
niteness of the sound of primitive languages (Boas). In 
fact, it would seem that limitation in the number of 
sounds is necessary in each language in order to make 
possible rapid communication. If the number of sounds 
that are used in any particular language were unlimited, 
the accuracy with which the movements of the compli- 
cated mechanism required for producing the sounds are 
performed, would presumably be lacking; and conse- 
quently rapidity and accuracy of pronunciation, and with 
them the possibility of accurate interpretation of the 
Sounds heard, would be difficult or even impossible. On 
the other hand, limitation of the number of sounds brings 
it about that the movements required in the production 
of each become automatic; that the association between 
the sound heard and the muscular movements, and that 
between the auditory impression and the muscular sensa-
-P-A-G-E-151
142 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
tion of the articulation, become firmly fixed. Thus it 
would seem that limited phonetic resources are necessary 
for easy communication. 
The second point that is often brought up to character- 
ize primitive languages is the lack of power of classifica- 
tion and abstraction. Here, again, we are easily misled 
by our habit of using the classifications of our own 
language, and considering these, therefore, as the most 
natural ones, and by overlooking the principles of classi- 
fication used in the languages of primitive people. 
It may be well to make clear to our minds what con- 
stitutes the elements of all languages. It is a fundamental 
‘and common trait of articulate speech that the groups of 
sounds which are uttered serve to convey ideas, and each 
group of sounds has a fixed meaning. Languages differ 
not only in the character of their constituent phonetic 
elements and sound clusters, but also in the groups of 
- ideas that find expression in fixed phonetic groups. 
The total number of possible combinations of phonetic 
-elements is also unlimited, but only a limited number are 
used. to express ideas. This implies that the total num- 
ber of ideas that are expressed by distinct phonetic 
groups is limited in number. We will call these phonetic 
groups “word-stems.”
-P-A-G-E-152
RACE AND LANGUAGE 143 
Since the total range of personal experience which lan- | 
guage serves to express is infinitely varied, and its whole 
scope must be expressed by a limited number of word- 
stems, it is obvious that an extended classification of ex- 
periences must underlie all articulate speech. 
This coincides with a fundamental trait of human 
thought. In our actual experience no two sense-impres- 
sions or emotional states are identical. Nevertheless we 
classify them, according to their similarities, in wider or 
narrower groups, the limits of which may be determined 
from a variety of points of view. Notwithstanding their 
individual differences, we recognize in our experiences 
common elements, and consider them as related or even 
as the same, provided a sufficient number of characteristic 
traits belong to them in common. Thus the limitation 
of the number of phonetic groups expressing distinct 
ideas is an expression of the psychological fact that many 
different individual experiences appear to us asrepresenta- 
tives of the same category of thought. . 
As an instance we may mention the color terms of 
different languages. Although the number of shades of 
color that may be distinguished is very great, only a 
small number are designated by special terms. The 
number of these terms has considerably increased in
-P-A-G-E-153
144 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
recent times. In many primitive languages the group- 
ings of yellow, green, and blue do not agree with ours. 
Often yellow and the yellowish-greens are combined in 
one group; green and blue, in another. The typical 
feature which occurs everywhere is the use of one term 
for a large group of similar sensations. 
This trait of human thought and speech may be com- 
pared in a certain manner to the limitation of the whole 
series of possible articulating movements by selection of a 
limited number of habitual movements. If the whole 
mass of concepts, with all their variants, were expressed 
in language by entirely heterogeneous and unrelated 
sound-complexes or word-stems, a condition would arise 
in which closely related ideas would not show their 
Telationship by the corresponding relationship of their 
sound-symbols, and an infinitely large number of distinct 
word-stems would be required for expression. If this 
Were the case, the association between an idea and its 
representative word-stem would not become sufficiently 
Stable to be Teproduced automatically without reflection 
at any given moment. In the same way as the automatic 
and rapid use of articulations has brought it about that 
a limited number of articulations only, each with limited 
variability, and a limited number of sound-clusters, have
-P-A-G-E-154
RACE AND LANGUAGE 145 
been selected from the infinitely large range of possible 
articulations and clusters of articulations, so the infi- 
nitely large number of ideas have been reduced by classi- 
fication to a lesser number, which by constant use have 
established firm associations, and which can be used 
automatically. 
It seems important at this point of our considerations 
to emphasize the fact that the groups of ideas expressed. 
by specific word-stems show very material differences in 
different languages, and do not conform by any means 
to the same principles of classification. To take the 
example of English, we find that the idea of “water” 
is expressed in a great variety of forms: one term serves 
to express water as a liquid; another one, water in the 
form of a large expanse (lake); others, water as running 
in a large body or in a small body (river and brook); 
still other terms express water in the form of rain, dew, 
Wave, and foam. It is perfectly conceivable that this 
variety of ideas, each of which is expressed by a single 
independent term in English, might be expressed in other 
languages by derivations from the same term. 
Another example of the same kind, the words for 
“snow” in Eskimo, may be given. Here we find one 
word expressing “‘snow on the ground;” another one, 
L
-P-A-G-E-155
146 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
“falling snow ;”’ a third one, “drifting snow;” a fourth 
one, “a snowdrift.” 
In the same language the seal in different conditions is 
expressed by a variety of terms. One word is the general 
term for “‘seal;” another one signifies the “seal basking 
in the sun;” a third one, a “seal floating on a piece of 
ice;” not to mention the many names for the seals of 
different ages and for male and female. 
As an example of the manner in which terms that we 
express by independent words are grouped together under 
one concept, the Dakota language may be selected. The 
terms “to kick,” “to tie in bundles,” “to bite,” “to be 
near to,” “to pound,” are all derived from the common 
element meaning “‘to grip,” which holds them together, 
: While we use distinct words for expressing the various 
ideas. 
It seems fairly evident that the selection of such simple 
terms must to a certain extent depend upon the chief 
interests of a people; and where it is necessary to dis- 
tinguish a certain phenomenon in many aspects, which in 
‘the life of the people play each an entirely independent 
role, many independent words may develop, while in 
other cases modifications of a single term may suffice. 
Thus it happens that each language, from the point of
-P-A-G-E-156
RACE AND LANGUAGE 147 
view of another language, may be arbitrary in its classifi- 
cations; that what appears as a single simple idea in one 
languagemay becharacterized by a series of distinct word- 
stems in another. 
The tendency of a language to express a complex idea 
by asingle term has been styled “holophrasis ” (Powell), 
and it appears therefore that every language may be holo- 
phrastic from the point of view of another language. 
Holophrasis can hardly be taken as a fundamental char- 
acteristic of primitive languages. 
We have seen before that some kind of classification 
of expression must be found in every language. This 
classification of ideas into groups, each of which is ex- 
pressed by an independent word-stem, makes it necessary 
that concepts which are not readily rendered by a single 
stem should be expressed by combinations or by modi- 
fications of the elementary stems in accordance with the 
elementary ideas to which the particular idea is reduced. 
This classification, and the necessity of expressing 
certain experiences by means of other related ones, — 
which, by limiting one another, define the special idea to 
be expressed,— entail the presence of certain formal 
elements which determine the relations of the single word- 
stems. If each idea could be expressed by a single word-
-P-A-G-E-157
148 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
stem, languages without form would be possible. Since, 
however, ideas must be expressed by being reduced to a 
number of related ideas, the kinds of relation become im- 
portant elements in articulate speech ; and it follows that 
all languages must contain formal elements, and that 
‘their number must be the greater, the less the number of 
elementary word-stems that define special ideas. Ina 
language which commands a very large, fixed vocabulary, 
the number of formal elements may become quite small. 
After we have thus seen that all languages require and 
contain certain classifications and formal elements, we will 
turn to a consideration of the relation between language 
and thought. It has been claimed that the conciseness 
and clearness of thought of a people depend to a great 
extent upon their language. The ease with which in our 
Modern European languages we express wide abstract 
ideas by a single term, and the facility with which wide 
generalizations are cast into the frame of a simple sen- 
tence, have been claimed to be one of the fundamental 
conditions of the clearness of our concepts, the logical 
force of our thought, and the precision with which we 
eliminate in our thoughts irrelevant details. Apparently 
this view has much in its favor. When we compare 
modern English with some of those Indian languages which
-P-A-G-E-158
RACE AND LANGUAGE 149 
are most concrete in their formative expression, the con- 
trast is striking. When we say, ‘“‘The eye is the organ of 
sight,” the Indian may not be able to form the expres- 
sion “the eye,”” but may have to define that the eye of a 
person or of an animal is meant. Neither may the In- 
dian be able to generalize readily the abstract idea of an 
eye as the representative of the whole class of objects, but 
may have to specialize by an expression like “this eye 
here.” Neither may he be able to express by a single 
term the idea of “organ,” but may have to specify it by 
an expression like “instrument of seeing,” so that the 
whole sentence might assume a form like “an indefinite 
person’s eye is his means of seeing.” Still it will be recog- 
nized that in this more specific form the general idea may 
be well expressed. It seems very questionable in how far 
the restriction of the use of certain grammatical forms can 
teally be conceived as a hindrance in the formulation of 
generalized ideas. It seems much more likely that the 
lack of these forms is due to the lack of their need. Primi- 
tive man, when conversing with his fellow-man, is not in 
the habit of discussing abstract ideas, His interests 
centre around the occupations of his daily life; and where 
Philosophic problems are touched upon, they appear 
either in relation to definite individuals or in the more
-P-A-G-E-159
150 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
or less anthropomorphic forms of religious beliefs. Dis- 
courses on qualities without connection with the object 
to which the qualities belong, or of activities or states dis- 
connected from the idea of the actor or the subject being 
in a certain state, will hardly occur in primitive speech. 
Thus the Indian will not speak of goodness as such, al- 
though he may very well speak of the goodness of a per- 
son. He will not speak of a state of bliss apart from the 
person who is in such a state. He will not refer to the 
power of seeing without designating an individual who has 
such power. Thus it happens that in languages in which 
the idea of possession is expressed by elements subordi- 
nated to nouns, all abstract terms appear always with pos- 
sessive elements. It is, however, perfectly conceivable 
that an Indian trained in philosophic thought would 
proceed to free the underlying nominal forms from the 
possessive elements, and thus reach abstract forms 
strictly corresponding to the abstract forms of our mod- 
em languages. I have made this experiment, for instance, 
in one of the languages of Vancouver Island, in which 
no abstract term ever occurs without its possessive ele- 
ments. After some discussion, I found it perfectly easy 
to develop the idea of the abstract term in the mind of the 
Indian, who stated that the word without a possessive
-P-A-G-E-160
RACE AND LANGUAGE I5r 
pronoun gives good sense, although it is not used idio- 
matically. I succeeded, for instance, in this manner, in 
isolating the terms for “love” and “pity,” which ordi-- . 
narily occur only in possessive forms, like “his love for 
him” or “my pity for you.’ That this view is correct, 
may also be observed in languages in which possessive 
elements appear'as independent forms; as, for instance, 
in the Siouan languages. In these, pure abstract terms 
are quite common. 
There is also evidence that other specializing elements, 
which are so characteristic of many Indian languages, 
may be dispensed with when, for one reason or another, it 
seems desirable to generalize a term. To use an example 
of a western language,! the idea “to be seated” is al- 
most always expressed with an inseparable suffix express- 
ing the place in which a person is seated, as “seated 
on the floor of the house, on the ground, on the beach, on 
a pile of things,” or “on a round thing,” etc. When, 
however, for some reason, the idea of the state of sitting 
is to be emphasized, a form may be used which expresses 
simply “being in a sitting posture.” In this case, also, 
the device for generalized expression is present ; but the 
opportunity for its application arises seldom, or perhaps 
1The Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island.
-P-A-G-E-161
152 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
never. I think what is true in these cases is true of. the 
structure of every single language. The fact that gener- 
alized forms of expression are not used, does not prove in- 
ability to form them, but it merely proves that the mode 
of life of the people is such that they are not required; 
that they would, however, develop just as soon as needed. 
This point of view is also corroborated by a study 
of the numeral systems of primitive languages. As is 
well known, many languages exist in which the nu- 
merals do not exceed two or three. It has been inferred 
from this that the people speaking these languages are not 
capable of forming the concept of higher numbers. 1 
think this interpretation of the existing conditions is 
quite erroneous. People like the South American In- 
dians (among whom these defective numeral systems are 
found), or like the Eskimo (whose old system of num- 
bers probably did not exceed ten), are presumably not in 
need of higher numerical expressions, because there ate 
not many objects that they have to count. On the other 
hand, just as soon as these same people find themselves 
in contact with civilization, and when they acquire 
standards of value that have to be counted, they adopt 
with perfect ease higher numerals from other languages, 
and develop a more or less perfect system of counting.
-P-A-G-E-162
RACE AND LANGUAGE 153 
This does not mean that every individual who in the 
course of his life has never made use of higher numerals 
would acquire more complex systems readily; but the 
tribe as a whole seems always to be capable of adjusting 
itself to the needs of counting. It must be borne in mind 
that counting does not become necessary until objects 
are considered in such generalized form that their in- 
dividualities are entirely lost sight of. For this reason 
it is possible that even a person who owns a herd of domes- 
ticated animals may know them by name and by their 
characteristics, without ever desiring to count them. 
Members of a war expedition may be known by name, 
and may not be counted. In short, there is no proof that 
the lack of the use of numerals is in any way connected 
with the inability to form the concepts of higher numbers 
when needed. 
If we want to form a correct judgment of the influence 
that language exerts over thought, we ought to bear in 
mind that our European languages, as found at the 
present time, have been moulded to a great extent by the 
abstract thought of philosophers. Terms like “essence” 
and “existence,” many of which are now commonly used, 
are by origin artificial devices for expressing the results 
of abstract thought. In this way they would resemble
-P-A-G-E-163
154 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
the artificial, unidiomatic abstract terms that may be 
formed in primitive languages. 
Thus it would seem that the obstacles to generalized 
thought inherent in the form of a language are of minor 
importance only, and that presumably language alone 
would not prevent a people from advancing to more gen- 
eralized forms of thinking, if the general state of their 
culture should require expression of such thought; that 
under these conditions, the language would be moulded 
rather by the cultural state. It does not seem likely, 
therefore, that there is any direct relation between the 
culture of a tribe and the language they speak, except inso 
far as the form of the language will be moulded by the 
state of culture, but not in so far as a certain state of cul- 
ture is conditioned by morphological traits of the language. 
Thus we have found that language does not furnish 
the much-looked-for means of discovering differences in 
the mental status of different races.
-P-A-G-E-164
VI. THE UNIVERSALITY OF CULTURAL 
TRAITS 
THERE remains one question to be discussed; namely, 
whether some tribes represent a lower cultural stage 
when looked at from an evolutionary point of view. 
Our previous discussion has shown that almost all at- . 
tempts to characterize the mind of primitive man do not ” 
take into account racial affiations, but only stages of 
culture, and the results of our efforts to determine char- 
acteristic racial differences have been of doubtful value. 
It appears, therefore, that modern anthropologists not 
only proceed on the assumption of the generic unity of the 
mind of man, but tacitly disregard quantitative differ- 
ences which may very well occur. We may therefore 
base our further considerations on the theory of the 
similarity of mental functions in all races. 
Observation has shown, however, that not only emo- 
tions, intellect, and will-power of man are alike every- 
where, but that much more detailed similarities in 
thought and action occur among the most diverse peoples. 
155
-P-A-G-E-165
156 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
These similarities are apparently so detailed and far- 
reaching, that Bastian was led to speak of the appalling 
monotony of the fundamental ideas of mankind all over - 
the globe. 
Thus it has been found that the metaphysical notions 
of man may be reduced to a few types which are of uni- 
versal distribution. The same is the case in regard to 
the forms of society, laws, and inventions. 
Furthermore, the most intricate and apparently illogi- 
cal ideas, and the most curious and complex customs, ap- 
pear among a few tribes here and there in such a manner 
that the assumption of a common historical origin is ex- 
cluded. When studying the culture of any one tribe, 
more or less close analogues of single traits of its culture 
may be found among a great diversity of peoples. In- 
stances of such analogues have been collected to a vast 
extent by Tylor, Spencer, Frazer, Bastian, Andree, Post, 
and many others, so that it is not necessary to give here 
any detailed proof of this fact. A few examples will 
suffice. Among the more general ideas, I may mention * 
the belief in a land of the souls of the deceased, located in 
the west, and reached by crossing a river, — known to all 
of us from Greek mythology, but well known also among 
the native tribes of America and Polynesia. Another
-P-A-G-E-166
UNIVERSALITY OF CULTURAL TRAITS 157 
example is the idea of a multiplicity of worlds, — one or 
more spanned over us, others stretching under us, the 
central one the home of man; the upper or lower, the 
home of the gods and happy souls; the other, the home 
of the unhappy, — an idea familiar to us from the po- 
sitions of heaven and hell, but no less developed in India, 
Siberia, and arctic America. The idea of the ability of 
man to acquire protecting guardian spirits offers another 
example. Another domain of mental life furnishes 
equally striking instances. (Che universal knowledge of 
the art of producing fire by friction, the boiling of food, 
‘the knowledge of the drill, illustrate the universality 
of certain inventions. Still other phenomena of this 
class are furnished by certain elementary features of 
grammatical structure, like the use of expressions for 
the three persons of the pronoun, — namely, the speaker, 
the person addressed, and the person spoken of, —or 
the frequent distinction of singularity and plurality. 
Special curious analogues that occur in regions far 
apart may be exemplified by such beliefs as the possibil- 
ity of foretelling the future by the cracking of burnt 
bones (Andree), the occurrence of the Phaéton legend in 
Greece and northwest America (Boas), the bleeding of 
animals by the use of a small bow and arrow (Heger), the
-P-A-G-E-167
“158. ‘THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
development of astrology in the Old World and the New, 
the similarity of basketry technique and design in Africa 
and America (Dixon), the invention of the blow-gun in 
America and Malaysia. 
These examples will suggest the classes of phenomena 
to which I refer. It follows from these observations that 
when we find analogues of single traits of culture among 
distinct peoples, the presumption is, not that there has 
been a common historical source, but that they have 
arisen independently; and the theory suggests itself 
that a common cause accounts for the constant recur- 
tence of these phenomena among the most varied mem- 
"bers of mankind, no matter to what race they may belong. 
Further investigation shows that these customs are not 
quite evenly distributed, but that certain more or less 
intimate associations exist between the industrial develop- 
ment, social organization, and religious beliefs of the 
peoples of the world; so that, among people. with simple 
industries, thoughts are found that differ somewhat from 
those of people who have advanced further in the develop- 
ment of material culture. ft has also been noticed that 
a telation exists between the ethnic life of a people and the 
geographical environment that favors or hinders their 
material development. }
-P-A-G-E-168
UNIVERSALITY OF CULTURAL TRAITS 159 
The common cause for this similarity of actions and 
beliefs of peoples and tribes widely separated, beloriging 
to different races, and being on certain stages of cultural 
development, has been looked for in several ways. 
Some investigators — like Ratzel, and in older times 
Karl Ritter and Guyot — have laid particular stress upon 
the influence of geographical environment upon the life 
of man, and emphasize those similarities which appear 
in similar types of environment. 
Others believe that many of the customs, beliefs, and 
inventions common to people who live in regions far 
‘apart are an old heritage derived from the earliest times, 
when mankind was still confined to a small part of the 
earth’s surface. 
Still others have tried to isolate the most generalized 
forms of similar ethnic phenomena. Bastian, the most 
important representative of this group of investigators, 
has called these forms “elementary ideas,” and has tried 
to show that they are unexplainable. 
Psychologists finally have endeavored to explain the 
Similarities by an analysis of mental processes. 
It seems necessary to discuss these four methods of 
approach a little more fully. 
It is not difficult to illustrate the important influence
-P-A-G-E-169
160 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
of geographical environment upon forms of inventions. 
The variety of habitations used by tribes of different areas 
offer an example of its influence. The snow house of the 
Eskimo, the bark wigwam of the Indian, the cave dwelling 
.of the tribes of the desert, may serve as illustrations of the 
way in which protection against exposure is attained, in 
accordance with the available materials. Other exam- 
plés may be found in the forms of more special inventions: 
as in the complex bows of the Eskimo, which seem to be 
due to the lack of long elastic material for bow-staves; 
and in the devices for securing elasticity of the bow where 
elastic wood is difficult to obtain, or where greatet 
Strength of the bow is required; and in the skin recep- 
tacles and baskets which often serve as substitutes for 
pottery among tribes without permanent habitation. 
We may also mention the dependence of the location of 
villages upon the food-supply, and of communication 
upon available trails or upon the facility of communica- 
tion by water. Environmental influences appear in the 
territorial limits of certain tribes or peoples, as well as in 
the distribution and density of population. Even in 
the more complex forms of. the mental life, the influence 
of environment may be found; as in nature myths ex- 
plaining the activity of volcanoes or the presence of curi-
-P-A-G-E-170
UNIVERSALITY OF CULTURAL TRAITS 161 
ous land forms, or in beliefs and customs relating to the 
local characterization of the seasons. . 
When, in our theories, we lay stress alone on observa- 
tions which show that man is dependent upon geographi- 
cal environment, and upon the assumption of a sameness 
or similarity of the mind in all races of mankind, we are 
necessarily led to the conclusion that the same environ- 
ment will produce the same cultural results everywhere. 
This is obviously not true, for the forms of culture of 
peoples living in the same kind of environment show often 
marked differences. I do not need to illustrate this by 
comparing the American settler with the North American 
Indian, or the successive races of people that have settled 
in England, and have developed from the Stone Age to 
the modern English. It may, however, be desirable to 
show that even among primitive tribes, geographical 
environment alone does not by any means determine the 
type of culture. Proof of this fact may be found in 
the mode of life of the hunting and fishing Eskimo and 
the reindeer-breeding Chukchee (Bogoras); the African 
pastoral Hottentot and the hunting Bushmen in their 
older, wider distribution (Schultze) ; the Negrito and the 
Malay of southeastern Asia (Martin). 
A second and more important element to be considered 
M
-P-A-G-E-171
162 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
is the social status of each people, and it would seem that 
environment is important only in so far as it limits or 
favors the activities that belong to any particular group. | 
It may even be shown that old customs, that may have 
been in harmony with a certain type of environment, 
tend to survive under new conditions, where they are of 
disadvantage rather than of advantage to the people. An 
example of this kind, taken from our own civilization, is 
our failure to utilize unfamiliar kinds of food that may 
be found in newly settled countries. Another example 
is presented by the reindeer-breeding Chukchee, who 
carty about in their nomadic life a tent of most compli- 
cated structure, which corresponds in its type to the older 
permanent house of the coast dwellers, and which con- 
trasts in the most marked way with the simplicity and 
light weight of the Eskimo tent (Bogoras). Even 
among the Eskimo, who have so marvellously well 
succeeded in adapting themsélves to their geographical 
environment, we may recognize customs that prevent 
the fullest use of the opportunities offered by the country, 
an example of which is the law forbidding the promiscuous 
use of caribou-meat and of seal-meat (Boas). 
Thus it would seem that environment has an important 
effect upon the customs and beliefs of man, but only in so
-P-A-G-E-172
UNIVERSALITY OF CULTURAL TRAITS 163 
far as it helps to determine the special forms of customs. 
and beliefs. These are, however, based primarily on 
cultural conditions, which in themselves are due to his- 
torical causes. so 
At this point the students of anthropo-geography. who 
attempt to explain the whole cultural development on 
the basis of geographical environmental conditions are 
wont to claim that these historical causes themselves are 
founded on older conditions, in which they have origi- 
nated under the stress of environment. It seems to my 
mind that this claim is inadmissible as long as the investi- 
gation of every single cultural feature demonstrates that 
the influence of environment brings about a certain degree 
of adjustment between environment and social life, but 
that a complete explanation of the prevailing conditions, 
based on the action of environment alone, isnever possible. 
We must remember, that, no matter how great an in- 
fluence we may ascribe to environment, that influence can 
become active only by being exerted upon the mind; so 
that the characteristics of the mind must enter into the 
Tesultant forms of social activity. It is just as little con- 
ceivable that mental life can be explained satisfactorily by 
environment alone, as that environment can be explained 
by the influence of the people upon nature, which, as we
-P-A-G-E-173
164 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
all know, has brought about changes of water-courses, 
the destruction of forests, and changes of fauna. In 
other words, it seems entirely arbitrary to disregard the 
part that psychical elements play in determining the 
forms of activities and beliefs which occur with great 
frequency all over the world. 
The second theory that has been advanced to explain 
the sameness of a number of fundamental ideas and in- 
ventions is based on the assumption that they represent 
old cultural achievements belonging to a period previous 
to the general dispersion of the human race. 
This theory is based on the universal distribution of 
certain cultural elements. Obviously it can apply only 
to features that occur the world over; for, if we should 
admit the loss of some of them in the course of historical 
development, the door would be open to the most fanc- 
ful conclusions. A few ethnological data seem to favor 
this theory, and make us inclined to believe that some of 
the universal traits of culture may go back to a very early 
time before that dispersion of mankind which is demanded 
on biological grounds. Most important among these is 
perhaps the occurrence of the dog as a domesticated ' 
animal in practically all parts of the world. It is true 
that in all probability native wild dogs constitute the
-P-A-G-E-174
‘UNIVERSALITY OF CULTURAL TRAITS 165 
principal ancestry of the dogs of the various continents; 
but nevertheless, it seems plausible that theliving-together 
of man and dog developed in the earliest period of human 
history, before the races of northern Asia and America 
separated from those of southeastern Asia. The intro- 
duction of the dingo (the native dog) into Australia seems 
to be most easily explained when we assume that it ac- 
companied man to that remote continent. 
Other very simple activities may perhaps be derived 
from achievements of the earliest ancestors of man. The 
art of fire-making, of drilling, cutting, sawing, work in 
stone, belonged probably to this early age, and may have 
been the heritage on which each people built up its own 
individual type of culture (Weule). If archeological 
investigations should show that implements and other 
evidences of human achievement are found in a geological- 
period during which mankind had not attained its present 
world-wide distribution, we should have to infer that these 
represent the early cultural possessions of man, which he 
carried with him all over the world. In this lies'the great 
and fundamental importance of the eolithic finds that 
have been discussed so extensively during the last few 
years, Language is also a trait common to all mankind, ) 
and one that therefore may have its roots in earliest times.
-P-A-G-E-175
166 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
The activities of the higher apes seem to favor the as- 
sumption that certain arts may have belonged to man be- 
_ fore his dispersion. Their habit of making nests, that is, 
habitations, the use of sticks and stones, point in this 
direction. 
All this makes it plausible that certain cultural achieve- 
ments date back to the origin of mankind. The defend- 
ers of this theory, like Weule and Graebner, also believe 
that a sporadic occurrence of certain inventions like the 
boomerang, among races that are held to be akin in 
descent, may have originated before the differentiation 
and dispersion of these races. 
In the case of many of the phenomena which may be 
explained from these points of view, it is quite impossible 
to give incontrovertible arguments which would prove 
that these customs are not due to parallel and independ- 
ent development rather than to community of origin: 
the decision of this problem will be found largely in the 
results of prehistoric archeology on the one hand, and in 
those of animal psychology on the other. 
The problem is made still more difficult by the dissemi- 
nation of cultural elements from tribe to tribe, from 
people to people, and from continent to continent, which 
can be proved to have existed from the earliest. times on.
-P-A-G-E-176
UNIVERSALITY OF CULTURAL TRAITS 167 
Asan instance of the rapidity with which cultural achieve- 
ments are transmitted may be mentioned the modern 
history of some cultivated plants. Tobacco and cassava 
were introduced into Africa after the discovery of Amer- 
ica, and it took little time for these plants to spread 
over the whole continent; so that at present they enter 
so deeply into the whole culture of the negro, that nobody 
would suspect their foreign origin (Hahn). We find in 
the same way that.the use of the banana has pervaded 
almost the whole of South America (Von den Steinen) ; 
and the history of Indian-corn is another example of the 
incredible rapidity with which a useful cultural acquisi- 
tion may spread over the whole world. ‘It is mentioned 
as known in Europe in 1539, and, according to Dr. Laufer, 
had reached China by way of Tibet between 1540 and 
1540, 
It is easy to show that similar conditions prevailed in 
earlier times. Victor Hehn’s investigations show the 
gradual and continuous increase of the number of domes- 
ticated animals and cultivated plants, due to their im- 
portation from Asia. The same process was going on in 
Prehistoric times. The gradual spread of the Asiatic 
horse, which was first used as a draught animal, Jater on 
for riding, the spread of cattle over Africa and Europe, the
-P-A-G-E-177
168 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
development of European grains, may serveasillustrations 
The area over which these additions to the stock of human 
culture were spread is very large. We see most of them 
travel westward until they reach the Atlantic coast, and 
eastward to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. They also 
penetrated the African Continent. It may be that the 
use of milk was disseminated in a similar way; for when 
the people of the world enter into our historic knowledge, 
we find milk used all over Europe, Africa, and the west- 
ern part of Asia. 
Perhaps the best proof of transmission is contained in 
the folk-lore of the tribes of the world. Nothing seems to 
travel as readily as fanciful tales. We know of certain 
complex tales, which cannot possibly have been invented 
twice, that are told by the Berbers in Morocco, by the 
Italians, the Russians, in the jungles of India, in the high- 
lands of Tibet, on the tundras of Siberia, and on the 
prairies of North America ; so that perhaps the only parts 
of the world not reached by them are South Africa, 
Australia, Polynesia, and South America. The examples 
of such transmission are quite numerous, and we begin 
to see that the early inter-relation of the races of man was 
almost world-wide. 
It follows from this observation that the culture of any  
-P-A-G-E-178
UNIVERSALITY OF CULTURAL TRAITS 169 
given tribe, no matter how primitive it may be, can be 
fully explained only when we take into consideration its 
inner growth as well as its relation to the culture of its. 
near and distant neighbors, and the effect that they may 
have exerted. 
It may be well to indicate here that there seem to have 
been two enormously large areas of extended diffusion. 
Our brief remarks on the distribution of cultivated plants 
pad domesticated animals prove the existence of inter- 
telations between Europe, Asia, and North Africa, from 
the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Other cultural traits 
corroborate this conclusion. The gradual spread of 
bronze from Central Asia westward and eastward, all over 
Europe and over China, the area in which the wheel is 
used, where agriculture with plough and with the help of 
domesticated animals is practised, show the same type 
of distribution (Hahn). We may recognize the sameness 
of characteristic traits in this area also in other respects. 
Oath and ordeal are highly developed in Europe, Africa, 
and Asia excepting the northeastern part of Siberia, 
while in America they are hardly known (Laasch). 
Other common features of the cultural types of the Old 
World appear also most clearly by contrast with con- 
ditions in America. One of these features is the impor-
-P-A-G-E-179
17o THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
tance of formal judicial procedure in the Old World, and 
its almost entire absence among all the tribes of North 
and South America, who, in their general cultural develop- 
ment, might well be compared with the African negroes. 
Tn the domain of folk-Iore I would mention the frequency 
of the riddle, the proverb, and the moralizing fable, which 
areso characteristic of an enormous part of the Old World, 
while they are lacking in northeastern Siberia and in 
America. In all these features, Europe, a large part of 
Africa, and Asia except in its extreme northeastern part, 
and its island connection east of the Malay Archipelago, 
form a unit. 
Tn a similar manner we may trace certain very general 
traits over a large part of America. Most convincing 
among these is the use of Indian-corn all over that part of 
America in which agriculture is practised; but we might 
also mention the development of a peculiar type of cere- 
monialism and of decorative art. It would seem as 
though the middle parts of America had played a rile 
similar to that of Central Asia in the Old World, in so far 
as many of the most characteristic traits of civilization 
may have had their home here before the higher type of 
Central American and South American civilizations were 
developed.
-P-A-G-E-180
UNIVERSALITY OF CULTURAL TRAITS 171 
The third point of view is represented by Bastian, who 
recognizes the great importance of geographical environ-. 
ment in modifying the analogous ethnic phenomena, but 
does not ascribe to them creative power. To him the 
sameness of the forms of thought found in regions wide 
apart suggested the existence of certain definite types of 
thought, no matter in what surroundings man may live, 
and what may be his social and psychical relations. 
These fundamental forms of thought, “that develop with 
iron necessity wherever man lives,” were called by him 
“elementary ideas.” “He denies that it is possible to 
discover the ultimate sources of inventions, ideas, cus- 
toms, and beliefs, which are of universal occurrence. 
They may be indigenous, they may be imported, they, 
may have arisen from a variety of sources, but they are 
there. The human mind is so formed that it invents 
them spontaneously, or accepts them whenever they are 
offered to it. Bastian’s theory of the permanence of 
these forms of thought seems to me related to Dilthey’s 
conception of the limitation of possible ‘types of philoso- * 
phy; and the similarity of lines of thought of these two 
men appears also clearly in Bastian’s const&nt references 
to the theories of philosophers as compared to the views 
held by primitive man. The important phenomenon in
-P-A-G-E-181
172, |THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
Bastian’s mind was the fundamental sameness of forms 
of human thought in all forms of culture, no matter 
whether they were advanced or primitive. 
In the views as propounded by him, a certain kind of 
mysticism may be recognized; in so far as the elementary 
ideas are to his mind intangible entities. No further 
thought can possibly unravel their origin, because we 
ourselves are compelled to think in the forms of these 
elementary ideas. 
To a certain extent a clear enunciation of the elemen- 
taryidea gives us the psychological reason forits existence. 
To exemplify: The fact that the land of shadows is s0 
often placed in the west suggests its localization at the 
place where the sun and the stars vanish. The mere 
statement that primitive man considers the animals as 
gifted with all the qualities of man shows that the anal- 
ogy between many of the qualities of animals and hu- 
man qualities has led to the view that all the qualities of 
animals are human. In other cases the causes are not $0 
self-evident; for example, in the instance of widespread 
customs of restrictions of marriage which have puzzled 
many investigators. The difficulty of this problem is 
proved by the multitude of hypotheses that have been 
invented to explain it in all its varied phases.
-P-A-G-E-182
UNIVERSALITY OF CULTURAL TRAITS 173 
The problem of the origin of elementary ideas has, 
however, been discussed from a psychological point of 
view; and the elaborate attempt by Wundt to work out 
a theory of folk-psychology, as well as the studies of psy- 
chological sociologists, indicate lines of attack of the prob- 
lem. To illustrate this point, I may mention the general 
discussion of the function of association in the beliefs of 
primitive people, given by Wundt, or. the study of sug- 
gestion and hypnotism in primitive life, made by Stoll. 
A more detailed discussion of this method of treatment 
of the common elementary ideas may be deferred until a 
later time (see Chapter VIII).
-P-A-G-E-183
Vil. THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 
I HAVE pointed out before that some of the older 
authors, like Gobineau, Klemm, Carus, Nott and Glid- 
don, assume characteristic mental differences between 
the races of man; and these have been revived by the 
growth of modern nationalism, with its exaggerated self- 
admiration of the Teutonic race, its Pan-slavism, and 
similar symptoms developing in other parts of the world; 
but these views are not supported by the results of un 
biassed research. . 
There remains, however, one point of view to be con- 
sidered, which might furnish a basis for investigation. 
The variety of forms in which the fundamental ideas 
occur were early correlated with general impressions 
regarding the degrees of civilization, and attention was 
directed to the recurrence of similar forms the world 
over, which appear to present an increasing degree of com- 
plexity of culture. This led anthropologists to the con- 
clusion that the types of human culture represent an evo- 
lutionary series; that the primitive tribes of our times 
174 
(
-P-A-G-E-184
THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 175 
represent an older stage of cultural development, through 
which the more advanced types passed in earlier periods. 
If this is true, and if, furthermore, it could be shown 
that the single tribes develop independently, we might 
well say that those races must be less favorably devel- 
oped in which earlier types of culture are found with 
great frequency, later developments rarely. I have re- 
ferred to this possibility at another place (p. 125). For 
this reason the theory of a uniform development of hu- 
man civilization must be considered in our investigation 
of the relation between racial types and cultural progress. 
The investigations of Tylor and Bachofen, Morgan 
and Spencer, fixed the attention upon the data of an- 
thropology as illustrating the gradual development and 
tise of civilization. The development of this side of an- 
thropology was stimulated by the work of Darwin and 
his successors, and its fundamental ideas can be under- 
stood only as an application of the theory of biological 
evolution to mental phenomena. The conception that 
the manifestations of ethnic life represent a series, which 
from simple beginnings has progressed to the complex 
type of modern civilization, has been the underlying 
thought of this aspect of anthropological science. 
The arguments in support of the theory that the
-P-A-G-E-185
176 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
development of civilization bas followed a similar course 
everywhere, and that among primitive tribes we may still 
recognize the stages through which our own civilization 
has passed, are largely based on the similarities of types 
of culture found in distinct races the world over, but also 
on the occurrence of peculiar customs in our own civiliza- 
tion, which can be understood only as survivals (Tylor) of 
older customs, that had a deeper significance at an earlier 
time, and which are still found in full vigor among prini- 
tive people. 
It is necessary to point out at least a few of the aspects 
of this general problem, in order to make clear the signifi- 
cance of the evolutionary theory of human civilization. 
The social organization of primitive tribes shows similar 
traits in many different parts of the world. Instead of 
counting descent in the way we do, many tribes consider 
the child as a member only of its mother’s family, and 
count blood-relationship only in the maternal line, so that 
cousins on the mother’s side are considered as near rela- 
tives, while cousins on the father’s side are considered as 
only distantly related ; other tribes have a strict paternal 
organization, so that the child belongs only to the father’s 
family, not to the mother’s; while still others follow the 
same principles as we adhere to, reckoning relationship
-P-A-G-E-186
THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 177 
in both directions. Connected with these customs is the 
selection of the domicile of the newly married couple, who 
sometimes reside with the wife’s tribe or family, sometimes 
with the man’s tribe or family. -When the couple take up 
their residence with the social group to which the wife 
belongs, it is often found that the man is treated as a 
stranger until his first child is born. These phenomena 
have been made the subject of thorough studies, and the 
observation has been made that apparently the customs 
of residence and of descent are closely associated (Tylor). 
As a result of these inquiries, the conclusion -has been 
drawn that everywhere maternal institutions precede 
paternal institutions, and that the social organization of 
mankind was such that originally perhaps no distinct fam- 
ily organization existed; that later on maternal institu- 
tions developed, which in turn were followed by paternal 
institutions, and again by the system of counting blood- 
relationship equally in maternal and paternal lines. 
Similar results were obtained by the study of human 
inventions. It has been noted before that apes and mon- 
keys sometimes use stones for defence, and in a way the 
artificial shelters of animals indicate the beginnings of 
invention. In this sense we may seek for the origin of 
implements and utensils among animals. In the earliest

times when human remains appear on the surface of the 
earth, we find man using simple stone implements which 
are formed by rough chipping, but the multiplicity of 
forms of implements increases gradually. Since many 
implements may have been made of perishable materials, 
we are not able to tell whether at a very early time the 
implements and utensils used were really confined to the 
few stone objects that may now be recovered; but cet- 
tainly the implements were few, and, comparatively speak- 
ing, simple. From this time on, the uses of fire, and of 
tools for cutting and striking, for scraping and perforat- 
ing, have increased in number and complexity, and 4 
gtadual development may be traced from the simple tools 
of primitive man to the complex machinery of our times. 
The inventive genius of all races and of unnumbered in- 
dividuals has contributed to the state of industrial pe- 
fection in which we find ourselves. On the whole, in- 
ventions once made have been kept with great tenacity, 
and, owing to incessant additions, the available resources 
of mankind have constantly been increased and multi- 
plied. 
An excellent example of the general theory of evolution 
of civilization is found in the theory of evolution of agti- 
culture and of the domestication of animals as outlined
-P-A-G-E-188
THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 179 
by Otis T. Mason, W J McGee, and Hahn. They 
point out how, in the earliest beginnings of social life, 
animals, plants, and man lived together in a definite sur- 
rounding, and how, owing to the conditions of life, cer- 
tain plants multiplied to the exclusion of others, and how 
certain animals were suffered in the neighborhood of the 
human camp. Through this condition of mutual suffer- 
ance and promotion of mutual interests, if I may use this 
term, a closer association between plants, animals, and 
man developed, which ultimately led to the beginnings 
of agriculture and to the actual domestication of animals. 
Researches on art have led to similar results. Investi- 
gators have endeavored to show, that, since the cave- 
dwellers of France drew the outlines of the reindeer and 
mammoth on bone and antler, man has tried to reproduce 
in pictographic design the animals of the region in which 
he lived. In the artistic productions of many people, de- 
signs have been found which are readily associated with 
Pictographic presentations, which, however, have lost 
their realism of form, and have become more and more 
conventional; so that in many cases a purely decorative 
Motive has been interpreted as developed from a realistic 
Rictograph gradually breaking up under the stress of 
asthetic motives. The islands of the Pacific Ocean,
-P-A-G-E-189
180 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
. New Guinea, South America, Central America, prehis- 
toric Europe, have furnished examples for this line of 
development (see March, Haddon, Von den Steinen, 
Holmes), which therefore was recognized as one of the im- 
portant tendencies of the evolution of human decorative 
art, which was described as beginning with realism, and 
as leading through symbolic conventionalism to purely 
zsthetic motives. 
Religion has furnished another example of typical evo- 
lution in human thought. At an early time man began to 
think and ponder about the phenomena of nature 
Everything appeared to him in an anthropomorphic form 
of thought; and thus the first primitive concepts regard- 
ing the world came into being, in which the stone, the 
mountain, the heavenly orbs, were viewed as animate 
anthropomorphic beings endowed with will-power, and 
willing to help man or threatening to endanger him. The 
observation of the activities of man’s own body and of 
his mind led to the formulation of the idea of a soul in- 
dependent of the body; and with increasing knowledge 
and with increasing philosophic thought, religion and 
science grew out of these simple beginnings. 
The sameness of all these phenomena in different parts 
of the world has been considered as proof not only of the a 
—_———___.;
-P-A-G-E-190
THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 181 
fundamental unity of the mind of all the races of man, but 
also of the truth of the theory of evolution of civilization ; 
and thus a grand structure has been reared, in which we 
see our present civilization as the necessary outcome of 
the activities of all the races of man that have risen in one 
grand procession, from the simplest beginnings of culture, 
through periods of barbarism, to the stage of civilization 
that they now occupy. The march has not been equally 
rapid; for some are still lagging behind, while others have 
forged forward, and occupy the first places in the. general 
advance. 
It seems desirable to understand more clearly what 
this theory of parallelism of cultural development im- 
plies. It seems to mean that different groups of man- 
kind started at a very early time from a general con- 
dition of lack of culture; and, owing to the unity of the © 
human mind and the consequent similar response to 
outer and inner stimuli, they have developed everywhere 
approximately along the same lines, making similar in- 
ventions and developing similar customs and beliefs. 
It also seems to involve a certain correlation between 
industrial development and social development, and 
therefore a definite sequence of inventions as well as of 
forms of organization and of belief.
-P-A-G-E-191
182 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
In the absence of historical data in regard to the 
earliest history of primitive man the world over, we have 
only three sources of historical proof of this assumption, — 
the evidence contained in the earliest history of the civ- 
ilized people of the Old World, survivals in modem 
civilization, and archeology. The last-named is the only 
method by means of which we can approach the problem 
in regard to people that have no history. 
While it is certainly true that analogues can be found 
between the types of culture represented by primitive 
people and those conditions which prevailed among the 
ancestors of the present civilized peoples at the dawn af 
history, and that these analogues are supported by the 
evidence furnished by survivals, the evidence of arche- 
ology does not support the complete generalization. The 
theory of parallel development, if it is to have any signii- 
cance, would require that among all branches of mankind 
the steps of invention should have followed, at least 
approximately, in the same order, and that no important 
gaps should be found. The facts, so far as known at the 
present time, are entirely contrary to this view. We find, 
for instance, large areas of the world inhabited by people 
well advanced in the arts of life, but who have neve 
made the discovery of pottery, one of the essential steps
-P-A-G-E-192
THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 183 
in the advance of civilization. Pottery is not found in 
the extreme southern parts of Africa, in Australia, in 
northeastern Siberia,’ in the whole northwestern part of 
North America, and in the extreme south of South Amer- 
ica. According to what has been said before (p. 169), 
it would seem as if Old-World pottery ‘covers about the 
same territory as the other characteristic traits referred to 
before, while in America its centre lies in the area of more 
advanced culture in the middle part of the continent. 
Thus it happens that the well-advanced tribes of North- 
west America have no pottery, and its presence or ab- 
sence seems to be due more to geographical location than 
to general cultural causes. 
The same may be said in regard to the use of metals. 
The invention of metallurgy, which marks so important 
an advance of European civilization, does not appear as- 
sociated with analogous levels of development in other 
parts of the world. Similar remarks may be made in 
regard to the development of agriculture and of the 
domestication of animals. People whom in a general 
way we ought to class as on the same level of culture may 
some possess the art of agriculture, others may have 
1Tn a few localities in this district pottery is found, perhaps due to a 
late local introduction.
-P-A-G-E-193
184 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
domesticated animals, while still others may rely upon the 
bounty of the sea or upon the natural vegetable products 
of their home.2 As soon as we begin to investigate the 
industrial achievements of different types belonging to 
different races, parallelism of industrial development 
does not seem to exist in any degree of detail. Only one 
general trait of industrial development remains; namely, 
the constant addition of new elements to the older stock of 
knowledge and an increasing refinement of methods and 
of results, setting aside periods of temporary regression. 
Thus it does not seem to be certain that every people 
in an advanced stage of civilization must have passed 
through all the stages of development, which we may 
gather by an investigation of all the types of culture 
which occur all over the world. 
A still more serious objection is based on another ob- 
servation. The validity of the general sameness of the 
evolution of mankind is based on the assumption that the 
same cultural features must always have developed from 
the same causes, and that all variations are only minor 
details of the grand uniform type of evolution. In other 
words, its logical basis is the assumption that the same 
1The cultural conditions of Melanesia Northwest America, and of 
some of the nomadic tribes of Africa, might thus be compared,
-P-A-G-E-194
THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 185 
ethnical phenomena are always due to the same causes. 
Thus the inference in regard to the sequence of maternal 
and paternal institutions, to which I referred before, is 
based on the generalization that because in a few cases 
paternal families have developed from maternal ones, 
therefore all paternal families have developed in the same 
way. If we do not make the assumption that the same 
phenomena have everywhere developed in the same way, 
then we may just as well conclude that paternal families 
have in some cases arisen from maternal institutions, in 
other cases in other ways. : 
Tn the same way it is inferred that because many con- 
ceptions of the future life have evidently developed from 
dreams and hallucinations, all notions of this character 
have had the same origin. This is true only if it can be 
shown that no other causes could possibly lead to the 
same ideas. 
To give another example. It has been claimed that 
among the Indians of Arizona, pottery developed from 
basketry, and it has been inferred that all pottery must 
therefore be later in the cultural development of mankind 
than basketry. Evidently this conclusion cannot be 
defended, for pottery may develop in other ways. 
As a matter of fact, quitea number of cases can be given
-P-A-G-E-195
186 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
in which convergent evolution, beginning from distinct 
beginnings, has led to the same results. I have referred 
before to the instance of primitive art, and have men- 
tioned the theory that geometrical form develops from 
realistic representations, which lead through symbolic 
conventionalism to purely zsthetic motives. We may 
remark here that a great diversity of objects might in this 
way have given rise to the same decorative motives, 90 
that the survival of the same decorative motive would not 
lead back to the same realistic origin; but more impot- 
tant than this, we may point out that geometrical motives 
of the same type have developed from the tendency of the 
artist to play with his technique as the virtuoso plays 08 
his instrument; that the expert basket-weaver, by vaty- 
ing the arrangement of her weave, was led to the develop- 
ment of geometrical designs of the same form as those that 
were developed in other places from realistic represents- 
tions. We may even go a step farther, and recognize that 
geometrical forms developed from the technique sug: 
gested animal forms, which later on were modified so as 
to assume realistic forms; so that in the case of decota- 
tive art the same forms may just as well stand at the be 
ginning of a series of development as at the end (Von 
den Steinen).
-P-A-G-E-196
THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 187 
Another example may not be amiss. The use of 
masks is found among a great number of peoples. The 
origin of the custom is by no means clear in all cases, but 
a few typical forms of their use may easily be distin- 
guished. They are intended to deceive spirits as to the 
identity of the wearer, and may thus protect him against 
attack; or the mask may represent a spirit which is per- 
sonified by the wearer, who in this way frightens away 
supernatural enemies. Still other masks are commemo- 
tative, the wearer personifying a deceased friend. Masks 
are also used in theatrical performances illustrating 
mythological incidents (Andree). While it is not at all 
necessary to assume that these explanations given by the 
wearet of masks represent the actual historical develop- 
ment of the custom, the explanations themselves suggest 
the improbability of a single origin of the custom. 
I will give another example. Primitive tribes are 
very often divided into a definite number of subdi- 
visions. There is little doubt that this form of social or- 
ganization has arisen independently over and over again. 
The conclusion is justified that the psychical conditions 
of man favor the existence of such an organization of 
society, but it does not follow that it has developed every- 
where in the same manner. Dr. Washington Matthews
-P-A-G-E-197
188 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
has shown that the groups of the Navaho have arisen by 
the association of independent elements. Captain 
Bourke has pointed out that similar occurrences have 
given rise to the Apache groups, and Dr. Fewkes has 
_ Teached the same conclusion in regard to some of the 
Pueblo tribes. On the other hand, we have proof that 
such groups may originate by division. Such events 
have taken place among the Indians of the North Pacific 
coast (Boas). Other divisions of tribes seem to have had 
an entirely different origin; as, for instance, the frequent 
twofold exogamic division of tribes, which may, perhaps, 
be adequately explained by the application of the laws of 
exogamy in a small community. Thus it would seem 
that a variety of causes has led to results which appeat 
identical to all intents and purposes. 
The principal obstacle in the way of progress on these 
lines seems to my mind to be founded on the Jack of com- 
parability of the data with which we are dealing. At- 
tention has been directed essentially to the similarity of 
ethnic phenomena, while the individual variations were 
disregarded. As soon as we turn our attention in this 
direction, we notice that the sameness of ethnic phe- 
nomena is more superficial than complete, more apparent 
than real. The unexpected similarities have attracted
-P-A-G-E-198
  THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 189 
our attention to such an extent that we have disregarded 
differences; while in the study of the physical traits of 
distinct social groups, the reverse mental attitude mani- 
+ fests itself. The similarity of the main features of the 
human form being self-evident, our attention is directed 
to the minute differences of structure. 
Instances of such lack of comparability can easily be 
given. When we speak of the idea of life after death as 
one of the ideas which develop in human society as a 
psychological necessity, we are dealing with a most com- 
Plex group of data. One people believes that the soul 
continues to exist in the form that the person had at the 
time of death, without any possibility of change; another 
one believes that the soul will be reborn in a child of the, 
same family; a third one believes that the souls will 
enter the bodies of animals; and still others believe that 
the shadows continue our human pursuits, waiting to be 
led back to our world in a distant future. The emo- 
tional and rationalistic elements which enter into these 
various concepts are entirely distinct ; and we can readily 
perceive how the various forms of the idea of a future 
life may have come into existence by psychological pro- 
cessesthatarenot at all comparable. If I may be allowed 
to speculate on this question, I might imagine that in one
-P-A-G-E-199
igo THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
case the similarities between children and their deceased 
relatives, in other cases the memory of the deceased as he 
lived during the last days of his life, in still other cases 
the longing for the beloved child or parent, and again the 
fear of death, — may all have contributed to the develop- 
ment of the idea of life after death, the one here, the other 
there. 
Another instance will corroborate this point of view. 
One of the striking forms of social organization which 
occurs in many regions wide apart is what we call “totem- 
ism,” —a form of society in which certain social groups 
consider themselves as related in a supernatural way to4 
certain species of animals or to a certain class of objects. 
T believe this is the generally accepted definition of “to- 
temism ;” but I am convinced that in this form the phe- 
nomenon is not a single psychological problem, but 
embraces the most diverse psychological elements. In 
some cases the people believe themselves to be descend- 
ants of the animal whose protection they enjoy. In other 
cases an animal or some other object may have appeared 
to an ancestor of the social group, and may have promised 
to become his protector, and the friendship between the 
animal and the ancestor was then transmitted to his de- 
scendants. In still other cases a certain social group ina
-P-A-G-E-200
THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 19r 
tribe may have the power of securing by magical means 
and with great ease a certain kind of animal or of increas- 
ing its numbers, and the supernatural relation may be 
established in this way. It will be recognized that here 
again the anthropological phenomena which are in out- 
ward appearances alike are, psychologically speaking, 
entirely distinct, and that consequently psychological 
laws covering all of them cannot be deduced from them 
(Goldenweiser). 
Another example may not be amiss. In a general re- 
view of moral standards we observe that with increas- 
ing civilization a gradual change in the valuation of ac- 
tions takes place. Among primitive man, human life 
has little value, and is sacrificed on the slightest provoca- 
tion. The social group among whose members any altru- 
istic obligations are binding is exceedingly small; and 
outside of the group any action that may result in per- 
sonal gain is not only permitted, but even approved ; and 
from this starting-point we find an ever-increasing valua- 
tion of human life and an extension of the size of the 
group among whose members altruistic obligations are 
binding. The modern relations of nations show that this 
evolution has not yet reached its final stage. It might 
seem, therefore, that a study of the social conscience in
-P-A-G-E-201
192 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
relation to crimes like murder might be of psychological 
value, and lead to important results, clearing up the origin 
of ethical values; but I think here the same objections 
may be raised as before; namely, the lack of comparable 
motives. The person who slays an enemy in revenge for 
wrongs done, a youth who kills his father before he gets 
decrepit in order to enable him to continue a vigorous 
life in the world to come, a father who kills his child asa 
sacrifice for the welfare of his people, act from such ea- 
tirely different motives, that psychologically a comparison 
of their activities does not seem permissible. It would 
seem much more proper to compare the murder of at 
- enemy in revenge with destruction of his property for 
the same purpose, or to compare the sacrifice of a child o2 
behalf of the tribe with any other action performed 0 
account of strong altruistic motives, than to base our com ; 
parison on the common concept of murder (Westermarck). 
These few data may suffice to show that the same ethnit i 
phenomenon may develop from different sources; and 
we may infer that the simpler the observed fact, the more 
likely it is that it may have developed from one sourt 
here, from another there. 
When we base our study on these observations, it a; 
pears that serious objections may be made against the a {
-P-A-G-E-202
\ — THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 193 
sumption of the occurrence of a general sequence of cul- 
tural stages among all the races of man; that rather we 
recognize a peculiar tendency of diverse customs and 
beliefs to converge towards similar forms. In order to in- 
terpret correctly these similarities in form, it is necessary 
to investigate their historical development; and only 
when the historical development in different areas is the 
same, will it be admissible to consider the phenomena 
in question as equivalent. From this point of view 
the facts of cultural contact assume a new importance 
(see p. 166). 
An important theoretical consideration has also shaken 
our faith in the correctness of the evolutionary theory as 
awhole. It is one of the essential traits of this theory 
that, in general, civilization has developed from simple 
forms to complex forms, and that extended fields of hu- 
man culture have developed under more or less rational- 
istic impulses. Of late years we are beginning to recog- 
hize that human culture does not always develop from the 
simple to the complex, but that in many aspects two ten- 
dencies intercross, — one from the complex to the simple, 
the other from the simple to the complex. It is obvious 
that the history of industrial development is almost 
throughout that of increasing complexity. On the other 
9°
-P-A-G-E-203
194 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
hand, human activities that do not depend upon reason- 
ing do not show a similar type of evolution. 
It is perhaps easiest to make this clear by the example 
of language, which in many respects is one of the most im- 
portant evidences of the history of human development. 
Primitive languages are, on the whole, complex. Minute 
differences in point of view are given expression by means 
of grammatical forms; and the grammatical categories of 
Latin, and still more so those of modern English, seem 
crude when compared to the complexity of psychological 
or logical forms which primitive languages recognize, but 
which in our speech are disregarded entirely. On the 
whole, the development of languages seems to be such, 
that the nicer distinctions are eliminated, and that it 
begins with complex and ends with simpler forms, al 
though it must be acknowledged that opposite tendencies 
are not by any means absent (Boas). 
Similar observations may be made on the art of primi- 
tive man. In- music as well as in decorative design we 
find a complexity of rhythmic structure which is une 
qualled in the popular art of our day. In music, partic- 
ularly, this complexity is so great, that the art of a skilled 
virtuoso is taxed in the attempt to imitate it (Stumpf). 
Tf once it is recognized that simplicity is not always 4
-P-A-G-E-204
THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEWPOINT 195 
proof of antiquity, it will readily be seen that the theory 
of the evolution of civilization rests to a certain extent on 
a logical error. The classification of the data of anthro- 
pology in accordance with their simplicity has been re- 
interpreted as an historical sequence, without an adequate 
attempt to prove that the simpler antedates the more 
complex. 
We are thus led to the conclusion that the assumption 
of a uniform development of culture among all the differ- 
ent races of man and among all tribal units is true in a 
limited sense only. We may recognize a certain modifi- 
cation of mental activities with modifications of form of 
culture; but the assumption that the same forms must 
necessarily develop in every independent social unit can 
hardly be maintained. Thus the question with which we 
began our consideration — namely, whether the repre- 
sentatives of different races can be proved to have de- 
veloped each independently, in such a way that the repre- 
sentatives of some races stand on low levels of culture, 
while others stand on high levels of culture — may be an- 
swered in the negative. If we should make the attempt 
to arrange the different types of man in accordance with 
their industrial advancement, we should find representa- 
tives of the most diverse races — such as the Bushman of
-P-A-G-E-205
196. _. THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
South Africa, the Veddah of Ceylon, the Australian, and | 
the Indian of Terra del Fuego — on the same lowest level 
We should also find representatives of different races on " 
more advanced levels, like the negroes of Central Africa, ' 
the Indians of the Southwestern pueblos, and the Poly- ; 
nesians; and in our present period we may find represen 
tatives of the most diverse races taking part in the highest 
types of civilization. Thus it will be seen that there is 
- no close relation between race and culture.

VII. SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 
Tr now remains to formulate more clearly the difference 
between the forms of thought of primitive man and those 
of civilized man, regardless of their racial descent. 
Even a superficial observation demonstrates that 
groups of man belonging to distinct social strata do not 
behave in the same manner. The Russian peasant does 
not re-act to his sense-experiences in the same way as does 
the native Australian; and entirely different from theirs 
are the re-actions of the educated Chinaman and of the 
educated American. In all these cases the form of re- 
action may depend to a slight extent upon hereditary 
individual and racial ability, but it will to a much greater 
extent be determined by the habitual re-actions of the 
society to which the individual in question belongs. 
It seems necessary, therefore, as a last step in our dis- 
cussion, to define and explain the mental re-actions which 
distinguish primitive man and civilized man of all races. 
We must confine this discussion to a very few examples 
of fundamental psychological facts. 
197
-P-A-G-E-207
198 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
One of the most striking features in the thoughts of 
primitive people is the peculiar manner in which concepts 
that appear to us alike and related are separated and re- 
arranged. According to our views, the constituting ele- 
ments of the heavens and of the weather are all inanimate 
objects ; but to the mind of primitive man they appear to 
belong to the organic world, The dividing-line between 
man and animal is not sharply drawn. What seem to us 
conditions of an object — like health and sickness — are 
considered by him as independent realities. In short, 
the whole classification of experience among mankind 
living in different forms of society follows entirely dis 
tinct lines. 
T have illustrated the necessity of classification in a 
previous chapter, when speaking of the relation of lan- 
guage and cultural development (p. 143). Incidentally I 
have also pointed out that the principles of classification 
which are found in different languages do not by any 
means agree. 
The behavior of primitive man makes it perfectly clear 
that all these linguistic classes have never risen into cot- 
sciousness, and that consequently their origin must be 
sought, not in rational, but in entirely unconscious, pro- 
cesses of the mind. They must be due to a grouping of .

sense-impressions and of concepts which\j is not in any 
sense of the term voluntary, but which develops froth en- 
tirely different psychological causes. It. ivy character.” 
istic of linguistic classifications that they never rise into 
consciousness; while other classifications, although the 
same unconscious origin prevails, often do rise into con-. .. 
sciousness. It seems very plausible, for instance, that 
the fundamental religious notions, like the idea of will- 
power immanent in inanimate objects, or the anthropo- 
morphic character of animals, are in their origin just as 
little conscious as the fundamental ideas of language. 
While, however, the use of language is so automatic that 
the opportunity never arises for the fundamental notions 
to emerge into consciousness, this happens very fre- 
quently in all phenomena relating to religion. 
These observations may be applied equally well to other 
Stoups of concepts. 
The primary object of these researches is the determi- 
nation of the fundamental categories under which phe- 
nomena are classified by man in various stages of culture. 
Differences of this kind appear very clearly in the domain 
of certain simple sense-perceptions. For instance, it has 
been observed that colors are classified according to their 
similarities in quite distinct groups, without any accom-

700 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
pesdothbi er panying difference in the ability to differentiate shades of 
. color. What we call green and blue are often combined 
. under some itch term as “gall-like color” ; or yellow and 
' green are combined into one concept, which may be 
named “young-leaves color.” Theimportance of thefact 
that in thought and in speech these color-names convey 
the impression of quite different groups of sensations can 
hardly be overrated. 
Another group of categories that offer a field of fruitful 
investigation are those of object and attribute. The con- 
cepts of primitive man make it quite clear that the classes 
of ideas which we consider as attributes are often con- 
sidered as independent objects. The best-known case of 
this kind, one to which I have referred incidentally before, 
is that of sickness. While we consider sickness as a con- 
dition of an organism, it is believed by primitive man, 
-and even by many members of our own society, to be an 
object which may enter the body, and which may be re- 
moved. This is exemplified by the numerous cases in 
which a disease is extracted from the body by sucking or 
by other processes, in the belief that it may be thrown 
into people, or that it may be enclosed in wood in order to 
prevent its return. Other qualities are treated in the 
same way. Thus the conditions of hunger, exhaustion,
-P-A-G-E-210
SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE ‘CULTURE 201 
and similar bodily feelings, are considered by certain 
primitive tribes as independent objects which affect the 
body. Even life is believed to be a material object that 
may become separated from the body. The luminosity 
of the sun is considered as an object that the Sun himself 
may put on or lay aside. 
I have indicated before that the concept of anthropo- 
morphism seems to be one of the important categories 
underlying primitive thought. It would seem that the 
power of motion of the self, and the power of motion of an 
object, have led to the inclusion of man and movable 
objects in the same category, with the consequent impu- 
tation of human qualities to the moving objective world. 
While in many cases we can see with a fair degree of 
clearness the fundamental concepts underlying these cate- 
gories, in other cases these are not by any means clear. 
Thus the concept of incest groups— those groups in 
which intermarriage is strictly forbidden — is omnipres- 
ent; but no satisfactory explanation has so far been 
given for the tendency to combine certain degrees of blood- 
telatiotiship under this viewpoint. 
Another fundamental difference between the mental 
life of primitive man and that of civilized man lies in the 
fact that we have succeeded in developing, by the appli-

cation of conscious reasoning, better systems from these 
crude, unconscious classifications of the sum total of our 
knowledge, while primitive man has.not done so. The 
first impression gained from a study of the beliefs of 
primitive man is, that while the perceptions of his senses 
are excellent, his power of logical interpretation of per- 
ceptions seems to be deficient. I think it can be shown 
that the reason for this fact is not founded on any funda- 
mental peculiarity of the mind of primitive man, but lies, 
rather, in the character of the traditional ideas by means 
of which each new perception isinterpreted ; in other words, 
in the character of the traditional ideas with which each 
new perception associates itself. In our own community 
a mass of observations and of thoughts is transmitted to 
the child. These thoughts are the result of careful ob- 
servation and speculation of our present and of past gen- 
erations; but they are transmitted to most individuals 
as traditional matter, much the same as folk-lore. The 
child associates new perceptions with this whole mass of 
traditional material, and interprets his observations by 
its means. I believe it is a mistake to assume that the 
interpretation made by each civilized individual is a com- 
plete logical process. We associate a phenomenon with 
a number of known facts, the interpretations of which are
-P-A-G-E-212
SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 203 
assumed as known, and we are satisfied with the reduction 
of a new fact to these previously known facts. For in- 
stance, if the average individual hears of the explosion of 
a previously unknown chemical, he is satisfied to reason 
that certain materials are known to have the property of 
exploding under proper conditions, and that consequently 
the unknown substance has the same quality. On the 
whole, I do not think that we should try to argue still 
further, and really try to give a full explanation of the 
causes of the explosion, 
The difference in the mode of thought of primitive man 
and that of civilized man seems to consist largely in the 
difference of character of the traditional material with 
which the new perception associates itself. The instruc- 
tion given to the child of primitive man is not based on 
centuries of expcrimentation, but consists of the crude 
experience of generations. When a new experience enters 
the mind of primitive man, the same process which we 
observe among civilized man brings about an entirely 
different series of associations, and therefore results in a 
different type of explanation. A sudden explosion will 
associate itself in his mind, perhaps, with tales which 
he has heard in regard to the mythical history of the 
world, and consequently will be accompanied by super-
-P-A-G-E-213

stitious fear. When we recognize that neither among 
civilized men nor among primitive men the average in- 
dividual carries to completion the attempt at causal 
explanation of phenomena, but carries it only so far as to 
amalgamate it with other previously known facts, we 
recognize that the result of the whole process depends 
entirely upon the character of the traditional material. 
Herein lies the immense importance of folk-lore in deter- 
mining the mode of thought. Herein lies particularly the 
enormous influence of current philosophic opinion upon 
the masses of the people, and herein lies the influence of 
the dominant scientific theory upon the character of 
" scientific work. 
It would be vain to try to understand the development 
of modern science without an intelligent understanding 
of modern philosophy ; it would be vain to try to under 
stand the history of medieval science without a knowl- 
edge of medieval theology; and so it is vain to try 
to understand primitive science without an intelligent 
knowledge of primitivemythology. “Mythology,” “the- 
ology,” and “philosophy” are different terms for the 
‘same influences which shape the current of human 
thought, and which determine the character of the at- 
tempts of man to explain the phenomena of nature. To

primitive man, — who has been taught to consider the 
heavenly orbs as animate beings; who sees in every 
_ animal a being more powerful than man; to whom the 
mountains, trees, and stones are endowed with life, — 
explanations of phenomena will suggest themselves en- 
tirely different from those to which we are accustomed, 
since we base our conclusions upon the existence of mat- 
ter and force as bringing about the observed results. If 
we should not consider it possible to explain the whole 
range of phenomena as the result of matter and force 
alone, all our explanations of natural phenomena would 
take a different aspect. 
In scientific inquiries we should always be clear in 
our own minds of the fact that we always embody a 
number of hypotheses and theories in our explanations, 
and that we do not carry the analysis of any given 
Phenomenon to completion. In fact, if we were to do 
80, progress would hardly be possible, because every 
Phenomenon would require an endless amount of time 
for thorough treatment. We are only too apt, how- 
ever, to forget entirely the general, and for most of us 
purely traditional, theoretical basis which is the founda- 
tion of our reasoning, and to assume that the result of 
our reasoning is absolute truth. In this we commit
-P-A-G-E-215
206 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
the same error that is committed, and has been com- 
mitted, by all the less civilized peoples. They are more 
easily satisfied than we are at the present time; but they 
also assume as true the traditional element which enters 
into their explanations, and therefore accept as absolute 
truth the conclusions based on it. It is evident that the 
fewer the number of traditional elements that enter into 
our reasoning, and the clearer we endeavor to be in regard 
to the hypothetical part of our reasoning, the more logical 
will be our conclusions. There is an undoubted tendency 
in the advance of civilization to eliminate traditional 
elements, and to gain a clearer and clearer insight into 
the hypothetical basis of our reasoning. It is therefore 
not surprising, that, with the advance of civilization, rea- 
soning becomes more and more logical, not because each 
individual carries out his thought in a more logical manner, 
but because the traditional material which is handed 
down to each individual has been thought out and worked 
out more thoroughly and morecarefully. While in primi- 
tive civilization the traditional material is doubted and 
examined by only a very few individuals, the number of 
thinkers who try to free themselves from the fetters of 
tradition increases as civilization advances. 
An example illustrating this progress and at the same  
-P-A-G-E-216
SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 207 
time the slowness of this progress is found in the relations 
between individuals belonging to different tribes. There 
are a number of primitive hordes to whom every stranger 
not a member of the horde is an enemy, and where it is 
right to damage the enemy to the best of one’s power and 
ability, and if possible to kill him. This custom is 
founded largely on the idea of the solidarity of the horde, 
and of the feeling that it is the duty of every member 
of the horde to destroy all possible enemies. Therefore 
every person not a member of the horde must be con- 
sidered as belonging to a class entirely distinct from the 
members of the horde, and is treated accordingly. We 
can trace the gradual broadening of the feeling of fellow- 
ship during the advance of civilization. The feeling of 
fellowship in the horde expands to the feeling of unity of 
the tribe, to a recognition of bonds established by a 
neighborhood of habitat, and further on to the feeling of 
fellowship among members of nations. This seems to be 
the limit of the ethical concept of fellowship of man which 
we have reached at the present time. When we analyze 
the strong feeling of nationality which is so potent at the 
Present time, we recognize that it consists largely in 
the idea of the pre-eminence of that community whose 
member we happen to be, — in the pre-eminent value of
-P-A-G-E-217
208 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
its language, of its customs, and of its traditions, and in 
the belief that it is right to preserve its peculiarities and 
to impose them upon the rest of the world. The feeling 
of nationality as here expressed, and the feeling of soli- 
darity of the horde, are of the same order, although modi- 
fied by the gradual expansion of the idea of fellowship; 
but the ethical point of view which makes it justifiable at 
the present time to increase the well-being of one nation 
at the cost of another, the tendency to value one’s own 
civilization as higher than that of the whole rest of man- 
kind, are the same as those which prompt the actions of 
primitive man, who considers every stranger as an enemy, 
and who is not satisfied until the enemy is killed. It is 
somewhat difficult for us to recognize that the value 
which we attribute to our own civilization is due to the 
fact that we participate in this civilization, and that it has 
been controlling all our actions since the time of ouf 
birth; but it is certainly conceivable that there may be 
other civilizations, based perhaps on different traditions 
and on a different equilibrium of emotion and reason, 
which are of no less value than ours, although it may be 
impossible for us to appreciate their values without hav- 
ing grown up under their influence. The general theory 
of valuation of human activities, as developed by anthro-

pological research, teaches us a higher tolerance than the © 
one which we now profess. ‘ 
After we have thus seen that a large numiber of tra- 
ditional elements enter into the reasoning of primitive man 
and of civilized man as well, we are better prepared to 
understand some of the more special typical differences in 
the thought of primitive man and of civilized man. 
A trait of primitive life that early attracted the atten- 
tion of investigators is the occurrence of close associations 
between mental activities that appear to us as entirely 
disparate. In primitive life, religion and science ; music, 
poetry, and dance ; myth and history ; fashion and 
ethics, — appear inextricably interwoven. We may ex- 
Press this general observation also by saying that primi-_ 
tive man views each action not only as adapted to its 
main object, each thought related to its main end, as we 
should perceive them, but that he associates them with 
other ideas, often of a religious or at least of a symbolic 
nature. Thus he gives them a higher significance than 
they seem to us to deserve. Every taboo is an example 
of such associations of apparently trifling actions with 
ideas that are so sacred that a deviation from the custo- 
mary mode of performance creates the strongest emo- 
tions of abhorrence. The interpretation of ornaments as 
P

210 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
charms, the symbolism of decorative art, are other ex 
amples of association of ideas that, on the whole, are 
foreign to our mode of thought. 
In order to make clear the point of view from which 
these phenomena seem to fall into an orderly array, we 
will investigate whether all vestiges of similar forms of 
thought have disappeared from our civilization. In our 
intense life, which is devoted to activities requiring the 
full application of our reasoning-powers and a repression 
of the emotional life, we have become accustomed to a 
cold, matter-of-fact view of our actions, of the incentives 
that lead to them, and of their consequences. It is not 
necessary, however, to go far afield to find a state of mind 
which is open to other aspects of life. If those among us 
who move in the midst of the current of our quickly puls 
ing life do not look beyond their rational motives and 
aims, others who stand by in quiet contemplation recog- 
nize in it the reflection of an ideal world that they have 
built up in their own consciousness. To the artist the 
outer world is a symbol of the beauty that he feels; to 
the fervent religious mind it is a symbol of the transcet- 
dental truth which gives form to his thought. Instrumen- 
tal music that one enjoys as a work of purely musical art 
calls forth in the mind of another a group of definite con-

OS SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE | arr 
cepts that are connected with the musical themes and. 
their treatment only by the similarity of the emotional 
states they evoke. In fact, the different manner in which 
individuals re~act to the same stimulus, and the variety 
of associations elicited by the same sense-impression in 
different individuals, are so self-evident that they hardly 
call for special remarks. . 
Most important for the purpose of our investigation is 
the fact that there are certain stimuli to which all of us 
who live in the same society re-act in the same way with- 
out being able to express the reasons for our actions. A 
good example of what I refer to are breaches of social 
etiquette. A mode of behavior that does not conform 
to the customary manners, but differs from them in a 
striking way, creates, on the whole, unpleasant emotions ; 
and it requires a determined effort on our part to make 
it clear to ourselves that such behavior does not conflict 
with moral standards. Among those who are not 
trained in courageous and rigid thought, the confusion 
between traditional etiquette — so-called good manners 
and moral conduct is habitual. In certain lines of 
conduct the association between traditional etiquette and 
ethical feeling is so close, that even a vigorous thinker 
can hardly emancipate himself from it. This is true, for
-P-A-G-E-221
212 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
instance, of acts that may be considered breaches of mod- 
esty.. The most cursory review of the history of costume 
shows that what was considered modest at one time has 
been immodest at other times. The custom of habitu- 
ally covering parts of the body has at all times led to the 
strong feeling that exposure of such parts is immodest. 
This feeling of propriety is so erratic, that a costume that 
is appropriate on one occasion may be considered oppro- 
brious on other occasions; as, for instance, a low-cut 
evening dress in a street-car during business hours. 
What kind of exposure is felt as immodest depends al- 
ways upon fashion. It is quite evident that fashion is 
not dictated by modesty, but that the historical develop- 
ment of costume is determined by a variety of causes. 
Nevertheless fashions are typically associated with the 
feeling of modesty, so that an unwonted exposure ex 
cites the unpleasant feelings of impropriety. There is 
no conscious reasoning why the one form is proper, the 
other improper; but the feeling is aroused directly by 
the contrast with the customary. Every one will feel 
instinctively the strong resistance that he would have to 
overcome, even in a different society, if he were required 
to perform an action that we are accustomed to consider 
as immodest, and the feelings that would be excited in
-P-A-G-E-222
SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 213 
his mind if he were thrown into a society in which the 
standards of modesty differed from our own. 
Even setting aside the strong emotions of modesty, we 
find a variety of reasons which make certain styles of 
dress appear improper. To appear in the fashion of our 
forefathers of two centuries ago would be entirely out 
of the question, and would expose one to ridicule. To 
see a man wear a hat in company indoors nettles us: it 
is considered rude. To wear a hat in church or at a 
funeral would cause more vigorous resentment, on ac- 
count of the greater emotional value of the feelings con- 
cemed. A certain tilt of the hat, although it may be very 
comfortable to the wearer, would stamp him at once as an 
uneducated brute. Other novelties in costume may 
hurt our esthetic feelings, no matter how bad the taste 
of the prevailing fashions may be. 
Another example will make clear what I mean. When 
we consider our table manners, it will readily be recog- 
nized that most of them are purely traditional, and can- 
not be given any adequate explanation. To smack one’s 
lips is considered bad style, and may excite feelings of 
disgust ; while among the Indians it would be considered 
bad taste not to smack one’s lips when invited to dinner, 
because it would suggest that the guest does not enjoy
-P-A-G-E-223
214 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
his meal. Both for the Indian and for ourselves the 
constant performance of these actions which constitute 
good table manners make it practically impossible to act 
otherwise. An attempt to act differently would not only 
be difficult on account of the lack of adjustment of mus- 
cular motions, but also on account of the strong emotional 
resistance that we should have to overcome. The emo- 
tional displeasure is also released when we see others act 
contrary to custom. To eat with people having table 
manners different from our own excites feelings of dis- 
pleasure which may rise to such an intensity as to cause 
qualmishness. Here, also, explanations are often given 
which are probably based solely on attempts to explain 
the existing manners, but which do not represent their 
historical development. We often hear that it is im- 
proper to eat with a knife because it might cut the mouth; 
but I doubt very much if this consideration has anything 
to do with the development of the custom, for the older 
type of sharp steel forks might as easily hurt the mouth 
as the blade of the knife. 
It may be well to exemplify the characteristics of out 
opposition to unwonted actions by a few additional ex- 
amples, which will help to clear up the mental processes 
that lead us to formulate the reasons for our conservatism.
-P-A-G-E-224
SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 21g 
One of the cases in which the development of such al- 
leged reasons for behavior is best traced is that‘of the — 
taboo. Although we ourselves have hardly any definite 
taboos, to an outsider our failure to use certain animals 
for food might easily appear from this point ‘of view. 
Supposing an individual accustomed to eating dogs 
should inquire among us for the reason why we do not eat 
dogs, we could only reply that it is not customary; and 
he would be justified in saying that dogs are tabooed 
among us, just as much as we are justified in speaking of 
taboos among primitive people. If we were hard pressed 
for reasons, we should probably base our aversion to 
eating dogs or horses on the seeming impropriety of 
eating animals that live with us as our friends. On the 
other hand, we are not accustomed to eat caterpillars, 
and we should probably decline to eat them from feelings 
of disgust. Cannibalism is so much abhorred, that we 
find it difficult to convince ourselves that it belongs to 
the same class of aversions as those mentioned before. 
The fundamental concept of the sacredness of human life, 
and the fact that most animals will not eat others of the 
same species, set off cannibalism as a custom by itself, 
considered as one of the most horrible aberrations of hu- 
man nature. In these three groups of aversions, disgust
-P-A-G-E-225
216 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
is probably the first feeling present in our minds, by which 
we re-act against the suggestion of partaking of these 
kinds of food. We account for our disgust by a variety 
of reasons, according to the groups of ideas with which 
the suggested act is associated in our minds. In the first 
case there is no special association, and we are satisfied 
with the simple statement of disgust. In the second case 
the most important reason seems to be an emotional one, 
although we may feel inclined, when questioned regard- 
ing the reasons of our dislike, to bring forward also habits 
of the animals in question that seem to justify our aver- 
sion. In the third case the immorality of cannibalism 
would stand forth as the one sufficient reason. 
Other examples are the numerous customs that had 
originally a religious or semi-religious aspect, and which 
are continued and explained by more or less certain utili- 
tarian theories. Such are the whole group of customs 
relating to marriages in the incest group. While the 
extent of the incest group has undergone material changes, 
the abhorrence of marriages inside the existing group is 
the same as ever; but instead of religious laws, ethical 
considerations, often explained by utilitarian concepts,are 
given as the reason for our feelings. People affected 
with loathsome diseases were once shunned because they
-P-A-G-E-226
a SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE | 217 
were believed to be stricken by God, while at present the | : 
same avoidance is due to the fear of contagion. The dis+ ‘S 
use into which profanity has fallen in English was first : 
due to religious re-action, but has come to be ane oh 
a question of good manners. : 
For another example we need go back only | a short 
period in history. It is not so many years ago that dis-' 
sension from accepted religious tenets was believed to be 
a crime. The intolerance of diverging religious views 
and the energy of persecution for heresy can be under- 
stood only when we recognize the violent feelings of out- 
raged ethical principles that were aroused by this devia- 
tion from the customary line of thought. There was no 
question as to the logical validity of the new idea. The 
mind was directly agitated by the opposition to an habit- 
ual form of thought which was so deeply rooted in each 
individual that it had come to be an integral part of his 
mental life. 
It is important to note that in all the cases mentioned 
the rationalistic explanation of the opposition to a change 
is based on that group of concepts with which the ex- 
cited emotions are intimately connected. In the case of 
costume, reasons are adduced why the new style is im- 
proper ; in the case of heresy, proof is given that the new
-P-A-G-E-227
218 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
doctrine is an attack against eternal truth; and so with 
all the others. 
I think, however, that a close introspective analysis 
shows these reasons to be only attempts to interpret 
our feelings of displeasure; that our opposition is not by 
any means dictated by conscious reasoning, but pri- 
marily by the emotional effect of the new idea which 
creates a dissonance with the habitual. 
In-all these cases the custom is obeyed so often and so 
regularly that the habitual act becomes automatic ; that 
is to say, its performance is ordinarily not combined 
with any degree of consciousness. Consequently the 
emotional value of these actions is also very slight. It is 
remarkable, however, that the more automatic an action, 
the more difficult it is to perform the opposite action, that 
it requires a very strong effort to do so, and that ordinarily 
the opposite action is accompanied by strong feelings of 
displeasure. It may also be observed that to see the 
unusual action performed by another person excites the 
strongest attention, and causes feelings of displeasure. 
Thus it happens that when an infraction of the customary 
occurs, all the groups of ideas with which the action is as- 
sociated are brought into consciousness. A dish of dog’s 
meat would bring up all the ideas of companionship; a
-P-A-G-E-228
SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 219 
cannibal feast, all the social principles that have become 
our second nature. The more automatic any. series ‘of. 
activities or a certain form of thought has become, the.’ 
gteater is the conscious effort required for breaking away 
from the old habit of acting and thinking, and the greater a 
also the displeasure, or at least the surprise, produced by vo 
an innovation. The antagonism against it is a reflex 
action accompanied by emotions not due to conscious : 
speculation. When we become conscious of this emo- 
tional re-action, we endeavor to interpret it by a process’ 
of reasoning. ‘This reason must necessarily be based on : 
the ideas which rise into consciousness as soon as a break: 
in the established custom occurs; in other words, our 
tationalistic explanation will depend upon the character 
     of the associated ideas. 
It is therefore of great importance to know hence the 7 
associated ideas are derived, particularly in how far we 
may assume that these associations are stable. It is not 
quite easy to give definite examples of changes of such 
associations in our civilization, because, on the whole, 
the rationalistic tendencies of our times have eliminated 
many of the lines of association, even where the emo- 
tional effect remains; so that the change, on the whole, is 
one from existing associations to loss of associations.
-P-A-G-E-229
220 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
We may sum up these observations by saying, that, 
while each habit is the result of historical causes, it may 
in course of time associate itself with different ideas. As 
soon as we become conscious of an association between a 
habit and a certain group of ideas, we are led to explain 
the habit by its present associations, which probably differ 
from the associations prevailing at the time when the 
habit was established. 
We will now turn to a consideration of analogous phe- 
nomena in primitive life. Here the dislike of that which 
deviates from the custom of the land is even more strongly 
marked than in our civilization. If it is not the custom 
to sleep in a house with feet turned towards the fire, a 
violation of this custom is dreaded and avoided. Tf ina 
certain society members of the same clan do not inter- 
marry, the most deep-seated abhorrence against such 
unions will arise. It is not necessary to multiply exam- 
ples, for it is a well-known fact that the more primitive 
a-people, the more it is bound by customs regulating the 
conduct of daily life in all its details. I think we are 
justified in concluding from our own experience, that as 
among ourselves, so among primitive tribes, the resistance 
to a deviation from firmly established customs is due to 
an emotional re-action, not to conscious reasoning. This
-P-A-G-E-230
  SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURI 
does not preclude the possibility that the fi: 
which became in course of time customary, 11 
due to a conscious mental process; but if; 
likely that many customs came into being, 
conscious activity. Their development must have been” 
of the same kind as that of the categories. which are re 
flected in the morphology of languages, and which can 
never have been known to the speakers of these languages. 
For instance, if we accept Cunow’s theory of the origin of 
Australian social systems,! we may very well say that 
1Some Australian tribes are divided into four exogamic groups. The 
laws of exogamy demand that a member of the first group must marry 
a member of the second group, and a member of the third group one of 
the fourth group. Cunow explains these customs by showing that when 
custom provides that a man in a tribe that is divided into two exogamic 
units, and in which only members of the same generation are allowed to 
intermarry, conditions like those found in Australia will naturally de- 
velop, if each group has a name, and one set of names are used for the 
first, third, fifth, generations, and another set of names for the second, 
fourth, sixth, generations, etc. If we should designate the two tribal 
divisions by the letters A and B, the generations by x and 2, the names 
of the four divisions would be Ar, Az, Br, B2; and in marriages in 
which is placed first the sex that determines the group to which ‘the 
ofispring belongs, we find that —

222 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
originally each generation kept by themselves, and there- 
fore marriages between members of two succeeding gen- 
erations were impossible, because only marriageable men 
and women of one generation came into contact. Later 
on, when the succeeding generations were not so diverse 
in age, and their social separation ceased, the custom had 
been ‘established, and did not lapse with the changed 
conditions. 
"There are a number of cases in which it is at least con- 
ceivable that the older customs of a people, under a new 
surrounding, develop into taboos. I think, for instance, 
that it is very likely that the Eskimo taboo forbidding 
the use of caribou and of seal on the same day may be 
due to the alternating inland and coast life of the people. 
When they hunt inland, they have no seals, and conse- 
quently can eat only caribou. When they hunt on 
the coast, they have no caribou, and consequently 
can eat only seal. The simple fact that in one season 
only caribou can be eaten, and that in another sea- 
son only seal can be eaten, may have easily led to a re- 
sistance to a change of this custom; so that from the 
fact that for a long period the two kinds of meat could 
not be eaten at the same time, the law developed that the 
two kinds of meat must not be eaten at the same time. I

thetical cases make it clear that the unconscioits origin’ 
of customs is quite conceivable, although of coutse not 
necessary. It seems, however, certain that even when 
there has been a conscious reasoning that led-to' the es- 
tablishment of a custom, it soon ceased to be conscious; 
and instead we find a direct emotional resistance to an 
infraction of the custom. 
Other actions which are considered proper or improper 
are continued solely through the force of habit; and no 
teasons are assigned for their occurrence, although the 
te-action against an infringement of the. custom may be 
strong. If among the Indians of Vancouver Island it is 
bad form for a young woman of nobility to open her 
mouth wide and to eat fast, a deviation from this custom 
would also be deeply felt, but in this case as an im- 
Propriety which would seriously damage the social stand- 
ing of the culprit. ‘The same group of feelings are con- 
cerned when a member of the nobility, even in Europe, 
marries below his or her station. In other, more trifling

cases, the overstepping of the boundaries of custom 
" merely exposes the offender to ridicule, on account of the 
impropriety of the act. All these cases belong psychologi- 
cally to the same group of emotional re-actions against 
breaks with established automatic habits. 
It might seem that in primitive society opportunity 
could hardly be given to bring into consciousness the 
strong emotional resistance against infractions of cus- 
toms, because they are rigidly adhered to. There is one 
feature of social life, however, that tends to keep the con- 
servative attachment to customary actions before the 
minds of the people. This is the education of the young. 
The child in whom the habitual behavior of his sur- 
roundings has not yet developed will acquire much of it 
by unconscious imitation. In many cases, however, it 
_Wwill act in a way different from the customary manner, 
and will be corrected by its elders. Any one familiar 
with primitive life will know that the children are con- 
stantly exhorted to follow the example of their elders, and 
every collection of carefully recorded traditions contains 
numerous references to advice given by parents to chil- 
dren, impressing them with the duty to observe the cus- 
toms of the tribe. The greater the emotional value of a 
custom, the stronger will be the desire to inculcate it in

I believe that these conditions e:

Clear insight into the secrets of the world, manifests itself 
at a very early time, and it is therefore not surprising 
that man in all stages of culture begins to sponiste : 
on the motives of his own actions. . 
As I have explained before, there can be no conscious 
motive for many of these, and for this reason the ten- 
dency develops to discover the motives that may deter- 
mine our customary behavior. This is the reason why, 
in all stages of culture, customary actions are made the 
subject of secondary explanations that have nothing to 
do with their historical origin, but which are inferences 
based upon the general knowledge possessed by the people. - } :
-P-A-G-E-235
226 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
I think the existence of such secondary interpretations 
of customary actions is one of the most important anthro- 
pological phenomena, and we have seen that it is hardly 
less common in our own society than in more primitive 
societies. It is a common observation that we desire or 
act first, and then. try to justify our desires and our actions. 
When, on account of our early bringing-up, we act with 
a certain political party, most of us are not prompted by 
a clear conviction of the justice of the principles of our 
party, but we do so because we have been taught to re- 
spect it as the right party to which to belong. Then only 
do we justify our standpoint by trying to convince our- 
selves that these principles are the correct ones. With- 
out reasoning of this kind, the stability and geographical 
distribution of political parties as well as of church de- 
nominations would be entirely unintelligible. A candid 
examination of our own minds convinces us that the aver- 
age man, in by far the majority of cases, does not deter- 
mine his actions by reasoning, but that he first acts, and 
" then justifies or explains his acts by such secondary con- 
siderations as are current among us. 
We have discussed so far only the class of actions in 
which a break with the customary brings into conscious- 
ness the emotional value of the action in question, and

The essential result of this inquiry is the conclusion 
that the origin of customs of primitive man must not be 
looked for in rational processes. Most investigators who 
have tried to clear up the history of customs and taboos 
express the view that their origin lies in speculations on 
the relations between man and nature; that to primitive 
man the world is filled with agenciesof superhuman power, 
which may harm man at the slightest provocation, and 
that attempts to avoid conflict with these powers dictate 
the innumerable superstitious regulations, The impres-

sion is given that the habits and opinions of primitive 
man had been formed by conscious reasoning. It seems 
evident, however, that this whole line of thought would 
remain consistent if it is assumed that the processes were 
all subconscious. : 
Even granting this, I believe that these theories need 
extension, because it would seem that many cases of this 
kind may have arisen without any kind of reasoning, con- 
scious or subconscious; for instance, cases in which a 
custom became established by the general conditions of 
life, and came into consciousness as soon as these con- 
-ditions changed. I do not doubt at all that there are 
cases in which customs originated by more or less con- 
scious reasoning; but I am just as certain that others 
originated without, and that our theories should cover both 
points. 
The study of primitive life exhibits a large number of 
associations of a different type, which are not so easily 
explained. Certain patterns of associated ideas may 
be recognized in all types of culture. 
Sombre colors and depressed feelings are closely con- 
nected in our minds, although not in those of peoples of 
foreign culture. Noise seems inappropriate in a place of 
sadness, although among primitive people the loud wail of

The most extended domain of such customs is that of 
titual. Accompanying important actions we find nu- 
merous stated ritual forms which are constantly applied, : 
although their original significance has been lost entirely. 
Many of them are so old that their origin must be Tooked, 
for in antiquity or even in prehistoric times. Tn our day : 
the domain of ritual is restricted, but in primitive cal 
ture it pervades the whole life. Not a single action ‘of 
any importance can be performed that is not. accom 
panied by proscribed rites of more or less elaborate form. 
Tt has been proved in many cases that rites ‘ate more 
stable than their explanations; that they symbolize dif-

ferent ideas among different people and at different times. 
The diversity of rites is so great, and their occurrence so 
universal, that here the greatest possible variety of asso- 
ciations is found. 
It seems to my mind that we may apply this point of 
view to many of the most fundamental and inexplicable 
traits of primitive life, and that when considered as 
associations between heterogeneous thoughts and activi- 
ties, their rise and history become more readily intelli- 
gible. 
In our modern society the consideration of cosmic phe- 
nomena is constantly associated with the efforts to give 
adequate explanations for them, based on the principle of 
causality. In primitive society the consideration of the 
same phenomena leads to a number of typical associa- 
tions which differ from our own, but which occur with 
remarkable regularity among tribes living in the most re- 
mote parts of the world. An excellent instance of this 
kind is the regular association of observations relating to 
cosmic phenomena with purely human happenings; in 
other words, the occurrence of nature myths. It seems 
to my mind that the characteristic trait of nature myths 
is the association between the observed cosmic events 
and what might be called a novelistic plot based on

A number of other examples will demonstrate that the 
kind of association here referred to is quite common in 
Primitive life. An excellent instance is furnished, by. 
certain characteristics of primitive decorative art. With: 
us almost the sole object of decorative art is esthetic.    
We wish to beautify the objects that are decorated. We: 
Tecognize a certain appropriateness of decorative motives. 
in accordance with the uses to which objects are to be put,. 
and the emotional effect of the decorative motive. In 
Primitive life the conditions are quite different... Ex-- 
tended investigations on decorative art in all continents, 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
232 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
have proved that practically everywhere the decorative 
design is associated with a certain symbolic significance. 
There is hardly a case known where a primitive tribe can- 
not give some sort of explanation for the designs in use. 
In some cases the symbolic significance may be exceed- 
ingly weak, but ordinarily it is highly developed. The 
triangular and quadrangular designs of our Plains Indians, 
for instance, almost always convey definite symbolic 
meanings. They may be records of warlike deeds, they 
may be prayers, or they may in some way convey other 
ideas relating to the supernatural. It would almost seem 
that among primitive tribes decorative art for its own 
sake does not exist. The only analogies in modern dec- 
orative art are such as the use of the flag, of the cross, 
or of emblems of secret societies, for decorative purposes ; 
but their frequency is insignificant as compared to the 
general symbolic tendencies of primitive art. Thus it 
will be seen that we have here again a type of association 
in primitive society quite different from the type of asso- 
ciation found among ourselves. Among primitive people 
the esthetic motive is combined with the symbolic, while 
in modern life the esthetic motive is either quite inde- 
pendent or associated with utilitarian ideas. 
On the North Pacific coast of America the animal de-
-P-A-G-E-242
SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 233 
sign, which is found in many other parts of the world, has 
associated itself firmly with the totemic idea, and has led 
to an unparalleled application of animal motives. This 
may also have helped to preserve the realistic character 
of this art. Among the Sioux the high valuation of mili- 
tary prowess, and the habit of exploiting deeds of war be- 
fore the tribe, have been the causes that led the men to 
associate the decoration on their garments with events 
of war; so that among them a military symbolism has 
developed, while the women of the same tribe explain 
the same design in an entirely different manner (Wissler). 
It seems to me that in this last case we have no particular 
dificulty in following the line of thought that leads to the 
association between forms of decoration and military 
ideas, although in general our minds require a much more 
conscious effort than that of primitive man. The very 
fact of the well-nigh universal occurrence of decorative 
symbolism shows that this association must establish 
itself automatically and without conscious reasoning. 
th both mythology and art the tendency to give ration-. 
alistic explanations for the peculiar associations that have’ 
developed may be observed in those cases in which styles 
of art or myths are borrowed. The fact that decorative 
art among primitive people is almost everywhere sym-
-P-A-G-E-243
234 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
bolic does not preclude the possibility of designs, and 
even of the whole style, of one region, being borrowed 
from the people of another region. This has been the 
case, for instance, among the tribes of our Northwestern 
Plains, who have borrowed much of their art from their 
more southern neighbors; but they have not adopted at 
the same time its symbolical interpretations, but invented 
interpretations of their own. I imagine that this is the 
outcome of a mental process which set in when the de- 
signs were found pleasing, and, according to the general 
character of primitive thought, a symbolic interpretation 
was expected. This was then secondarily invented in 
accordance with the ideas current among the tribe. 
The same observation may be made in primitive my- 
thology. The same kind of tales are current over enor- 
mous areas, but the mythological use to which they are 
put is locally quite different. Thus an ordinary adven- 
ture relating to the exploits of some animal may some- 
times be made use of to explain some of its peculiar 
characteristics. At other times it may be made use of to 
explain certain customs, or even the origin of certain con- 
stellations in the sky. There is not the slightest doubt in 
my mind that the tale as such is older than its mytho- 
logical significance. The characteristic feature of the
-P-A-G-E-244
sh 
TT SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 235 
development of the nature myth is, first, that the tale has 
associated itself with attempts to explain cosmic conditions 
(this has been referred to before); and, secondly, that 
when primitive man became concious of the cosmic prob- 
lem, he ransacked the entire field of his knowledge until he 
happened to find something that could be fitted to the 
problem in question, giving an explanation satisfactory to 
his mind. While the classification of concepts, the types 
of association, and the resistance to change of automatic 
acts, developed unconsciously, many of the secondary 
explanations are due to conscious reasoning. 
Iwill give still another example of a form of association 
characteristic of primitive society. In modern society, 
social organization, including the grouping of families, is 
essentially based on blood-relationship and on the social 
functions performed by each individual. Except in so 
far as the Church concerns itself with birth, marriage, 
and death, there is no connection between social organ- 
ization and religious belief. These conditions are quite 
different in primitive society, where we find an inextri- 
cable association of ideas and customs relating to society 
and to religion. As in art form tends to associate itself 
with ideas entirely foreign to it, so the social unit tends 
to associate itself with various impressions of nature,
-P-A-G-E-245
236 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
particularly with the divisions of the animal world. This 
form of association seems to me the fundamental trait 
of totemism as found among many American tribes, as 
well as in Australia, Melanesia, and in Africa. I have 
described before its characteristic trait, which consists 
in a peculiar connection that is believed to exist be- 
tween a certain class of objects, generally animals, and a 
certain social group. Further analysis shows very clearly 
that one of the underlying ideas of totemism is the ex- 
istence of definite groups of man that are not allowed 
to intermarry, and that the limitations of these groups 
are determined by considerations of blood-relationship. 
The religious ideas found in totemism refer to the per- 
sonal relation.of man to certain classes of supernatural 
powers, and: the typical trait of totemism is the associa- 
tion of certain kinds of supernatural power with certain 
social groups. This granted, the establishment of asso- 
ciation with the supernatural world becomes at least in- 
telligible. That such feelings are not by any means 
improbable, or even rare, is sufficiently shown by the ex- 
clusiveness of the European high nobility, or by the na- 
tional emotions in their pronounced form. It is not at all 
difficult to understand how an overbearing enthusiasm 
of self-appreciation of a community may become a power-

Sa SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 237 
ful emotion or a passion, which, on account of the lack of 
tational explanation of the world, will tend to associate 
the members of the community with all that is good and 
powerful. Psychologically, therefore, we may compare 
totemism with those familiar forms of society in which 
certain social classes claim privileges by the grace of God, 
or where the patron saint of a community favors its mem- 
bers with his protection. It will be recognized. that we 
have here again a type of association in primitive society 
which has completely changed with the development of 
dvilization, 
However these associations may have been brought 
about, there is no doubt that they do exist, and that, 
Psychologically considered, they are of the same charac- 
ter as those previously discussed, and that the ration- 
alizing mind of man soon lost the historic thread, and re- 
interpreted the established customs in conformity with 
the general trend of thought of his culture. We are 
therefore justified in concluding that these customs must 
also be studied by the pragmatic method, because their 
Present associations are not likely to be original, but 
tather secondary. 
It is perhaps venturesome to discuss at the present 
moment the origin of these types of association; yet it
-P-A-G-E-247
238 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
may be admissible to dwell on a few of the most general- 
ized facts which seem to characterize primitive culture 
as compared to civilization. From our point of view, 
the striking features of primitive culture are the great 
number of associations of entirely heterogeneous groups 
of phenomena, such as natural phenomena and individ- 
_ ual emotion, social groupings and religious concepts, 
decorative art and symbolic interpretation. These tend 
to disappear with the approach to our present civiliza- 
tion, although a careful analysis reveals the persistence 
of many, and the tendency of each automatic action to 
establish its own associations according to the mental 
relations in which it regularly occurs. One of the great 
changes that has taken place may perhaps best be ex- 
pressed by saying that in primitive culture the impres- 
sions of the outer world are associated intimately with 
subjective impressions, which they call forth regularly, 
but which are determined largely by the social sur- 
roundings of the individual. Gradually it is recognized 
that these connections are more uncertain than others 
that remain the same for all mankind, and in all forms 
of social surroundings; and thus sets in the gradual 
elimination of one subjective association after another, 
which culminates in the scientific method of the present
-P-A-G-E-248

RR SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 239 
day. We may express this also by saying that when we 
have our attention directed to a certain concept which 
has a whole fringe of incident concepts related to it, 
we at once associate it with that group which is repre- 
sented by the category of causality. When the same con- 
cept appears in the mind of primitive man, it associates 
itself with those concepts related to it by emotional 
States, 
If this is true, then the associations of the primitive 
mind are heterogeneous, and ours homogeneous and con- 
sistent only from our own point of view. To the mind of 
Primitive man, only his own associations can be rational: 
Ours must appear to him just as heterogeneous as his to _ 
us, because the bond between the phenomena of the 
World, as it appears after the elimination of their emo- 
tional associations, which is being established with in- 
easing knowledge, does not exist for him, while we can 
no longer feel the subjective associations that govern his 
mind, 
This peculiarity of association is also another expres- 
sion of the conservatism of primitive culture and the 
changeability of many features of our civilization. We 
tried to show that the resistance to change is largely due 
to emotional sources, and that in primitive culture emo-
-P-A-G-E-249
240 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
tional associations are the prevailing type: hence re- 
sistanceagainst the new. In our civilization, on the other 
hand, many actions are performed merely as means to a 
rational end. They do not enter sufficiently deeply into 
our minds to establish connections which would give them 
emotional values: hence our readiness to change. We 
recognize, however, that we cannot remodel, without 
serious emotional resistance, any of the fundamental lines 
of thought and action which are determined by our early 
education, and which form the subconscious basis of all 
our activities. This is evinced by the attitude of civilized 
communities towards religion, politics, art, and the funda- 
mental concepts of science. 
In the average individual among primitive tribes, rea- 
soning cannot overcome this emotional resistance, and it 
therefore requires a destruction of the existing emotional 
associations by more powerful means to bring about a 
change. This may be effected by some event which 
stirs up the mind of the people to its depths, or by eco- 
nomic and political changes against which resistance is 
impossible. In civilization there is a constant readiness 
to modify those activities that have no emotional value. 
This is true not only of activities designed to meet prac- 
tical ends, but also of others that have lost their associa-

tions, and that have become subject to fashion. There 
remain, however, others which are retained with great 
tenacity, and which hold their own against reasoning, 
because their strength lies in their emotional values. 
The history of the progress of science yields example 
after example of the power of resistance belonging to old 
: ideas, even after increasing knowledge of the world has 
undermined the ground on which they were erected. 
Their overthrow is not brought about until a new genera- 
tion has arisen, to whom the old is no longer dear and 
hear. 
Besides this, there are a thousand activities and modes 
of thought that constitute our daily life, —of which we 
are not conscious at all until we come into contact with 
other types of life, or until we are prevented from acting 
according to our custom, — that cannot in any way 
be claimed to be more reasonable than others, and to 
Which, nevertheless, we cling. These, it would seem, are 
hardly less numerous in civilized than in primitive culture, 
because they constitute the whole series of well-estab- 
lished habits according to which the necessary actions of 
ordinary every-day life are performed, and which are 
leamed less by instruction than by imitation. 
We may also express these conclusions in another

‘form. While in the logical processes of the mind we find 
a decided tendency, with the development of civilization, 
to eliminate traditional elements, no such marked de- 
crease in the force of traditional elements can be found 
in our activities, These are controlled by custom almost 
as much among ourselves as they are among primitive 
man. We have seen why this must be the case. The 
mental processes which enter into the development of 
judgments are based largely upon associations with pre- 
vious judgments. This process of association is the same 
among primitive men as among civilized men, and the 
difference consists largely in the modification of the 
* traditional material with which our new perceptions amal- 
gamate. Inthe case of activities, the conditions aresome- 
what different. Here tradition manifests itself in an ac- 
tion performed by the individual. The more frequently 
' this action is repeated, the more firmly it will become 
established, and the less will be the conscious equivalent 
accompanying the action; so that customary actions 
which are of very frequent repetition become entirely 
unconscious. Hand in hand with this decrease of con- 
sciousness goes an increase in the emotional value of the 
omission of such activities, and still more of the per- 
formance of actions contrary to custom. A greater will-
-P-A-G-E-252
SOME TRAITS OF PRIMITIVE CULTURE 243 
power is required to inhibit an action which has become 
well established ; and combined with this effort of the will- 
power are feelings of intense displeasure. 
Thus an important change from primitive culture to 
civilization seems to consist in the gradual elimination of 
what might be called the social associations of sense-im~ 
pressions and of activities, for which intellectual associa- 
tions are gradually substituted. This process is accom- 
Patied by a loss of conservatism, which, however, does not 
ertend over the field of habitual activities that do. not 
come into consciousness, and only to a slight extent over 
those generalizations which are the foundation of 
knowledge imparted in the course of education.

NIX. SUMMARY 
I may now be allowed to pass once more briefly over 
the whole ground that we have covered. First of all, 
we tried to understand the reasons for our belief in the 
existence of gifted races and of others less favorably en- 
dowed, and found that it was based essentially on the 
assumption that higher achievement is necessarily asso- 
diated with higher mental faculty, and that therefore the 
features of those races that in our judgment have accom- 
plished most are characteristics of mental superiority. 
We subjected these assumptions to a critical study, 
and discovered little evidence to support them. So 
many other causes were found to influence the progress 
of civilization, accelerating or retarding it, and similar 
processes were active in so many different races, that, on 
the whole, hereditary traits, more particularly hereditary 
higher gifts, were at best a possible, but not a necessary, 
element determining the degree of advancement of a race. 
The second part of the fundamental assumption seemed 
even less likely. Hardly any evidence could be adduced 
244 :

to show that the anatomical characteristics of the races 
possessing the highest civilization were phylogenetically 
more advanced than those on lower grades of culture. 
The various races differ in this respect; the specifically 
human characteristics being most highly developed, some 
ip one race, some in another. Furthermore, it appeared 
thata direct relation between physical habitus and mental 
endowment does not exist. 
Atter thus clearing away the racial prejudice, the most _ 
formidable obstacle to a clear understanding of our 
problem, we turned to an investigation of the question 
Whether human types are stable, more particularly 
Whether environment may change the anatomical struc- 
ture of man, and thus of his mental make-up, and to the 
conelated question, what man owes to heredity. In 
tating the general question of the stability of human 
types, we described some rudimentary organs and some 
Peculiar anatomical traits which prove a phylogenetic 
development of man, traces of which were found in all 
taces, The influence of environment was demonstrated 
in all those cases in which changes in the rate of growth 
flected the final form of the body ; and we saw particu- 
latly that early arrest of development does not necessa- 
tly mean unfavorable development, because in many
-P-A-G-E-255
246 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
cases the rapidity and short period of development 
seemed favorable elements. We saw that other changes 
in human types may be brought about by selection, and 
that environment itself seems to have a direct effect upon 
bodily form, as was proved by the changes of type due to 
the transfer from a rural environment to city life, and 
to the immigration of various nationalities from Europe 
to America, We saw, however, that there is no evidence 
at present to prove that these changes exceed certain 
definite limits. Special attention was directed to those 
features of the bodily form that characterize man as a 
domesticated animal, and which are due to the peculiari- 
ties of human nutrition, and which facilitate crossing of 
distinct types. The mentality of man appeared also to 
be influenced by the degree of his domestication. 
Turning to the influence of heredity, we recognized 
that by it are determined all the most fundamental fea- 
tures of each race and type of man, and that often the 
individual reverts to the traits of the one or the other 
of his parents, or of his remote ancestors, in such manner 
that one trait may belong to one ancestor, another to 
another, This tendency seemed to explain the develop- 
ment of local types, and we recognized the importance 
of the breaking of old lines of heredity, in cases of in-

SUMMARY 247 
termarriages of branches of the same race that had long 
been separated. By analogy we concluded that possibly, 
ot probably, similar tendencies may exist in the mental 
life of man. 
After we had thus gained an insight into the physical 
characteristics of the races and social groups of man, we 
took up a consideration of his mental life. The mental 
traits common to all mankind are those which appear 
by contrasting man with animals; and we pointed out _ 
briefly that articulate language, the use of implements, 
and the power of reasoning, belong to all members of the 
human species as opposed to the higher animals. Before 
Weentered into the comparison of the mental life of primi- 
tivemanand of civilized man, we had to clearawayanum- 
ber of misconceptions caused by the current descriptions 
of the life of primitive man. We saw that the oft-re- 
peated claim that he has no power to inhibit impulses, no 
Power of attention, no originality of thought, no power of 
Clear reasoning, could not be maintained; and that all 
these faculties are common to primitive man and to civi- 
Iked man, although they are excited on different occasions. 
This led us to a brief consideration of the question 
Whether the hereditary mental faculty was improved by 
CWvilzation, an opinion that did not seem plausible to us.
-P-A-G-E-257
248 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
The study of the problem of the relation of racial de- 
scent to cultural advancement required a determination of 
the question in how far these are correlated. We en- 
deavored to gain an insight into this problem by following 
out the relations between human types, languages, and 
cultures. A general lack of correlation appeared, which 
led us to infer that the present types of man are older 
than the present linguistic families, and that each type 
developed a number of languages. Since these must be 
considered the product of the mental activities of each 
type, uninfluenced or almost uninfluenced by other types, 
we tried to discover whether one language could be shown 
to be superior to others, and whether some languages 
‘ made higher forms of thought impossible. The results 
of this inquiry were quite analogous to those obtained in 
| our inquiry into the physical characteristics of man, and 
| showed similar traits in all languages, and also that lan- 
guages were moulded by thought, not thought by lan- 
| guages. 
"There still seemed to be a possibility of proving the 
backwardness of certain tribes, if it could be shown that 
members of certain races were all on early levels of cul- 
ture, while those of other races had independently 
reached later stages of development. This would pre-
-P-A-G-E-258
SUMMARY 249 
suppose that the general course of cultural development is 
the same everywhere, and that types of culture can be 
ascribed to definite stages of development. The theory 
of such general parallelism of the history of human cul- 
ture is based on the similarity of cultural traits in all parts 
of the world, Our analysis showed that the similarities 
“were more apparent than real, that they often developed 
by convergent development from distinct sources, and 
that not all stages have been present in all types of cul- 
tures, Thus all attempts to correlate racial types and 
cultural stages failed us, and we concluded that cultural 
stage is essentially a phenomenon dependent upon his- 
torical causes, regardless of race. 
Finally we attempted to describe the mental charac- 
teristics of primitive man, regardless of his racial affilia- 
tions, We pointed out the differences in principles of 
classification of experience found on different social 
stages, and the differences in logical conclusions reached 
by primitive and civilized man owing to the difference in 
the character of knowledge accumulated by preceding 
Benerations. We then followed out the emotional asso- 
ations of habitual activities, and the tendency to in- 
Vent for them rationalistic explanations. We found 
them quite common in primitive life, and noticed the

great variety of ideas and activities that were thus 
brought into contact so as to produce a number of pecu- 
liar concepts and activities. Other peculiar associations 
are not due to strong emotional causes, but to all of them 
is common the tendency of taking on rationalistic ex- 
planations of varied character. The change from primi- 
tive to civilized society includes a lessening of the num- 
ber of the emotional associations, and an improvement of 
the traditional material that enters into our habitual 
. mental operations.

Our previous considerations make clear the hypotheti-

importance. However, it should be solved on the basis 
of scientific knowledge, not according to emotional clamor. 
Under present conditions, we seem to be called upon to 
formulate definite answers to questions that require the 
most painstaking and unbiassed investigation; and the 
more urgent the demand for final conclusions, the more 
needed is a critical examination of the phenomena and of 
the available methods of solution. 
Let us first represent to our minds the facts relating to 
the origins of our nation. When British immigrants first 
flocked to the Atlantic coast of North America, they 
found a continent inhabited by Indians. The population 
of the country was thin, and vanished comparatively rap- 
idly before the influx of the more numerous Europeans. 
The settlement of the Dutch on the Hudson, of the 
Germans in Pennsylvania, not to speak of other national- 
ities, is familiar to all of us. We know that the founda- 
tions of our modern state were laid by Spaniards in the 
Southwest, by French in the Mississippi Basin and in 
the region of the Great Lakes, but that the British im- 
migration far outnumbered that of other nationalities. 
In the composition of our people, the indigenous element 
has never played an important réle, except for very 
short periods. In regions where thesettlement progressed

cmmamaes, RACE PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES 25; 
fora long time entirely by the immigration of unmarried 
males of the white race, families of mixed blood have 
been of some importance during the period of gradual de- 
velopment, but they have never become sufficiently nu- 
merous in any populous part of the United States to be 
considered as an important element in our population. 
Without any doubt, Indian blood flows in the veins of 
quite a number of our people, but the proportion is 80 
insignificant that it may well be disregarded. 
Much more important has been the introduction of the 
negro, whose numbers have increased many fold, so that 
they form now about one-eighth of our whole nation. 
For a certain length of time the immigration of Asiatic 
tations seemed likely to become of importance in the de- 
velopment of our country, but the political events of.re- 
cent years have tended to decrease their immediate im- 
Portance considerably, although we do not venture to 
Predict that the relation of Asiatics and white Americans 
may not become a most important problem in the future. 
These facts, however, are familiar to all of us, and stand 
out clearly to our minds. 
More recent is the problem of the immigration of 
People representing all the nationalities of Europe, west- 
€m Asia, and northern Africa. While until late in the
-P-A-G-E-263
254 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
second half of the nineteenth century the immigrants con- 
sisted almost entirely of people of northwestern Europe, 
natives of Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzer- 
land, Holland, Belgium, and France, the composition of 
the immigrant masses has changed completely since that 
time. With the economic development of Germany, 
German immigration has dwindled down; while at the 
same time Italians, the various Slavic peoples of Austria, 
Russia, and the Balkan Peninsula, Hungarians, Rou- 
manians, East European Hebrews, not to mention the 
numerous other nationalities, have arrived in ever in- 
creasing numbers. There is no doubt that these people 
of eastern and southern. Europe represent physical types 
distinct from the physical type of northwestern Europe} 
and it is clear, even to the most casual observer, that 
their present social standards differ fundamentally from 
our own. Since the number of new arrivals may be 
counted in normal years by hundreds of thousands, the 
question may well be asked, What will be the result of this 
influx of types distinct from our own, if it is to continue 
for a considerable length of time? 
It is often claimed that the phenomenon of mixture 
presented in the United States is unique; that a similar 
intermixture has never occurred before in the world’s

SSI RS ROTA RACE PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES ass - 
- history; and that our nation is destined to become what 
some writers choose to term a “mongrel” nation in a 
sense that has never been equalled anywhere. : a 
When we try to analyze the phenomenon in greater de- 
tail, and in the light of our knowledge of conditions in 
Europe as well as in other continents, this view does not. 4, 
seem tome tenable. In speaking of European types, we - 
are accustomed to consider them as, comparatively 
speaking, pure stocks. It is easy to show that this view. 
iserroneous. It is only necessary to look at a map illus-": 
trating the racial types of any European country — like : 
Italy, for instance — to see that local divergence is the 
characteristic feature, uniformity of type the exception. 
Thus Dr. Ridolfo Livi, in his fundamental investigations 
on the anthropology of Italy, has shown that the types 
of the extreme north and of the extreme south are quite © 
distinct, —- the former tall, short-headed, with a consider- 
able sprinkling of blond and blue-eyed individuals; the’ 
latter short, Iong-headed, and remarkably dark. The 
transition from one type to the other is, on the whole, 
Guite gradual; but, like isolated islands, distinct types 
occur here and there. The region of Lucca in Tuscany, 
and the district of Naples, are examples of this kind, which 2 
may be explained as due to the survival of an older 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
256 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
stock, to the intrusion of new types, or to a peculiar in- 
fluence of environment. 
Historical evidence is quite in accord with the results 
derived from the investigation of the distribution of 
modern types. In the earliest times we find on the penin- 
sula of Italy groups of heterogeneous people, the lin- 
guistic relationships of many of which have remained 
obscure up to the present time. From the earliest prehis- 
toric times on, we see wave after wave of people invading 
Italy from the north. Very early Greeks settled in the 
greater part of southern Italy, and Phoenician influence 
was well established on the west coast of the peninsula. 
A lively intercourse existed between Italy and northern 
Africa. Slaves of Berber blood were imported, and have 
. left their traces, Slave trade continued to bring new 
blood into the country until quite recent times, and Livi 
believes that he can trace the type of Crimean slaves who 
were introduced late in the middle ages in the region of 
Venice. In the course of the centuries, the migrations 
of Celtic and Teutonic tribes, the conquests of the Nor- 
smans, the contact with Africa, have added their share to 
the mixture of people on the Italian peninsula. 
The fates of other parts of Europe were no less diversi- 
fied, The Pyrenean Peninsula, which at present seems
-P-A-G-E-266
RACE PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES 257 
to be one of the most isolated parts of Europe, had a most 
checkered history. The earliest inhabitants of whom we 
know were presumably related to the Basques of the Pyre- , 
nees. These were subjected to Oriental influences in the 
pre-Mycenzan period, to Punic influences, to Celtic in- 
vasions, Roman colonization, Teutonic invasions, the 
Moorish conquest, and later on to the peculiar selective 
process that accompanied the driving-out of the Moors 
" and the Jews. 
England was not exempt from vicissitudes of this kind. 
It seems plausible that at a very early period, the type 
which is now found principally in Wales. and in some 
parts of Ireland occupied the greater portion of the 
| islands. It was swamped by successive waves of Celtic, 
Roman, and Anglo-Saxon migration. Thus. we find 
: change everywhere. 
¥ The history of the migrations of the Goths, the inva- 
"ions of the Huns, who in the short interval of one century 
moved their habitations from the borders of China into 
the very centre of Europe, are proofs of the enormous 
    i 4 changes in population that have taken place in early 
times, 
Slow colonization has also brought about fundamental 
! changes in blood as well as in diffusion of languages and 
8
-P-A-G-E-267
258 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
cultures. Perhaps the most striking recent example of 
. this change is presented by the gradual Germanization of 
the region east of the Elbe River, where, after the Teu- 
tonic migrations, people speaking Slavic languages had - 
settled. The gradual absorption of Celtic communities, 
of the Basque, in ancient times the great Roman coloniza- 
tion, and later the Arab conquest of North Africa, are 
examples of similar processes. 
Intermixture in early times was not by any means con- 
fined to peoples which, although diverse in language and 
culture, were of fairly uniform‘’type. On the contrary, 
the most diverse types of southern Europe, northern 
Europe, eastern Europe, and western Europe, not to men- 
tion the elements which poured into Europe from Asia 
and Africa, have been participants in this long-continued 
intermixture. 
There is, however, one fundamental difference in re- 
gard to the early European migrations and the modern 
transatlantic migration. On the whole, the former took 
place at a period when the density of population was, com- 
paratively speaking, small. There is no doubt that the 
number of individuals concerned in the formation of the 
modern types of Great Britain were comparatively few as 
compared with the millions who come together to form a
-P-A-G-E-268
RACE PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES 259 
new nation in the United States; and it is obvious that 
the process of amalgamation which takes’ place in com- 
munities that must be counted by millions differs in 
character from the process of amalgamation that takes 
place in communities that may be counted by thou- 
sands. Setting aside social barriers, which in early times 
as well as now undoubtedly tended to keep intermingling 
peoples separate, it would seem that in the more populous 
communities of modern times a greater permanence of 
the single combining elements might occur, owing to their 
larger numbers, which make the opportunities for segre- 
gation more favorable. 
Among the smaller communities the process of amal- 
gamation must have been an exceedingly rapid one. 
After the social distinctions have once been obliterated, 
pure descendants of one of the component types decrease 
greatly in number, and the fourth generation of a people 
consisting originally of distinct elements will be almost 
homogeneous. I shall revert to this phenomenon later 
on, 
It might be objected to this point of view, that the very 
diversity of local types in Europe. proves the homo- 
geneity of race types, — as, for instance, of the north- 
Western European type, the Mediterranean type, the East
-P-A-G-E-269
260 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
European type, or the Alpine type, — but it must be re- 
membered that we have historical proof of the process of 
mixture, and that the relative number of component ele- 
ments is sufficient to account for the present conditions. 
I think we may dismiss the assumption of the exist- 
‘ence of a pure type in any part of Europe, and of a process 
of mongrelization in America different from anything 
that has taken place for thousands of years in Europe. 
Neither are we right in assuming that the phenomenon 
is one of a more rapid intermixture than the one prevail- 
ing in olden times. The difference is based essentially 
in the masses of individuals concerned in the process. 
If we confine our consideration for the present to the 
intermixture of European types in America, I think it will 
be clear, from what has been said before, that the con- 
cern that is felt by many in regard to the continuance of 
racial purity of our nation is to a great extent imaginary. 
The history of Europe proves that there has been no 
racial purity anywhere for exceedingly long periods, 
neither has the continued intermixture of European types 
shown any degrading effect upon any of the European 
nationalities. It would be just as easy to prove that 
those nations that have been least disturbed have lacked 
the stimulus to further advance, and have passed through
-P-A-G-E-270
ome RACE PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES 261 
periods of quiescence. The history of Spain might be in- 
terpreted as an instance of an occurrence of this kind. 
The question as to the actual effects of intermixturewill . 
not, however, be answered by a generalized historical 
treatment such as we have attempted here. The ad- 
vocates of the theory of a degradation of type by the in- 
flux of so-called “lower” types, will not be silenced by 
teference to earlier mixtures in Europe, the course of 
which can no longer be traced in actual detail; for we do : 
not know to what extent actual intermarriages have taken 
Place, and what the development of families of mixed de- 
sent as compared with those of pure descent has been. 
It seems necessary that the problem should be -ap- 
proached from a biological standpoint. It has seemed 
¥ell, however, to gain first a clearer view of the historical 
tations of our problem. A knowledge of the events of 
the past tends to lay our apprehensions, that make the 
Problem exciting, and which for this reason fill the ob- 
server with a strong bias for the results which he fears or 
desires, . 
Two questions stand out prominently in the study of 
the physical characteristics of the immigrant population. 
The first is the question of the influence of selection and 
‘vironment in the migration from Europe to America.
-P-A-G-E-271
262 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
The second is the question of the influence of inter- 
mixture. 
We have been able to throw some light upon both of 
these. 
- We found that the types which come to our shores do 
not remain stable, but show such important modifications, 
that many of the differences of the human types of Europe 
seem rather ephemeral than permanent, determined more 
by environment than by heredity. The characteristics 
which belong to the influences of environment belong to 
the most fundamental traits of the body. Stature, form 
of head, and size of face, seem to be equally subject to 
these influences; and the modifications are the more 
marked, the less developed the organ in question at the 
time of birth, the longer it is therefore subject to the in- 
fluences of environment. This fact allows us to assert 
with a high degree of confidence that mental traits as well 
as physical traits will be modified by the effect of environ- 
ment. When, furthermore, we recall that we could not 
discover any proofs of the superiority of one type over 
another, we may feel safe when we state that the dangers 
to the vigor of the American nation; due to an influx of 
alien European types, is imaginative, not real. 
A number of data have also been obtained for a better
-P-A-G-E-272
RACE PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES 263 
understanding of the significance of race-mixture. Let us. 
recall that one of the most powerful agents modifying 
human types is the breaking-up of the continuance of 
certain strains in small communities by a process of rapid 
migration, which occurs both in Europe and in America, 
but with much greater rapidity in our country, ‘because » 
the heterogeneity of descent of the people is much greater’ 
than in the countries of Europe. : 
What effect these processes may have upon the ulti- 
mate type and variability of the American people: can- 
not be determined at the present time; but no evidence 
is available that would allow us to expect a lower status 
of the developing new types of America. Much remains 
to be done in the study of this subject; and, considering 
our lack of knowledge of the most elementary facts that 
determine the outcome of this process, I feel that it be- 
hooves us to be most cautious in our reasoning, and par- 
ticularly to refrain from all sensational formulations -of 
the problem that are liable to add to the prevalent lack 
of calmness in its consideration; the more so, since the 
answer to these questions concerns the welfare of millions 
of people. . 
The problem is one in regard to which speculation as. 
easy as accurate studies are difficult. Basing. our: ur ange:
-P-A-G-E-273
264 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
ments on ill-fitting analogies with the animal and plant 
world, we may speculate on the effects of intermixture 
upon the development of new types — as though the mix- 
ture that is taking place in America were in any sense, 
except a sociological one, different from the mixtures 
that have taken place in Europe for thousands of years; 
looking for a general degradation, for reversion to remote 
ancestral types, or towards the evolution of a new ideal 
type — as fancy or personal inclination may impel us. 
We may enlarge on the danger of the impending sub- 
mergence of the northwest European type, or glory in the 
prospect of its dominance over all others. Would it not 
be a safer course to investigate the truth or fallacy of each 
theory rather than excite the public mind by indulgence 
in the fancies of our speculation? That these are an im- 
portant help in the attainment of truth, I do not deny; 
but they must not be promulgated before they have been 
subjected to a searching analysis, lest the credulous 
public mistake fancy for truth. 
If I am not in a position to predict what the effect of 
mixture of distinct types may be, I feel confident that this 
important problem may be solved if it is taken up with 
sufficient energy and on a sufficiently large scale. An 
investigation of the anthropological data of people of dis-

tinct types, — taking into consideration the similarities 
and dissimilarities of parents and children, the rapidity. 
and final result of the physical and mental development 
of children, their vitality, the fertility of marriages of 
different types and in different social strata, — such.an 
investigation is bound to give us information which will 
allow us to answer these important questions definitely 
and conclusively. 
The final result of race-mixture will necessarily depend 
upon the fertility of the present native population and of 
the newer immigrants. It has been pointed out re- 
Peatedly that the birth-rate of Americans has declined 
With great rapidity, and that in the second and third gen- 
erations of descendants of immigrants the same decline 
makes itself felt. It will therefore be important to know 
what the fertility of different types may be. ' 
If the fertility of foreigners continues high without a 
correspondingly higher death-rate of children, we may 
anticipate a gradual increase of the physical influence of 
the more fertile type. ‘The immigration of the diver- 
gent types of southern and eastern Europe is, however, 
% recent, that this question cannot be answered until 
at least twenty years more have elapsed. 
No less important than the fertility of each immigrant
-P-A-G-E-275
266 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
type by itself is the question in how far they tend to inter- 
marry. The data presented in our census reports do not 
give a clear insight into this tendency among various na- 
tionalities. The difficulties of collecting significant statis- 
tics on the problem are very great. They appear particu- 
larly clearly in the case of Italians. Married men from 
Italy come to the United States, earn some money, and 
go back to rejoin their families. They may come again, 
and, when conditions are propitious, they may finally 
send for their families to follow them. Thus we find 
among the Italian immigrants very large numbers who 
were married before they came here. It seems almost 
impossible to separate the contingent of couples married 
before their arrival here from those married after 
their arrival, and the chief point of interest to us lies 
in the intermarriages of children born in this country. 
It is natural that in large cities, where nationalities sepa- 
rate in various quarters, a great amount of cohesion 
should continue for some time; but it seems likely that 
intermarriages between descendants of foreign nationali- 
ties are much more common than the census figures would 
make it appear. Our experience with Americans whose 
grandparents immigrated into this country is, on the 
whole, that most social traces of their descent have dis-
-P-A-G-E-276

NS 
SY RACE PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES 267 
appeared, and that many do not even know to what 
nationalities their grandparents belonged. It might be 
expected — particularly in Western communities, where 
a rapid change of location is common — that this would - 
result in a rapid mixture of the descendants of various 
nationalities. This inquiry, which it is quite feasible to 
carry out in detail, seems indispensable for a clear under- 
standing of the situation. 
It is somewhat difficult to realize how rapidly inter- 
mixture of distinct types takes place if the choice of mates 
isleft entirely to accident. Ihave made this calculation, - 
and I find that in a population in which two types inter- 
mingle, and in which both types occur with equal fre- 
quency, there will be in the fourth generation less than 
one person in ten thousand of pure descent. When the 
Proportion of the two original types is as eight to one, there 
will be among the more numerous part of the population 
less than thirty in one thousand in the fourth generation 
that will be of pure blood. Taking these data as a basis, 
itis obvious that intermixture, as soon as the social bar- 
ters have been removed, must be exceedingly rapid; 
and I think it safe to assume that one hundred years 
ftom now, in the bulk of our population, very few pure 
descendants of the present immigrants will be found.
-P-A-G-E-277
268 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
Unfortunately, however, we do not know the influence 
of racial cohesion. Obviously this is one of the funda- 
mental points that ought to be known in order to gain a 
clear insight into the effect of recent immigration. With- 
out this information, the whole discussion of the effect of 
intermixture remains speculative. The results of the 
present census will give us a certain amount of much- 
needed information on these points. 
In these remarks on the problems of European immi- 
gration I have confined myself entirely to the biological 
problem, because all our considerations have shown 
conclusively that mental life is so plastic, that no heredi- 
tary inability can be assumed to exist in any of the 
neoples of Europe. 
When we turn our attention to the negro problem as it 
presents itself in the United States, we must remember 
our previous considerations, in which we found that no 
proof of an inferiority of the negro type could be given, 
except that it seemed possible that perhaps the race 
would not produce quite so many men of highest genius as 
other races, while there was nothing at all that could be 
interpreted as suggesting any material difference in the 
mental capacity of the bulk of the negro population as 
compared to the bulk of the white population.
-P-A-G-E-278
RACE PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES 269 
’ Much has been said about the shorter period of growth 
of the negro child as compared to the white child, but 
no convincing data have been forthcoming. Considering 
the great variation in the duration of growth and develop- 
ment in different individuals and in various social classes, 
according to the more or less favorable nutrition of the 
child, the information that we possess in regard to the 
negto child is practically without value. We have not 
even evidence that would prove that a shorter period 
af development must be unfavorable in its results. 
Neither do we know at what period and in what manner 
develop the typical negroid features, which are much less 
Pronounced in the new-born than in adults. 
It is surprising, that, notwithstanding their impor- 
, lance, no attempts have been made to gain a better in- 
| Sight into these anatomical and physiological problems, 
some of which might be solved without much difficulty. 
As it is, almost all we can say with certainty is, that the 
differences between the average types of the white and 
| of the negro, that have a bearing upon vitality and men- 
‘al ability, are much less than the individual variations 
in each race. 
This result is, however, of great importance, and is 
{ quite in accord with the result of ethnological observation.

A survey of African tribes exhibits to our view cultural 
achievements of no mean order. To those unfamiliar 
with the products of native African art and industry, a 
walk through one of the large museums of Europe would 
be a revelation. None of our American museums has 
made collections that exhibit this subject in any way 
worthily. The blacksmith, the wood-carver, the weaver, 
the potter, — these all produce ware original in form, exe- 
cuted with great care, and exhibiting that love of labor, 
and interest in the results of work, which are apparently 
so often lacking among the negroes in our American sur- 
roundings. No less instructive are the records of travel- 
lers, reporting the thrift of the native villages, of the ex- 
tended trade of the country, and of its markets. The 
power of organization as illustrated in the government of 
native states is of no mean order, and when wielded by 
men of great personality has led to the foundation of ex- 
tended empires. All the different kinds of activities that 
we consider valuable in the citizens of our country may 
be found in aboriginal Africa. Neither is the wisdom 
of the philosopher absent. A perusal of any of the collec- 
tions of African proverbs that have been published will 
demonstrate the homely practical philosophy of the negro, 
which is often proof of sound feeling and judgment.

It would be out of place to enlarge on this subject, be- 
cause the essential point that anthropology can contribute 
to the practical discussion of the adaptability of the 
negro is a decision of the question how far the undesir- 
able traits that are at present undoubtedly found in our 
iegro population are due to racial traits, and how far 
they are due to social surroundings for which we are re- 
sponsible. To this question anthropology can give the 
decided answer that the traits of African culture as ob- 
erved in the aboriginal home of the negro ate those of a 
healthy primitive people, with a considerable degree of 
Personal initiative, with a talent for organization, and 
with imaginative power, with technical skill and thrift. - 
Neither is a warlike spirit absent in the race, as is proved 
by the mighty conquerors who overthrew states and 
founded new empires, and by the courage of the armies . 
that follow the bidding of their leaders. ‘There is nothing 
fo prove that licentiousness, shiftless laziness, lack of 
initiative, are fundamental characteristics of the race. 
Everything points out that these qualities are the result 
social conditions rather than of hereditary traits. 
It may be well to state here once more with some em- 
phasis that it would be erroneous to assume that there are 
to differences in the mental make-up of the negro race
-P-A-G-E-281
272 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
and of other races, and that their activities should run in 
the same lines. On the contrary, if there is any meaning 
in correlation of anatomical structure and physiological 
function, we must expect that differences exist. There is, 
however, no evidence whatever that would stigmatize the 
negro-as of weaker build, or as subject to inclinations and 
powers that are opposed to our social organization. An 
unbiassed estimate of the anthropological evidence so far 
brought forward. does not permit us to countenance the 
belief in a racial inferiority which would unfit an individ- 
ual of the negrorace to take his part inmodern civilization. 
We do not know of any demand made on the human body 
or mind in modern life that anatomical or ethnological 
evidence would prove to be beyond the powers of the 
negro. 
The traits of the American negro are adequately ex- 
plained on the basis of his history and social status. The 
tearing-away from the African soil and the consequent 
complete loss of the old standards of life, which were 
replaced by the dependency of slavery and by all it en- 
tailed, followed by a period of disorganization and by 2 
severe economic struggle against heavy odds, are sufficient 
to explain the inferiority of the status of the race, without 
falling back upon the theory of hereditary inferiority.
-P-A-G-E-282
RACE PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES 273 
In short, there is every reason to believe that the negro, 
when given facility and opportunity, will be perfectly able 
to fulfil the duties of citizenship as well as his white neigh- 
bor. It may be that he will not produce as many great 
men as the white race, and that his average achievement 
will not quite reach the level of the average achievement 
of the white race ; but there will be endless numbers who 
will be able to outrun their white competitors, and who 
will do better than the defectives whom we permit to 
drag down and to retard the healthy children of our public 
schools. 
The anthropological discussion of the negro problem 
tequires also a word on the “race instinct” of the whites, 
which plays a most important part in the practical aspect 
of the problem. Ultimately this phenomenon is a repeti- 
tion of the old instinct and fear of the connubium of pa- 
tricians and plebeians, of the European nobility and the 
common people, or of the castes of India. The emotions 
and reasonings concerned are the same in every respect. 
In our case they relate particularly to the necessity of 
maintaining a distinct social status in order to avoid race- 
mixture. As in the other cases mentioned, the so-called 
instinct is not a physiological dislike. This is proved by 
the existence of our large mulatto population, as well as by 
T
-P-A-G-E-283
274 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
the more ready amalgamation of the Latin peoples. It is 
rather an expression of social conditions that are so deeply 
ingrained in us that they assume a strong emotional 
value; and this, I presume, is meant when we call such 
feelings instinctive. The feeling certainly has nothing to 
do with the question of the vitality and ability of the 
mulatto. 
Still the questions of race-mixture and of the negro’s 
adaptability to our environment represent a number of 
important problems. 
I think we have reason to be ashamed to confess that 
the scientific study of these questions has never received 
the support either of our government or of any of our 
great scientific institutions; and it is hard to understand 
why we are so indifferent toward a question which is of 
paramount importance to the welfare of our nation. The 
anatomy of the American negro is not well known; and, 
notwithstanding the oft-repeated assertions regarding 
the hereditary inferiority of the mulatto, we know hardly 
anything on this subject. If his vitality is lower than 
that of the full-blooded negro, this may be as much due 
to social causes as to hereditary causes. Owing to the 
very large number of mulattoes in our country, it would 
not be a difficult matter to investigate the biological
-P-A-G-E-284
RACE PROBLEMS IN THE UNITED STATES 275 
aspects of this question thoroughly.. The importance of 
researches on this subject cannot be too strongly urged, 
since the desirability or undesirability of race-mixture 
should be known. Looking into a distant future, it 
seems reasonably certain that with the increasing mo- 
bility of the negro, the number of full-bloods will rapidly 
decrease; and since there is no introduction of new negro 
blood, there cannot be the slightest doubt that the ulti- 
mate effect of the contact between the two races must 
necessarily be a continued increase of the amount of white 
blood in the negro community. 
This process will go on most rapidly inside of the col- 
ored community, owing to intermarriages between 
mulattoes and full-blooded negroes. Whether or not the 
addition of white blood to the colored population is suffi- 
| dently large to counterbalance this levelling effect, which 
will make the mixed bloods with a slight strain of negro 
blood darker, is difficult to tell; but it is quite obvious 
that, although our laws may retard the influx of white 
blood considerably,. they cannot hinder the gradual prog- 
j tess of intermixture. If the powerful caste system of 
India has not been able to prevent intermixture, our 
laws, which recognize a greater amount of individual lib- 
erty, will certainly not be able to do so; and that there
-P-A-G-E-285
276 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
is no racial sexual antipathy is made sufficiently clear by 
the size of our mulatto population. A candid considera- 
tion of the manner in which intermixture takes place 
shows very clearly that the probability of the infusion of 
white blood into the colored population is considerable. 
While the large body of the white population will always, 
at least for a very long time to come, be entirely remote 
from any possibility of intermixture with negroes, I think 
‘that we may predict with a fair degree of certainty a 
condition in which the contrast between colored people 
and whites will be less marked than it is at the present 
time. Notwithstanding all the obstacles that may be 
laid in the way of intermixture, the conditions are such 
that the persistence of the pure negro type is practically 
impossible. Not even an excessively high mortality and 
lack of fertility among the mixed type, as compared with 
the pure types, could prevent this result. Since it is 
impossible to change these conditions, they should be 
faced squarely, and we ought to demand a careful and 
critical investigation of the whole problem. 
It seems to my mind that the policy of many of our 
Southern States that try to prevent all racial intermix- 
ture is based on an erroneous view of the process involved. 
The alleged reason for this type of legislation is the neces-

sity of protecting the white race against the infusion of 
negro blood. As a matter of fact, this danger does not 
exist. With very few exceptions, the unions between 
whites and negroes are those of white men and negro 
women. ‘The increase of races, however, is such that the 
number of children born does not depend upon the num- 
ber of men, but upon the number of women. Given, 
therefore, a certain number of negro women, the increase 
of the colored population will depend upon their number ; 
and if a considerable number of their children are those 
of white fathers, the race as a whole must necessarily 
lose its pure negro type. At the same time no such in- 
fusion of negro blood into the white race through the 
maternal line occurs, so that the process is actually one of 
lightening the negro race without corresponding admix- 
ture in the white race. ; 
It appears from this consideration that the most im- 
portant practical questions relating to the negro problem 
have reference to the mulattoes and other mixed bloods, 
—-to their physical types, their mental and moral quali- 
ties, and their vitality. When the bulky literature of 
this subject is carefully sifted, little remains that will en- 
dure serious criticism; and I do not believe that I claim 
too much when I say that the whole work on this subject
-P-A-G-E-287
278 THE MIND OF PRIMITIVE MAN 
remains to be done. The development of modern meth- 
ods of research makes it certain that by careful inquiry 
definite answers to our problems may be found. Is it 
not, then, our plain duty to inform ourselves, that, so far 
as that can be done, deliberate consideration of observa- 
tions may take the place of heated discussion of beliefs 
in matters that concern not only ourselves, but also the 
welfare of millions of negroes ? 
I hope the discussions contained in these pages have 
shown that the data of anthropology teach us a greater 
tolerance of forms of civilization different from our own, 
_ and that we should learn to look upon foreign races with 
, greater sympathy, and with the conviction, that, as all 
*~zaces have contributed in the past to cultural progress in 
one way or another, so they will be capable of advancing 
‘the interests of mankind, if we are only willing to give 
é them a fair opportunity.

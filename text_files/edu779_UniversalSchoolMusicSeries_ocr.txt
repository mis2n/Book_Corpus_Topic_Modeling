Lk. B Dear Boys anp Grrts: 
In this new music-book the songs are more difficult than 
those in the first two books of this series, but the music is 
more advanced, and, of course, you do not want to stay in pri- 
mary music all your lives. The teacher will still sing a few of 
the songs for you to learn by imitation, but this is a “first 
gsade” way of teaching, and you will not need it for any 
except the most difficult songs. In most-cases, you will learn 
the songs by reading them; and if you work hard and learn 
to do it well, you will,never be sorry. 
You will notice that a good many of the songs in this book 
are written for two.or three parts, but although part-singing 
is harder, it is also more fun, and we know you will enjoy it 
if you learn to doit well, Remember that in order to sing wel] 
in parts you must do two seemingly opposite things: (1) You 
must mind your own business and stick to your own part, 
even if another group is singing a wholly different part at the 
same time; and (2) While thus minding your own business, 
each one of you must, nevertheless, listen enough to the other 
part to make sure that your voice is in perfect tune with it. At 
first this is difficult, but we know you can do it if you try. 
We hope that there is a phonograph in your school; but if 
there is not, we suggest that you ask your Board of Education 
or the School Trustees to buy one. If they cannot do this, 
why not get up a School Concert, raise the money, and buy it 
ourselves ? : y $ Your Friends, 
TueE Epitors.

THE UNIVERSAL 
SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES 
FOREWORD 
The editors of these books realize that very few children 
become professional musicians. For the great majority, music 
study is to be justified primarily as an important factor in 
making human life more satisfying. Music is taught for the 
sake of the joy and satisfaction which it brings into the lives of 
the many; not merely as a means of enabling the few to re- 
ceive professional training. A series of books to be used by 
all the children of all the people must therefore stress that 
side of music which results immediately in zsthetic pleasure 
rather than that which concerns itself only with elaborate 
technical training in preparation for future achievements and 
enjoyments. In short, we must give the children, abundantly, 
while they are still in school, the joyful experience of hearing. 
and sharing in the rendition of beautiful music. Accordingly 
we have emphasized, throughout the series, somg-singing and 
listening lessons, with “music appreciation ” as the general 
objective. The abundance of music of high quality which 
these books contain is perhaps their most distinctive feature, 
and we hope that through singing this music-our children 
will come to lové music because it is beautiful, satisfying, - 
-and exalting. In thus learning to appreciate and to love — 
beautiful music, we believe that our boys and girls will be 
inclined to observe and to acquire a taste for all beauty. Such 
‘stimulation of the children’s zsthetic instincts will in turn 
tend to enrich, refine and ennoble their entire lives, thus 
amply justifying the time devoted to music.

A Little Hymn 
Charles I. Rice 
  gra - cious ear To what the young-est child can say. 
In addition to the seven tones of the scale (do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do) that we have been using there 
are five other tones that are frequently employed in writing music. These correspond to the five black 
keys on the piano when playing in the key of C; and just as the same black key is sometimes called 
“D-sharp”’ and at other times “ E-flat”’ so in singing, one often uses different syllables for the same tone. 
Thus Ri and Me stand for the same pitch in any given key. In ascending, the five additional tones are 
called Di, Ri, Fi, Si and Li. Note that the initial consonant remains, but that the vowel changes to “i” 
(pron In descending, the sytlables are Te, Le, Se, Me and Ra. Here the vowel changes to ‘“‘e’’ 
(pronounced a) in every case but tl of Re, which already has this vowel. 
Study the two versions of “A Little Hymn” very carefully, making certain that you understand the use 
of the new syllables.

The sign C is sometimes used instead: of 4/4 to indicate 4/4 measure. This sign is not a letter C. (as we are sometimes told), but is a broken circle. . The circle O was formerly used to indicate triple measure, and the broken circle C to indicate - duple measure. The use of the complete circle has now entirely disappeared, but the broken circle with a line through it, 
is still used-te indicate duple measure (usnally 2/2). The plain broken circle C stands for 4/4 measure. .

Sometimes the d is used as the beat note instead of d. In this case the ¢ has one beat, thee has two, thee-has three, and 
a new character which you have probably never seen is'used to indicate a tone four beats tong. This new character is some- times made #4 and sometimes i-==4 It is called a breve, and it may be of interest to you to know that the breve origi- 
nally stood for the shortest tone, whereas now it stands for the longest tone. The use of thed as'a ‘beat note does not indicate 
a slower tempo, as many seem to think.

Melodies Illustrating Six-Eighth Measure 
  call - ing us to the church. 
In six-eighth measure an eighth-note has one beat, a quarter-note two, and a dotted-quarter three, the first and fourth beats being accented. This is only true when the tempo is slow. In a rapid tempo there are only two beats in a measure, a dotted-quarter being the beat note. ‘This is sometimes indicated in this book by writing the measure sign thus: 8G) . Sing the above melodies with six beats to the measure at first, then change to two.

  Note that this song is in F Minor and that this may be indicated by stating that it is in f (the smalt letter means minor while the capital letter is understood to mean major unless combined with the word minor. Thus c stands for C minor, but C indicates C major. c has three flats in its signature, being the relative minor of Eb major; but C has no sharps or flats in its signature).

This song looks as though it might be 4, but when you sing it you will see that there is no accent on the 
fourth eighth-note, and that the measures divide naturally into three parts and not into two. .

We have been singing minor songs for several years, and now we are to study the minor mode more 
intensively. Minor music centers about La as its key-note instead of about Do, as major music does. 
Many minor songs begin with La and almost all of them close with La. ‘The minor scale is not always 
exactly the same. Sometimes it runs La, Ti, Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La; sometimes La, Ti, Do, Re, Mi, Fa, 
Si, La. The first form is called the original minor scale; the second form is the harmonic minor; while 
the third one is referred to as the melodic minor scale. The first five tones of all forms are alike, and the 
important thing to remember is that the scale gets its name from the fact that its first and third tones are 
only three half-steps apart, while in the major scale the first and third tones are four half-steps apart. 
Minor means smaller; Major means larger. Learn to sing all three forms of the scale.

’ Norwegian Folk-Song 
  Most minor songs will be found to use Si instead of So. This is called ‘‘raising the seventh-tone of the 
scale” and is done in order to make more satisfactory harmony. Note that this “raising” of the seventh 
brings the seventh and eighth tones nearer together, so that the interval between them is a half-step~as in the major scale.

note especially its last tone or chord. In the above song the first accented tone is La while the last chord is

  PREFACE 
SomMETHING precious to education was lost when the 
Greek idea of the ethical goodness of wisdom became 
obscured by neglect. It is one of the principal pur- 
poses of this volume to bring into clearer light the 
moral functions of knowledge, and to show how over 
the bridge of ethical interest youth may be led from 
understanding to wisdom, and from wisdom to its cor- 
relative goodness and volitional efficiency. 
Another purpose is to make clear the great existing 
differences in ideals and conditions between the ancient 
static and socialistic organizations under an economy 
of deficit and pain, with their resultants of struggle and 
sacrifice, and the modern dynamic and democratic order 
under an economy of surplus and satisfaction, with their 
resultants of personal independence and codperative 
well-being. We live in a world of new conditions, and 
the ethical training we give must reflect these conditions 
through new interpretations of old ideals. As has 
been said, we shall need an annual supplement to the 
decalogue, unless we fit our old conceptions to the new 
situation. Old vices and old offences against the social 
order are still with us, but they are not always ade- 
quately recognized and opposed, because they assume 
the forms of public service. Without stealing a dollar

by primitive theft, men may now steal a million from 
the community through methods analogous to those 
of indirect taxation, and, alas! without raising the 
hue and cry. It is essential that the young be taught 
to adjust their moral ideals, old perhaps as the race, 
to existing conditions, new perhaps as yesterday. 
The first two chapters attempt to blaze a trail through 
ethical theory, that the regulative principles of moral 
conduct may be made clear and unmistakable to the 
young. 
One idea animates the whole; namely, that there 
may be realized the completest possible utilization of 
the agencies for ethical training now available to the 
American high school. That religious agencies for the 
uplifting of men will still exert their beneficent influence 
is heartily recognized, but the fact that the school can- 
not at present use them is not a good reason why it 
should not utilize those it has. 
The author wishes to express his sense of gratitude 
to his colleague, Richard Ray Kirk, A.B., A.M., of the 
Cornell English Department, for his assistance in reading 
manuscript and proof.

CHAPTER I 
REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 
1. The Teleology of Conduct: Individual and 
Social Ends 
x. Conduct, in accordance with its twofold nature, 
has both an inner and an outer reference — inner, since 
it is motive that impels to action; outer, because every 
act has some objective end or purpose. A deed belongs 
to the world of accomplished events, but its impelling 
cause is found only in the mind of the actor. We may 
speak, therefore, of the psychology and the teleology of 
conduct. Out of these two aspects the whole of ethics 
may be derived. But in ethics, as in all subjects compli- 
cated by ages of development, only clear and detailed 
analysis will enable the student to find and keep his way. 
2. The first and most obvious distinction to be made 
in the psychology of conduct is that the individual may 
be moved by motives having either an internal or an 
external origin. Thus, we may conceive that a primitive 
man, the “noble savage” of Rousseau, who owes no 
allegiance to others, but stalks the forest with all the 
freedom of a lion roaming the wilderness, would neces- 
B I 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  2 ETHICAL TRAINING 
sarily be moved to action only by his own instincts, 
impulses, and emotions. These, of course, have most to 
do with the requisites for individual and race survival, 
such as food, shelter, protection, sex, and the like. 
A counterpart to this imaginary individual would be 
the Spartan youth brought up by state officials in public 
barracks and directed in all the essentials of his conduct 
by the mores of his group. Another illustration of group 
morality in which the incentive to action is external is 
the medieval monk, who had no will of his own, but took 
the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. For 
the modern man, however, no explanation of conduct is 
adequate that does not take into account both internal 
and external springs to action, for their coexistence is 
self-evident. To ascribe to each, however, both its real 
and its ideal value is perhaps the most difficult problem of 
modern ethics. The discussion of these values will be 
opened in Chapter II, when the sanctions of conduct are 
considered. 
Discussion :— Origin of the motives that are ascribed to 
Robinson Crusoe, (1) before the coming of his man Friday, 
(2) afterwards. : 
3. Teleology (Gr. telos, end) as here used. pertains to 
the doctrine of ends in morality. These ends, whether 
so intended or not, have both an individual and a social 
reference. All my conduct affects me individually; 
now immediately and powerfully, as when I eat or protect
-P-A-G-E-15
      REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 2 
my health or secure my safety or die for my country; 
or remotely and indirectly, as when I feed or protect my 
family or my neighbors or contribute a mite to the for- 
mation of an influential public opinion. 
On the other hand, all my conduct, however personal 
it may appear, affects others to some extent for good or 
ill, and has therefore a social reference. ‘‘ No man liveth 
to himself alone.” He cannot do so for two reasons: 
first, because he is a social being whose established motives 
of conduct are his inheritance from ages of social experi- 
ence; and, second, because he lives in a social commu- 
nity, whose ‘ “mutuality,” as Ross calls it, is constantly 
increasing. Even were his impulses of the lowest and the 
result of arrested development, yet such as he is he is 
social ; and however non-social an individual may seem in 
disposition, yet his social situation clings to him like the 
queue to Peter Schlemihl’s Chinaman: — 
“Er dreht sich rechts, 
Er dreht sich links, 
Der Zopf er hingt ihm hinten.” 
Discussion :— Make a list of things we do (r) chiefly 
from social motives; (2) chiefly from individual or non-social 
motives. 
(1) Extent of Individual Reference 
4. Many and diverse have been the theories and prac- 
tices of mankind respecting the extent to which the adult     
 
-P-A-G-E-16
4 ETHICAL TRAINING 
individual may properly make his own gratification or 
well-being the end of his actions. The extent to which 
he actually does so is determined by many factors, such as 
race, tradition, passion, love; native selfishness, habitual 
self-renunciation, stage in mental and moral development ; 
economic, political, and social status, and the like. 
Since, in short, we have now a developing individual in a 
developing society, it is evident that much variation may 
be expected in the ends toward which men direct their 
conduct. 
Discussion :—1. Show how each of the aforementioned 
circumstances may affect conduct. 2. Describe historic 
movements toward individualism: (1) among the Greeks 
(the Sophists), (2) at the time of the Renaissance, (3) in the 
times of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, (4) during the first 
four hundred years of American History, (3) Selfishness of 
some in the modern street car. 
5. It is important for the teacher to have some intel- 
ligible guide as to the comparative validity of personal as 
opposed to social demands in the direction of conduct, for 
the high-school student has arrived at a stage in mental 
development when he can comprehend and appreciate 
the fluctuating sanctions that impel and direct his be- 
havior. Slavish subserviency to the behests of social 
groups is as destructive to right character as ruthless 
efforts to maintain the paramount importance of in- 
dividual ends. There are legitimate demands of society,
-P-A-G-E-17
REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 5 
and there are just claims of the individual. What prin- 
ciple will enable us to distinguish and fairly estimate the 
validity of these conflicting claims ? 
The extremist, on one side, declares that the individual 
has no rights that society is bound to respect. This 
means ancient socialism. According to this view, society 
is a communism like a hive of bees, where only one, the 
queen, may have a complete development. The worker 
must yield its flitting life to supply food for future broods ; 
the drone must perish in fertilizing the eggs of the queen. 
In the bee economy, the perpetuation of the swarm is the 
end; the individual is nothing but a means to attain it. 
At the other extreme, we have the theory that society 
as a whole has no rights not granted by the individual, 
since society is conceived to be merely an aggregate of 
independent units. Whatever rights it exercises, what- 
ever privileges it enjoys, attach to it by virtue of the 
convenience or grace of the autonomous personalities that 
compose it. This view is illustrated by the theory of 
States’ Rights and it always comes to the front in periods 
of revolt against social oppression, as in the time of 
Rousseau. 
The socialistic conception is aided by Aristotle’s dic- 
tum that man is by nature a political, 7.e., a social being; 
also by the biological analogy, wherein society is com- 
pared to a living organism in which consciousness and 
direction belong to the whole, and obedience to the parts. 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
      6 ETHICAL TRAINING 
While the whole supports and protects the organs, it yet 
controls and uses them. ; 
The individualistic, or aggregation, theory of ‘society 
is supported by the general nominalistic position that all 
consciousness, and all power to enjoy or to suffer or to 
will, are inherent in the composing units, or emanate 
from them. There is, so this argument runs, no general 
consciousness or volition except as men think or feel or 
exercise their volitions in common. 
The best evidence that each of these positions may 
from certain points of view be logically defended is the 
fact that they have often in turn claimed the allegiance 
of influential groups of men. 
Discussion :— 1. Doctrines of (1) Plato’s “Republic,” 
(2) More’s “Utopia,” (3) Bellamy’s “Looking Backward.” 
2. Meaning of Jeffersonian democracy. Of anarchy. 
6. Without becoming involved in speculation con- 
cerning the genesis and nature of society or the primacy 
or subordination of the individual, we may approach the 
problem from the standpoint of the functions performed 
by each. Society performs certain actions that individ- 
uals assuch cannot accomplish. Thus, government raises 
and expends revenues, builds navies and supports armies, 
enacts and executes laws, undertakes gigantic works of 
public improvements like the reclamation of arid wastes 
and the digging of the Panama Canal. So likewise minor 
organizations, such as corporations, trusts, and labor 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
       REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES ay: 
unions, banks, insurance companies, churches, schools, 
and organized social groups in general perform collective 
functions impracticable, if not impossible, to the individ- 
ual. Whatever we may call the forces that enable the 
social group to do its work, the fact that it does it is in- 
disputable. There is, consequently, such a thing as social 
function which is more than a sum of individual actions. 
“ The social mind is thus more than a mere aggregate of 
individual processes. It is a functional active unity. 
As a psychical existence, society is essentially a process.’’ + 
Discussion : — Relative importance of the following as 
bonds which enable the social groups to perform their func- 
tions: (1) compulsion, (2) economic needs, (3) religion, (4) 
consciousness of kind (Giddings), (5) the idea of a common 
good. 
7. The individual, on the other hand, is forever per- 
forming functions within the larger functioning whole. 
His actions themselves are immediate and personal, yet, 
as already stated, they have also a social reference. 
Since all men are in society, and stand in necessary re- 
lations to the various social groups of which they are 
members, it follows that the ultimate significance, the full 
meaning of their acts, can be understood only when this 
social bearing has been apprehended. Thus, each man is 
expected to earn a living, but to do so he must touch a

thousand wires that run to the hearts and wills of other 
men. The sweat may start upon his brow, and _ his 
muscles may tire; he may eat the bread his toil has 
earned, yet, notwithstanding this personal reference, his 
labor still derives its larger meaning from his relations to 
others. In like manner, whatever he does in school or 
church or state or community gets its larger ultimate 
meaning from its social implications. Looking at it from 
the other side, it is the acts of individuals that effect the 
functionings of society. The true relation of the individ- 
ual to a social group is therefore that of a functioning unit 
to a functioning whole. This statement does not solve 
the entire problem of the relation of the individual to the 
social whole, but it constitutes a step toward such solu- 
tion. 
Discussion :— Difference between a structural and a func- 
tional theory of society. 
8. We still have lingering with us the unanswered 
question as to how far the individual reference may go. 
From the bare legal standpoint men find themselves safe 
so long as they limit the extent of such reference by obey- 
ing the law that protects the rights of others. I may 
gratify my love of noise so long as I do not disturb the 
legally guaranteed quiet of my neighbors, or I may ex- 
ploit the natural resources of the country so long as no 
law protects the interests of the public. But such recog- 
nition of bare legality makes but a sorry moral spectacle
-P-A-G-E-21
  
REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 9 
when we come to modern offences against the social wel- 
fare. As Ross! maintains, unless we can have new defi- 
nitions of what constitutes offences against society, we 
shall need an annual supplement to the decalogue. It is 
in view of such distinctions that Ross would distinguish 
between sim and vice; the former being defined as offence 
against society, and the latter as conduct that injures 
chiefly the individual himself. 
Discussion : — Compare the old definitions with the new : 
1. Old — Sin is violation of the laws of God, 
Crime is violation of the laws of man. 
2. New — Sin is conduct that injures others. 
Vice is conduct that injures self. 
9. What shall be the proper moral measure of the 
extent of individual reference? Here we may discern 
two aspects of the problem, (1) the distribution of the 
efforts of the individual among competing groups, and 
(2) the consideration that self shall have as related to 
other individuals. 
Social groups stand to individuals in varying, and 
even fluctuating, relations. One man will do everything 
for his country, but nothing for his family, while another 
will reverse these relations. A politician puts party 
before public interests; a statesman thinks first of his 
country. A philanthropist will be lavish of his gifts in 
one cause, but close his ears to all others. A zealot pro- 
1 Ross, E. A., “Sin and Society,” p. 40. Houghton, Mifflin Co., Boston.

  Io ETHICAL TRAINING 
motes a specific institution, but decries all similar ones. 
As to the distribution of benevolence, however much it 
may lament, the world does not complain even when 
this is determined by pure caprice. The chief reason 
probably is, because, on the one hand, benevolence is 
looked upon as a pure act of grace, and because, on the 
other hand, it must be reasonably concentrated to be 
effective. A gift of a penny apiece to each inhabitant 
of the United States would do little or no good to anybody, 
even though the aggregate of the gift should be near a 
million dollars. Though we may not hope to remove 
subjective factors in the distribution of benevolence, we 
may at least teach our students to reflect upon the larger 
bearings of their contributions, that they may estimate 
relative values, and try to secure the largest possible 
amount of self-helpfulness on the part of the recipient. 
When different social groups come into competition for 
the services of the individual, the average man is prone to 
follow the instincts that have been begotten by long ages 
of struggle for existence. In the past those have sur- 
vived who have fought and renounced. The maxim of 
the age of deficit has been, “ Fight for the group and 
sacrifice self for the young.” These are still our primary 
impulses. They are expressed in that barbaric toast, 
“My Country, may she never be wrong; but right or 
wrong, My Country!” Under modern conditions, how- 
ever, where there are both economic surplus and public
-P-A-G-E-23
  
REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES It 
security, our primitive instincts should be suppressed, or 
better, directed by intelligent reflection. It is no longer 
necessary to abandon wife and children to helpless pov- 
erty, to rob them of protection and deprive them of 
education, in order to repel an invader or to follow a vic- 
torious leader in his conquests. On the other hand, it is 
no longer necessary or best for parents to suffer hunger 
that their children may eat, or for the mother in the 
modern city to sacrifice herself in the warfare against dirt 
and disease. There are more effective ways of combat- 
ting these evils. Corporate action is able to secure clean 
streets, pure water, adequate means of disposing of sew- 
age, and to protect the people against the spread of 
disease. The taxable wealth of the city is now able to do 
effectively what personal sacrifice was once able to do 
ineffectively.t| Personal contributions distributed in co- 
operative efforts for communal welfare in all the essentials 
of healthful and happy living are now better than painful 
personal sacrifices, whether for the military protection of 
the whole or for the promotion of the welfare of children. 
It is fortunate that in general this distribution among 
competitive groups is not left to the individual alone, 
but is attended to by organized society. If individuals 
contribute their just share in taxes and in free gifts, the 
city government will see that a reasonable balance is

VIL.

  I2 ETHICAL TRAINING 
maintained among the various kinds of public service. 
So far, however, as the individual must choose between 
competing groups, he should be guided by his best judg- 
ment concerning the effect of his choice, first upon the 
welfare of the groups concerned, and finally upon society 
in general.

ment, (4) in industries. 
to. The individual reference of conduct when the actor 
comes into relation, not to social groups, but to other 
individuals, presents two aspects, that of justice and 
that of generosity, or their opposites. Some men are just 
who are not generous; others are generous without being 
just. It is not unusual to find those who are just and 
generous in some things and the opposite in others. It 
all depends upon the stage of moral development the 
individual has reached. If he is blind to the effects of 
given lines of conduct, or perverted by appetite, he may 
compel his wife to beg for clothing, or his children for 
bread, in order that his own selfish pleasures may be 
promoted. 
Justice permits a man to make himself the recipient of 
his own conduct to any extent he pleases, provided only 
that he refrain from violating the just rights of others. 
      
    
This rule is formal, hence easy to state, but it is difficult 
to follow. It is merely an ideal according to which the
-P-A-G-E-25
  REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 13 
teacher may enable the student to judge of conduct. 
Justice, in this sense also, ranges from bare legality to the 
most exalted moral standards. 
The highest moral type of individual reference in con- 
duct is that in which generosity is tempered by justice to 
self, to family, and to the other persons with whom one 
comes in contact. Shall I have the best upon the table, 
or in the store, while those to whom I am most closely 
related must put up with the second best? Shall I in- 
dulge myself in abundant spending money, while my 
family does without? The highest guide here is love, 
tempered with justice to all concerned, myself perhaps 
included. Justice to herself is renounced when the 
mother slaves to support her daughters in idleness, or to 
promote their selfish pleasures; but she is acting upon 
a different plane when she sacrifices herself to give them 
the higher riches of the mind. 
In conclusion, therefore, we may say that in appor- 
tioning the fruits of conduct between ourselves and other 
persons our maxim should be this: Justice mellowed by 
generosity ; generosity regulated by justice. 
Discussion :— What constitutes a neighbor? Compare: 
(1) the story of the Jericho Road, (2) modern associated 
charities, (3) the spirit of codperation in group activities.

(2) Extent of Social Reference 
11. The end of education from the individual stand- 
point may be conceived to be the completest possible 
unfolding of the individual in intelligence, emotional range 
and direction, and. volitional efficiency. In other words, 
the culture and discipline of the individual should cul- 
minate only when he has reached the extent of his pos- 
sibilities of development. This makes it appear that the 
ends of education are purely subjective and personal. 
But the moment we ask how these ends are to be reached, 
we find the social reference. This is true because the only 
way one can develop and manifest intelligence is through 
the science and art that man has created and in the 
human affairs with which men are busied ; the only sig- 
nificant field for the manifestation of emotional experience 
and attitude is found in our relations to others; and the 
only domain for volitional action and efficiency is the 
many-sided work of the world. Thus much of our rela- 
tion to the social groups to which we chance to belong is 
universally valid and necessary; it is true of all races, 
countries, ages, and conditions. The eighteenth-century 
conception of a developed, but completely non-social 
individual, is a pure fiction, invented to reénforce an 
argument, not to express a reality. But even when the 
inevitableness of the social reference of conduct is recog- 
nized, the first step only of our investigation has been

taken. The whole character and content of such rela- 
tions depend upon the personal and the social stages of 
development attained in a given case. Confining our 
attention for the time being to social reference as deter- 
mined by the extent of social development attained, we 
can distinguish two markedly different stages, (1) that in 
which the social conditions are prevailingly static, or 
fixed, and (2) that in which they are prevailingly dynamic, 
or progressive. There are radical differences in the extent 
and character of social reference of conduct in the two cases. 
(3) Social Reference of Conduct under Static Social 
Conditions 
12. What is meant by a static society is illustrated 
by the Greek city-states. At Sparta, Lycurgus, some 
nine hundred years before Christ, after much study and 
reflection, drew up a code of laws designed to secure and 
maintain the military security and even the superiority 
of that community. To that end he completely sub- 
ordinated the individual to the demands of a military 
city-state; had his system sanctioned by the oracle at 
Delphi, which declared that Sparta would endure and ° 
prosper as long as the people obeyed the laws he had 
given them; and, that they might remain true to the 
oath they had taken, voluntarily condemned himself to 
exile for lifet Under this system, which Sparta left

substantially unchanged so long as she was an independent 
power, the individual was completely dominated by his 
social groups. He was brought up in public barracks, 
educated for war, forbidden to engage in trade, or to have 
any will but the public will. This, of course, is com- 
pletely the reverse of the modern democratic state, where 
government exists for the individual. In Sparta the 
individual lived and wrought for the state alone. 
A somewhat more liberal application of the same prin- 
ciple is found in the city-state of Athens under the laws 
first of Draco and then of Solon. Here again the state 
was reénforced by received and traditional economic and 
religious standards of conduct. That Athens possessed 
the seeds of personal liberty within her system is proved 
by her subsequent development in art, science, and phi- 
losophy. No such seeds could germinate within the icy 
fields of Spartan socialism. The ancient and medieval 
world abounds in similar illustrations, as the castes in 
Egypt and India; the feudal system of the Middle Ages ; 
the dominance of the church-state government of the 
same period; the absolutism of monarchs and aristoc- 
racies, as in France during the eighteenth century. 
Modern instances of a state trying amidst violent in- 
ternal convulsions to emerge from the static into the 
dynamic condition are Russia and Turkey, with their 
feeble but hopeful efforts at parliamentary government. 
13. Static social organizations arise from the stress  
-P-A-G-E-29
REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 17 
of an intense struggle for corporate and even individual 
existence. They belong to what Patten calls an economy 
of deficit and pain. There is deficit in food supply or in 
military power to protect against incursion, and there is 
pain on the one side, through loss of liberty to work and 
act and own, to know and think and believe, and on the 
other, pain in being compelled to act solely according to 
the commands of a dominant social whole. The concomi- 
tants of social deficit are deprivation, pain, and servitude 
on the part of the individual, and control and domination 
and even tyranny and oppression on the part of the static 
social groups. It is against this sort of social order that 
the race has so often revolted in the past, and it is the 
instinctive revulsion against such an order by the strong 
individual that produces violent opposition to all the 
crude forms of modern socialism, which are only new 
devices for reproducing the conditions of an outgrown 
social economy of pain and deficit. Sociologists of this 
antique type, to effect a little good, would do a great harm; 
to prevent some men from getting hungry, they would 
subject all men to the social rigorism of the primitive 
city-state or to some worse form of social despotism.

the mental attitude is one of subjection to authority on 
the one side, and of submission to exploitation by the 
strong on the other. Thus, for example, during the later 
Middle Ages men were almost completely unified in their 
respective social groups, which exerted an authority not to 
be safely questioned. In the church-state men were ex- 
pected to think and believe and act alike, on pain of ex- 
clusion from all economic, political, and social advantages 
of civilized life; for it was forbidden to give excommuni- 
cated persons food, shelter, or employment. Like sailors 
marooned on a desert island, they were left to starve or 
to return to savage life. Industries in the country put 
the individual into the feudal treadmill, from which there 
was no escape except by death; and in the cities they 
put him into the guild, to which he must conform, or 
remain an industrial outcast. Education was as com- 
pletely unified as church, state, and industry, for it had 
but one curriculum for all, and but one aim, the produc- 
tion of the completely socialized individual. But this 
medieval social unity was in principle completely shat- 
tered by the Renaissance, which, through revolution, now 
peaceful, now warlike, so completely individualized man- 
kind that the necessary socialization, without which men 
cannot live together, had a chance to fall into new and 
better forms.

15. The standing internal remedy of mankind for social 
despotism is revolution. Authority and the power to 
exploit become so firmly intrenched in tradition, custom, 
vested interests, legal enactments, and the military ma- 
chinery of suppression, that only a violent outbreak of 
the whole people can destroy an old and establish a new 
order. The external remedy is conquest by a more pro- 
gressive nation. 
Discussion :— Examples of (1) revolutions that have

to the destruction of a static social order. 
(4) Social Reference of Conduct under Dynamic Social 
Conditions 
16. Dynamic, or progressive, social groups are the 
reverse of the static. Group and individual act and react 
upon each other. What was before an external and un- 
changeable rule of life now becomes internal and alter- 
able. The individual may conform to the group behest 
as before, but he does so with a different attitude. 
Compulsion gives place to willing obedience, for in so far 
as the group rule is felt to be irrational there is always 
the possibility of changing it. The individual has the 
feeling that since his representatives made the law, they 
may also unmake it. In other words, he obeys with all
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 ETHICAL TRAINING 
his heart, or he obeys with the resolution to make 
obedience to an obnoxious rule no longer necessary. 
We get, in short, that admirable dialectic, or reciprocal 
interaction, between the individual and the social group 
so vividly portrayed by men like Baldwin,' Ward,? Mac- 
kenzie,? Small and Vincent,‘ Ross,® and Hobson.® Imita- 
tion and conformity on the one hand are balanced by 
initiative and invention on the other; external authority 
becomes internal, so that what was blind obedience 
becomes intelligent codperation. Out of this dialec- 
tic between society and citizen there arises what we call 
rational freedom, by which is meant not license or caprice, 
but thought-regulated conduct, in which the individual 
alternately conforms and initiates, as fundamental ethical 
principle or expediency may prescribe. 
17. Examples of such dynamic social groups are found 
on every hand in modern times; indeed, they are the rule 
in most civilized countries. Parliamentary, or more 
generally, representative governments, all conform theo- 
tetically to this type, however sadly they may fail to 
secure the highest freedom. There is a world-wide 
difference in the real social status of government in the

United States and in China, Russia,“Turkey, Cuba, or 
even Mexico. No country can acquire in a day or a 
generation what it has taken Anglo-Saxon civilization 
centuries to develop, for as freedom can never be be- 
queathed, so it can never be created by fiat. Neverthe- 
less, we may freely admit that the aforementioned 
countries have taken the first steps in the transition from 
static to dynamic government. 
In education most American states are free from cen- 
tral authorities which insist on doing all the thinking 
required, or in initiating all the changes that should be 
made. Such an order of things belongs to the old static 
group system, which produces servile, even if sleek and 
well-fed, conformists, not independent individuals, strong 
in codperation and initiative. Not infrequently, however, 
we find the old attitude under modern conditions, and 
education furnishes numerous examples. Among the 
most striking of these is the position taken by the older 
promoters of the kindergarten. They assume what may 
be called the religious attitude, since the system as it 
came from Frébel is held to be perfect, and any devia- 
tion is pronounced infidelity or profanation, to be visited 
by anathema. But when any system of thought may 
not be changed, it loses the aspect of a science and as- 
sumes that of a religion, with its mysteries and sacred 
symbols. The learner is then initiated into a sanctuary, 
rather than introduced into a laboratory, and the doc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  22 ETHICAL TRAINING 
trine at once takes on the characteristics of the static 
group. Over against the religious, we find the scientific 
attitude. The student now reflects that since Frébel’s 
day the whole doctrine of evolution has arisen, and with it 
genetic psychology and child-study. He calls to mind 
also that Frébel adjusted the machinery of his system to 
the peasant children of a foreign country in a previous 
generation, whereas the kindergarten with us now applies 
to a modern democratic society, with a different economic, 
political, and social background. He concludes, therefore, 
that the adjustment of the kindergarten to its environment 
is not disloyalty, but the highest and truest reverence. 
Such a view of the kindergarten is modern, dynamic, 
democratic, progressive —is, in short, scientific. It has 
all the characteristics that belong to dynamic or progres- 
sive social groups in which improvement keeps pace with 
social progress. 
Doubtless all American social groups are subject to the 
diseases inherent in the old static order, for we find at 
times not only religious conservation of the old because 
it is old, but also tyranny, exploitation, fraud, and graft ; 
fortunately, however, these groups also contain within 
themselves in still larger degree the forces of purgation and 
cure. Like the waters of the ocean, they purify them- 
selves by agitation and the unfailing salt of moral purpose.

tions, (3) educational doctrines (e.g. literary vs. industrial 
education), (4) economic systems. 
18. Whatever we may hold regarding the doctrine that 
the completely socialized individual is the goal of future 
development, it is evident that under the conditions of 
dynamic or progressive society the extent of social refer- 
ence of conduct can be almost indefinitely enlarged, not 
only without injury to the individual, but with a cor- 
responding expansion to the scope and effectiveness of his 
initiative and codperative efforts. Even under a highly 
centralized and autocratic government, like that of Ger- 
many, where, as the satirist declares, “ Allesist verboten,”+ 
this individual sense of freedom is not essentially im- 
paired, since he may codperate in rational, and protest 
against irrational injunctions. 
Under a more democratic government, like our own, 
this sense of freedom is greatly enhanced, for in addition to 
the dialectic of progress between the individual and the 
group, society is not so stratified but that each may feel 
himself a potential master in his assigned or chosen 
group. The only oppression in America is the denial 
of opportunity. In a progressive society, no other sin is 
so black as this negation, for it is starvation in a land of 
plenty, it is slavery in a country dedicated to freedom.

ant of the Russian village. The latter is bound by con-

modern state, may live in comfort, safe against dirt and 
disease (if not noise), and unaffected by the servility 
inherent in a static order of civilization. He is free in 
religion, in politics, in occupation, in residence, in educa- 
tion, and in his social life. If he has miseries, they are 
misfortunes or evils of his own making; if he would have 
blessings, they are his for the winning. The time and 
tide of opportunity wait daily upon his initiative, while 
organized society is ever ready to reward a hundredfold 
the services he renders.

2. The Psychology of Conduct: Internal and 
External Sanctions 
19. By sanction is meant primarily a ground of moral 
obligation, whether that ground be of internal or of ex- 
ternal origin; it may mean also a spring to moral action, 
impelling or inducing men to attain virtue, to effect the 
good. The discussion of sanctions belongs consequently 
to what has been called the psychology of conduct. 
Sanctions of conduct have either an internal or an ex- 
ternal origin; for they either arise in the self, its instincts, 
impulses, emotions, or reflections; or they spring from 
the obligations imposed by society. In complex cases 
both sets of forces are operative, when internal sanctions 
may reénforce external ones, or may flatly oppose them. 
‘Tuus, before the American Civil War, the “ underground 
railroad,” a device for conveying escaped slaves to Canada, 
brought conscience and constitution into sharp antithesis, 
since the moral repugnance to returning a fugitive slave to 
bondage overcame with many the validity of the legal

  26 ETHICAL TRAINING 
obligation to deliver him to his masters. In the lan- 
guage of that period, “ The higher law of conscience is 
superior to the lower law of the courts.” 
A conception that greatly aids in the discussion of in- 
ternal and external sanctions is that of a developing self in 
a developing society, since the whole aim of modern edu- 
cation is to develop a self that shall be not only socially 
coéperative, but shall also contribute to social improve- 
ment. The “ape” and the “tiger” of primitive man 
must be developed until natural impulse is either inhib- 
ited or else guided by reason; and slavish conformity to 
custom must be made to give way to intelligent social 
codperation or to constructive opposition to outgrown 
social laws.

20. This work is not concerned with the processes of 
moral development antecedent to the dawn of adoles- 
cence. How the various primitive instincts of imitation, 
play, curiosity, construction, aggression, expression, and 
the like, are gradually inhibited or brought under control 
through the establishment of habitual modes of thought, 
feeling, and action, is sufficiently explained in the many 
works that deal with these topics. 
But if childish impulses to action are by this time well

REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 27 
out of the way or under control, a new set of impulses, 
mostly of a social nature, awake with the dawn of adoles- 
cence, the most important and insistent of which is the 
instinct of sex. These new-born inner forces of the human 
being assume a moral character as they conform or run 
counter to the established customs and laws of society.* 
The important question that confronts us when we 
consider these inherent inner springs to action is, What 
is the basis of our moral obligation to inhibit some and 
control others? Does it lie within the confines of our 
own personality or is its origin to be sought in the social 
order about us? Is it passional or rational; is it religious, 
or legal and social; is it moral heteronymy or moral 
autonomy ; is it moral result or moral intention ; is it the 
authority of self or that of church or of state? 
We here encounter a nest of assumptions, arguments, 
and theories, many of them as old as reflective thought, 
which may easily bewilder the seeker for light. They 
can be adequately treated only in extended historical 
works such as those by Hobhouse,” Paulsen,’ and Dewey 
and Tufts.‘

21. The utilitarian theory of morals makes it a calcu- 
lus of pleasure and pain. That is pronounced “good” 
which brings a surplus of pleasure, and that “ bad ” which 
causes a surplus of pain. Consequently the primary 
ground of our obligation to do one thing and refrain from 
doing another is found in the effect of our action upon 
ourselves. But this at once raises the question, discussed 
in Chapter I, How far am I justified in seeking my own 
personal good ? 
The utilitarian hastens to add that the individual 
can have no right that is inconsistent with the general 
welfare, and contestants must, therefore, be made to 
recognize a common good, else there would be no check 
to the possible aggressions of the individual. But at 
this point the further question arises, Shall future good 
be sacrificed to present pleasure, or shall good of one kind 
be surrendered that another may be obtained? Evi- 
dently a reflecting personality, even if consciously pro- 
ceeding by the calculus of pleasure and pain, must inform 
himself concerning the permanent social and individual 
laws of health, growth, and development. The rule of 
life for such an investigator must therefore be: So act 
along developmental lines as to promote permanent well- 
being, and happiness. 
The desire which points to present pleasure may not 
agree with that well-regulated volition which leads to 
permanent happiness. But the harmony between in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  
‘ REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 29 
dividual happiness and social development is imperfect, 
and can only be approached gradually as society improves. 
The life of one may mean the death of another; a bit of 
present pleasure may entail widespread future misery. 
The highest conception to which this view of morals 
leads is not so much the immediate pleasure of individual 
or group, as that permanent advance in spiritual growth 
in which alone abiding satisfactions are found. 
Discussion :— Application of utilitarian principles to some 
of the various aspects of the act of lying. 
22. The foregoing distinctions, elaborated chiefly by 
Bentham,! are much clarified by evolutionary views more 
recently developed. Bain points out that a child passes 
through three stages in his moral growth: (x) that in 
which susceptibility to pleasure and pain is made use of 
to bring about obedience; (2) that in which command is 
given or punishment inflicted by those whom he admires, 
respects, and loves, and (3) that transformation which 
arises when the reasons for the command are apprehended. 
In the first stage pleasure and pain are the sole arbiters, 
in the second love is an added factor, while in the third 
the first two are reénforced by personal insight. This 
development is obviously incomplete, first, as respects 
individuals, for some miss the second or the third stage, 
and second, as respects the various kinds of conduct, for 
some who will respect all three incentives in one field will

be insensible to their claims in another. A man who 
would not abstract a nickel from a till, will sometimes 
withhold it from the street-car conductor. Others who 
would not steal a book directly will do it indirectly by 
borrowing without returning. Indeed, it is rather a safe 
generalization to declare that the most moral are yet 
immoral in spots, and that the most immoral are likewise 
moral in some things, or, as Dr. Lavendar declares, “I do 
not know by which I am the more impressed; the badness 
of the good, or the goodness of the bad.” 
Discussion : — Illustrations of the partial application of 
moral principles. 
23. To the restraining power of the various social in- 
fluences, pointed out by Bentham, Spencer’ would add 
the internal changes brought about in the race and in- 
herited by the young because of the long, unremitting 
pressure exerted throughout the entire period of human . 
development. It might be asserted that no man is more 
than a small percentage of himself; the most of him con- 
sists of his ancestors. This racial transformation varies 
with individuals; some remain in an arrested state of 
development, others rise to the upper levels of moral life, 
where external is replaced by internal sanction. 
Ifit is denied that acquired characteristics are inherited, 
then developmental advance must be explained by means 
of two factors: first, the fortuitous results of fortunate 
1“Principles of Ethics,” Vol. I, Part I, Chapter VII. 
|
-P-A-G-E-43
  REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 31 
parental union, and, second, the cumulative influence of 
social heritage. Taking up the second point first, it is 
doubtless of great moral advantage to the young that 
their social environment continually improves, in that 
moral standards rise as the impelling influences of the 
primary requisites for survival decline. Ward‘ maintains 
that certainly within historic times there has been no 
appreciable advance in the mental capacity of men, and 
that the lower classes are the intellectual equal of the 
higher. All improvement, he thinks, has been the result 
of our social advance. Race experiences, and their perma- 
nent record in books, inventions, structures, and institu- 
tions become constantly extended and enriched. Educa- 
tion takes advantage of this social development, and thus 
produces results that seemingly point to superior men- 
tality in the present generation. This, however, Ward 
contends, is merely illusion, due to the fact that modern 
education presupposes a better social heritage than 
the ancients enjoyed. According to this view, the old 
Greek scholars would be again the intellectual leaders 
of mankind, were they alive to-day. Could Aristotle 
have started with the advantages that are opened by 
the science of the present, he would be the peer, perhaps 
the superior, of any now living. But even if minds are now 
no more capable than they were then, the evolutionist may 
still point to the improvement consequent upon the steady 
1 “Applied Sociology,” pp. 95-110. 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 ETHICAL TRAINING 
accumulations arising from recorded human experiences. 
In one other particular, also, modern society is superior 
to the ancient, —its intellectual riches are better dis- 
tributed. 
What is true in the intellectual is true also in the moral 
world. The youth of to-day has an ethical heritage upon 
which to construct his moral character. 
Through physical heritage also, according to the Weiss- 
mann theory, evolutionary forces may further the develop- 
ment of the race, for even if the results of parental union 
are fortuitous, or incapable of secure prediction, it is certain 
that since the struggle for existence tends to eliminate the 
more unfit, parental union among the fittest who survive 
has a better chance of improving the offspring than would 
otherwise be the case. Consequently, whether we accept 
or reject the Darwinian assumption that acquired char- 
acteristics are inherited, it is evident that individual 
development is furthered by improvements, probably in 
individual, and certainly in social inheritance. 
Discussion :— Contrast the doctrines of Herbart with 
those of Darwin; of Weissmann and of De Vries. 
24. The most extreme claim for the validity of the 
rational aspect of the internal sanction is found in the 
moral theory of Immanuel Kant. His opening proposi- 
tion is, There is nothing morally good but the good-will. 
The theory that morality is nothing but a calculus of 
pleasure and pain cannot hold, he declares, for the end of 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 33 
desire is nothing but pleasure; furthermore pleasure is 
always individual and fluctuating, and may be selfish, 
even to the extent of harming others, so that happiness, 
or personal good, cannot be regarded as a sound basis for 
the estimation of moral worth. An action is therefore not 
moral just because it fulfils our desires, however ardent 
or praiseworthy these may be, or even though it square 
with social law or custom. The moral quality of an act 
depends upon something more stable than desire, for 
this fluctuates both in purpose and intensity, differing 
with persons, conditions, times, and circumstances. Mo- 
rality, according to Kant, is made of sterner stuff; it knows 
no variableness or shadow of turning; it is the same for 
all men, and for each man at all times. It is and must 
be law-accordant, hence universal and necessary as to its 
basis and scope. Morality recognizes such words as 
ought, duty, conscience. For the same reasons that mo- 
rality cannot be dependent upon the heterogeneity of 
desire, so it cannot be dependent upon the equally hetero- 
geneous character of outer sanctions, whether of civil law 
or of social custom. These things change with changing 
conditions, but moral worth remains untouched by such 
vicissitudes. Kant therefore recognizes two aspects of 
the will, one guided by the solicitations of desire, the 
other by the dictates of reason. Through reason, auton- 
omy of the will arises; through desire, heteronomy. 
The moral law inheres in the autonomous will. Being 
D 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 ETHICAL TRAINING 
generated by reason, this law cannot become divided and 
inconsistent, for reason has but one voice concerning any 
given act, since reason by its very nature is never incon- 
sistent, never like a house divided against itself. 
It is necessary, however, to formulate the moral law, 
if men are to be able to recognize and follow it. Plainly, 
a law that is to be universal cannot at the same time be 
specific and detailed. If it is to be always valid, it must 
render the conduct of its obedient servant consistent with 
itself, and must of course conduce to his ultimate survival 
and rational welfare. It must, moreover, be of easy 
application to concrete cases. Kant’s formulation of the 
moral law, his famous categorical imperative, is as follows : 
So act that through your own will the maxims of your 
conduct might become universal laws. 
This means that if we would test the moral value of a 
proposed action, say taking the unprotected property of a 
neighbor to promote our own welfare, all we need to do is 
to imagine the consequences were this act made universal, 
so that everybody should be free to do what we are pro- 
posing for ourselves. Under such a rule no property 
would be secure except such as were personally defended. 
To “possess”? a thing we should have literally to sit 
upon it, as the word possess signifies. Might alone would 
make right. Neither individual nor social group could 
retain anything not constantly defended. Kant con- 
cludes that no rational creature desiring to be secure in
-P-A-G-E-47
  REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 35 
the ownership of any property whatever could of his own 
volition will an order of things which would render such 
desire futile. If, however, having seen the ultimate con- 
sequences of such universalizing of the maxim by which 
he is tempted to act, he still yields to the temptation, then 
his deed is plainly and consciously immoral. The cate- 
gorical imperative is not an order to do this or to refrain 
from doing that, but is only a general formula for testing 
the morality of actions. Duty is nothing but the obliga- 
tion imposed upon us by reason to follow the moral law 
involved in the formula. 
If it be asked, What aside from bare rationality impels 
us to obey, that is, to apply the tests of the categorical 
imperative? the answer is, pure reverence for the moral 
law. In the words of Kant himself : ‘‘ Duty, then, consists 
in the obligation to act from pure reverence for the moral 
law. To this motive all others must give way, for it is 
the condition of a will which is good in itself, and which 
has a value with which nothing else is comparable.” + 
Discussion :—Apply the categorical imperative to con- 
crete cases as follows :— 
1. Deceiving an enemy in war, in love. 
Deceiving a friend for his own good. 
. Lying to protect a friend. 
. Lying for one’s own benefit. 
. Committing suicide. aon

6. “Watering stock.” 
7. Gambling’ on the Board of Trade. 
8. Using the funds of a bank for speculation to enrich the 
bank. 
25. But how can reason impose a binding law upon 
us? Just because it is reason, and therefore an end in 
itself. Every rational being necessarily conceives of his 
own existence as an end in itself, not as a means for some- 
thing else. Just as he regards his flesh as existing for his 
bodily good and not for satisfying the appetite of an ani- 
mal, so he conceives his rational existence as its own end, 
not as material for the promotion of foreign good. Thus 
conceiving himself, it is plain that if he obeys the cate- 
gorical imperative, he must likewise conceive of every 
other man, no matter what his station in life, as also an 
end in himself. That is, as Kant expresses it, “ All ra- 
tional beings stand under the law, that each should treat 
himself and others, never simply as means, but always as 
at the same time ends in themselves.” ! This means that 
personality is sacred, and must never be debased into a 
mere means of serving the good of another, as in mental 
or physical slavery. The man himself, on the other hand, 
may sell his labor, but he must not barter his will or his 
soul. These belong to him as an autonomous being, and 
he can never surrender them without ceasing to be a man. 
The true moral foundation, according to these views, 
1 Watson’s “Selections,” p. 248. 
 
-P-A-G-E-49

is the autonomy of the individual will, that is, a will not 
constrained by outer circumstance, but ever obedient to 
that law of reason which is expressed in the categorical 
imperative. Duty is the moral obligation thus to obey. 
But this principle, highly subjective as it appears, leads 
to a certain extent over into social applications; for if 
every man is supposed to be acting according to maxims 
that might through his own volition become universal 
laws, it is plain that these laws will fall into systems in 
accordance with the various institutions built up about 
the ideas of religion, government, economics, education, 
and the like. In this way there will arise what Kant 
calls a “ kingdom of ends,” in which all rational beings are 
properly related. Our maxims of conduct will no longer 
bear the stamp of anarchistic individualism, but will be 
reflected in a social order. 
Discussion :— Comparison of Kant’s “Kingdom of Ends” 
with actual society. 
26. Though all must concede the usefulness of the 
categorical imperative as a test for the morality of .any 
proposed action, and though we may gladly acknowledge 
the dignity and validity of a system that endows person- 
ality with absolute worth and exalts the moral value of the 
good will, yet we may well inquire, whether or not the last 
word in the moral problem has been spoken. That there 
is something else, we may conclude for two reasons: first 
because personality has been divided, so that only one 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 ETHICAL TRAINING 
aspect of it has moral quality, all the rest being either 
unmoral or immoral; and second because the sources of 
moral obligation have also been divided, the personal 
being exalted and the social slighted, ignored, or denied. 
Kant always viewed moral problems from the stand- 
point of metaphysics, never from that of psychology. 
This led him to search for the logical presuppositions of 
experience, but never to analyze the experience itself. 
Searching for the universal and invariable, he rejected 
desire entirely as a factor in moral life because it is vari- 
able. The modern psychologist, however, who seeks to 
explain the genesis and development of will, finds that 
desire performs a most important function in revealing 
and realizing the ends that make for personal and social 
survival and progress. Desire simply as a means for 
securing pleasure as an end in itself is as devoid of moral 
worth as Kant thought, but desire as a necessary means 
for arousing and directing the energies of the will has a 
moral value that Kant did not recognize. “ Biologically, 
impulse and appetite represent, not a striving for pleasure, 
but a striving to maintain and further the life process.” + 
Again, when we inquire what particular emotion aids 
the will to apply and obey the categorical imperative, it 
is found that reverence alone is relied upon. Reason and 
reverence therefore constitute Kant’s whole machinery for 
1 Dewey, “Interest as Related to Will,” p. 236. See also Dewey and 
Tufts, “Ethics,” Chapter XVI. 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
    
REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 39 
realizing the moral life. Reverence, however, comes late 
and is certainly not marked during adolescent years. As 
Dewey says, “ the self is split in two,” and the part most 
useful in helping the will to follow insight, namely, im- 
pulse, emotion, desire, is ignored or positively rejected.t 
This at least is true for the unrationalized desire. If it 
be objected that we never act at all except from desire, 
Kant’s admonition is, first rationalize the desire in accord- 
ance with the categorical imperative. By so doing, 
pleasure as an end will be eliminated. Should it come 
anyway as a by-product, we may indeed accept it thank- 
fully enough, but we must not imagine that it is the meas- 
- ure of the moral value of our act. Happiness is not in- 
consistent with duty, but it must not be made the incentive 
to moral conduct until it has been tested and classified 
by the application of the categorical imperative.? 
As the self is conceived to be divided, and the rational 
part retained while the sensuous is rejected as the source 
of virtue, or moral worth, so, in similar manner, the sources

life will be found in Chapter VI.

“Willingly serve I my friends, but I do it alas with affection. 
Hence I am plagued with this doubt, virtue I have not attained!” 
to which he is supposed to receive this reply : — 
“This is your only resource, you must stubbornly seek to abhor them ; 
Then you can do with disgust that which the law may enjoin.” 
See Dewey and Tuits, “Ethics,” p. 349. 
   
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 ETHICAL TRAINING 
of moral obligation are also divided and the subjective 
retained while the objective or social are rejected. It 
may indeed be prudent to conform to social customs or to 
yield obedience to legal requirements, but according to 
Kant there is no morality in such sanctions. They may 
happily coincide with the prescriptions of the moral law, 
but this fact gives them no force as moral imperatives. 
They give us no warrant for doing as the Romans do 
when we chance to be among them. Only in one way, 
as we have seen, does Kant recognize that we live in a 
social world and have social obligations, which is of 
course his recognition of the autonomy of other selves. 
These we are bound to recognize as ends in themselves, 
not mere means for the promotion of our own welfare. 
Though Kant’s phrase A Kingdom of Ends points to social 
organization, yet the prevailing impression left by his 
discussion is that we live in a system which at best is a 
congeries of autonomous individuals. Of the systems 
described by political, economic, and social science, and 
their resulting moral obligations binding upon the indi- 
vidual, there is scarcely a trace’in Kant’s exposition. 
Discussion :— 1. Extent to which social customs must seem 
rational to the individual before they are binding upon him, 
as to the following: (a) table manners, (4) fashions in dress, 
(c) wine drinking, (d) smoking, (e) dancing, (f) theatre- 
going. 2. Extent to which legal enactments must appear 
rational to the individual before they are morally binding 
upon him, as to (a) taxes, (6) military service, (c) the per-

sonal avenging of wrongs, (d) stock gambling, (e) horse racing, 
(f) exercise of the suffrage, (g) right to work in or out of a 
labor union. 
(2) External Sanctions 
27. If the rational and sensuous nature of the individual 
is one pole of moral conduct, society as a system of obliga- 
tions is certainly the other. For a system of completely 
developed persons, the rational individualism of Kant 
would perhaps suffice, since each might be supposed to   
      
have perfect insight and to be animated by that good-will 
which Kant thinks the essence of morality. But for a 
system in which men are in the making, where none are 
fully developed, and where the mass range downward to a 
moral zero in insight, disposition, and volitional power, 
it is evident that social institutions are needed for guid- 
ance and for the exercise of the authority that develops. 
They are sources, therefore, of moral obligation, unifying 
men, and effecting a formative function in the moral 
development of the individual. They are the concrete 
form of human interdependence, the highest attained 
realization of the idea of humanity. It is only through 
institutions that the caprice of theindividual finds a limit 
which cannot be safely passed ; it is here that his imper- 
fect insight is corrected by crystallized race experience ; it 
is only through institutions that his “ good-will ” can be 
effectively realized in the objective world; and finally it 
is only by means of institutions that the individual is able 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  42 ETHICAL TRAINING 
to secure for himself and his posterity any abiding benefit 
from the sacrifices he has made or the energies he has 
expended. In so far, therefore, as men are social beings, 
and in so far as the institutions of society are needful to 
their advance, and useful in embodying in law and custom 
the progress they have made, the organized will of society 
becomes a ground of moral obligation, and hence the 
source of important moral sanctions. 
Discussion :—- Illustrations of society’s methods of secur- 
ing ethical advance respecting (a2) amusements, (b) humane 
treatment of offenders, (c) wars, (d) disasters, (e) feuds, etc. 
28. The idea of a developing self in a developing society 
renders it unnecessary that there should be complete 
coincidence between the self and society, whether the 
self be conceived as sensuous or as rational or as both 
sensuous and rational. 
An individual at any stage of his moral development 
may be supposed to have attained some stability of char- 
acter, in which certain moral imperatives have become 
established in moral habits. Thus, with a given person, an 
open saloon door or the odors emanating fromit are not 
an effectual solicitation to enter. A regulative principle 
concerning this matter has been accepted and acted upon, 
until what might once have been a temptation is no longer 
such. On the other hand, however, a growing self is with 
respect to many types of action always on the moral firing- 
line, where both internal and external forces are needful to 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES 43 
raise the old habitual self to a new plane of conduct. It 
is on this firing-line that conscience awakes, that duty 
emerges, that moral victories are won or moral defeats 
suffered. It is here that, in the words of Dewey, “ Social 
influences enable an individual to realize the weight and 
import of the socially available and helpful manifestations 
of the tendencies of his own nature and to discriminate 
them from those which are socially harmful or useless.” ! 
Out of this recognition of the conflict of individual caprice 
or subjective convictions with established law and custom 
arises the sense of social duties and the binding nature 
of the obligations that society is determined to en- 
force. 
The converse of this situation arises from the fact that 
society, too, is developing and has its own firing-line, where 
convention, tradition, and legal enactment come into 
conflict with new conceptions of a better social order. In 
the case of a man whose moral status is below that- of 
society we have the exercise of society’s well-known 
methods of social pressure in matters not vital, and of 
coercion in those that are; but when the man has reached 
a moral status above that to which society has attained, 
the opposition between the two may assume various forms. 
It may be that the individual will submit without other 
than inward protest, as to a resistless tyranny; or hemay 
utterly refuse to conform, even to the extent of suffering 
1 Dewey and Tufts, “Ethics,” p. 362. 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 ETHICAL TRAINING 
martyrdom, as where the peacefully inclined refuse even 
~ in the face of the severest punishment to perform military 
service; or finally he may outwardly conform, while at 
the same time protesting aloud against an imposition that 
society has no moral right to inflict upon him. Here 
again we come upon the eternal dialectic, or interaction, 
between the individual unit and the social whole. If, on 
the one hand, the will of the individual is not supreme, , 
neither, on the other, is that of society. But both acting 
together, now mutually checking, now supplementing, 
now reénforcing each other, make up the great dialectic 
of progress which lifts individual and social groups to 
higher levels. It is in this way that both make progress. 
How these forces interact in static and in dynamic stages 
of society may be seen in subsequent sections (11 to 18).° 
Baldwin sums the matter up as follows :! — 
1. “ The examination of society reveals a body of rules 
of conduct with sanctions which are in the main adequate 
for the private life of the individual. : 
2. “ The examination of the individual gives rules and 
sanctions which are in the main adequate for social life. 
3. “ Neither of the above principles is absolute. 
4. “ The principles just formulated find their ground in 
the method of progress of society,” as follows: — 
a. “ The method of progress of society is a dialec- 
tic.

  CHAPTER III 
THE ADOLESCENT IN MODERN SOCIETY: NEW 
BASES OF SOCIAL IMPERATIVES 
29. From the standpoint of heredity, the adolescent 
may be defined as one in whom the inherited past is just 
budding for future bloom and fruit; or, to change the 
figure, one who possesses many inherited tendencies in 
an unstable equilibrium. These tendencies may be inhib- 
ited, or further developed, or organized to produce new 
traits of character. 
Society, however, when regarded as a resultant of past 
forces, is seen to be an organization established in rela- 
tively stable equilibrium. This is true because society 
means collective human experience crystallized into insti- 
tutions, which express themselves in modes of thought, 
habits of action, written codes, laws, constitutions, and 
the like. The adolescent individual, largely unconscious 
of his heredity, is plastic and easily directed into new 
forms of thought and conduct; whereas society, com- 
posed of adults upon whom the past has deeply set its 
stamp of tradition, custom, morals, and institutional 
life, responds but slowly and with reluctance to sugges-

tions for new interpretations of old doctrines or for radi- 
cal changes in behavior. 
Discussion :—1. Examples of (1) adolescent plasticity, 
(2) social rigidity. 
30. A favorite method of society for the moral training 
of adolescents is the direct exercise of authority in com- 
mand and prohibition. The youth is compelled on pain 
of punishment to inhibit all his impulses to proceed con- 
trary to the established order. This method succeeds to 
the extent that the situation makes the exercise of author- 
ity seem rational and necessary. The comfort, health, 
and even life of children depend upon their submitting 
to the authority of their parents respecting these things; 
both individual and community welfare necessitate the 
_ exercise of police power respecting public order and of 
legal power in general respecting life and property and 
public morals. But externally incited inhibition works 
badly with adolescents whenever the situation does not 
support the command or prohibition to the extent of = 
making it seem obviously rational and necessary. The 
rigorism of puritanism once succeeded, because the reli- 
gious and political situation in England and America 
rendered some such policy needful for the maintenance of 
political and religious liberty; even if the young man 
could not see the need of drawing the lines so tightly, 
the community of his elders could, so that public senti- 
ment supported the regulations. Any attempt to-day,
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 ETHICAL TRAINING 
however, to restore such a system would certainly fail, 
for the situation would not support it. Neither adoles- 
cent nor community would submit to a rigorism not 
founded in vital needs. 
The spirit of adolescence is, therefore, in eternal oppo- 
sition to that of society, in so far as the latter is unable 
to justify its position by appeals to the logic of the situa- 
tion. This fact, taken into consideration with the ob- 
vious tendency of society to enforce old prescriptions long 
after the causes that occasioned them have ceased to 
operate, makes it incumbent upon every succeeding gen- 
eration to examine anew the grounds of its imperatives. 
Unless this is done, opposition arises between old and 
young, and ideals that once moved the race to action or 
steeled it to endurance lose their force. 
Discussion:— 1. Is there a need for a “return to puritan- 
ism” in any aspect of education? 2. Examples of unprofit- 
able rigorism in the training of youth, of unjustifiable laxity. 
31. Ideals of conduct and character grow naturally 
out of social conditions. The Turks of Asia Minor 
relieve mental excitement by a massacre of Armenians ; 
American Indians burned their captives at the stake, a 
form of torture not unknown to presumably more civil- 
ized peoples. Personal sacrifices of comfort, of the 
necessaries of existence, and even of life itself, have from 
time to time been exalted as the most sublime traits of 
character, until agony has been deemed the necessary 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  
THE ADOLESCENT IN MODERN SOCIETY 49 
concomitant of virtue. Martyrdom, either self-pre- 
scribed or outwardly inflicted, has at times become the 
highest goal of character. Even to-day our minds turn 
more readily to the courage and self-sacrifice of firemen 
than to plans for making houses non-combustible. We 
are inclined to prize more highly the rescue of the wounded 
than the prevention of the strife; to praise more highly 
the heroes in the battle against disease than the efforts of 
the board of health to prevent it. We bewail the slaughter 
of tuberculous cattle, and the inconvenience of travellers 
at the quarantine station, but we applaud the invincible 
courage of those who go down to death because our pre- 
ventive measures are ineffectual. 
This old idea that suffering is the measure of worth 
grew out of a condition of society that no longer exists in 
favored lands like our own. It was a condition of deficit 
and pain. There was deficit of food, clothing, and shelter 
for the individual, and deficit of material resources and 
military power for the community. There was lack of 
protection against disease, and lack of means for com- 
munication and transportation, so that famine and pesti- 
lence were the twin terrors of such a social state. Under 
such conditions the few who were strong could only thrive 
by the exploitation of those who were not. The weak 
were made to work for the strong, without adequate 
return, and in times of stress were called upon to sur- 
  render even their lives for the welfare of their superiors. 
E 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  5° ETHICAL TRAINING 
Pain was thus made the attendant of service, and agony 
the measure of moral worth! The old ideals still tend to 
prevail, but the conditions that produced them have de- 
parted. That the old order of deficit and pain has given 
way to a new order of surplus and satisfaction, may be 
seen by considering a few facts. 
The new agriculture laughs to scorn the old Malthusian 
fear of a frontier of starvation which the race cannot pass, 
because of sheer inability to produce food. The new 
technology rejoices in practically unlimited power to 
produce clothing, shelter, tools, machines, and means for 
transportation and communication. Capital and organi- 
zation make it possible to increase the wealth of the few 
without the exploitation of the many to the point of pain. 
Capitalists and workmen may thrive together, even if not 
at the same rate. It is now possible for men to pay taxes 
without decreasing their comforts; indeed, in most com- 
munities, no money brings so large a share of personal 
satisfaction as that paid for paving, fire and police protec- 
tion, water supply, sewage system, lighting, and education. 
In other words, pleasure and not pain is now the concomi- 
tant of sacrifices for public welfare. 
Discusston : — 1. Provisions for conserving and increasing 
the fish supply in our river and ocean. 2. Utilization of 
tropical and semi-tropical food products. 3. Function of

chapters on Resources and on Character. 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE ADOLESCENT IN MODERN SOCIETY 5r 
rapid transportation in distribution. 4. Fields in which the 
heroic virtues of self-sacrifice are still essential. 
32. Changed social conditions produce modifications in 
our ideals of moral values. If the situation in which men 
find themselves no longer demands suffering as a natural 
or even a necessary concomitant of virtue, it is inevitable 
that ultimately the ethical emphasis should shift from the 
moral worth of agony to that of the benefits of service for 
mutual welfare. Though it may readily be granted that 
occasions will frequently arise where old forms of self- 
sacrifice costing comfort, health, and even life itself are 
still called for, and will still bear the old heroic stamp of 
virtue, yet on the whole it must be maintained that these 
embodiments of old moral ideals are exceptional, and can- 
not be allowed to usurp the whole field of moral values. 
A distinction should be made between conventional and 
actual self-sacrifice. The former is pleasant and praise- 
worthy; the courtesies of polite society conduce to the 
agreeableness of social intercourse, and doubtless lead to a 
mitigation of natural antagonisms, but at best the con- 
ventional code is convenient rather than vital. It is quite 
worth while to insist upon good form in all social inter- 
course among the youth under our charge, for by so doing 
we not only tend to mitigate natural violence of opposition 
to persons or actions that do not please us, but we also 
thereby contribute to a rational toleration of views not our 
own. The ideal of mutually advantageous service should, 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 ETHICAL TRAINING 
however, displace that of personal sacrifice in the larger 
affairs of life, such as the enforcement of law, the paving, 
cleaning, and lighting of streets, the construction of build- 
ings with respect to health and incombustibility, pro- 
vision for public safety in and out of doors, the laying of 
sewers, the disposal of sewage, the purity of the water- 
supply, the prevention of the spread of diseases, the care 
of the sick and unfortunate, maintenance of public schools 
for equality of educational opportunity as well as for social 
and political equality, and in general the promotion of 
public welfare. 
Along with this shifting of emphasis upon moral vir- 
tues there goes a corresponding transformation of offences 
against self and others. Here we again encounter the 
distinctions between sin and vice pointed out by Ross 
(Section 8). Sin is conceived as offence against others, 
and vice as conduct injurious to the higher self. Doubt- 
less vice in this sense merges into sin, for there are few 
things harmful to self that are not likewise injurious to 
those most nearly related to us. Drunkenness in the 
father afflicts all the members of his family in their com- 
fort and happiness, and distinctly lowers the well-being 
of the various groups of which the drunkard is a member. 
So, conversely, offences against the social group injuri- 
ously affect the person doing the wrong. 
Although the old distinctions between sin as violation of 
the laws of God, and crime as violation of the laws of man, 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE ADOLESCENT IN MODERN SOCIETY 53 
still have validity, and though vice in all its hideousness is 
still to be found amongst us, yet, on the whole, the storm- 
centre of the warfare against immorality is the effort to 
mitigate or eliminate the exploitation of men and things 
for the benefit of the few, who, respecting public opinion as 
to old forms of vice and crime such as drunkenness, un- 
truthfulness, personal violence, theft, burglary, forgery, 
perjury, and the like, yet by systems of indirection man- 
age to exploit the public to their own enhanced advantage. 
The stealing is real, though concealed under new terms 
such as franchises, monopolies, and trusts. Competitors 
are crushed, natural resources which should bless future 
generations exhausted in a few years, municipal re- 
sources squandered by graft and other forms of corrup- 
tion. Daniel Webster said of Alexander Hamilton that 
he struck the rock of national resources and abundant 
streams of revenue gushed forth. In other words, when 
taxation became indirect and impersonal, revenue came 
abundantly and without protest. In the same way, the 
modern exploiter has changed his system from that of 
direct and personal exploitation to one that is indirect 
and impersonal. Here again abundant streams of revenue 
gush forth without effective protest, but this time not for 
public, but for private good. The dominant political 
rings in our cities always exact their percentages of money 
raised for public benefit, franchises to exploit the com- 
munity are obtained by fraud or finesse, stocks are 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 ETHICAL TRAINING 
watered, swindling corporations established, values arti- 
ficially inflated or depressed to enrich one group or to 
destroy another, and, not unduly to prolong the list of 
modern plagues, gigantic trusts or corporations enrich 
themselves by methods comparable to those of indirect 
taxation. 
Discussion :— 1. Comparison of old and new methods of 
charity. 2. Should mine owners be held responsible for pre- 
ventible accidents? for all accidents whether preventible or 
not? 3. Should manufacturers be held responsible for acci- 
dents and for loss of health arising from remediable condi- 
tions? 4. Illustrations of modern methods of exploitation 
of men and natural resources. 
33. To the high-school teacher this shifting of em- 
phasis in merits and defects of character calls for in- 
creased vigilance and widened effort. The old forms are 
still with us, even if in lessened degree, and the new are 
inherent in our more intensive modern social relations. 
Without dimming our perception of the moral worth of 
painful self-sacrifice, we must recognize and cultivate 
those forms of service that contribute to the well-being of 
all. While combating and eliminating as far as possible 
the vice that degrades the individual, we must at the same 
time bring insight and conscience to bear on those more 
subtle and effective indirect forms of public plunder, 
which are not yet adequately comprehended, condemned, 
and punished. Manifestly, we have here to do with the 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
THE ADOLESCENT IN MODERN SOCIETY 55 
establishment of new insights, ideals, inhibitions, and 
resolutions. 
Discussion :— 1. Under modern urban conditions what are 
proper occasions for the exercise of (1) physical courage? 
(2) anger? (3) exposure to danger? 2. Proper attitude 
toward intrenched evils like (1) the saloon, (2) the “white 
slave” trade, (3) political organizations for public plunder, 
(4) monopolies. 
34. Turning now to some of the more effective means 
for strengthening character against the inroads of evil, 
we have further to examine the various stimuli to inhi- 
bition of impulses and motives for wrong-doing. It has 
already been shown that externally incited inhibition 
through the agency of command and prohibition succeeds 
only so far as it is supported by the situation, but fails 
when this exercise of authority is not adequately reén- 
forced by obvious necessity or by public opinion (Section 
30). The most effective inhibitions are those that are 
internally incited, as through conformity to ideals, obedi- 
ence to accepted regulative principles, the results of well- 
grounded moral habits, and especially through the pre- 
ponderating force of complementary, as opposed to isolated, 
motives. This last consideration is of particular signifi- 
cance in our intensely codperative society. 
It is no longer necessary to condemn the world and the 
flesh, for it is only when they are perverted that they 
become devilish. The economist easily convinces us that

industry, thrift, accumulation of capital, national and 
private wealth, in short, economic well-being, are the 
necessary conditions for the development of the higher 
nature of man. The biologist with equal ease proves 
that every natural appetite and passion has played its 
part in the physical survival and well-being of the race. 
The appetites perpetuate the race and energize mind and 
body; the passions stir up and release these internal 
forces. The moral problem now is conceived to be the 
proper subordination, not the elimination, of inherited 
traits. The monastics thought that the higher virtues 
could be attained only by the slaughter of natural im- 
pulses. So they burned the body to warm the soul. 
The modern man nourishes the body to develop in greater 
perfection the sources of spiritual life. 
The impulses that lead to vice are insistent and per- 
sistent, but they may be isolated; those that point to 
higher things are perhaps weaker and more remote, but 
they may be combined. As an army is stronger than a 
giant, so an aggregate of complementary and associated 
motives may be more powerful than strong but isolated 
temptations. A youth, for illustration, desires above all 
things to be, let us a say, a locomotive engineer. Such an 
occupation fulfills his highest dreams of distinction, 
power, rewards. He sees himself the controller of un- 
limited force and intrusted with the lives of thousands, 
the annihilator of space, the trusted guardian of wealth, 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
THE ADOLESCENT IN MODERN SOCIETY 57 
the pride and envy of his humbler companions, the dis- 
penser of what to him is an affluent salary. Each of these 
motives is complementary to every other, and all depend 
upon the attainment of the great ambition, the becoming 
of an engineer. Over against these associated ends 
stands, let us say, an invitation of some of his acquaint- 
ances to go with them into a saloon. If the youth is 
ignorant, or devoid of the imagination necessary to trace 
the consequences of proposed actions, or has no memory 
for the pain of past transgressions, he will probably 
accept the invitation. If, on the other hand, he is aware 
that railroads no longer appoint men to be engineers who 
are known to frequent saloons, or will retain those known 
to drink alcoholic liquors, and if he has imagination and 
memory, and the mental power to contrast the glowing 
group of unfulfilled ambitions with the isolated pleasure of 
gratifying the wish of his companions or the curiosity of 
his own mind, he will say to them, “ Boys I can’t go with 
you to the saloon, for, if I do, I shall injure my chances of 
becoming an engineer.”” Every high-school student has, 
or may have, like ambitions, which, in their aggregate 
strength, may be made to counteract the solicitations of 
strong but isolated temptations. 
Such prudential motives, or those of enlightened self- 
interest, are not perhaps the highest that may be ap- 
pealed to, but they are at least to be respected, and they 
have the great advantage of being always appropriate to

urge. However exalted an appeal to religion or virtue 
as an end in itself may be, there are occasions when it 
would not be effective; but no teacher is debarred from 
contrasting as strongly as he can the lower with the higher 
self-interests of his student. Such an appeal, if honest and 
sincere, is always respected, and but rarely resented.t

CHAPTER IV 
MORAL HABITS, NEW AND OLD 
35. Psychology, general and applied, explains suffi- 
ciently the nature of habit and the laws of its formation. 
It may in general terms be defined as a tendency to readi- 
ness and uniformity of response to stimuli, whether of 
external or internal origin. 
Habit has been well described as the balance-wheel of 
character. What this analogy signifies may perhaps be 
best seen from a recapitulation of the functions of the 
balance-wheel, say on a 4-cycle marine gasolene engine. 
Such an engine consists of a cylinder in which works a 
piston connected by a rod to a crank-shaft, on one end of 
which is fastened the propeller and on the other or inner 
end the balance-wheel. To start the engine the operator 
gives a whirl to the balance-wheel, thus drawing in an 
explosive charge of mixed air and gasolene and compress- 
ing it at the top of the interior of the cylinder. An 
electric spark explodes the charge, thus causing a sudden 
and powerful impulse to be communicated to the crank- 
shaft, and through it to the balance-wheel. But this 
wheel is very heavy and cannot be started forward with 
59 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
    60 ETHICAL TRAINING 
any such velocity as the explosion would naturally impart 
to the piston. The rapidity of the expansion of the gases 
is therefore checked, and they are compelled to exert 
their pressure at the rate necessitated by the motion of 
the balance-wheel. Here, then, is its first function — to 
equalize the expansive pressure of the exploding gases. 
The balance-wheel, being heavy, has now acquired a strong 
momentum, and could be stopped in the time it took to 
acquire this momentum only by a force equal to that 
which imparted it. There being no object in stopping 
the wheel, its motion is used to perform certain necessary 
offices before a new explosion of gases can impart a new 
impulse. _As the piston reaches its lowest position a 
valve opens at the top of the cyclinder for the burnt gases 
toescape. The return of the piston expels all that remain. 
On its next downward stroke the piston draws in by 
suction a new charge of explosive gases, which is in turn 
compressed by the second upward stroke. The com- 
pressed gases are now fired as at first by the electric 
spark, and a new impulse is given to the balance-wheel, 
which consequently in return for one working impulse 
performs the following operations: (1) expels the burnt 
gases, (2) draws in a new charge of explosive mixture, 
and (3) compresses it for firing. All the surplus energy 
produced by the explosion is exerted upon the propeller, 
which, acting against the water, pushes the boat forward. 
The first and second functions above named do not call 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  MORAL HABITS, NEW AND OLD 61 
for the exertion of much force; but the third demands a 
very considerable application of power in the compression 
of the charge of air and gasolene gas. During all these 
operations the balance-wheel keeps the propeller steadily 
at work so that it will propel the boat at a uniform rate. 
The most obvious conclusion from this survey of the 
various equalizing operations performed by the balance- 
wheel is that it originates no energy, but only applies it in 
such a way that violent explosions occurring at compara- 
tively distant intervals are made to perform a number of 
intervening operations, and at the same time to exert a 
steady pressure upon the water through the propeller, 
thus propelling the boat at a uniform rate. If the analogy 
is to be of much service in illustrating the function of habit 
in the moral life, it certainly consists in the suggestion that 
habit originates no moral energy, but merely in moments 
of conflicting strains carries us steadily by the dead points, 
and enables us to decide and act correctly in moments of 
temptation. The propelling force is not in the habit, but 
in accepted regulative principles, in matured insight, in 
memory of past experiences, and in imagination which can 
picture relations and ultimate consequences. Should we 
depend upon the habit alone to carry us safely through, 
it would doubtless fail us at many critical junctures, 
since its function is to equalize, not to originate, moral 
force. A mere habit of respecting the unprotected prop- 
erty of others would not save us from stealing in moments 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 ETHICAL TRAINING 
of sudden stress of hunger. Every drinking young man 
up to the time he enters a saloon has had the habit of pass- 
ing by with no thought of entering. To resist enticements 
successfully, he needs something more substantial than 
mere routine actions to support him. The habit must, 
like the balance-wheel, be but the equalizer of moral force, 
which, as before indicated, arises from regulative principles 
founded on insight, and reénforced by emotion, memory, 
and imagination. Moral resolution, therefore, based on 
intelligent comprehension and supported by an emotion 
that energizes, is the impelling force that renders habit 
the true balance-wheel of character. 
Discussion :— Application of this analogy in (1) social 
customs pertaining to bearing and language, (2) committing 
to memory (spelling, poetry, Lord’s Prayer, etc.), (3) emotions 
pertaining to cruelty to animals, the rescue of those in peril, 
etc., (4) offences against school order, (5) serious moral offences. 
36. Childhood is the period for the authoritative incul- 
cation of habits in home and school. These of course 
relate to industry, politeness, promptness, regularity, 
obedience, truthfulness, self-control, and the like. The 
exercise of this authority will be effective, whether the 
situations that prompt it are real or artificial. Firmly 
enforced parental authority is reality enough for the 
child. It is somewhat different, however, with adoles- 
cents. Capricious authority, or that not seemingly based 
upon real situations, is resented as artificial and arbitrary, 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  
MORAL HABITS, NEW AND OLD 63 
and it must be backed by force not easily resisted to be 
successful. Unless the reason for a given routine of action 
is apparent, the youth usually asks for it. This explains 
why it is so difficult to institute habits not imperatively 
called for, and so easy to form those that are impelled by 
  concrete life relations. The youth who cannot be in- 
duced to regularity in going to work where the need of so 
doing is not immediately apparent falls into it easily and 
naturally whenever regularity is a necessary condition of 
his employment. An artificially generated habit having 
no strong motive force behind it, is consequently of small 
value in the trying exigencies of life. As the ever renewed 
resultants of moral achievements in the past, habits not 
artificially generated serve as impelling forces of forward 
movement and as inner stimuli to inhibition when inhibi- 
tion is needed. 
Discussion :— 1. Examples of efforts to establish habits 
for subjective reasons, respecting (r) time of rising, (2) prompt- 
ness in performing duties, (3) order in living-room, on study 
table, (4) carriage of body in walking, deep breathing, exer- 
cise, etc., (4) speech, ‘choice or avoidance of words, pronun- 
ciation, slang, etc. 
37. From the foregoing it is evident that with adoles- 
cents new habits of important ethical import must be 
founded on insight, supported by real needs, and reén- 
forced by all the sanctions, both internal and external, 
that can be brought to bear upon them. They should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
    
64 ETHICAL TRAINING 
launched under incentives as powerful as the exigencies 
of the case will warrant. These incentives will range all 
the way from bare prudence for physical and mental well- 
being, up to reverence for the highest ideals of truth and 
goodness. They will necessarily be accompanied by 
pictured rewards and penalties, whether of a material or 
a spiritual nature, which will of course awaken the emo- 
tional life. 
Training must take its subjects where it finds them, 
appealing to the highest motives that give promise of 
being effective. To a coarse and undeveloped character, 
it may be that only prudence for bodily welfare, such as 
that aroused by fear of the policeman’s club or the rav- 
  
  ages of swift, painful, and inexorable disease, will suffice as     
incentive for the establishment of a regulative principle 
of conduct. To a character already refined, such an ap- 
peal is unnecessary, and may be repulsive. In such a case 
an appeal to truth or the external fitness of things or re- 
gard for the rights of others or the demands of the higher 
self is both better in taste and more effective in result. 
The initial steps of breaking an objectionable habit are 
more diff   
      ficult than those necessary for launching a new 
one. The balance-wheel of habit here works against us, 
rather than for us: There is all the more need of deepen- 
ing insight, arousing sentiment, and appealing to sanc- 
tions, that the whole intellectual, emotional, and volitional 
being be energized until it is able to reverse the routine 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  MORAL HABITS, NEW AND OLD 65 
that may have become a second nature. With adults 
such a reversal is often well-nigh impossible, as may be 
seen in efforts to break such habits as swearing, drinking, 
smoking, gambling, or indulgence in grosser forms of vice. 
Fortunately, however, the adolescent, poised with uncer- 
tain equilibrium between respect for the old and aspira- 
tion for the new, between egotism and altruism, between 
the physical and immediate and the spiritual and remote, 
finds it far easier than does the adult to make and break 
the sequences of habit. Has he been lingering in the 
paths of dalliance, a forceful reminder, coming either from 
another or from his own mind and conscience, of his dan- 
ger or the wrong he is doing, may serve as sufficient 
incentive for a complete and final renunciation of the 
dangerous or evil way. A youth who had never had 
temperance instruction, had, however, once read the story, 
“Ten Nights ina Barroom.” At a later date he enlisted 
in the army. Having spending-money and idle moments, 
he began to drink the sutler’s beer. At first he greatly 
disliked the taste, but daily indulgence gradually changed 
the dislike, first to toleration, then to a growing liking, 
until he found himself daily anticipating the time that he 
might again indulge. It was at this point that a sense of 
possible danger took possession of his mind and, aside 
from any moral consideration whatever, caused him to 
break the habit once for all. The incipient and haunting 
desire for the drink soon disappeared, for the system had 
F 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  66 ETHICAL TRAINING 
not become abnormal or diseased. A few impressions 
concerning alcoholism, gained from reading the story, had, 
unconsciously to himself, crystallized into regulative prin- 
ciples, until in later life he found it easy to turn down 
his glass, even when hospitality urged indulgence. 
In some way the young must be taught the danger and 
wrong involved in evil habits; through some influence 
regulative principles must be implanted in their minds 
and hearts respecting these things, and through some 
agency the whole being must be energized until the new 
and desirable habit may be formed and maintained, and 
the objectionable one broken and permanently inhibited. 
Discussion :— Examples of successful making and break- 
ing of habits. 
38. A reliable means for inhibiting impulses and 
thoughts that tend to a downward course is the presence 
of a body of regulative principles so firmly fixed in mind 
that temptations are promptly dismissed the moment 
they emerge. If these principles are associated with 
strong repugnance for the conduct suggested, the prompt- 
ness and effectiveness of the inhibition are greatly reén- 
forced. Finally, if the mind has accustomed itself to 
inhibit the objectionable by the instantaneous substitu- 
tion of worthy ideas, there is small danger of going astray. 
This is where habits of thinking are important for the 
moral life. Principle saturated with emotion gives voli- 
tional strength to change the current of thought the 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  MORAL HABITS, NEW AND OLD 67 
moment it threatens to lead in wrong directions, and lead 
finally to a state in which the temptations that so easily 
beset the poor in principle and spirit cease to urge their 
claims. Habits of right thinking and feeling are therefore 
fundamental to right living. They are of especial im- 
portance during the hours in which we are alone, for the 
“foul fiend” is then within us and must be combated by 
inward forces. When he is ramping in the outer world 
we may oppose him by habits of action. When he solic- 
its us to do his will, we may do something else — may 
avert the face or pass by on the other side or observe the 
forms of decency imposed by social custom. We may 
say to him boldly, “ Get thee behind me, Satan.” 
It is in such situations that conventional habit builds 
a moral barrier between the youth and the abyss into 
which he is inclined to plunge, so that even such habits of 
behavior serve as a powerful inhibitory force. Much 
has been said, by Professor James and others, about the 
moral efficaciousness of inhibition by substitution — of 
avoiding the wrong by diligent application to the right. 
Character, however, is never secure until the inward fires 
generate the powers of outward action; until regulative 
principle and ethical emotion either produce that purity 
of heart in which evil cannot dwell, or maintain a stand- 
ing army to slay evil suggestions as fast as they arise. 
Discussion :— 1. Cause and cure of the “blues.” 2. How

wrongs? 3. Best ways to inhibit temptations to cheat, to 
overreach others, to gain an unfair advantage. 4. To what 
extent do competitive athletics develop the spirit of disregard 
for the rights of others? 5. What can inhibit the gambling 
among college students incited by the admonition, “Put up or 
shut up” ? 
39. As habit may be used to inhibit suggestions to evil 
until reason and principle can be brought to bear, so 
reason may illumine and reénforce habit. A habit ac- 
quired in unthinking conformity to conventional usage 
or authority may often, during the adolescent period, be 
filled with significance and added force when its inherent 
rationality is made apparent. This can perhaps be done 
most impersonally, hence most effectively, by tracing the 
origin, development, and ultimate significance of manners, 
customs, and: morals as they come to view in the daily 
work of the school, especially with classes in history and 
literature. Shylock, for instance, in a burst of passion, 
exclaims to Bassanio, who has invited him to dinner, 
“T will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, and 
so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, 
nor pray with you.” Why should he be unwilling to eat, 
drink, or pray with the Christian? The explanation is 
found in the customs originating with primitive peoples, 
whereby the exercise of hospitality placed men in an atti- 
tude of tribal unity and friendship. To break bread with 
a man was to accept his friendship, laying aside, tempo- 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
        
   
                                            
      
        
        
    MORAL HABITS, NEW AND OLD 69 
rarily at least, all strife and enmity. Should Shylock eat 
and drink with Bassanio, ages of enmity and persecution 
would have to be forgotten or ignored, while if he prayed 
with him, religious equality and unity would be assumed. 
These concessions could hardly be made in an age of active 
persecution. This thought may be developed further, 
until the meaning of modern hospitality is better under- 
stood — how it places all guests upon a plane of perfect 
social equality during its continuance, the differences of 
rank, wealth, and of intellectual and moral character 
being for the time completely ignored; how the dinner is 
used as a means of uniting diverse opinion for the support 
of desired lines of action, the expectation being that at least 
toleration and good-will in this direction will be attained. 
The indirect training in morals that comes from ration- 
alizing in this way the customs and morals we have ac- 
cepted from our ancestors may profitably be carried to 
considerable length. Works on anthropology and on the 
development of ethics will furnish the teacher the needed 
information.! 
Discussion :— Trace the origin, development, and signifi- 
cance of tribal customs respecting the following matters: 
(See Tylor, “Anthropology,” Chapter XVI.) 
1. The tracing of descent (a) from the mother, (5) from the 
father. 2. Social protection of the weak against the strong. 
1A few such works are mentioned : 1. Tylor, Edward B., “Anthropol- 
ogy”; 2. Spencer, H., “Principles of Sociology ”; 3. Dewey and Tufts, 
“Ethics ”; 4. Hobhouse, “Morals in Evolution.”

3. Kindness and gentleness of savages in peace, and their 
ferocity in war. 4. Use of the imagination in promoting good 
and mitigating evil. 5. Effect of public opinion of right 
and wrong upon nations. 6. Giving the best to the aged. 
7. Killing or exposing to death of the aged or the incapable. 
8. Manslaughter: when justifiable, when not. 9. Theft and 
plunder, when right, when wrong (customs in modern war- 
fare). 10. Retaliation for wrong done (private vengeance, feuds, 
etc.). 11. Responsibility of family or tribe for wrongs in- 
flicted (customs of the American Indians in this respect). 
12. Cities or temples of refuge. 13. Quarrels between states 
(modern efforts at arbitration). 14. Origin of laws respecting 
real and personal property. 15. Treaty customs (burying the 
hatchet, smoking the pipe, commingling the blood, feasting 
together, etc.). 16. Oaths, ordeals, etc. 
40. The preceding sections have shown the futility of 
trying with adolescents to inculcate moral habits having 
a merely perfunctory or artificial warrant, or of breaking 
those already formed, out of regard for outgrown or purely 
sentimental considerations. But even when these large 
classes are eliminated, the youth still finds himself con- 
fronted with enough urgent needs for the making and 
breaking of habits. The exercise of truthfulness and 
self-control; the avoidance of envy, jealousy, selfishness, 
injustice ; the practice of generosity, courage, temperance ; 
the inhibition of impure thoughts, and the avoidance 
of temptation and evil companions — furnish situations 
enough that are genuine, and a scope sufficiently wide 
for moral conquests over the lower self.

Successfully to form a desired new habit or to break ah™ 
objectionable old one, two requisites are of prime ne- 
cessity : (1) an active realization of the urgency of the need, 
and (2) an unbroken continuity in effort. In the larger 
affairs of life a single gigantic effort of will, reénforced by 
the emotion that accompanies such a struggle, may settle 
the whole matter once for all. This may easily be true 
regarding such momentous things as drinking and im- 
purity, as theft and falsehood; but in other things, such as 
practice in generosity, moral courage, and the overcoming 
of the baser feelings, oft renewed effort is frequently 
necessary before the mind can securely occupy the higher 
plane. Character is not made in a day; it is the slow 
growth of years; it does not come of wishing, but by 
courageous effort impelled by vital need; it is furthered 
by sympathetic guidance and by the insight that only 
educative instruction can, give.

  CHAPTER V 
SOME CARDINAL MORAL IDEALS, OLD AND NEW 
I. Justice 
41. The names of the virtues remain substantially un- 
changed, but their meaning alters to fit the age to which 
they are applied. If we may judge by appearances, there 
have been times when men were much more religious 
than they are now, at least to the extent of laying more 
stress upon beliefs and doctrines, yet the effect of religion 
upon conduct was certainly very different from what it 
is to-day. We no longer insist that men shall think and 
profess and conduct themselves alike respecting these 
matters, but in some of those earlier periods each faith 
that felt itself sufficiently powerful did not hesitate to 
punish non-conformity with excommunication or banish- 
ment or imprisonment or even with death at the stake. 
Again, if we may believe history, society in those ages of 
religious zeal was more prone to fall into vice or to be- 
come politically corrupt than at present, as can be seen 
in the decline of France in the seventeenth and eigh- - 
teenth centuries. Even if it be urged that this corrup- 
tion was in spite of the church, and to no extent because 
72
-P-A-G-E-85
  SOME CARDINAL MORAL IDEALS, OLD AND NEW 73 
of it, or that it was society that produced whatever was 
unlovely in religious bodies, still the point must be 
insisted upon that the content of religious life was differ- 
ent then from what it is now, and that religious influence 
to-day is more wholesome than it was then. 
Ideals of justice have always been important in the 
ethical life of every nation and age, yet here again we find 
great differences of opinion as to its content. If it be 
permissible to measure the standards of antiquity by 
those of the present, it must be said that men once tried 
to award justice to individuals under systems that were 
based on injustice. How can there be any thorough- 
going justice to a slave? The very fact that slavery 
exists at all is itself an injustice so gross as to cut the 
moral ground from beneath any so-called justice to the 
individual, so long as he remains a slave. How can we 
talk of the justice of English courts, when there were 
one hundred and fifty-six offences for which the offender 
might be made to suffer death? So, even to-day, how 
can we prate of justice to the miner, when he is exposed 
to the most imminent dangers, and always at his own 
risk? After a recent mine disaster in West Virginia, 
the owners appealed to a generous public to pay the 
bill for them, urging in their own behalf that they had 
permitted the widows and orphans of the dead miners to 
remain in the corporation’s quarters rent free for a period 
of six weeks! The towering injustice of our mining laws 
   
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 ETHICAL TRAINING 
is paralleled, even if in somewhat less glaring form, by that 
of our other industries. Miss Crystal Eastman! con- 
ducted an investigation in Pittsburg to see what burden 
falls upon the family of a workman who has the misfor- 
tune to lose his life through accident in labor. The period 
covered was one year. There were 304 deaths recorded. 
Of the 304 families represented, 88 received not one dollar 
of compensation from the employers; 93 received not 
more than $100; 62 received something over $100, but 
not more than $500; 61 families received more than $500, 
but most of them under $1000. The net probable earn- 
ings at the time of death were ascertained in the caseof 
193 of the married men. The wage loss to the families of 
these men, based on their earnings at the time of death 
and their expectation of life, $300 a year being deducted 
for the support of the man himself, amounted to over two 
and three-quarters million dollars. The total compensa- 
tion to these families, including funeral expenses, was ap- 
proximately $72,000 or about two and one-half per cent of 
the actual loss. Is it any wonder that labor clamors for 
an employers’ liability law and for better protection to 
the lives of employees? Germany lessens the burden 
caused by accident by laws that diminish its frequency, 
and she distributes it justly by compulsory insurance 
laws. She may with some show of consistency claim to 
dispense justice in this domain of economic life, since it is 
1See Devine, E. T., “Misery and its Causes,” pp. 96-104. 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  SOME CARDINAL MORAL IDEALS, OLD AND NEW 75 
a just exercise of laws based on just conditions; but until 
we mend our ways in the United States we may at best 
claim no more than just application of an unjust 
system. 
Notwithstanding facts of this kind, it is quite possible 
for men in any age to live in content, and with the com- 
placent belief that they are just in their treatment of 
their fellow-men, ignoring, or not perceiving, the injustice 
underlying their conduct, or with equal complacency 
ascribing the injustice that cannot be concealed to the 
decrees of an inscrutible providence. 
How idle would it be, therefore, for the modern teacher 
of adolescents to prate of justice as a word or a form 
devoid of specific content. The important question with 
them is not, Should justice obtain? but, What would be 
just under the conditions in which we live? Justice in 
the “ Arabian Nights ” has a different setting from justice 
in a Denver police court for juvenile delinquents. 
What is true about the content of ideals of religion and 
justice is equally true of all the other so-called cardinal 
virtues.

42. So, though the names of all the old virtues are still 
with us, they must have a new interpretation in order to 
fit the new setting. Subjectively, of course, attitude of 
mind is all-important. The “ good-will” is as good and 
essential now as it was when Kant first proclaimed it, or, 
indeed, when the morning stars first sang together. Real 
virtue must always lie behind convention if habitual 
behavior is to have a genuinely moral value. But men- 
tal attitude deserves an independent treatment, and may 
consequently be omitted from the present chapter, which 
is devoted to insight into moral ideals. 
Justice, which in the widest sense is a synonym for 
morality itself, as Dewey! points out, has had a number 
of different meanings. In the old Greek sense it means 
rectitude of conduct, righteousness, uprightness. To 
say that aman is just is, according to this definition, tosay 
that he is all that a neighbor and a citizen should be. 
This meaning passes easily over into the notions of fair- 
ness in dealing; equity in awarding praise and blame, or 
requital for good or evil deeds ; impartiality in the treat- 
ment of others; honesty in all the business affairs of life. 
The narrowest meaning of the term is its legal one, by 
which we mean the vindication of right through process of 
law. 
Justice in all its meanings implies that breadth of view 
which considers things in their fundamental relations, so

that, for instance, we shall not base our code of justice 
upon a broader one of injustice, such as Robin Hood’s 
system of robbing the rich to relieve the poor or of the 
modern practice of exploiting the poor to endow institu- 
tions. The old Greek ideal of whole-mindedness still has 
validity, and justice is perhaps its supremest manifesta- 
tion, for the just man responds to the whole of a situation, 
and not merely to a fragment of it. He tries to reconcile 
private with public good, and on the other hand so to 
order the affairs of the social whole that the just rights of 
all the members shall be conserved. Thus, when justice 
obtains in economic affairs, no tyranny of the majority 
over the life and death of the minority will be possible. 
Employers will not be able unfairly to exploit their la- 
borers, nor will the latter longer try to break the heads of 
those of their own class who feel that they must work to 
keep their wives and children from starving. In like 
manner, a just judge will take all circumstances and rights 
into consideration, refusing to render a biased decision ; 
a just merchant will correctly represent his wares, and 
take no advantage of necessity in order to charge an un- 
fair price; a just teacher will not for the sake of super- 
ficial uniformity subject any student to treatment essen- 
tially unjust, because all the conditions in the case are 
not considered. 
This whole-minded view of justice is impaired when 
the latter is made unduly harsh and severe. This harsh- 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 ETHICAL TRAINING 
ness, so often associated in the minds of people with courts 
of law and the execution of their decrees, may refer to the 
clumsiness of the law in fitting the punishment to the 
offence, to the manner of treating offenders, to severity of 
sentence, or to the unfeeling hardness of those charged 
with punishing crime. Children have often been thrown 
into jail among hardened criminals and thus schooled in 
vice; or adults, like Jean Valjean,! subjected to such in- 
iquitous treatment for trivial offences as to tend to steel 
the soul against all good influences. The old idea was 
that punishment is for retribution, which, to be effective, 
must be severe. But the modern idea is that it should be 
educative, not toward a worse life but toward a better one. 
Restraint may be necessary for the good of society, and 
hence just, but restraint alone is sufficient for retribution, 
All the rest must, if perfect justice is to be attained, be for 
reformation, for the type of treatment that makes a man 
better as an individual and more useful as a citizen. It 
is because of the iniquities of the law itself and the ten- 
dency of courts to become callous to suffering and indif- 
ferent to ultimate justice, that society has provided for 
the exercise of grace in the form of suspended sentence, or 
of pardon or mitigation of punishment for good behavior, 
or the partial or total remission of fines. 
The justice inherent in whole-mindedness is an ideal for 
youth, for it permits no contentment with conduct biased

by personal interest or rendered morally futile by preju- 
diced views or short-sighted snap judgment. In such 
an ideal there is no self-negation, for justice rendered in 
accordance with it is not cancelled by a cankering injus- 
tice further down. 
Discusston :—Application of the whole-minded adminis- 
tration of justice to the following: (1) the routine of high- 
school affairs, (2) cheating in class, (3) stealing, (4) lying, 
(5) going into a saloon. 
2. Temperance 
43. Another ideal that has powerfully affected human 
affairs is that of temperance. It is of the greatest impor- 
tance that adolescents should know something of the vary- 
ing interpretations that nations and periods of thought 
have given to it, together with an insight into its status 
in our own times. For it is especially in this field that 
the man of the near future will have moral questions to 
decide that aremomentous both for himself and for society, 
and this is, moreover, one of the domains where decision 
rests upon the insight and forceful conviction that come 
only from knowledge of all the essential aspects of ethical 
theory and practice. 
We know from Chapter II on Sanctions, as well as from 
general reading and observation, that every prominent 
ethical theory ever entertained by mankind is still held by 
some fraction of the population, and that there is a peri- 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 ETHICAL TRAINING 
odic return to asceticism whenever indulgence passes safe 
limits and threatens the dissolution of society. Thus, 
we find among us disciples of Epicureanism, Stoicism, 
Hedonism, Utilitarianism, as well as the sterner moral codes 
emanating from the philosophy of Kant and the practice 
of the Puritan. Yet, notwithstanding this diversity of 
view, each age is likely to be dominated by some character- 
istic theory of morals, which, on the whole, best fits its 
spirit and most promotes its progress. The paragraphs 
that now follow attempt to portray briefly a few such 
dominant aspects as they have historically appeared. 
It is with the Greeks that all ethical discussion most 
naturally begins, for they were the first people to bend all 
the energy of their minds to such matters. But the ruling 
passion of the Greek was the esthetic — that perfect 
balance of mind and body, of impulse and reflection, of 
appetite and reason, that produces the beautiful, the 
becoming, the graceful, the harmonious, and hence 
with them the moral. We should not, therefore, be 
surprised to find in him a view of temperance that differs 
perhaps radically from our own. Aristotle developed 
the dominant Grecian ethical view in his principle of the 
‘golden mean,’ according to which virtue rests in harmoni- 
ous moderation, not in excess or deficiency, and certainly 
not in total abstinence respecting any appetite, passion, 
or function natural to the human being. Accordingly 
every human impulse is good (a modern would say, 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  
SOME CARDINAL MORAL IDEALS, OLD AND NEW 81 
“ because had it not been a requisite for survival it would 
not exist ”) when confined in proper degree to its legiti- 
mate function. It is only its abuse that ever leads to vice 
or social wrong. Montaigne long after reiterated the 
same doctrine in grosser hedonistic form, when, in effect, 
he told the youth to use every good the gods provide, to 
feed every appetite, gratify every passion, satisfy every 
desire ; but to be prudent, lest he befool himself, and 
should go to such excess that pleasure would become the 
road to pain. The Greeks mean (for the Greek view is 
still extant) that there should be, as Dewey says, “‘ a per- 
fect blending of the force of appetite with the authority 
of reason.” Intelligence is to guide the exercise of all the 
instincts, impulses, and conscious desires of human nature. 
The fundamental reason why Greek ideals of conduct 
do not completely satisfy the minds of most moderns, is 
that, notwithstanding their beauty, and their appeal to 
whole-mindedness, they are essentially esthetic rather 
than moral. The ideals of duty, of moral responsibility, 
and the subordination of the lower to the higher nature 
are, if not excluded, at least diminished to a detrimental 
degree. Yet, however emphatically we may be inclined 
to reject such Greek principles of conduct, we shall gain 
more than we lose by instructing adolescents concerning 
them, for high-school students have sufficient maturity 
to see the radical difference between an esthetic and a 
moral point of view.

The Romans, who gave us the word éemperance (tempus, 
time), thought of this virtue somewhat as the Greeks did, 
but for different reasons. One should, according to them, 
exercise self-control, that is, subject appetite and tumul- 
- tuous desire to the guidance of reason, not indeed to 
procure an artistic harmony of life, but rather to insure a 
line of conduct comporting well with Roman seriousness 
and dignity. The exercise of the virtue of temperance 
necessitates, therefore, consideration for what goes before 
and for what comes after, that is, for the timeliness of 
conduct and its due estimation in ground and consequence. 
Reflection should calm and control the turbulence of 
desire, thus making conduct consistent with the soberness 
and thoughtfulness of the Roman character. The further- 
ance of all that contributes to this end, and inhibition 
of everything inconsistent with it, constitutes the domi- 
nant Roman ideal of temperance. 
The medieval ideal of temperance as held by the 
spiritual leaders of the time differs from that of Greek 
and Roman in that emphasis is laid upon the defilement 
that comes to the soul through uncontrolled animal pas- 
sions, so that instead of grace or of dignity, purity be- 
comes the central conception. The best of the appetites, 
like hunger and thirst, were looked upon as necessary 
evils, while the grosser ones were regarded as sources of 
moral corruption which must be vigorously combated. 
The functional value of appetite was wholly overlooked, 
   
-P-A-G-E-95
  SOME CARDINAL MORAL IDEALS, OLD AND NEW 83 
and “‘ other-worldliness ” became the central conception 
of the ideal of temperance. 
In all three systems the duty of renunciation, of inhibi- 
tion, or of restraint appears as a necessary implication, 
but, as said before, for various reasons: for the Greek, 
that harmony of relation might not be disturbed ; for the 
Roman, that the proprieties of dignity might not be vio- 
lated ; for the Christian, that the godly purity of the soul 
might not be sullied. But in the modern world these 
motives, though recognized as having a certain validity, 
are so richly supplemented by others as to give a substan- 
tially new content to our most characteristic ideals of 
temperance. The Greek assumed as a matter of course 
that every human attribute is essentially good when not 
surpassing its proper limit, but modern studies in the 
development of individuals and societies have shown a 
sufficient reason for the substantial correctness of the 
assumption, which is, that they have been the requisites 
for survival. A race without courage; without the pos- 
sibilities of anger, love, sympathy, justice, and a hun- 
dred other virtues ; without strong bodily appetites and 
sexual passions — would long ago have ceased to exist. 
All those attributes of human beings whose imperative and 
impetuous demands impel us toward intemperate action, 
are, therefore, or at least have been, necessary requisites 
for our very existence. They are presumably functions 
to be regulated, not permanently or wholly suppressed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 ETHICAL TRAINING 
So far as they are still vital to race continuance, they 
must be respected as legitimate, and recognized as inex- 
tinguishable. Thus far, modern science seems to give 
support to Greek and Roman ideals, but modern ethics 
goes so far beyond the ancient systems both in individual 
and in social respects that ethical conduct is lifted above 
the planes of beauty and propriety. There were among 
the later Greeks ethical systems in which duty, good-will, 
and moral responsibility, both from an individualistic 
and from a social standpoint, were recognized and insisted 
upon, but they were standards for the few, not guides to 
the many. But Kantian moral philosophy, reénforced 
by evolutionary study of man and his institutions, and 
the general ‘sense of social solidarity, which modern 
science and its diffusion by education have made possible, 
have enabled the masses to apprehend a theory of morals 
which, while involving many ancient conceptions up to a 
certain point, rises distinctly above them in moral worth. 
It expresses this theory in many striking phrases, such as 
“a square deal,” “ fair play,” “ don’t flinch, don’t foul, 
hit the line hard,” “an injury to one is a wrong to the 
whole,” etc., but, what is far more important than speech, 
it strives to live up to the Kantian dictum that no man 
should ever be treated as a mere means for ends lying 
outside himself, but should always be recognized as a true 
end. Politically, this means democracy; educationally, 
it means equality of educational opportunity on a basis of 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
SOME CARDINAL MORAL IDEALS, OLD AND NEW 85 
social and political equality before the law and in the 
larger relations in society; economically, it means the 
right to property and just rewards for labor; or, con- 
versely, it means that no man or institution has the right 
to debauch mankind or to exploit the labor of men to the 
point of servitude for selfish ends; socially, it means that 
artificial castes shall not dominate the lives of the people, 
but that every human capacity shall have free scope for 
its development and utilization. 
As a matter of fact, temperance now includes various 
aspects of the drink problem. Men would solve it in 
various ways, though some would not recognize it at all. 
But certain facts concerning the sale of alcoholic liquors 
are so patently hostile to the prevailing ethical convic- 
tions among men and the common sense of social soli- 
darity and responsibility, that they cannot safely be 
ignored in the moral training of the young. It is well 
known that the saloon is strongly intrenched in political 
and capitalistic power and that it often uses this power 
to the detriment of society and individuals. At its best, 
it is still an ever threatening peril to health and morals ; 
at its worst, it is the anteroom to the brothel and the 
jail; and is altogether the heaviest burden that mankind 
is called upon to bear. The attractive things about the 
saloon, its light, and warmth, and glitter, its music and 
sociability, can be supplied through other channel’: but 
the deep damnation involved in its other aspects soly

be cured by annihilation. If society could once put 
Socrates to death on the false charge of corrrupting the 
youth of Athens, what double brew of sudden death 
should it not administer to that business which actually 
corrupts, not only the youth of our land, but which in 
the name of individual liberty, for selfish gain, deliber- 
ately poisons both body and soul of men and women?

3. Courage 
44. So important did Plato regard courage as a human 
virtue, that he made it the basis for one of the three great 
classes of society in the Scheme of the Republic. The 
state was to be a colossal man, the head (the rulers) being 
the philosophers, or the men of wisdom; the chest (the 
defenders) being the soldiers, or the men of courage; and 
the abdomen (the feeders) being the industrial classes. 
Universal education from early years was to be the sieve 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  SOME CARDINAL MORAL IDEALS, OLD AND NEW 87 
that should sift out these classes according to predominant 
mental qualities. Butsuch ascheme did faint justice to 
the universality of courage as a human characteristic. 
The evolutionist now knows that eons of experience have 
tended to the survival of the brave and the elimination 
of the timid. The coward has always been discriminated 
against at home, being forced to choose his mate from an 
inferior class or to go without altogether, and he was the 
first to fall in battle because of the feebleness of his attack 
and defence. The old adage that, 
“He who fights and runs away 
May live to fight another day,” 
had not much force in primitive life, for human survival 
has depended much more upon courageous attack and 
defence than in cowardly yielding. Savage cunning, 
reénforced by tribal contempt at home, could always be 
depended upon to make an easy victim of the man who 
would not fight. If we ask what primitive activities 
most promoted survival, the answer appears to be, fighting 
and renouncing ; fighting to ward off enemies or to extend 
conquest, renouncing to preserve the lives of women and 
children in times of stress, as in cases of famine and pesti- 
lence. The virtues that grow out of this state of society 
are courage and self-sacrifice, and probably the greater of 
these is courage. 
How explain the present universal contempt for the 
physical coward, even though the need for the exercise 
   
-P-A-G-E-100
    88 ETHICAL TRAINING 
of courage has declined as the need for anger and physical 
combat has diminished, except as we perceive that two 
things are a heritage of the past: first, the almost uni- 
versal presence of the quality of courage in the normal 
individual; and second, a still more universal admiration 
for the virtue, and contempt for those who lack it? It 
will conduce to modesty in the adolescent to learn that 
most of the courage he possesses is probably inherited, 
and it will brace him to courageous vigor to know that 
courage is to be expected of all who are not underlings. 
With this background of understanding, we may ex- 
amine the varying aspects of this quality as they come to 
light under changing circumstances. 
Two extremes of character should be made clear to the 
  
    young: first, goodness of intention without efficiency in   
action ; and, second, vigor in execution without goodness 
of intention. The first leads to moral weakness, the 
second to moral unscrupulousness. The execution of 
moral intention with persistent vigor alone gives true 
courage. 
Again, the pursuit of exciting pleasure tends to excess, 
to carrying the acts of passion beyond the bounds of 
reason, thus giving unbridled scope to the energies 
aroused; on the other hand, the fear or dislike of disa- 
greeable consequences inhibits or lessens the output of 
energy. Courage affects both these conditions, for it 
leads us to put forth rational energy to check irrational, 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  SOME CARDINAL MORAL IDEALS, OLD AND NEW 89 
and it arouses positive, to overcome negative energy of 
inhibition. He has courage, therefore, who rules his own 
spirit, as well as he who overcomes his dread of battle, 
wounds, and death. At bottom, therefore, all normal 
courage is moral courage, for on the one hand it repre- 
sents the mental force that opposes the excesses of pleas- 
ure, and on the other the inhibitions of fear. Still, it is 
common to contrast physical with moral courage, the 
former being conceived as persistent vigor in the face of 
physical danger, and the latter vigorous opposition to 
the opinions, prejudices, and customs of society, or even 
of our own friends, and resistance to temptation. 
The Greek city-state was in general a socialistic organi- 
zation, in which a part were freemen and the remainder 
slaves. Sparta, as we have seen, belonged wholly to the 
non-progressive type of such societies, while Athens, 
though freer and more progressive, was also essentially 
communistic. The supreme virtue having to do with 
courage in such states is normally patriotism, for national 
defence was greatly needed both to keep the slaves in 
subjection and to ward off dangerous external enemies. 
Courage under such conditions would be naturally most 
closely associated with physical vigor directed to un- 
daunted defence of the public good. This position is, of 
course, closely in line with race development out of the 
primitive stages. In times of public danger, even now, 
this form of courage flames into activity, and all classes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  90 ETHICAL TRAINING 
young and old, men and women, are reanimated by it. 
The pale city clerk fights as bravely and endures hard- 
ships as uncomplainingly as the son of the most hardy. 
An attribute inbred through thousands of generations 
will not easily die out. Indeed, in the past, it has been 
easy to lead brother to fight against brother, countryman 
against countryman. While England was colonizing the 
available parts of the earth, Germans were engaged in the 
occupation of breaking one another’s heads, as in the 
Thirty Years’ War. Now they wish they had broken 
fewer heads and had acquired more colonies. 
Courage as the executive side of every virtue has cer- 
tain well-known characteristics, summed up by Dewey? 
as follows : — 
“ Tn its onset, willingness in behalf of the common good 
to endure attendant private evils is alacrity, promptness. 
In its abiding and unswerving devotion, it is constancy, 
loyalty, and faithfulness. In its continual resistance to 
evil, it is fortitude, patience, perseverance, willingness to 
abide for justification an ultimate issue. The fotality of 
commitment of self to the good is decision and firmness. 
Conviction and resolution accompany all true moral 
endeavor.” 
Courage in the face of physical danger is well-nigh in- 
stinctive in the human race, and may be left to take care 
of itself, as soon as the young have acquired an insight 
1 Dewey and Tufts, “Ethics,” pp. 411-412. 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  SOME CARDINAL MORAL IDEALS, OLD AND NEW OI 
into its genesis and nature. If an adolescent is not al- 
ready physically brave, there is small chance of teaching 
him to become so, except, perhaps, through physical train- 
ing. Growth in courage usually does accompany vigor- 
ous physical development. 
The supreme need, however, of modern society is that 
form of courage which we call moral. This being less 
instinctive, and less closely associated with those forms of 
emotion, like anger, which arouse energy, is more teach- 
able. It has more to do with insight, conscious fixity of 
attention to the end desired, conviction and resolution, 
and less to do with strong emotions and instinctive actions, 
than has physical courage. Because of these character- 
istics it is rarer than the other, but at the same time more 
attainable through education.

4. Wisdom as Virtue 
45. It was axiomatic with the great Greek philosophers 
that the wise man is the good man; that truly to know 
the good is to do it; but the thesis of Rousseau’s first 
Dijon essay was that the development of the arts and 
sciences tends to corrupt mankind. A sharper antithesis 
could hardly exist. In Greek opinion, wisdom is the 
mother of goodness; in Rousseau’s view the very knowl- 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  Qg2 ETHICAL TRAINING 
edge that is supposed to constitute the food of wisdom is 
the parent of evil. The modern world is inclined to take 
a middle stand, and to declare that knowledge has nothing 
whatever to do with goodness or badness. With Kant, 
the seat of these qualities is placed in the “ good” or 
“had ” will, z.¢., in intention, while knowledge is regarded ‘ 
as purely intellectual. Were the Greeks right? Was 
Rousseau correct? Did Kant express the truth? Or, is 
there an element of truth in all three? 
Men have always distinguished between wisdom, or 
ripened judgment, and knowledge as a mere possession. « 
Wisdom implies insight and discretion, whereas knowl- 
edge implies awareness of facts and intellectual insight 
into their meaning. But the two ideas blend when we 
assert that truly to know the good is to do it. 
Rousseau had as justification for his contention the 
fact that the French aristocracy of his time were at once 
the most cultured and the most corrupt people of Europe. 
He assumed, moreover, that primitive men, without the 
civilization that the cultivation of the arts and sciences 
produces, were nobly good and free ; ignorant, indeed, but 
uncorrupted in feelings and conduct. If, now, he argued, 
man is found to be both cultured and depraved, what but 
the agents of civilization, the arts and sciences, can have 
brought this result to pass? They alone seem to consti- 
tute the difference between the savage and the man of 
culture. 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
SOME CARDINAL MORAL IDEALS, OLD AND NEW 93 
With Kant, intention alone, the “good-will,” gives the 
moral quality to action, while knowledge or even wisdom 
performs but an instrumental function, making the act 
better or worse in its consequences than it otherwise 
would have been, but not essentially altering its moral 
character. 
It helps us somewhat to know that the chief agency of 
education among the Greeks was life itself, rather than 
the book. To “know” a thing or a principle with them, 
therefore, was not merely to apprehend it in an intellec- 
tual act, but to realize it fully in all its depth and breadth 
of meaning, to feel intensely its consequences to self and 
to others; in short, to act out concretely in the agora, the 
palestra, the family, in the public discussions, and in the 
activities of war, the moral convictions and insights that 
possessed the mind. Knowledge in such a state of so- 
ciety is more a matter of life than of bare intellectual 
possession. The assumption underlying the Greek posi- 
tion is that the patriot will always choose the good and 
not the evil, both for his country and himself. That is, 
the Greek assumed “ good-will” both to self and country, 
and felt justified in the conviction that the man who truly 
sees the good will do it. 
It is in such facts as these that we shall find an explana- 
tion of the three radically different positions. When does 
culture corrupt? We well know that vice is never so 
insidious as when gilded by art. Is not the answer found 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
94 ETHICAL TRAINING | 
in the fact that culture, the grace that comes from art 
and science, was in Rousseau’s time but a veneer over a 
decaying structure? Knowledge and skill were detached 
from the real life, and made to serve the artificial. Free 
art sweetens and adorns, illuminates and leads the way, to 
all worthy achievement; science truly conceived per- 
forms the function of ministering to the welfare of man 
in his institutional and his economic life. When sepa- 
tated from their proper use, they may become a mere 
isolated treasure lying dead in the mind that holds them, 
or they may become the instruments of evil. 
The Greeks were right when they assumed that funda- 
mental insight concretely applied to life is a warrant for 
moral conduct; Rousseau was right in the claim that art 
and science detached from the life to which they properly 
belong, may become a source of corruption; and Kant 
was right when he made explicit that attitude of will 
which with the Greeks was implicit. 
The detachment of knowledge as a whole from life as 
a whole comes about through such multiplication of the 
former that no individual is able to utilize in action all 
there is to know even ina single department. Scholars in 
every field in every land are daily adding to the world’s 
store of knowledge, hence to the store ultimately available 
in instruction. But human capacity and length of life 
are somewhat strictly limited. We have here a parallel of 
the Malthusian doctrine of population in relation to food 
 
-P-A-G-E-107

supply. We double our store of knowledge at frequent 
intervals, but can only add an increment now and then to 
the length of adolescent education and to human capac- 
ity. Ward even suspects that the latter does not in- 
crease at all. This growing difference between what is 
known and what can be utilized in life by any individual, 
has, perhaps against our will, brought about in our 
thought and practice an artificial separation of knowledge 
from conduct. The Greek wholeness of life as the inti- 
mate synthesis of insight and conduct has become divided, 
so that we have morality and insight, not morality through 
insight. We can and must restore the Greek wholeness 
by bringing the knowledge taught to each individual 
into intimate relation to the life he now lives and that 
into which he will soon enter. This is the meaning of 
industrial education for the masses, and of laboratory 
work, manual training, and domestic science for all. 
The ultimate consequences of these views will come 
more clearly to light when we consider the function of the 
studies in moral training, and to regard interest as the 
bridge that unites knowledge and conduct.

Greek position in his educative instruction, or instruction that 
culminates in moral training. 2. Conscientiousness as the 
quality that helps us to live up to our insight. 3. Effect of con- 
science, or the sense of inner freedom (Herbart), as an in- 
fluence tending to secure harmony of conduct and insight.

  CHAPTER VI 
ETHICAL INTEREST: THE BRIDGE BETWEEN 
KNOWLEDGE AND MORAL CONDUCT 
1. External and Internal Factors 
46. There are two sets of influences that combine in the 
formation of character: namely, (1) the external or ob- 
jective; and (2) the internal or subjective. 
By external influences is meant those that arise without 
the mind’s conscious intervention in the way of reflection 
and choice. First among these come instinctive or 
hereditary reactions, such as anger, courage, spontaneous 
attraction or repulsion, appetite, and the like, and then 
supplementary to these the various constraining forces 
of the environment, such as traditions, customs, and the 
direct exercise of authority in family, school, or state. 
Conversely, we have the countless solicitations to direct 
imitation that lead the youth to copy and emulate the 
admired actions of those by whom he is surrounded. 
The external influences are, therefore, in brief, those that 
96 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  ETHICAL INTEREST 97 
tend more or less automatically to determine the conduct 
of the individual. They predominate during the pre- 
adolescent years. 
Internal influences, on the other hand, are those that 
arise from insight accompanied by reflection and conscious 
choice. It is here that the ethical bearings of knowledge 
are found, for it is through the subjects of the curriculum 
that we get an intelligent grasp of the ethical meaning 
of any proposed line of action. The human sciences give 
an insight into the weal and woe of institutional life, 
while the natural sciences lie at the basis of a knowledge 
of health and of economic welfare. We realize the ethical 
value of knowledge, therefore, by socializing it. When 
illumined by the insight that knowledge gives, regulative 
principles become an intelligent basis for moral decisions, 
while moral character is lifted far above the levels of 
external influence. 
These two phases of character come to unity when 
knowledge and reflection reveal a fundamental insight 
into the deeper meaning of those external influences 
arising from inherited instincts, group life, and authority 
which we have hitherto heeded, but not understood. Here, 
again, we come upon the whole-mindedness of the Greeks, 
— that aspect of wisdom which to them meant virtue, 
since it is the integrity of mind that constitutes moral 
character. It is only when knowledge is detached from 
its ethical implications that it becomes morally indifferent.

Discussion :— Relative weight of those influences (1) in 
childhood, (2) in youth, (3) in maturity. 
2. Pleasure as an End vs. Pleasure as a Means 
47. The thesis of the present chapter is that ethical 
interest is the bridge between knowledge and conduct» 
A prerequisite to the establishment of this proposition is 
a clear idea of the nature of such interests. Kant, as we 
have seen (section 26), rejected as impure all desire that 
leads to pleasure as an end. According to him, reverence 
for the moral law, the inner force that impels to the per- 
formance of duty, is the only feeling that has a moral 
value. However much we may be inclined to agree with 
him in this contention, we should not overlook the purely 
instrumental function that feeling in all its phases, such 
as emotion, desire, and interest, performs in the mental 
life. The moral quality of interest in the agreeable as 
an end may indeed be questioned, but interest as a means 
of stirring up the energies to reach a moral end certainly 
cannot be, for it is the antecedent complement of that 
phase of moral effort which arises from insight into the 
morally good. 
An ethical interest is a natural feeling of sympathy with 
others, of good-will toward them, of love for them and 
their welfare, transformed by insight into a larger social 
impulse to conserve the highest welfare of individual and 
group. It transforms charity from instinctive giving to 
relieve immediate misery, into benevolence that elevates 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  ETHICAL INTEREST 99 
its recipients and makes them self-helpful, while supply- 
ing immediate necessities. It helps men to codperative 
effort, and it consecrates science and art and history and 
economics to the uplifting of human life. Such an in- 
terest is whole-hearted and sincere, and when perma- 
nently aroused by a socialized study of the arts and 
sciences, becomes the ever potent means for arousing the 
highest and most persistent moral energies of which the 
individual is capable. 
With this general idea of the nature and function of an 
ethical interest, we may proceed to a more detailed ex- 
amination of the subject. 
3. The Function of Emotion 
48. A common misconception about interest in general 
is that it is only an index of external allurement, so that 
to try to arouse interest in a student is equivalent merely 
to an effort to amuse him. Such a view confounds pleas- 
ure as a stimulus to effort, with pleasure as an end of 
action. If to amuse the mind were the purpose of insttuc- 
tion, then interest would have such a meaning ; but 
since no true teacher ever so conceives instruction, is it not 
an unreasonable idea that the purpose of interest is only 
to amuse? 
The function of emotion in general is to stir up the 
energies of the mind to attain a desired end. In Kant’s 
day the biological function of emotion was not duly 
considered, so that it was perhaps natural that he should 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
    ae         
   
                            100 ETHICAL TRAINING 
conceive desire from a purely selfish point of view; but 
there is no warrant for such a position at present. Of 
course, desires may be purely selfish, but they need not be, 
for it is a well-known fact that our energies are stirred to 
action only as our feelings are aroused. These feelings 
have many aspects — impulse, emotion, desire, interest, 
etc.; but for educational purposes interest is the one of 
most importance, for it signifies a more or less remote 
end to be reached, and it implies persistence of desire, so 
that it is not quenched by a shift of attention or the in- 
terruptions of sleep, nor is it marked by the tumultuous- 
ness of vivid emotion or cancelled by the feebleness of 
wishes which do not generate action. It is not a substi- 
tute for effort, but a necessary complement to it, since it 
arouses effort. When the end to be reached is an ethical 
one, then any interest in reaching this end has an ethical 
quality. Heretofore, it has been customary to consider 
the doctrine of interest only in its intellectual bearings, 
      
  but reflection shows that its ethical import is as real and 
    important as the intellectual. 
    Discusston :— Comparison of this view with the Herbar- 
tian Erziehender Unterricht! (morally educative instruction).      
       4. The Object of Ethical Interest 
49. There is always an object of interest, which is of     course the end sought. In morals, the end is not the mere     1 See the author’s “ Herbart and the Herbartians,” p. 9.   
-P-A-G-E-113
  
ETHICAL INTEREST IoI 
intellectual apprehension of truth, but rather its concrete 
application to those affairs of life in which the good or ill 
of individuals or of social groups is concerned. Plainly, 
therefore, all studies have an ethical aspect, for in the 
main their intellectual side is the apprehension of the 
knowledge transmitted to us from the past, and their 
motor, or executive, side is the acquisition of skill for 
the application of this knowledge in our present and 
future doings.! 
To realize the educational value of such ethical ends of 
knowledge, it is not necessary to sever the altruistic from 
the personal. Youth finds it difficult to divide its mo- 
tives. The deed is one; it is only psychological analysis 
that ever tries to separate its motives and its bearings 
into classes, some of which are ethical, some perhaps 
unethical, and others morally indifferent. It suffices to 
know that knowledge and skill in its use have a pervading 
ethical function to impress this fact upon the student, 
and then to permit him to enjoy both in their integrity. 
An inventor, for example, may perhaps be thinking partly 
of his own fame or profit, but at the same time he also 
considers how his invention will benefit other men, for in 
his subconsciousness is the ever present thought that his 
own benefit from it will be measured by the degree of 
service he is able to render others. So with the student, 
the value of a thought or the acquisition of a technique 
1See Vol. I of this work, pp. 162-172. 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  To2 ETHICAL TRAINING 
is worth to him only what he can make it worth to others. 
Confining ourselves for the present to the ethical bearings 
of knowledge as acquired in the school, the object of 
ethical interest is seen to be twofold, first the ideas and 
ideals embodied in the high-school studies, and second, 
the acquisition of skill in applying this knowledge and 
insight to the affairs of life. 
ISCUSSION :— Concrete function of the several studies as 
furthering the “complete living” of men. 
5. The Subjective Side of Ethical Interest in Knowledge 
(1) Ethical Valuation 
50. The personal or subjective ethical import of an 
insight or an acquired skill in its use is first of all a feeling 
of its worth to the self as measured by the stage of ethical 
development already attained. Manifestly in the degree 
of sensitiveness to such valuation there is a wide range, 
from predominant selfishness to unselfish altruism. A 
clear but somewhat cold ethical sense of such worth is 
found in the oft-praised appreciation of the value of truth 
as such, and in the satisfaction of acquiring skill without 
regard to the use to which it is to be put. Such interest 
is more intellectual than moral, being mostly detached 
from application to the affairs of life. Yet, it also as- 
sumes a moral quality again the moment it comes into 
relation to the ethical ideals and regulative principles of 
the self. It is no mean moral attainment when devotion 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
ETHICAL INTEREST 103, 
to truth as truth comes to rule the mind, when fairness and 
adequacy of judgment become ideals, when neatness and 
  
    accuracy and promptness and energy and efficiency pre-   
dominate in the learning and reciting of lessons, for these 
ideals may become the prevailing characteristics of future 
relations to others. But valuable as such results are, 
their moral worth is greatly enhanced when they broaden 
out into their wider social applications. It is at this 
point that we may see the striking difference between the 
ethical worth of pure science and that of applied science. 
51. Pure science produces at best only that intellectual- 
ized ethical insight and love for the true, the beautiful, and 
the good, which, while lifting the character to new planes 
of thought and impulse, may still leave it cold, and de- 
tached from the concrete doings of men. Applied science, 
on the other hand, even if its application to later practical 
life must be mediated by the imagination, as must be the 
case in large degree, takes on a new and warmer ethical 
quality. Students pursue their studies in applied science 
with greater zeal and for longer periods. The idea of 
pure quantity, for illustration, as developed in mathe- 
matics, may seem at first view to be devoid of any ethical 
bearings, to be morally indifferent. As usually taught, it 
is so, except in so far as it arouses a sense of the worth of 
truth and exactness as such. But a visit to a good tech- 
nical high school like the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn or 
the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia or the Lewis Insti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
| 104 ETHICAL TRAINING 
tute in Chicago or the Bradley Institute in Peoria, where 
mathematics is taught in close and daily application to 
matters of technology, will enable one to mark the dif- 
ference. Here the boys are alert, interested in number, 
fertile in initiative, skilful in setting and solving prob- 
lems, and, above all, not only content, but anxious, to pur- 
sue the subject for years. Why? Because the immediate 
purpose of mathematics becomes daily apparent, and 
because this immediate sense of its value is gradually 
permeated by those larger valuations that are bound up 
with the boy’s ambitions, his dreams of future usefulness, 
and his visions of personal honor and distinction through 
the mastery of material forces. How many boys there 
are now dreaming of aviation who would welcome a 
vigorous course in mathematics, if they could see an in- 
timate bearing of the one upon the other! Mathematics 
under such conditions performs in perfection all the 
ethical functions of which it is capable, for it has become 
completely socialized. 
What is true of mathematics is likewise and in larger 
degree true of every other science, natural and human, 
and the sense of ethical valuation to the self increases as 
the subject assumes more and more intimate relations to 
the vital aspects of human conduct. This is the reason 
why the following chapter will emphasize the superior

man, The School Review, January, 1910.

value of applied science in the ethical training of 
youth. 
Discussion :—The transformation of intellectual into 
ethical valuations in the various studies. 
(2) Mediate vs. Immediate Ethical Interest 
52. Mediate interest! is that which is felt in present 
means to distant ends. The final purpose of aviation, 
for example, is flying; if, now, all the interest felt in that 
end is also felt in each step of study and construction and 
trial which lead to it, then we have a case of mediated in- 
terest. To the extent that this imagined future triumph 
is supposed to benefit mankind, the interest in it is ethical. 
An immediate ethical interest is one in which the means 
are simultaneous with the end. The purpose of charity, 
for example, is the relief of suffering; if, now, the impulse 
to succor is coincident with the act of succoring, as in the 
case of saving from drowning or rescuing from fire or the 
giving of alms upon the street or of subscribing for a 
charity or of stopping a runaway team, the interest is 
immediate. Immediate ethical interest is spontaneous 
and is only an expression of natural sympathy, reénforced, 
perhaps, by long-established habit. But mediate ethical 
interest marks the transformation of natural sympathy 
or of habit into a socialized excitation that can feel the

“Tnterest and Education,” pp. 29-31. 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 ETHICAL TRAINING 
thrill of ultimate satisfactions in every form of action, 
mental or physical, that leads toward the distant goal. 
Manifestly it is mediate interest that the school should be 
most anxious to develop, for in a prevailing degree the ends 
for which youth labors lie in the future, and the means 
for reaching these ends are the very studies they pursue. 
If these subjects become charged with the ethical interests 
they are capable of evoking, the pursuit of knowledge 
will be the surest and directest road to the attainment of 
virtue. 
Discussion :— 1. Contrast between immediate interest in 
ethical matters and those relating to art and play. 2. Con- 
trast between mediate intellectual and mediate ethical inter- 
ests. 
(3) Work vs. Drudgery 
53- When the interest in the end is felt also in the means 
for reaching the end (in school, the studies), we have the 
joy of work; but when it is not, we have the pain of 
drudgery. Every stroke of the hammer, every outline 
traced by the pencil, every increment of color added to the 
painting by the artist, is permeated by the artistic glow 
felt in the ideal to be reached. No man can be a drudge 
and an artist at the same time, for drudgery with its de- 
pressing influence upon the mind is incompatible with 
artistic creation. Detachment of artistic impulse means 
loss of artistic power; so, in the same way, ethical ideals 
detached from the means for their realization lead simply 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  ETHICAL INTEREST 107 
to moral impotence. This is the realm of “ good inten- 
tions” that never get themselves realized, of mere theoreti- 
cal morality. But when the mind of the student is satu- 
rated with the moral ideals inherent in the studies, and 
feels their dynamic force as he masters their ideas and 
technique, then he becomes, not a moral drudge, but a 
moral worker. 
As an illustration of the directness of association of 
ideals with daily actions which constitute genuine medi- 
ate interest and true moral effort, some of the questions 
asked at each meeting of the Junto Club, founded by 
Benjamin Franklin, in Philadelphia, are most pertinent. 
Here are a few of them: ! — 
1. Have you met with anything in the author you last 
read, remarkable, or suitable to be communicated to the 
Junto; particularly in history, morality, poetry, physics, 
travels, mechanical arts, or other parts of knowledge? 
2. Do you know of a fellow-citizen who has lately done 
a worthy action, deserving praise and imitation; or who 
has lately committed an error, proper for us to be warned 
against and avoid? 
3. What unhappy effects of intemperance have you 
lately observed or heard of; of imprudence, of passion, or 
of any other vice or folly? 
4. What happy effects of temperance, of prudence, of 
moderation, or of any other virtue? 
1 Used by Elbert Hubbard as a model in his “Roycroft Clubs.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 ETHICAL TRAINING 
5. Do you think of anything at present wherein the 
members of the Junto may be serviceable to mankind, to 
their country, to their friends, or to themselves? 
6. Has any deserving stranger arrived in town since 
last meeting that you have heard of? And what have 
you heard or observed of his character or merits? And 
whether, think you, it lies in the power of the Junto to 
oblige him, or encourage him as he deserves? 
7. Have you lately observed any encroachment on the 
just liberties of the people? 
8. Have you any weighty affair on hand in which you 
think the advice of the Junto may be of service? 
g. Is there any difficulty in matters of opinion, of jus- 
tice and injustice, which you would gladly have discussed 
at this time? 
Among the ethical results of the discussions that grew 
out of these questions are the following: the establish- 
ment of the Philadelphia Public Library, the parent of all 
public libraries in America; the organization and equip- 
ment of a fire company; paving and lighting the streets 
of Philadelphia; the establishment of an academy, now 
the University of Pennsylvania; and the founding of 
the Philadelphia Public Hospital. Besides this splendid 
social output, it is easy to suppose that each member 
increased, if not in stature, at least in wisdom, in knowl- 
edge, in ethical insight and efficiency, and in that rapid 
moral development that is always the outcome of living 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  ETHICAL INTEREST Iog 
interest in the good of men when intimately joined to the 
means of realization. 
Discussion :— 1. Comparison of drudgery in the intellec- 
tual and in the economic field with that in the ethical. 2. Is 
drudgery an idea to be tolerated in a high school ? 
(4) Ends of Action ; Ideals ; Motives 
54. In mediated interest an end is in general an ideal 
projection of the active powers. The mind pictures 
itself as expressed or realized in some given accomplish- 
ment, say, as a statesman, guiding the destinies of the 
nation; as a judge, dispensing justice among all men; as 
a reformer, diminishing the ills that flesh is heir to; as 
a surgeon, relieving pain and saving life; as an engineer, 
increasing the economic welfare of mankind ; as a teacher, 
guiding youth into the paths of virtue. In such cases the 
mind is conscious of the meaning of the impulse that 
impels to action, and measures its worth in terms of 
aspiration. 
An ideal as a projection of the active powers of the 
mind is the same as motive, and as such has all the dy- 
namic power that attaches to any impulse, whether lying in 
the realm of self-conscious valuation or wholly instinctive.! 
Should a so-called ideal not become a real motive, it may 
be considered as being in that undeveloped stage in which 
passive ‘“‘ good wishes’”’ are devoid of effort at fulfilment. 
1 Compare Dewey, “Interest as related to Will,” p. 23. 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  IIo ETHICAL TRAINING 
But there may be conflicting ideals. The self may 
project itself in different and even contradictory ways. 
Thus one might desire to save for future security, yet 
spend for present satisfaction; to donate funds to a 
charity, yet utilize the same money to establish a factory. 
An appeal is made simultaneously to different sets of 
active powers. Reflection must decide the matter, else 
confusion and impotence of will are certain to ensue. 
But when action begins, the choice has been made, and 
the ideal that prevails becomes the motive. The motive, 
therefore, is self-made, being only the mental side of the 
concrete act, or the equivalent of the ideal that prevails. 
It is here again that regulative principles have their 
power, for they help to make the choice rational and in 
accord with the character of the individual. Motive is, 
further, only interest in the end carried back into the 
realm of habit, impulse, and regulative principle. 
Discussion :— Fallacy of the old idea that ethical motive 
is an influence external to self. 
(5) Interest in Remote Ends 
55. The larger ethical bearings of knowledge are re- 
vealed through insight, which in turn depends upon an 
apprehension of facts and a comprehension of their re- 
lations. The teacher who expects science and history and 
literature to carry their ethical import upon the surface, 
will be subject to disappointment, for the ethical signifi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
  
ETHICAL INTEREST LEE 
cance of knowledge is always implicit, not explicit. Such 
ends are, therefore, remote, and it would be idle to as- 
sume that interest in them is spontaneous or to be lightly 
acquired. It is the main duty of the teacher who would 
develop character through knowledge to make a gradual 
revelation of these ultimate moral meanings by arousing 
interest in the steps that lead to them. Proximate, lead 
to final ends. 
No high-school student, for illustration, could be ex- 
pected upon a bare statement of the idea to become 
warmly interested in Chinese missions. China is a long 
way off, not only geographically, but psychologically. 
Youth is naturally absorbed in what is immediate, close 
at hand, and related to ends that have become vivid. 
But it is quite conceivable that such an interest might be 
developed through a course of instruction which should 
reveal an insight into the qualities of mind of China- 
men, present their economic life and its future possibili- 
ties, their political system, the function their military 
potentialities are destined to play in the Orient, their 
relations to our own people, their education, and the 
like. A nation that can in a generation turn its 
back, so to speak, upon its whole educational past, de- 
stroying ten thousand of the old examination booths at 
one time in a single city, and invite the West to impart 
its knowledge and skill, not only of war, but of science 
and government, of finance and manufacture, of educa-

  Ii2 ETHICAL TRAINING 
tional organization, yes, even of morals and religion, 
might stir a missionary spirit even in the most lumpish 
bosom when enlightenment had made it possible. Many 
a church to-day plans to spend as much upon missions as 
upon its own administration, and great congresses of 
young men and young women whose hearts are already 
burning with ardor for the cause, arouse the people to 
interest and effort. Such a movement is an index of the 
ethical possibilities often lying inert and unused in a 
knowledge of the sciences and humanities. 
Discussion :— Political, social, and moral reforms through 
the agency of progressive enlightenment. 
(6) Rise of Ethical through Intellectual Interests 
56. Closely akin to the idea that distant ends must be 
approached through proximate ones, is that of the present 
section; for in knowledge the intellectual phase neces- 
sarily comes first. To know facts and to comprehend 
their relations is the function of retention and under- 
standing ; interest in their ultimate ethical bearing comes 
later, but always through intellectual apprehension. It 
lies on the surface, therefore, that the surest way to arouse 
interest in the ethical significance of history, art, physics, 
geography, or biology and in the mastery of their tech- 
nique, is to arouse as vivid an interest as possible in those 
intellectual aspects that are always antecedent to such 
interests. The old idea was that moral ideals shell out of 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  
ETHICAL INTEREST II3 
history and literature like peas out of a pod; but this 
conception is illusive, because unsupported by that intel- 
lectual comprehension which is their firm basis and logical 
presupposition. As the road to distant ends lies through 
paths lying close at hand, so the road to the heights of 
moral interests lies along the ascending paths of intel- 
lectual zeal. Youth needs, not preaching, but mental 
illumination; not hortatory appeal, but a development 
of Greek whole-mindedness. He reaps the largest ethical 
harvest from knowledge who lets ultimate moral revela- 
tion rest on present intellectual insight; who finally 
transmutes intellectual interests into ultimate zeal for 
ethical ideals, and who, while developing skill in the use 
of knowledge, finally directs it to the accomplishment of 
moral purposes. ;

torical events. 2. Ethical “snap judgment” in the case of

  CHAPTER VII 
REALIZING THE ETHICAL VALUE OF THE HIGH- 
SCHOOL STUDIES 
1. Contrasts and General View 
57. Whether knowledge shall have ethical import or 
not, depends upon the attitude, capacity, and insight of 
the knower. It becomes a moral instrument when con- 
sciously used for moral ends; but when these are absent 
because unseen or disregarded, then knowledge may be 
purely intellectual or esthetic, or may even become the 
instrument of evil. In itself considered, knowledge, even 
of the most sacred things, may be wholly non-moral. 
When it is detached from the purposes and activities of 
life, it is, as already remarked, largely devoid of ethical 
quality. The humanities have often been praised as of 
high, and science depreciated as of low, moral value. 
This is evidently an error of judgment, for, though they 
have different moral functions when properly used, neither 
has any moral value at all when not so used. When it is 
advocated that the Bible should be read in school for its 
literary value, the end aimed at is esthetic, not moral. 
114 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES II5 
It may be that those who advocate such a policy hope 
that the moral functions of the Bible will be surrepti- 
tiously performed, even when it is introduced for esthetic 
ends; but upon the face of the proposition nothing but 
the esthetic aspects of the Scriptures is to be considered. 
It is small wonder that those who reverence the Bible as 
the chief means of moral guidance for mankind should 
question the wisdom of putting the student into a merely 
esthetic or even a coldly intellectual attitude toward it. 
If, therefore, even the Scriptures themselves may become 
non-moral through the mental attitude of the reader, 
how much more is this true of secular knowledge! It zs 
not necessarily, but it may become moral. Neither feel- 
ings nor knowledge as such are ends of intellect, for the 
intellect, as Ward shows, always uses the indirect method, 
since it employs knowledge for the attainment of ethical 
ends. Both emotion and science are means for the attain- 
ment of the moral purposes of life.t 
Discussion :— When is ceremony (saluting the flag, etc.) 
moral, when non-moral ? 
58. Insight into its moral import has been mentioned 
as a condition for realizing the ethical possibilities of a 
study. This does not mean its moral import in a sen- 
timental or purely subjective aspect, but in a broadly

objective one as affecting conduct that looks to the benefit 
of an individual or of a social group. 
The Greek idea of whole-mindedness regarded knowl- 
edge as being in most intimate relations to the whole of life 
to which it in any way referred. In the old Greek educa- 
tional period, even in Athens, everything focussed sooner 
or later upon citizenship. The songs and instrumental 
music were cast in the heroic mould; national heroes and 
their service to the state were exalted; the mind was 
stimulated to noble and patriotic ardor by the stirring 
Doric airs. The gymnastics of the palestra found their 
natural goal in the later activities of the soldier. Life 
and education were never separate and distinct entities, 
forming a dualism like Descartes’s mind and matter; not 
two unrelated fields of activity, whose later reconciliation 
must be left to accident or to the domain of theory. On 
the contrary, what the palestra and the music school 
offered to the youth was his heritage from his social past, 
of which he must gradually become possessed by study 
and practice. Like the modern youth he might have 
acquired it as a more or less inert treasure, to be heaped 
up for possible future use, as men store the surplus dia- 
monds from the South African mines. But this was not 
the Greek conception. He was taught only what he 
could render meaningful for active use. Like the modern 
youth, his mind might have been left coldly critical or 
indifferent, not to say hostile, toward the knowledge 
   
-P-A-G-E-129
  ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES II7 
gained. But this again was not the Greek conception. 
Knowledge as the vital residuum of the past was so im- 
parted that the zeal and warmth of patriotic ardor should 
possess the lad’s soul. Like the modern youth, once 
more, knowledge might have been so acquired by memory 
and imitation that the skill to use it should be wanting. 
But here, again, the Greek conception was different. What 
the lad read, that he was taught to write; what he could 
read and write, he was taught to sing ; and what he could 
read and write and sing, he was taught to speak, first 
in declamation, and then in spontaneous utterance 
upon his own initiative. Thus the seeds of mythology, 
tradition, history, and language blossomed and bore fruit 
in thought and speech, so that the youth was trained in 
the school to participate actively and intelligently in the 
affairs of the communal city-state. He was equally ready 
for peace or war; to deal generously and magnanimously 
and effectively with every issue that might present itself. 
Three things, then, it must be reiterated, are necessary 
that knowledge should become ethical : — 
1. Insight into its ethical significance as a social heri- 
tage from the past, more complicated indeed now than in 
the days of yore, but of the same sort. Society hands 
down but little that cannot be made useful in promoting 
the well-being of mankind ; to see its meaning to this end, 
at least in its broader aspects, is necessary if the learner is 
to get its full ethical benefit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
118 ETHICAL TRAINING 
2. The acquisition of that emotional attitude toward 
this knowledge which makes “ Interest the bridge be- 
tween knowledge and conduct,” as described in the pre- 
ceding chapter. 
3. The acquisition of the skill necessary to render the 
social instrument transmitted to us effective in the world 
of deeds: knowledge, skill, and ethical interest, —and 
the greatest of these is interest, for it incites to both the 
others. It is for this reason that President Schurman 
declares that “Interest is the greatest word in educa- 
tion.” ? 
59. The first thing to recognize in examining the moral 
worth of studies is that they differ perhaps as much in 
their ethical, as in their intellectual, function. It is over- 
hasty to conclude that because a study, say physics, does 
not promote a given virtue, say meekness, it is conse- 
quently devoid of all moral import; or, again, to decide 
that because physics may be pursued from purely intel- 
lectual motives, it always must be so pursued. 
Of the natural sciences in general, as contrasted with 
the humanities, it may be said that their ethical value 
lies not in the moral content of their underlying concep- 
tions, but in the functions they perform in promoting 
human welfare. Physical laws as such are devoid of

Society, articles by Dewey, “Ethical Principles underlying Education,” 
and De Garmo, “Social Aspects of Moral Education.”

-P-A-G-E-131
  ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES IIg 
moral content, except as all systems of truth are moral, 
but functionally considered they may become the greatest 
of ethical instruments. Yet the sciences differ among 
themselves in ethical function, just as they differ in their 
entirety from the humanities. Biology, dealing with life, 
has a different moral import from physics, which deals 
with mechanical law. Hygiene, for example, concerns 
the physical health of man, as the application of me- 
chanical law to machinery affects his economic welfare. 
Even if both function in the same field, they do so in 
different ways, as where biology assists in perfecting the 
quality and quantity of crops, and physics improves the 
machinery for reaping them. 
On the other hand, the humanities, which deal for the 
most part with the institutional aspects of civilization, 
have a double ethical function, since they, like the sciences, 
not only serve as moral instrumentalities, but also treat 
directly of man’s will as expressed in conduct, and hence 
embody conceptions that may be ethically considered. 
In other words, they have both ethical content and ethical 
function. 
Many thinkers have been misled on this point, and, 
confining their attention to the moral value of studies on 
the content side, have affirmed the ethical value of history, 
literature, and Scriptures and denied that of physics, chem- 
istry, and biology. This has been noticeably the case with 
the Ziller school of pedagogics in Germany. But the 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 ETHICAL TRAINING 
moment we recognize the validity of the functional idea 
in ethical training, the studies appear in a newlight. Is 
not the prevention of suffering, for example, as estimable 
upon ethical grounds as the relief of suffering? Benevo- 
lence in the form of almsgiving is deemed a highly moral 
attribute in him who bestows; but shall we deny this 
virtue to one who with equally pure motives utilizes his 
scientific knowledge to prevent the suffering that benevo- 
lence would allay? Functionally considered, therefore, 
every study that can be used to promote human welfare 
is moral to the extent that it is so utilized ; it is non-moral 
to the extent to which it fails to perform this function. 
Discussion :— 1. Contrast between Greek conditions for 
attaining whole-mindedness in education with our own. 
2. Is congestion of subject-matter a necessity in modern educa- 
tion? 3. Is industrial education capable of throwing any light 
on this subject ? 
60. One more aspect of the subject should be made 
clear before any detailed examination into the varying 
moral functions of the several studies is undertaken. Is 
the mingling of egoistic and altruistic attitudes or motives 
consistent with a learner’s realization of the ethical worth 
of a study? It may be held that so long as a study has 
individual or personal reference, it is selfish, and hence 
unethical ; that to become moral, all reference to self must 
be eliminated. According to this view, knowledge. be- 
comes moral only when it excites certain subjective and   
-P-A-G-E-133
       ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES r2r 
impersonal attitudes of mind — leads the knower to forget 
self completely, except as he may sacrifice it utterly for 
another. But this heroic condition of mind is rarely, and 
then but fleetingly, entertained by youth. It is not 
natural to adolescence, when all nature and social life 
invite to enterprise and conquest and when the ripening 
of inherited tendencies urges to action. Ethical valnes 
are not impaired, but strengthened and made objective, 
by the blending of personal and social reference., The 
youth should be encouraged rather than forbidden to see 
himself as a functioning unit in a larger functioning whole, 
for this is the actual constitution of a progressive demo- 
cratic society. Action and reaction are and should be 
recognized as reciprocal, especially when we come to the 
mutual relations that exist between a social group and its 
constituent members. The vicarious idea has validity 
here, for as the individual serves the group, so in turn the 
group serves the individual. Any other relation tends 
to make the group a despot and the individual a slave, 
who gives all and gets nothing. Therefore, when the boy 
pictures himself a future mechanician controlling the most 
subtle forces of nature for the good of man, do not depre- 
cate his contemplation of himself as a centre of fame or 
wealth. Encourage him, however, to emulate many of our 
great leaders who pursue their projects for the work’s 
sake rather than for mere personal glory — to build the 
railroad that an unutilized domain may come to fruitage,    
-P-A-G-E-134
  122 ETHICAL TRAINING 
dig a canal for the enrichment of all future generations, 
perfect a process that an industry may be elevated to a 
higher plane, promote a reform that will lengthen life and 
increase its worth. Lead the lad to see himself indeed a 
future great engineer, or chemist, or biologist, or teacher, 
or lawyer, but at the same time make him realize what 
this service means to the world. There are always two 
sides to the shield of life. To see them both is better 
than to fix the gaze upon one, ignoring or forgetting the 
other. 
As before explained (Section 44), to fight and renounce 
was the program of the man who dwelt in the primitive 
economy of deficit and pain; but to the modern partici- 
pant in an economy of surplus and satisfaction, codper- 
ation and mutual service are more potent ethical ideals. 
There is still a place for sacrifice in the world, but it is no 
longer the dominating moral ideal. 
Discussion :— Relative ethical potency of the idea of sac- 
rifice, and that of mutual service (1) in the several studies, 
(2) in the realm of courtesy, (3) in the world of charity, (4) 
in that of business. 
61. In the first volume of this series there is an extended 
study of the function and educational worth of the several 
branches of learning taught in the high school. Volume 
two is devoted to an exposition of the leading features of 
genuine scientific method, which alone makes it possible 
to realize these values in the minds of the young. There 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  
ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 123 
is no need to repeat at this point what has already been 
done. But certain aspects of the ethical content of these 
studies need emphasis, as do also the best ways of making 
that content effective. 
The teacher is always rightly concerned with the char- 
acter of the mental training that the student is getting in 
the school, for that is poor teaching that forgets the mind. 
But to the student himself such considerations have little 
weight, since the healthy mind, like the healthy stomach, 
takes little heed of its own processes. Both crave satis- 
fying nourishment, indeed, but both are satisfied to leave 
the processes and the ultimate results to nature. It is 
only a premature habit of introspection that leads the 
youth to have any interest in how he thinks or feels or 
acts; it is enough for him that he does these things. 
Objective results properly occupy his attention. It is 
through these, attained or anticipated, that ethical in- 
sight and disposition most naturally emerge; while his 
capacity to utilize these values in actual life arises mostly 
through the intellectual and physical training acquired by 
following out the processes of a truly scientific method. 
To get to the centre of an ethical question in education, 
it is sometimes necessary to look beyond the schoolroom 
to see what is going on in the great world outside. Many 
reasons are assigned to account for the rapid diminution 
in numbers in schools as soon as the twelfth year of life is 
past, but a most important one is often overlooked, be- 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 ETHICAL TRAINING 
cause in our emphasis on the immediate we tend to ignore 
the more remote. It may be that the conditions that 
reduce numbers also prevent or impair the realization of 
ethical values. 
62. It is always at great risk that a people breaks 
seriously and suddenly with an important race experience. 
But because of the introduction of the factory system and 
the consequent growth of cities, this is precisely what a 
large section of our population has done, for it has 
eliminated the most potent influence of the past in the 
education of the young. In education the lost art is 
productive labor. This fact has important bearings upon 
ethical motives and ethical efficiency. 
If we ask ourselves how the race has been developed on 
its motor or executive side; what means of training in 
quickness, decision, and efficiency has mankind employed 
during all the countless generations of the past? the 
answer is Play, work, and war, —and the greatest of these 
is work. Children played constantly till they could work, 
and occasionally thereafter ; they worked as long as they 
lived, and they fought when they had to or wanted to. 
Play was for the young; work for the masses, of all ages 
beyond childhood; and war, with its preparatory gymnas- 
tics, military training, and chivalric discipline, for the 
so-called freemen, assisted now and then by the sturdy 
arms of toil.   
      
But the most universal in scope and importance of these 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 125 
influences was work — productive labor, which has made 
civilization possible and desirable. 
If we ask by what means chiefly northern Europe 
passed from barbarism to civilization, the answer is: 
Through the industrial training imparted by the monks. 
We usually think of the monasteries as they are pictured 
in their decline, when wealth and power and idleness had 
corrupted them. But for five hundred years at least they 
were centres of industrial training for the people about 
them. They taught barbarians the rudiments of* agri- 
culture and horticulture, how to clear the forests, drain 
the swamps, and cultivate cereals and fruits. They 
showed them how to build houses and cathedrals, how 
to spin and weave the textiles, how to work skilfully in 
wood, iron, copper, brass, and leather ; how, in short, to 
become deft workmen in all the arts and handicrafts. 
In these ways the monks made cities and guilds pos- 
sible. All this they did without the agency of book or 
desk. What they so effectively taught, the guilds con- 
tinued, At a suitable age each boy was indentured for 
the learning of a trade, and he emerged at last, not indeed 
perfected in letters, but rather in the successful applica- 
tion of art and skill to the transformation of raw material 
into objects of use and beauty. Without multiplying 
illustrations, we may forthwith declare with conviction, 
that in the past, not only has man been raised from bar- 
barism to civilization by productive labor, but that his 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  
126 ETHICAL TRAINING 
progress in civilization up to the present has been secured 
by the same means. 
The cost of breaking with the experience of centuries is 
especially great on its motor side, for these traits of mind 
and body acquired and become natural by centuries of 
experience are like great unutilized electric cables, bearing 
upon their stands the accumulated power of countless 
generations. It comes to the teacher with a shock of 
surprise that, whenever he touches a live wire of this kind, 
he gets a flash of light and energy that seems to transform 
the doltish or rebellious youth into a new being. We 
already partly utilize this latent energy in our manage- 
ment of the truant and the incorrigible, by giving them 
at least a partial chance to utilize their inherited powers 
in manual training. The response is always positive and 
helpful. But is it not a pity that we should reserve our 
natural education for the dolt or the rebel? We use all 
the resources of natural docility, all the force of parental 
authority, all the influences of social pressure, to hold 
the great mass of children to a repressive and receptive, 
though perhaps not unhappy and oppressive, education by 
means of desk and book. The education we give is not 
bad in itself; indeed, it is beneficent and necessary : but it 
is partial, since it appeals to but one-half of human nature, 
and that not the strongest and most effective. Most of 
those we teach in the schools come from a not distant an- 
cestry that never knew the restraint of the desk or the 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
       
     
        
   
        
                                                       ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 127 
enlightenment that comes through the book, but they do 
come from an ancestry trained even to the remotest past 
through productive labor. Education should utilize 
these stored-up forces. 
Most books on human instincts and natural impulses 
give no sense of relative values. The instincts of play 
and construction take their places in a long list, each 
briefly described and put upon a plane of equality in im- 
portance with all the rest. Such a method has small 
value in showing the teacher what todo. Play alone has 
received the treatment it deserves as an educative in- 
fluence. Not even the advocates of manual training have 
done justice to the constructive instincts that have been 
developed by productive labor. And yet this is the 
psychological key to the solution of the problems of in- 
dustrial education, and it throws much light on ethical 
training. 
The first principle of all such training, therefore, must 
be creative productivity, a satisfaction and utilization of 
the powers of creative construction, in which the mind 
joins the hand in a common effort. The mindless itera- 
tion of modern machine production has no place in modern 
education, for all training should be educative in method 
as well as design, in that mind and hand, thought and 
motor activity, problem and solution, are joined in an 
indissoluble union, which it were treason to youth to 
destroy.
-P-A-G-E-140

This releases the young fromthe grind of economic 
toil, the depression of drudgery, the benumbing effects of 
endless routine, while allowing the body to grow to its 
normal stature and while permitting the natural powers 
and tendencies of the individual to bud and bloom and 
come to fruitage; releases the great unused storehouse 
of energy accumulated by ages of race experience to find 
scope and useful application. When this is done, the 
race experience, now broken, will be made whole again. 
Discussion :— Efforts of the American Indian to break 
with old, and to acquire new, race experiences. 
63. The ethical aspect of these considerations becomes 
more impressive when we reflect that the experiences of 
the race have always arisen from vital motives. The 
most pressing of these have béen economic, and have 
pertained to survival in the struggle for food, clothing, and 
shelter. Others, such as the artistic and religious, have. 
expressed the deepest needs and inner nature of the mind 
itself. But whatever the end to be reached has been, it 
has always throbbed with human interest. The motive 
might have been attended with deficit, privation, and 
pain, or with the Greek sense of well-being united with 
surplus and satisfaction, but it has always arisen from 
real, rather than artificial situations, and has consequently 
had all the driving force of life itself. Modern high- 
school education must also deal with reality instead of 
artificiality, with motives that are living, not those that  
-P-A-G-E-141
        
     
                                                                  
        ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 129 
are dead; with the genuine and life-giving, not the per- 
functory and abstract. 
These vital motives will emerge from the character of 
our curriculum and our manner of presenting it. In the 
first place, as already urged, no study is so dead to living 
motive as the study that is detached, isolated from its 
fellows, and but distantly related to the ends sought by 
the education under consideration. Yet the ruling passion 
of the schoolmaster is to teach each branch as an end in 
itself, not the means to a greater end further on. If we 
would evoke and utilize living motives in the young, we 
must not yield to this impulse, but must make every 
study stand at every point in living relation toits leading 
purpose. 
Thesciences lead naturally toward practical life, whether 
industrial or professional, and it is in this motive that their 
greatest potency lies. The idea of pure science as a 
school subject is most modern, and arouses but a small 
part of the resources of the mind, just because it assumes 
that this break in human experience is normal and desir- 
able. Pure science is ethical, therefore, only in an ab- 
stract intellectualized sense, since it does not tap the 
boundless stored-up moral forces of the past which lie in 
inherited capacity and aptitude for productive work. 
But once turn these neglected currents in full tide through 
the soul, and the whole being is transformed. Person- 
ality at once rises to a higher plane. The youth becomes 
E
-P-A-G-E-142
  130 ETHICAL TRAINING 
consciously more of a functioning unit in a functioning 
whole, less an atom in an aggregate; that is, more of a 
man and less of a machine. Even a coral insect would 
rise in the scale of being, if it could be even dimly con- 
scious thatin their simple occupations of assimilating food, 
depositing lime, and multiplying their kind, it and its fel- 
lows were building islands where higher forms of life might 
thrive, where fronded palms should rise in air, the orange 
bloom and bear its golden fruit, and a higher form of in- 
telligence realize the increasing purpose of which they 
were laying the foundations. How much more should a 
youth be enabled to comprehend the meaning of life who 
has, however imperfectly, seen the growth of mind and 
its products in the past, and who perceives in some sense, 
at least, that he is furthering the development of the 
future. Then every brick well laid, every concrete 
foundation made permanent, every piece of iron heated 
and fashioned to use and beauty, every scientific fact 
comprehended and made ready for use, becomes a con- 
tribution to an expanding future. Life in this way rises 
in dignity, as it deepens in meaning; it becomes its own 
most worthy end, and not a mere mechanical means of 
aggregation. 
Again, as already intimated, we have been slow to rec- 
ognize that such an education is morally superior to any 
other. Plato may have been right when he declared that 
the occupation of the gods is perpetual geometrizing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES I3r 
That would be poor business for a man. The esoteric 
contemplation of abstract truth is less moral in its in- 
fluence than the concrete application of truth to human 
affairs. It is for this reason that applied science is more 
moral in its. effects than pure science, that creative con- 
struction is better than graphic representation. Studies 
are moralized by being socialized, and they are socialized 
by daily application to constructive effort. 
For similar reasons, a socialized education of this sort is 
the best protection against vice, for a life made efficient in 
social service by skill, and animated by insight into the 
eternal verities of science and humanity, and inspired by 
the ever brightening hope of the man who sees his deed 
in its ultimate meaning, lifts the soul to some degree at 
least above the animal, which seeks the gutter because it 
is cool. 
Discussron :— Other means for arousing vital motives in 
students. 
64. As such an education tends to make a man per- 
sonally more worthy, so it tends to make him economi- 
cally more fit; hence, ethically more efficient. His study 
and practice in fundamentals make him better able to 
master a whole trade, or the details of a series of factory 
operations, than he otherwise would be. But integrity, 
  
    or wholeness, in occupation, increases efficiency in earning   
power, since it increases and perfects the product. To 
such a man a new machine is a new joy, to be quickly 
   
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 ETHICAL TRAINING 
mastered and to be made a servant to better results, not 
a monster to deprive him of his living. When men are 
industrially well trained, the best man for a new machine 
will be one who has acquired deftness and intelligence 
about machinery in general, not the boy from the gram- 
mar school. Then the employer can with economic ad- 
vantage promote the worker from machine to machine, 
until he has mastered the whole business. The employer 
will find it easier and safer to enter into codperative 
relations with such men, for they are no longer in a blind 
and more or less unintelligent struggle for individual 
existence; they are functioning members of a business 
that is a functioning total. Each one reflects in his in- 
dividual work and comprehension the work and meaning 
of the entire enterprise. Under such conditions work is 
not so much drudgery to be paid for by so much dole, but 
it is a spiritual entity, in which the artist spirit displaces 
that of the serf, and where hope and meaning animate 
the whole. 
Discussion :— Reflex influence of economic upon moral 
efficiency. 
2. The Natural Sciences 
65. Youth is vision of manhood to be. To give this 
vision substantiality with respect to the ethical possibili- 
ties of science, three things at least should be emphasized. 
They are wonder, desire to understand, and scientific 
method of thinking. 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 133 
The wonder of the child, which Plato calls the beginning 
of wisdom, gives place in the adolescent to that form of 
admiration that is excited from a contemplation of what 
one might call the romance of knowledge. Effects hith- 
erto undreamed of come to light when a new basic applica- 
tion of science is made to human needs. Thus, in physics 
a device for utilizing the expansive power of steam makes 
the modern factory system a reality, and thus absolutely 
transforms the industries of the world. Another device 
for utilizing the power generated by explosion leads to 
the motor boat and the automobile. The invention of 
the dynamo, the electric motor, and the methods for 
transforming voltage from low to high, and from high to 
low, gives us the electric street car, the electric light, the 
electric furnace, and many other devices for utilizing in 
new ways the force generated by cataracts and by burn- 
ing coal. Put the eye in the other end of the housewife’s 
needle, and the sewing-machine comes ; use iron fingers to 
hold the grain and a reciprocating sickle, and the modern 
harvester begins its development. Devise a swivelling 
truck and a sloping face to the wheel outside the flange, 
and the train can safely travel on curves; exhaust the 
steam into the smoke-stack, and the more steam is used, 
the more is produced; contrive the air-brake, and the 
heavy Pullman sleeping-car becomes practicable; burn 
the excess carbon from the molten iron, and the resulting 
Bessemer steel rails will withstand the shock and strain

  produced by the swift-moving, heavy laden trains that 
thunder over them. He is indeed a torpid creature whose 
pulse is not quickened by these splendid triumphs of 
thought in the utilization of the forces of nature to the 
needs of men. 
What is true in physics is paralleled in chemistry. 
Once Indian corn was the simple food of the pioneer and 
his beast, now there are forty or more useful products 
arising from it; new medicines for the alleviation or cure 
of diseases are constantly being produced ; digestion and 
life-processes in general are rendered intelligible through 
the investigations of the chemical laboratory; new in- 
dustries are constantly created, old ones enlarged and 
improved or wholly displaced. Heating oil of turpentine 
with hydrochloric-acid gas enables us to manufacture 
camphor by the ton. It is no longer so necessary for the 
inhabitant of the tropical jungle to chop the camphor tree 
to bits in order to extract the gum. Similar results were 
produced by the discovery of the aniline dyes. The 
chemist’s retort might almost be said to have transformed 
Germany from an agricultural to an industrial nation, 
able to employ all her rapidly increasing population in 
profitable labor, and to rival England in supplying the 
world with manufactured goods. 
The triumphs of biology are equally impressive, espe- 
cially in the fields of agriculture, horticulture, medicine, 
and hygiene. Plants are improved or newly created,

fertilizing nitrogen is gathered from the air, the laws of 
growth are determined, the causes of disease ascertained, 
while in the surgeon’s office the patient may confidently 
wrap the drapery of his couch about him and lie down 
as to pleasant dreams. 
The feeling of wonder at the marvels of science is culti- 
vated by the history of discovery and invention, and by 
the personal inspection of machinery, processes, and prod- 
ucts. A museum of the raw and partially manufactured 
products of commerce may be rendered of priceless value. 
About every article fancy may twine its garlands woven 
from the strands of fact. Out of wonder thus stimulated 
and developed will spring the enthusiasm with which 
science is ready to reward her votaries; and with this 
enthusiasm founded upon insight and growing revelation 
of the ethical significance of science, there may easily 
arise that passion for service which is the sure mark of the 
moralized man.

“2, Patience and exactitude in observing, verifying, 
and recording them ; | 
“3, A disposition to brood over new facts before reach- 
ing a judgment as to their meaning and classification ; 
‘4. An habitual willingness to take great trouble in 
getting at the truth.” 
Ethically considered, most of the foregoing aspects 
may be summed up under “ desire to understand.” Out 
of this desire, after wonder, grows alertness of interest, 
patience, and fidelity in investigation, reflection as to 
meaning, and the taking of pains to get at the truth. 
Some have pictured the purpose of science teaching to be 
the accumulation of facts rather than a training of the 
mind to comprehend them. But facts alone, when iso- 
lated from experience, even if separately fairly well ap- 
prehended, have small practical, and almost no ethical 
value. The desire to know the reason of things, to find 
out causes and to trace effects, the unwillingness to accept 
a fact without a demand for its explanation, has as much 
ethical significance as it has intellectual. Even if it be 
asserted that the desire to understand has no effect upon 
ethical disposition, it most certainly has much upon 
ethical efficiency. He who understands the causes of 
misery is better prepared to relieve and prevent it than 
he who perceives the pain, but knows not whence it comes. 
He who can intelligently use his scientific knowledge to 
promote the good of others is ethically more capable than 
 
-P-A-G-E-149

he who does not comprehend. Good-will not reénforced 
with insight and capacity effects but little. 
Keenness of desire to understand should, therefore, 
ever be a prominent aim in the teaching of science. There 
need be no effort to isolate the ethical from theintellectual. 
What nature has joined together, it is better for the 
teacher not to try to separate. Moral character does not 
affect merely a fraction, but the whole, of man. It pene- 
trates his inmost thought, it permeates his whole being, 
_ it saturates concept and emotion and volition, and that is 
but a fragmentary and feeble morality that is separated 
from daily thought and doing, from experience as a whole. 
Through this insistent desire to understand the whence 
and whither and why, which may be cultivated by scientific 
training, we come to know what is worth doing, as well as 
how to doit. “ Science,” as Dewey says, “ has as yet had 
next to nothing to do with forming the social and moral 
ideals for the sake of which she is used. Even where 
science has received its most attentive recognition, it has 
remained a servant of ends imposed from alien traditions. 
If ever we are to be governed by intelligence, not by 
things and by words, science must have something to say 
about what we do, and not merely about how we may do it 
most easily and economically. And if this consummation 
is achieved, the transformation must occur through educa- 
tion, by bringing home to men’s habitual inclination and 
attitude the significance of genuine knowledge and the

full import of the conditions requisite for its attain- 
ment.”! 
Discussion :— The laws of hygiene (1) as a starting point 
for the teaching of sexual morality,’ (2) as a guide to sanita- 
tion and to quarantine regulations, (3) medical inspection of 
schools, (4) control of conditions leading to diseases like small- 
pox and tuberculosis. 
67. What, it may be asked, has scientific procedure of 
thought to do with morals? Just this: Aside from the 
subjective merits of good-will, the whole ethical efficacy 
of our deeds depends upon it. Would a modern man 
  
    help his neighbors in combating a plague, how efficacious 
will his efforts be if he insists that its cause is a demon,   
who can be made to desist only by incantations and the 
beating of tom-toms? The rites of magic are less potent 
than a method of thought that enables the true cause to 
be discovered. Demonology as a theory of disease has 
yielded to that of bacteriology, which in turn has been 
made possible only by the methods of science. The 
weakness of supernaturalism in general in explaining that 
whose efficient causes may be detected by scientific 
method, is that man is objectively unable to evade the 
evil effects of harmful influences. His resources are peti- 
tion, incantation, submission. He may ascribe his suf-

ferings to the inscrutable will of divine power, and bear 
with meekness the ills whose causes he feels himself 
impotent to remove. Under such circumstances a life 
sacrificed in the aid of mankind renders only a psycho- 
logical service. Subjectively, the offering is sublime; 
objectively, thesacrifice is futile. But a lifesacrificed in a 
scientific search for the causes of disease, as was Dr. La- 
zear’s in the warfare against yellow fever, has all the sub- 
limity that attaches to the other, and it also renders a 
lasting service to the whole human race. Subjectively 
sublime, it is also objectively efficient. 
“With fear of change 
That flaming meteor, John, 
Perplexes sovereigns throughout his range.” 
The superstitious fears of men, and the paralysis of 
self-help arising from supernatural explanation of natural 
events is well illustrated by the ancient belief that “a 
comet is a ball of fire flung from the hand of an angry 
God to warn the grovelling dwellers of earth.”1 It is a 
triumph of scientific method that all intelligent people 
now ascribe these untoward events to natural law, and 
are consequently released from all the baleful results of 
the feelings of fear and of impotence to help. 
“Mankind so far has been ruled by words, not by 
thought, for till the last few moments of history, humanity

has not been in possession of the conditions of secure and 
effective thinking. Unless we master things, we shall 
continue to be mastered by them; the magic that words 
cast upon things may indeed disguise our subjection or 
render us less dissatisfied with it, but, after all, science, 
not words, casts the only compelling spell upon things.” * 
But if men have not been in position to rule themselves 
by thought “ till the last few moments of history,” it is 
highly probable that the mass of men have not yet risen 
to the heights of knowledge and efficiency to which the 
scientific method has raised our leaders. For illustration, 
man untrained in the resources of scientific thought is 
prone to confuse analogy as a guide to discovery with 
analogy as a final basis of conclusion. Wireless teleg- 
raphy may raise the question whether mental telepathy 
is not possible, but it does not warrant a jump to the 
conclusion that it is, upon the ground that it would be 
absurd to deny to mind what is freely ascribed to matter. 
Produrance of substance may hint at immortality, but it 
  is not sufficient to guarantee it, for spirit and physical 
force or crass matter are not identical. A belief in im- 
mortality may suggest the free communication of the dead 
with the living; but the analogy is no proof, though 
it has produced a class of clever artists in legerdemain, 
doubtless partly self-deceived, who have aroused the

superstitious nature of the masses, and in some cases 
attracted the half-believing attention of learned men.! 
What is illustrated by the failure to use analogy legiti- 
mately, is equally true of the disuse or wrong use of the 
whole machinery of scientific method :— ascertaining 
facts by observation and experiment, their explanation by 
hypothesis, the laws of procedure in searching out cause 
and effect, the adequate verification of tentative results 
through repeated experiment under controllable condi- 
tions and the test of negative instances, and, finally, the 
application of ascertained truth to revise old opinions and 
to advance knowledge. 
Wherever men work, in trade, in production, in govern- 
ment or courts, in charity or social reform, in education, 
in the home or the church, they need the methods of 
science in applying effectively the truths that science has 
revealed. Scientific method, like science itself, is uni- 
versal in its scope. It offers its beneficent guidance’ in 
every path of life. He who is a stranger to her ways is 
not so good a trainer of character as he will be when he 
understands her simple yet effective processes for reveal- 
ing the truth that makes men free.

confusion in moral perceptions, so that fallacious reasoning

conduct.

  CHAPTER VIII 
REALIZING THE ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL 
STUDIES (Continued) 
3. Industrial Subjects 
68. Industrial subjects have a larger moral potency as 
ethical instruments than those of disciplinary and cultural 
education, for the same reason that applied is superior 
to pure science. The motives aroused are more social, 
also more immediate and vital, than they are where sub- 
jects are more detached from life, and hence more sub- 
jective and individual. 
There are at least two fundamental conditions for 
realizing in full measure the ethical value of these sub- 
jects. They are: (1) the reorganization of old subjects 
to new ends — the industrial — so that every subject in 
the curriculum ‘shall be taught in its industrial aspects ; 
and (2) emphasis upon creative productivity, rather than 
upon imitation and memory. 
Industrial training, to be most effective morally as well 
as intellectually, must in the future rest upon the reor- 
ganization of all its subject-matter according to the in- 
142 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  
ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 143 
dustrial purpose, and not as in the past upon an academic 
aggregation in which a new detached subject (manual 
training) is simply added to others of diverse aim. No 
successful technical education can ignore this principle. 
It is the basal educational idea in engineering, law, medi- 
cine, and agriculture, and it must be also incommerce and 
trade. Each teaches the fundamental sciences, but always 
from its own point of view. The German continuation 
schools also recognize the principle, all studies of what- 
ever kind, such as drawing, art appreciation, physics, 
chemistry, literature, history, civics, being focussed upon 
the particular trade the lad may be preparing for. Thus, 
for the baker class of apprentices, the reading book treats 
of the cereals and the other raw materials that are used 
in the baking industry. Their history as articles of 
human food is traced, and a complete account is given 
of their elaboration into usable articles. The book con- 
cludes with an historical survey of baking machinery and 
processes.1. Similar books covering the entire curriculum 
are prepared, and furnish an ample guide to this kind of 
reorganization. As pointed out in the preceding chapter 
(section 62), such an arrangement of subject-matter 
renders vital the motives that otherwise may easily be- 
1The Leipzig Fortbildungs-Schuldirectoren und Lehrern have edited 
a series of such books in reading and mathematics for the various trades, 
such as bakers, barbers, carpenters, masons, metal workers, waiters and 
cooks, cabinet-makers, textile workers, and the like. Similar books are 
prepared for all aspects of drawing and of bookkeeping.

become perfunctory. The youth works with a hope and 
understanding and enthusiasm that are often painfully 
lacking in general education. In so-called culture courses, 
that is given to the student which seems good for him; 
but in industrial courses of the kind advocated, that is 
given which seems good fo him. The effect upon the 
attitude, outlook, motives, and enthusiasm of the youth 
is often startlingly apparent. The subjective becomes 
objective; the non-social is transfused into the social; the 
intellectual and morally indifferent takes on the aspect of 
social service that leads to ethical valuation (see section 
60). 
In a school whose curriculum is thus organized, dis- 
cipline practically takes care of itself, for the institution 
seems to the youth a real, and not an artificial thing. 
Teachers become to him friends and guides, not educa- 
tional policemen on the watch for the infraction of rules. 
The occupations of the class room prepare for those of 
laboratory and shop, and these in turn seem to him in- 
stinct with the incentives that move men in the outside 
world. The industrial subjects simply carry the ethical 
significance of applied science one step farther, in that 
they permeate and consecrate to living ends all the other 
contributory subjects of the curriculum. 
No less important is the second condition, that school 
work shall be permeated by the idea of productive crea- 
tion, rather than memory and imitation; for the mind is 
   
-P-A-G-E-157
  
ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 145 
at once removed from the passive, receptive stage to the 
active and creative one. Drawing, for illustration, under 
the passive order of instruction, emphasized reproduction. 
It incited the student to imitate the drawings of others or 
to reproduce in two-dimensional space more or less con- 
ventional objects that have length, breadth, and depth. 
Such exercises were directed by the maxims, “ skill for the 
sake of skill,” “art for art’s sake,” “ beauty is its own 
excuse for being,” etc. These motives have proved to be 
‘both fleeting and feeble with most students, so that high- 
school drawing has been acquired only to be discarded 
and forgotten, as soon as the pressure to pursue it has 
been relaxed. But drawing, both free-hand and me- 
chanical, under the newer industrial motive of graphic 
creation as the necessary prelude to material construction 
is neither fleeting nor feeble in its motives, but strong and 
lasting. Not representation, but creation, is its aim. The 
old artistic incentives are revitalized by the new motive, 
for the student has a vivid interest in acquiring the neces- 
sary technique to give expression to his conception. As 
one superintendent said of his own daughter, “‘ She came 
near failing in French, because she was so much inter- 
ested in drawing her hat.” 
The same incentives to create that have transformed 
drawing, affect the other subjects in the same way. 
Manual training used to consist in the performance of 
detached exercises. The old literary education in its 
L 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
    146 ETHICAL TRAINING 
worst estate never produced a more formalized and desic- 
cated form of instruction than this. But where each 
product of manual skill is conceived and drawn by the 
inventor, the only use for the product of isolated exer- 
cises is to serve as a clarifier of the conceptions that are 
antecedent to construction. It is worth while for the 
student to handle various types of joint and the separate 
elements of objects, for these give him concrete data for 
his own creations; but it is a poor use of his time to con- 
fine him to detached exercises upon parts of things. 
Here, again, creation leads to vital motives, and leads the 
student by a shorter path to the acquisition of the nec- 
essary skill. 
Industrial education, therefore, witha unified curriculum 
in which each science studied, whether natural or human, 
is governed both in material and method by the central 
purpose of the school, and with that incentive for the 
free use of the whole mind that is involved in the ideal of 
creative work throughout, socializes in high degree the 
whole process, and thus creates the conditions for the best 
realization of the moral potencies of such instruction. 
The perfunctory and artificial is warded off, while the 
genuine, the life-giving, the inspiring, is ever at hand. 
The student uses his whole mind and all his manual powers 
in equipping himself for useful work in the world. This 
is, of course, not all of moral training, but it is a worthy 
part of it.

69. History shares with science its instrumental ethical 
value, but in a different field. The former is scientific 
and largely economic, whereas the latter is human and 
mostly institutional. But history, in common with art, 
has a larger and more effective moral potency arising 
from the nature of its content. It is the bearer of count- 
less ethical ideals worked out concretely in experience. 
Its leading theme is the political evolution of man; its 
goal is liberty and self-government, The moral quali- 
ties of men that promote the development and help to 
realize the goal are exhibited in the actions and motives 
of individuals. Courage and cowardice, patriotism and 
treason, public spirit and personal greed, humanity and 
bestiality, self-sacrifice and selfishness, are exhibited side

by side, and their consequences illustrated by the fate of 
nations and peoples. Is a nation oppressed, distracted 
by dissension, deprived of independent existence ? — the 
causes, internal and external, are revealed by history; so 
that the reader can perceive to what extent the people 
contributed to their own fate through elements of weak- 
ness due to their own shortcomings. History exhibits 
for the admiration and inspiration of youth the concrete 
exemplification of the noblest motives of men — patriot- 
ism, fidelity, patience to wait for results, moral leader- 
ship, heroic action, and, in general, the undaunted mind. 
What youth not dead to noble impulse does not even 
now thrill to the answer of the chiefs of a tribe along the 
Danube to the arrogant question of the conqueror of the 
world, Alexander the Great? Hearing that they were 
a brave people, but expecting them to cringe before his 
irresistible power, he sent them by courier this inquiry 
— “Of what are you most afraid?” After mature de- 
liberation, the chiefs returned this answer: “What we 
most fear is that the sky may fall upon us!” ? 
That history has this moral potency, of which many 
have written, is unquestioned; but how much of this 
moral worth shall be utilized depends upon the manner 
and spirit in which history is taught. Nothing is com- 
moner than for this subject to fail to function in its moral 
aspects.

40. The inquiry most important for the teacher is, not, 
Is there a moral value in history? but, What are the essen- 
tial conditions for realizing it im the minds and hearts of 
the students? : 
Here, again, the principle that has guided us throughout 
must be applied; namely, that a study to be morally 
valuable must function if the concrete field of present 
thought, feeling, and action. What is sundered from 
this remains inert and undeveloped, like seeds embedded 
in ice. History should give insight into present condi- 
tions. Why, for illustration, are the people of the United 
States engaged in a titanic struggle against corporate 
greed? The answer is to be found in the history of the 
legislation that grew out of the demands of the frontier. 
There was much free land, a superabundance of natural 
resources, and but few people. The frontier claimed that 
it was better for the nation to inhabit the waste places and 
to utilize as far as possible the natural resources than to 
let them lie idle. The people of the frontier conse- 
quently demanded and obtained free land for the actual 
settler, and free use of coal and iron and timber and 
4
-P-A-G-E-162
150 ETHICAL TRAINING 
water-power by farmer or miner or woodman or miller 
who wished to utilize them. These laws remain un- 
changed, but conditions have altered. Where there were 
once thousands, there are now millions of people. Free 
land has been absorbed, and placer mining and other simi- 
lar forms of individual utilization of natural resources 
have become impracticable. Only large capital can 
profitably extract the gold or silver from low-grade ores. 
Only great business organizations can carry on the opera- 
tions of mining or utilize the electric power to be devel- 
oped in large waterfalls. 
What now confronts us, therefore, is public interest 
versus obsolete laws. Only individuals may claim mining 
privileges, say, in the Alaskan coal fields, but capital must 
be employed to mine and market the coal. Here the 
large corporation steps in, buys what individual claims it 
can, and, when these do not suffice, proceeds to secure the 
advantage of fraudulent entries. But the resources 
belong to the whole people; they can no longer be profit- 
ably given away to individuals, and corporations should 
not be permitted to exploit them for their own sole advan- 
tage. Thus, a study of the frontier as an influence in 
American history results in a clarifying comprehension 
of the existing conditions which bring about the contest 
between public and corporate interests. The insight thus 
gained brings with it a corresponding attitude of mind. 
Shall I favor the party of obsolete legality, or the party

that would protect the public interests, incidentally by 
exposing and defeating and punishing graft and fraud, 
but chiefly by bringing legislation into harmony with 
present conditions? There is but one answer to the man 
who understands and who is unbiassed by party or per- 
sonal interests. Insight and disposition culminate natu- 
rally in the resolution to resist the evil at every oppor- 
tunity. The history of the American frontier thus 
directly contributes to public opinion, which does not 
have to wait long ere it results in public action.

va to that aspect of moral life that we call citizenship. Here, istory is of preéminent value in training youth 
as elsewhere, the essential qualities to cultivate are intel-

ligence, attitude, and capacity. Without insight the best 
of intentions fail. Many seem to think that if they can 
cultivate piety and good intention in their pupils, — the 
subjective or purely personal aspects of virtue, — all the 
rest will take care of itself. Desirable as these personal 
qualities may be, they do not suffice to make good citizens ; 
for, lacking insight into the good and evil of political 
society, men know not how to serve. If, however, history, 
as suggested in the preceding section, is made to function 
in understanding of present situations, in the proper atti- 
tude of mind concerning them, and in the consciousness 
of power to help correct public abuses and to 
render personal service to the various governmental 
groups in which the individual is a functioning part, then 
history becomes an important instrument of ethical 
training. 
As Professor Jenks conclusively shows,! civic evils arise 
mostly, not from lack of good-will toward the state and 
society in general, but from maladjustment to existing 
conditions. 
Maladjustment in the public laws themselves is often 
to blame for much of misery and bad citizenship. If men 
try to govern a great city by the methods of the New 
England town-meeting, the results, though brought about 
in the name of democracy, are most undemocratic, in 
that the door is opened to all forms of municipal corrup- 
1 Jenks, J. W., “Citizenship and the Schools,” Chapter I. 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 153 
tion. If obsolete laws for the individual appropriation 
of public resources hold over into a situation like the 
present, when the individual is no longer able to serve 
either himself or the public by such appropriation, but 
"becomes rather the convenient tool for corporate greed to 
exploit public resources, then legality becomes the means 
for the plundering of the public. It serves to divide the 
moral forces of the country, because it confuses the sense 
of what is right, sets “conscience over against constitu- 
tion,” and in the end will probably wreck any political 
party which in the name of law allows corporations to 
plunder publicproperty. Youth can beso trained through 
history as to perceive these ever recurring antitheses be- 
tween old laws and new situations that they will help to 
swell that public opinion which sooner or later will remove 
the difficulty by reforming the laws. The conflict between 
archaic legality and present need touches almost every 
aspect of our public life. Monopoly finds it possible to 
crush competition without violating law; courts defeat 
justice while observing legal forms, thus inviting lynch 
law and general disrespect for legal enactments; legis- 
lators accept bribes for promoting or defeating proposed 
legislation; graft and fraud obtain everywhere, and for 
each grafter who is exposed and punished a dozen others 
are developed to take his place, and all because we do not 
by law and political methods render it unsafe and im- 
practicable to commit fraud, while leaving the road wide

open that leads to public service. It should be made 
hard to do public wrong, but easy to do public good. 
That this is possible by means of education and political 
methods, the experience of Switzerland and of New Zea- 
land conclusively proves. 
Bad citizenship frequently arises from maladjustment 
of the individual to economic conditions. New machines 
and new methods in industry frequently displace large 
bodies of workers who from defects of education lack the 
capacity to readjust themselves to the new order. At 
this point, the whole activity of the school should contrib- 
ute to that elasticity of capacity which makes the ex- 
perienced workman on an old machine the best man to 
master and run the new one. This can be done only 
through instruction in machinery — its underlying prin- 
ciples and manifold ways of effecting a given purpose. 
Such instruction is intensive in the mastery of mechanical 
law, but extensive in application. Every variety of wood- 
and metal-working machinery, every type of machine 
used in textile industries, all forms of prime-movers for 
the development of power, should pass in turn through 
the hands of the youth who expects to join the ranks of 
industry. He should have opportunity to handle them, 
run them, take them apart, and to demonstrate his in- 
sight respecting their construction and adaptation to

           ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 155 
purpose, and so far as possible he should become adept 
in their use. When to this knowledge and skill he adds 
the history of the industries they represent, he will con- 
tribute to good citizenship because he is at home in the 
economic world. 
“ History as now taught,” says Professor Robinson, 
“is sadly out of touch with modern progress. What we 
want to teach is the advancement of man through his 
labor and not through his fighting spirit. “Political his- 
tory gives the student a false impression and drives out of 
mind the fact that industry is the foundation for all 
advance, and that political and national affairs are based 
on the industrial prowess of any nation. As soon as boys 
and girls are taught to look upon labor as something 
worth study, we will have more competent men and 
women.” ! 
Another influence that makes for bad citizenship is 
intolerance of new ideals and new standpoints. In over- 
coming this tendency, history may become preéminent, for 
it always looks dispassionately at the doings of men after 
the event. Understanding is the key to toleration, and 
history finds its chief excellence here, in that insight into 
causes is freed from the passion that their effects often 
induce. Men on both sides can now reflect calmly on the 
deep-rooted conditions that led to the great American

Civil War, and thus understanding can tolerate, even if 
not share, the opposing views that led to the shedding of 
blood and the destruction of property.!| But for the less 
burning issues of life, at least, this same training in tolera- 
tion for the ideals and motives and actions of men of past 
generations should make it easier for the youth now, and 
later in his more conservative years, to readjust himself to 
new ideals, standpoints, and conditions of his own times. 
But to effect these results in fullest degree, history must 
function in the important things of the present. Thus, 
for the youth of the great city, municipal affairs form 
a far more important element in his citizenship than the , 
more formal and distant ones of state and nation. He 
might know the Constitution by heart, yet be a poor citi- 
zen. The history of the past, of his own country im- 
mediately, and more remotely that of England and Europe 
in general, should culminate in the civic affairs of his 
owncommunity. For him, municipal is of much greater 
weight than national civics.” 
    For influences upon the more personal aspects of moral 
    culture, history has abundant material in the biographies 
    of great men such as Washington, Lincoln, Lee, in our own 
    country, and in the portrayal of the lives and characters

of philosophers, inventors, and men of science throughout 
the world. Again, if we wish to dwell upon the negative 
side of virtue, history offers a wealth of material for 
ethical judgment. 
In the words of Dewey, ‘‘ What the normal student con- 
tinuously needs is not so much isolated moral lessons in- 
stilling in him the importance of truthfulness and honesty, 
or the beneficent results that follow from some particular 
act of patriotism, etc. It is the formation of habits of 
social imagination and conception — the habit of inter- 
preting the special incidents that occur and the particular 
situations that present themselves in terms of the whole 
social life. The evils of the present industrial and politi- 
cal situation, on the ethical side, are due not so much to 
actual perverseness on the part of individuals concerned, 
not to mere ignorance of what constitutes the ordinary 
virtues (such as honesty, industry, purity, etc.), as to 
inability to appreciate the social environment in which 
we live. It is tremendously complex and confused. 
Only a mind trained to grasp social situations, and to 
reduce them to their simpler and typical elements, can 
get sufficient hold on the realities of this life to see what 
sort of action, critical and constructive, it really demands. 
Most people are left at the mercy of tradition, impulse, 
or the appeals of those who have special and class interests 
to serve. In relation to this highly complicated social 
environment, training for citizenship is formal and nomi-

nal unless it develops the power of observation, analysis, 
and inference with respect to what makes up a social situa- 
tion and the agencies through which it is modified. Be- 
cause history rightly taught is the chief instrumentality 
for accomplishing this, it has an ultimate ethical value.” 4

5. The Arts 
72. Has art as such any bearing upon conduct and 
character, or are esthetics and ethics so diverse in kind 
that neither has anything to do with the other? This 
is a topic much discussed and not a little confused in the 
past. Kant, the philosopher, who denies the validity of 
desire as a guide to conduct, sees no natural means of 
transition from the sensuous to the rational, and hence 
prescribes religion as the bridge from the one to the 
other. He can merely say to the student: “ Be free, 
reverence the moral law, obey the categorical imperative, 
perform duty for duty’s sake, embrace the rule of reason 
and renounce that of appetite and desire; this is your

-P-A-G-E-171

prerogative and duty as a rational being. If you inquire 
how you are successfully to combat sense and exalt rever- 
ence and reason, the answer is through religion or at least 
the religious attitude of mind, which often suddenly, and 
always resolutely, puts off the old and takes on the new.” 
Schiller, the poet, on the other hand, permeated with 
love for the beautiful, which always has its sensuous side, 
cannot accept the sharp Kantian antithesis between the 
natural and the spiritual, and prescribes art as the bridge 
between the two realms. It is the beautiful soul (die 
schine Seele) that is truly moral, for his conduct is deter- 
mined, not by rule of moral law, but by free, spon- 
taneous, habitual good-will to man. The Christian! 
religion itself, Schiller thinks, is at bottom esthetic, 
since it displaces the rigors of the law by the feelings of 
the heart. Inclination displaces legality. Man is not 
a mere intellectual machine, but a being having passions, 
emotions, desires, one who has good and bad intentions 
toward individuals and groups of men; but this whole 
emotional aspect (Gemiith) takes its rise in the sensuous 
world and finds its expression through bodily action. 
Art mediates, therefore, between the sensuous and the 
rational. As art is never truly beautiful until it is moral, 
so morality is never complete until it is truly beautiful. 
In the beautiful soul it is not separate actions that con- 
stitute virtue, but the whole bearing and attitude of the 
mind; it is the character itself that is moral. In such a 
   
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 ETHICAL TRAINING 
soul the sensuous and the rational, devotion to duty and 
inclination to men, completely harmonize. Gracefulness 
is the expression of the harmony. Crudity, vulgarity, 
bestiality, are all overcome in one in whom the beautiful 
is the rule of life. Virtue is therefore inclination to duty, 
not enforced conformity to law. Virtue and art are twin 
sisters. Man has to be animal before he is spirit, and 
art is truly the bridge between animality and rationality. 
Man must creep in the dust before he can venture on 
Newtonian flights through the universe. Out of the body 
spring our first activities. The response to sense is the 
first round on the ladder to perfection. “Artists derive 
their works from nature, tones conquer the savage pas- 
sions, beauty and harmony ennoble customs, taste and 
art lead to science and virtue.’’ Thus speaks the poet. 
Herbart, another philosopher, sought to cut the Gor- 
dian knot by declaring forthwith that ethics springs from 
esthetics, and he attempted, not very successfully, to 
discover just what the fundamental virtues are. Like 
other preévolutionary investigations, this study ignores 
much that has come about by the natural processes of 
individual and social growth, One point in Herbart’s 
contention is perhaps to be accepted, and that is the 
zsthetic aspect of mental attitudes of mind. These

appear to please or displease us as spontaneously as do 
the sensuous expressions of ideals and conceptions in art. 
If a Greek expression in marble of the quality of graceful- 
ness appeals to us spontaneously as beautiful, so likewise 
do the motives that lead to acts of generosity, courage, 
justice, magnanimity, and the like. As the one is physi- 
cally, so is the other morally, beautiful. In short, it may 
be maintained with some show of reason that whatever 
awakens our spontaneous admiration or our equally 
spontaneous disapproval is at heart esthetic, whether in 
the realm of the arts or in that of morals. That there 
are great differences between art and morals is certain, 
for in the latter we have the ideas of sanctions and obli- 
gations, both external and internal. The imperatives of 
conduct have a different quality from those of art. 
Interesting, however, as are the theories of the relation 
of esthetics to ethics, the practical bearings of the sub- 
ject are more important from the standpoint of the teacher 
who would make art realize all its possibilities for ethical 
training. 
Discussion :—1. Is Herbart’s “Inner Freedom” a guide to 
action or a mere description of a state of mind? 2. Is his 
“good-will” properly defined as ‘the harmony of two wills, 
or may “good-will” exist without such harmony? 3. Which 
view, Kant’s or Schiller’s, is most in accord with the mod- 
ern idea of the instrumental value of impulses, instincts, pas- 
sions, and desires?

73. Art, like other subjects, has its least ethical worth 
when it is most detached from the daily life of the people. 
When confined to a few producers, devoted to trivial or 
non-vital subjects, and placed in museums for occasional 
wholesale inspection, art has but feeble moral value. Nor 
is its ethical function greatly enhanced when more or less 
forced or sentimental contemplation of representations 
of such art is undertaken in the schoolroom. No art 
has ever greatly affected a people that has not been a 
vivid expression of their inmost spirit. It speaks to the 
heart only when it springs from the heart. 
Art, to be morally most effective, must permeate the 
whole of life. It must not be confined to professional 
artists, but must become the inspiration of the artisan as 
well. Emerson declares that beauty must come back to 
the useful arts, and the difference between the fine arts 
and the useful arts must be forgotten. Art as an all- 
embracing principle must find expression in thought and 
feeling and volition; in speech and in manners; in what 
we make and what we use. It should brighten the home 
and its adornments inside and out, and be reflected in our 
clothing and in the preparation and serving of our food. 
Symmetry and harmony belong, not alone to sculpture, 
painting, and music, but also to what we call the useful 
arts. Ina good dinner, for example, one dish is the com- 
plement of another. Life can be sustained for a dreary 
while on a restricted and uniform diet, but health and 
   
-P-A-G-E-175
ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 163 
comfort and the joy of living are enhanced when suitable 
variety is accompanied by artistic skill in preparation 
and correlation. What is true of foods and their 
preparation, is equally true of their serving. Cleanliness, 
neatness, artistic arrangement of dishes and implements, 
contribute their share to good cheer. When to these we 
add smiling faces and happy chatter or genial conversa- 
tion, life tends to goodness because inspired by the 
happiness that springs from beauty. 
The Arts and Crafts movement would transform every 
artisan into an artist, not that it would restore the eco- 
nomic situation of the sixteenth century when an artist was 
found in every craftsman, but that it would reconcile 
machinery and art. The machine will still make the 
thing, but the mind and hand must adorn it. Every 
article made in wood or metal or leather or cloth or paper 
must bear the marks of creative thought and the form 
and finish of the skilful, artistic hand. 
Discussion :—1. Can the ideals of William Morris be 
reconciled with a factory system of industry? 2. In the useful 
arts, is it often necessary to sacrifice beauty to utility? 3. Is 
art realized when form follows function? (illustrate from 
architecture, from agricultural machinery, from vehicles for 
transportation.) 
74. Art promotes morality because it refines, and in 
refining puts vulgarity to shame. If history records acts 
of men and leads to social insight and efficiency, art ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 ETHICAL TRAINING 
presses their finest feelings and ideals. Artistic efficiency 
should be promoted in studio, workroom, laboratory, and 
shop; in sewing room and kitchen. To gain artistic 
skill is thus an important part of school occupation; but 
to gain art appreciation beyond the limits of personal 
achievement in art production may well become a rec- 
reation. With its accustomed lag behind the spirit of 
the age, the school is only beginning to appreciate the 
means society is already freely, but uncritically, using to 
entertain the masses by new instruments of artistic ex- 
pression. In music we have the pianola and the grapho- 
phone. The one enables the humblest citizen to enjoy 
the performance of the greatest composers of past and 
present; the other enables him to hear the voices of the 
kings and queens of song. Almost any high school can 
procure one or both these instruments and can use them 
in general exercises and in entertainments, when bio- 
graphical, explanatory, and descriptive remarks upon 
composers, performers, and instruments, by students or 
teachers, will enliven the occasion, excite new interest, 
and promote understanding. 
For the eye we have the familiar photograph and the 
stereopticon, both of which are freely used. In addition 
to these, however, we have in the moving-picture appa- 
ratus a more potent, because a more dramatic, form of 
representation. Now used for getting money largely 
by the exhibition of psuedo or low-grade art, it is sus- 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
      
    
   
                                  
        
        
      
      ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 165 
ceptible of the finest artistic results. Thus two young 
men of the Cleveland Technical High School presented 
to their thousand fellow-students a moving-picture ex- 
hibition of the Court of King Arthur. The characters 
were dressed in such costumes and performed such acts 
as led the observers to realize as they never could by read- 
ing alone what the life of ancient chivalry was like. 
We have, furthermore, for the training of the ear the 
resources of the human voice. Is there a fine reader 
among teachers or students, let him from time to time 
read for the entertainment of the students choice selec- 
tions from literature in the school library which shall not 
only entertain, but shall also excite the curiosity to know 
what follows. 
When all the resources! at our command for training 
eye and ear to artistic appreciation are fully utilized, it 
may be that we shall decide that culture acquired as rec- 
reation is more potent than culture gained by occupation. 
Discussion :—1. Ways and means for supplying high 
schools with musical and other instruments. 2. Since this is 
art education as recreation, what is the desirable range of 
musical and other selections (may the music, for example, 
range from ‘rag time’ to grand opera)? 3. Time and place 
for the enjoyment of these recreations (general exercises, 
periods of intermission, special appointed times, etc.).

75. Refining influences may be enhanced by the culti- 
vation of the habit of esthetic valuation. How beauty 
should enter into daily life by permeating the useful arts 
has already been considered. In addition to this, the 
sense of esthetic values may be still further extended by 
forming the habit of viewing esthetically things and ac- 
tions not usually regarded as having esthetic qualities. 
Art has two aspects, the inner meaning and the outer 
expression. It is usually the form of the expression, as 
in plastic or graphic art, that constitutes the immediate 
object of esthetic judgment. Thus, harmony of propor- 
tions and of colors, gracefulness of pose and symmetry 
in composition, are the things that catch the eye and 
the observer soon transcends this surface valuation and form the immediate ground of esthetic admiration. But 
searches for the deeper meanings of which these are but 
the expression. It is in this search for the inner signifi- 
cance of things that the high school has unrealized possi- 
bilities for a kind of training that is directly esthetic, 
but indirectly and ultimately moral. 
Anything may be viewed from the esthetic standpoint by 
looking at it ideally with respect to its functions in the whole 
of life. That this is true is daily demonstrated by poet and 
painter. No object is too seemingly humble and prosaic 
to become the subject of poem or painting. L. H. Bailey, 
for illustration, writes a poem on “The Tile Drain,’’! 
1 Bailey, L, H., “The Tile Drain,” Cornell Countryman for February, 
1909. 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  
ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES 167 
in which the esthetic quality attaches, not to the outer 
appearance of the object, but to the functions it performs 
in rendering the land fit for human use. A tree is regarded 
commercially when its value as a wood producer is con- 
sidered; it is viewed botanically when the form and 
function of its elements are studied, and it may be re- 
garded esthetically, first with respect to its form, foliage, 
and place in the landscape, but more remotely with 
respect to its ideal function as the resort of lovers, the 
home of birds, the outward expression of the immanent 
forces of nature, etc. A cotton field is beautiful to look at 
because of its mingling of brown and green and white, but 
its ideal functions in the whole of life are more impres- 
sive. How much of hope is bound up in its billows of 
fluffy white! Upon this crop depend the health and 
comfort and sustenance of countless thousands of work- 
men, not only those who till and gather, but those also 
who manufacture and use its products. It stimulates 
and rewards the inventive genius of those who make 
machines for its transportation and utilization; and it 
clothes alike the form of beauty and the back of toil. 
To the philosopher this is the familiar method of looking 
at men and things sub specie @ternitatis. When intro- 
duced into the high school, this method stimulates the 
imagination, gives wings to the soul, trains the student to 
look beyond the sign to the ultimate significance, leads him 
to view his petty appetites and desires in their ultimate

meaning and result. To a mind thus trained nothing ap- 
pears worth while whose ultimate outcome is not whole- 
some and life-giving. In its white heat, deceit, injustice, 
selfishness, impurity, cowardice, intemperance, are shriv- 
elled and consumed. In this way, beauty as a part of 
the world process becomes the bridge that unites the true 
and the good. 
Discussion :— 1. Trace out some of the ideal functions in 
the whole of life performed by (1) wheat, (2) Indian corn, 
(3) flax, (4) the Mississippi River, (5) the Appalachian Moun- 
tains, (6) a wheel, (7) an automobile, (8) the theatre, (9) the 
press, (10) the school. 2. The sense of humor as a check 
upon sentimental excesses in esthetic valuations. 
6. Literature 
76. In trying to realize the ethical values of literature 
it is important to have a clear conception of what they 
are, else time and toil were thrownaway. 
Literature as an art shares the function of the other 
arts, but mere “style” and literary adornment have but’ 
trifling moral worth. Youth is not impressed by mere 
elegance of expression, — the iridescent gleam from frail 
bubbles of thought, — but responds readily to striking 
and forceful utterance of that which falls within the com-

prehension and interest of adolescence. It is idle to ex- 
pect much ethical influence from even highly artistic 
expression of sentiment beyond or below the range of 
adolescent experience. Many teachers grieve because 
boys are so indifferent to poesy, however pretty or ele- 
vated in sentiment. Others lament the seeming stolidity 
of mind that makes no response to the subtleties of Brown- 
ing or to the elegance of Addison. The all-sufficient ex- 
planation is that the adolescent lacks the apperceiving 
basis, both for sentiment and for philosophy. Youth is 
interested, however, in struggle, in adventurous contests 
of skill and strength, and, above all, in those social or 
group relations whose attractiveness and importance are 
begnnning to impress themselves upon the mind. 
Discussion :— Compare “The Lady of the Lake” with 
“Aurora Leigh” as to fitness for youth. 
77. The muscular theory of morality, according to 
which there is no will training save through action, does 
not estimate literature highly as a means for moral train- 
“ing; because, though it may give insight into moral 
relations and cultivate a desirable attitude of mind, it 
stops short of the concrete deed. The action side of 
ethical training finds its best application in industrial 
education. If we may call ideas clear‘ that stop at the 
stage of cognition, and those vivid that complete the 
psychological cycle, passing beyond apprehension to desire 
1In the author’s “Interest and Education,” pp. 44-46. 
    
-P-A-G-E-182
  170 ETHICAL TRAINING 
and volition, then it must be said that ideas in literature 
are normally more than clear and less than vivid. To 
apprehension they add interest, but they stop short of 
application in the concrete deed. A kind of concrete 
expression, however, they can indeed attain in dramatic 
oral reading. On this account, literature in the high 
school reaches its highest moral efficiency only when it 
culminates in exercises of this kind. A Shakespeare 
club that shall by private practice prepare dramatic 
readings for public exhibitions before the school is always 
a powerful auxiliary to literary interest both for audi- 
tors and performers. 
DISCUSSION :— 1. Best materials for dramatic readings, 
2. Ways, times, and means for drill and practice. 3. Times 
and methods of public performance. 
78. As already intimated, literature is most effective 
with adolescents when it is revealing the relations of the 
individual to the various social or institutional groups of 
which he is or soon will be a member. The dawning 
social interests of youth render such studies fascinating, 
if only they are so presented that concrete social relations 
come clearly to consciousness. All the ethical relations 
portrayed in the first and second chapters of this book 
pass in dramatic form before the youthful reader. Here 
he sees in concrete panorama the conflicting impulses of 
the social and the unsocial self as they work out to their 
ultimate ideal solution; he sees the individual reference 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  
ETHICAL VALUE OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDIES I7i 
trying to adjust itself to the social; he perceives the 
difference of these relations in static, as contrasted with 
dynamic society ; he realizes in imagination what happens, 
ethically considered, when a higher comes into conflict 
with a subordinate social obligation, as when a man must 
choose between honor and love, or between fidelity to 
home and patriotic service to country; he sees the dif- 
ference between tragedy in which the collision of prin- 
ciples destroys the individual, and comedy in which the 
individual is saved by mediation. 
The literature of most worth for giving ethical insight 
and for stimulating ethical interests is that which mirrors 
race experience, not those evanescent types that reflect 
merely passing phases. “ The Idyls of the King,” the 
Shakspearean dramas, the “ Iliad ” and the “‘ Odyssey,” 
and, as illuminating the same eternal themes under 
modern conditions, the masterpieces of our greatest Eng- 
lish and American authors, —all these taken together 
constitute a literary and ethical treasure of unlimited 
extent and inestimable ethical value. 
Discussion :— 1. The most appropriate selections for each 
year of high-school English. 2. Available methods for realiz- 
ing ethical insight and ideals. 3. Is the preaching of ethical 
sermons from literary texts a practice to be commended?

CHAPTER IX 
SOME MORAL ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL TRAINING 
79. In the Athenian city-state the education of free- 
men was divided into two distinct yet correlated parts: 
(z) thought and its expression, called in general “ music’; 
and (2) physical training, called “gymnastic.” The pur- 
pose of “ music” was to develop the rational and emo- 
tional aspects of mind, and that of “ gymnastic” to 
perfect what Plato called the “spirited” side of man. 
Since war was more nearly a steady occupation in ancient 
times than it is now, freemen among Athenians, and also 
among Greeks in general, laid great stress upon physical 
training as the best means for developing in youth those 
qualities that make for military efficiency ; namely, cour- 
age, self-reliance, and the complete control of the mind over 
the body in all those exercises of sense and muscle that make 
the bold and skilful son of battle. In addition to this 
primary motive, the Athenians, at least in their later 
history, had another of hardly less importance, and that 
was the esthetic. That passion for symmetry and har- 
mony which led them to strive for whole-mindedness in 
intellectual realms led them no less earnestly to seek 
173 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
    174 ETHICAL TRAINING 
artistic and moral completeness in the entire man, body 
and soul. A godlike mind with the body of a dwarf, or a 
giant’s body with the mind of a child, was regarded as an 
incongruity, even if not asa monstrosity. To bring about 
this equipoise of body and mind, this harmony between 
the spirit which rules and the body which serves, the time 
of the youth was divided somewhat evenly between the 
music-school and the palestra, or place of physical train- 
ing. In the former he learned to think and to express 
his thought in language and music; in the latter he prac- 
tised the games and exercises that contribute most to 
strength and physical skill; namely, running, leaping, 
discus-throwing, javelin-casting, and wrestling. The first 
two were for the lower limbs, the next two for arms and 
eye, and the last for the whole body and the control of 
the temper. Along with these warlike exercises, there 
were dancing and lessons in deportment calculated to give 
ease, grace, and dignity to every attitude and movement, 
and to overcome diffidence and awkwardness. To these 
more formal exercises, not a little free play was added to 
keep the spirits joyous and spontaneous, and render mind 
and body quick and resourceful in strategy and skill. 
Morality with the Athenians was not subjective and 
detached from the intellectual and the physical, but con- 
sisted rather in the life beautiful, in which every function 
of the being was fulfilled normally, temperately, and in 
esthetic balance with every other. The mind must be 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
SOME MORAL ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL TRAINING 175 
keen enough to perceive how this equipoise can be brought 
about, and forceful enough to subordinate appetite to 
reason whenever appetite tends to pass its proper limits. 
Thus, assuming that strength of will naturally balances 
strength of intellect, the Greek could maintain that the 
man truly wise is also the one truly good. But he neg- 
lected no proper means for producing this mental and 
physical equilibrium. Young men were not permitted 
to pander to the animal side of their nature by idleness 
or gluttony or drunkenness, but were put through the 
most vigorous daily exercise in gymnastics and swimming, 
in hunting, and, during their later apprenticeship to the 
state, in mimic, if not actual, warfare. Thus by a kind 
and amount of training whose hygienic and psychical 
effect is now well understood, the Greek achieved the 
end he sought — a vigorous, well-disposed, and resource- 
ful mind in a beautiful and efficient body. Belonging, 
however, to a more or less static and socialistic city-state, 
the ideal Greek character would hardly meet successfully 
the conditions of a modern democracy. Where the re- 
straints of such a socialistic order as that of Athens would 
hold many natural tendencies to evil sternly in check, 
the modern state would leave the road to destruction wide 
open. It is evident, therefore, that the modern youth 
needs to develop inner sources of strength which in 
Athens he would not have been called upon to supply. 
Our civilization is not naive, but complicated by a long 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 ETHICAL TRAINING 
period of development. It has been enriched by increas- 
ing knowledge, purified in its ideals by Christianity, and 
rendered free by democracy, — by liberty, fraternity, 
and equality. Not a few freemen only, but all men, are 
now to be educated and trained to live up to moral stand- 
ards. War has ceased to be a leading occupation; and 
hunting is a thing of the past for the normal citizen. Our 
free youth must be fitted for a life of service through 
labor, not for one of civil and foreign war, nor of super- 
vision of slaves. Nevertheless, physical training of the 
right sort still exercises a beneficent moral influence, as 
it did in the days of ancient Athens. 
Discussion :— Contrast between modern and Greek ideals 
concerning (1) the persons to be trained in morals, (2) the 
state of knowledge, (3) ideals of virtue, (4) occupations of 
freemen, (5) athletics, (6) range of requisite moral qualities. 
80. Health and exercise are important conditions for 
the best development of moral character, but in them- 
selves they are not now, even if they ever were, an ade- 
quate basis for moral training. Character at bottom 
is mental, not physical, and this fact is particularly im- 
pressive in modern society, where the wide range of in- 
dividual freedom permitted is almost certain to subject 
the youth devoid of inner strength to allurements of vice 
which he cannot withstand. Even the most rigorous 
rules of athletic training are no permanent defence against 
drinking or smoking or grosser forms of indulgence,
-P-A-G-E-189
  
SOME MORAL ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL TRAINING 177 
because such training always has long vacations during 
which its controlling motives relax or disappear. Insight, 
disposition, imagination, ideals, regulative principles, and 
moral habits, reénforced by social example, custom, and 
pressure, are still the main reliance for moral develop- 
ment; but the physical factor is always important, and 
should never be neglected. It increases vigor and courage, 
self-reliance, and executive capacity now as it did in the 
days of Greece. It is doubtless true that the English- 
man owes more to his sports than to his instruction for 
that primitive daring as a leader of men of which Kip- 
ling speaks in “‘ The Light that Failed.” He says, “‘ The 
Egyptian troops had seen many Englishmen die, but they 
had never seen an Englishman afraid.” Properly directed 
physical training seizes upon racial traits and utilizes 
them to stir the being to its primeval depths; unlike the 
mental training of the present, it makes no break with 
race experience (see section 61). The free play always 
associated with the best physical training leads, moreover, 
to choice under conditions of genuine freedom. The 
student can here act out his real nature, thus revealing 
to the observer his natural traits of strength and weak- 
ness. 
Such training counteracts in large degree the restless- 
ness engendered by sedentary education; it restores the 
physical equilibrium by utilizing in healthful ways the 
surplus energy stored up by bodily inertness during hours 
N 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
    178 ETHICAL TRAINING 
of study. Conversely, it restores the mind to healthful 
tone, inhibiting the morbid or morose or impure by the 
substitution of a cheerful and wholesome state of 
mind. 
Discussion : — 1. High-school games as an aid to discipline. 
2. Cultivation of loyalty to the school through physical train- 
81. The modern school has a responsibility in physical 
training not acutely felt by the ancients; namely, the 
duty of educating students in the ideals and practices of 
true sportsmanship. In the static city-state of the 
Greeks, public opinion was fixed by tradition and custom, 
hence exerted a compelling force not safely to be ignored 
by youth. To-day, however, the freedom accorded the 
individual has led to two conditions, one permanent and 
the other probably transient, that complicate the problem. 
They are: (1) the disposition of democratic society to give 
wide scope to individual judgment, and even caprice, in 
all phases of conduct not obviously to be controlled in the 
interests of the public; and (2) the reflex influence of an 
unwholesome college athletic sentiment upon the corre- 
sponding activities of the high school. The first of these 
conditions is inherent in dynamic society, hence not to be 
materially altered. The second, resting upon the first as 
its logical presupposition, has arisen because true manli- 
ness in sports has often been temporarily obscured by 
college rivalries for prestige. This sentiment might be 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
SOME MORAL ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL TRAINING 179 
crystallized into a toast, as follows: “‘Our college — May 
she ever play fair; but whether by fair means or foul let 
her win!” 
The causes of this unworthy spirit among the colleges 
and universities are known and deplored by all right- 
thinking men. The most hopeful aspect of the situation 
is that it is gradually improving under public criticism, 
and because academic circles are returning to a better 
sense of relative values. 
So long as unsportsmanlike conduct of athletics con- 
tinues, either openly or surreptitiously, the high school 
must resist its influence; not so much perhaps by vocifer- 
ous condemnation, as through the inculcation of right 
ideals, accompanied by unremitting supervision in prac- 
tice. Democratic freedom always calls for the develop- 
ment of inner strength; bad example makes it more 
  
difficult, but also more imperative. 
High ideals in sports, like those in other aspects of life, 
are inculcated by precept, example, and illustration. 
They involve insight, attitude, and practice. 
The moral tone of athletics at Rugby and other Eng- 
lish secondary schools that became imbued with the       
spirit of Thomas Arnold is one that might well animate 
the American high school. Every boy in these schools 
is trained to the axiomatic conviction that there are 
certain things that no gentleman can do. Everything 
that violates the rules of fair play is condemned, and not 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 ETHICAL TRAINING 
only in theory, but in practice. The public sentiment 
of the school is against it, and ready to enforce its opinion 
in ways that the offender cannot help but heed. Ac- 
cording to this view, foul play in athletics merits the 
same condemnation that is implied in the maxim, “ No 
gentleman will cheat at cards.” 
Superintendent James L. Hughes of Toronto tells the 
following incident, which illustrates the spirit that gov- 
erns the well-bred English youth: A young English 
fencing champion, accompanied by his aged father, who 
had himself once been a famous fencer, had a trial of 
skill with a Canadian expert for championship honors. 
The Canadian, finding the contest going against him, 
began to avoid being touched upon the chest by swiftly 
turning and receiving upon his back the thrust he saw 
himself unable to avoid in front. Bystanders, sympa- 
thetic with the Englishman, whom these tactics were 
tending to defeat, called out to him, “ Turn your back, 
Harry; turn your back.” At this point the aged father 
rose, and in quavering tones called out, “‘ No, Harry, 
don’t do that! No true Englishman ever turns his back 
to an opponent!” 
The high school must avoid the pitfalls that have beset 
college athletics. Among these we find the employment 
of the professional short-time coach, who, hired to win 
victories, and not being highly imbued perhaps, with the 
sense of honor, either openly or covertly often takes every 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
    SOME MORAL ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL TRAINING I8I 
possible unfair advantage over the opposing team; also 
the spirit of inordinate partisanship, which manifests it- 
self in betting, even to the extent of many thousands of 
dollars upon a single game, and in “rooting,” in jeering, 
and in other aspects of that mob spirit which makes 
young men throw courtesy, justice, and generosity to the 
winds, and abandon themselves for the time being tothe 
lust of battle.! 
For the inculcation of wholesome ideals and sentiments, 
the following may prove beneficial : — 
1. Appeals to the sense of fairness and honor among the 
students. These appeals may be made both before and 
after the games, when the mind is unexcited and true judg- 
ment may have a chance to obtain. 
2. Written agreements between the faculties of the re- 
spective schools, that the games shall be played only upon 
the basis of the courteous and sportsmanlike conduct of 
all concerned. These agreements may be posted where 
the students can read them, and they might well contain 
particulars which should be made the subject of public 
comment and discussion. If the school as a whole 
commits itself to a code of honor, half the battle is 
won. 
3. Coaching, not by a transient outside trainer, em-

ployed for the season only, but by a permanent member 
of the faculty, whose opinion and authority shall reflect 
the best sentiments of faculty and students. 
4. Deliberate and continued resistance to the exhi- 
bition of outside hoodlum spirit. This resistance must 
doubtless be moral rather than physical. Perhaps 
nothing will shame the hoodlum so effectively as a gen- 
erous public recognition of good play and plucky, sports- 
manlike conduct of opponents. If merit in the home 
team is recognized by hearty cheers, that of the visitors 
may well be rewarded by occasional applause with the 
hands. 
Discussion :— 1. Estimation of the effects of the following 
qualities in those who direct high-school athletics: (1) sound 
judgment, (2) self-mastery, (3) cheerfulness and persuasion 
in enforcing rules, (4) readiness to incur temporary unpopu- 
larity in upholding ideals, (5) optimistic view concerning 
the attitude of students toward courtesy and fair play. 
2. Evileffects of the following qualities in themanagement of 
high-school athletics: (1) indifference towards the mainte- 
nance of right moral standards, (2) weakness in enforcing them, 
(3) credulity in the belief that courtesy and sportsmanship 
will prevail without conscious effort on the part of students 
and managers, (4) indolence in supervision, (5) “‘near-sighted- 
ness to excellencies and far-sightedness to defects,” (6) pes- 
simistic views concerning truthfulness and fairness, (7) desire

CHAPTER X 
A GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING 
ABROAD 
  82. In all civilized countries of the world the need for 
moral training of the young is recognized, while in most 
of them it is held to be paramount. Nations differ radi- 
cally, however, in their methods of effecting the common 
end desired, because each is influenced by conditions 
not present in equal degree in the others. 
A comparative view may perhaps be best obtained by 
considering the subject from three aspects, as follows : — 
1. Shall the sanctions underlying ethical training be 
religious, or personal and social? 
2. Shall moral instruction be direct and formal, or in- 
direct and informal ? 
3. Shall direct effort be made to inculcate national 
ideals of conduct and character, or shall institutional life 
itself be regarded as its own best teacher ? 
1. England 
83. As Sadler points out in his introduction of the 
Report which furnishes the main facts upon which the 
184
-P-A-G-E-197
       GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING ABROAD 185 
present chapter is based,! the question of religious as 
compared with social and personal sanctions breaks up 
naturally into a number of subordinate aspects as follows : 
1. Are social and personal sanction sufficient for certain 
phases of moral training, such as pertain to cleanliness, 
love of fair play, patriotism, etc., while religious sanctions 
are to be regarded as essential in teaching reverence, 
truthfulness, honesty, purity, charity, kindness, etc. ? 
2. Which of the following four views of the relation of 
religion to moral training shall be accepted ? 
(1) The two are inseparable ; 
(2) They are wholly separable ; 
(3) All religious instruction shall be given over to the 
church ; 
(4) The two are in some sense interdependent, both 
being necessary to true education. 
State and church in England have never been wholly 
separated, and this partnership still extends to education 
as well as to state support of the Anglican church. From 
the beginning of the last century down to 1870, elemen- 
tary schools in that country owed their origin and most of 
their support to religious organizations, while most of the 
secondary or so-called “‘ public ” schools also owed their 
origin to religious influence. Nothing could be more

ternational Inquiry.” Ed. by Michael E. Sadler, 2 vols. Longmans, 
Green & Co., N.Y. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 ETHICAL TRAINING 
natural than that the bodies which established and in 
large part supported these schools should insist upon 
basing all ethical training upon religious, not to say 
denominational, instruction. Catholics and dissenting 
Protestant denominations, though forming but a small 
percentage of the whole population, likewise established 
schools for their own children, and like the established 
church diligently instructed them in the tenets of their 
respective confessions. 
By 1833 it became evident that denominational support 
of public education was proving inadequate in at least 
two particulars: first, because money enough could 
not be raised to equip and maintain properly the schools 
already established; second, because many parts of the 
country, including sparsely settled districts and cities 
with dense populations, could not be accommodated at 
all. 
Government was consequently appealed to for aid, and 
in that year began a system of parliamentary grants to 
church schools which are still made and which have con- 
stantly increased in amount. Together with other con- 
ditions, such as provision for government inspection and 
the licensing of teachers, the so-called “‘ conscience clause” 
was imposed, forbidding school authorities from imparting 
religious instruction to children without the consent of 
their parents. 
By 1870 the inability of church organizations to supply 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING ABROAD 187 
  schools to all children became so marked that “‘ board 
schools ” were established by public authority where 
most urgently needed, and they were supported by local 
taxation in addition to the government grants that were 
extended to them. Following the example of the church 
schools, religious instruction was instituted in these 
schools, this time not by a denomination, but by the state. 
For three quarters of a century, debate, contention, and 
dissension have ruled in England over the respective 
privileges and responsibilities of church and state in the 
economic and religious control of education. Through- 
out it all, however, as Sadler declares, the majority of 
Englishmen have held to the conviction that ethical train- 
ing in school should rest upon a religious basis, at least so 
far as the graver aspects of conduct are concerned. This, 
then, is England’s answer to the broader query, Shall re- 
ligious sanctions underlie moral instruction and training ? 
As to the second query, Shall moral instruction be 
direct and formal, or indirect and informal? the answer 
appears to be as follows: The religious instruction shall be 
direct and formal, though varying greatly in content and 
manner of presentation in the respective denominations ; 
in the state schools it shall be formal, but, so far as pos- 
sible, undenominational. So far as a code of moral prin- 
ciples or maxims is concerned, the instruction appears to 
be incidental and informal. 
There is no evidence of any concerted effort to inculcate 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
    188 ETHICAL TRAINING 
national ideals of conduct and character. It is appar- 
ently assumed that if the school is what it should be, this 
matter will take care of itself. 
Concerning the minor aspects of the general theory of 
religious sanctions, it is natural that in a country so free 
in thought as England is, every shade of opinion should be 
held. Where the church assumes a distinctly institu- 
tional aspect, as with Anglicans and Roman Catholics, 
it is commonly maintained that religion and moral train- 
ing are inseparable. Furthermore, it is often held that 
so-called secular instruction is wholly non-moral (un- 
godly) unless imparted in the religious “ atmosphere.” 
The force of this conviction is shown by the fact that paro- 
chial schools for such an education are maintained, often 
at great financial sacrifice. The feeling appears to prevail, 
that without such schools, religious instruction would 
suffer because unsupported by a friendly intellectual en- 
vironment, and that secular training would lose some- 
thing of its proper effect upon character, because given 
with a non-religious background. 
Many in England, as in the United States, maintain 
that moral and religious training are separable, or at 
least that religious instruction should be remanded to the 
church, while the school should inculcate a moral code 
based upon social and personal sanctions. These views, 
however, do not prevail in England. 
The variety and force of these opinions are well ex-

hibited in the Report of an International Inquiry above 
referred to, Vol. I, pp. 295-325. 
2. Germany 
84. Though conditions in Germany are different from 
those in England, state control of education having dis- 
placed entirely that of the church, yet religion is every- 
where taught in public schools, and is assumed to be not 
only a proper, but even a necessary, basis of moral in- 
struction and training.’ It is taught with great thor- 
oughness twice a week throughout the nine years of all 
gymnasial courses, as well as in the elementary schools. 
No child escapes this training, for it is imposed by law 
upon all. Yet parents may have their children taught 
in their own faith, whether Protestant, Catholic, or Jew- 
ish. This is done presumably in the schools under 
teachers specially trained and carefully selected for this 
purpose, but if not there, then at home, provided always 
the instruction be supervised and approved by state au- 
thorities. ‘ Teachers of religion are trained, certificated, 
and appointed like all other teachers; they enjoy the 
same rank, honors, and emoluments as other teachers. In 
fact, unusual significance is attached to these positions. 
Instructors in religion must not only be scholars and

190 ETHICAL TRAINING 
  skillful teachers, but they must also possess high moral 
character and gentlemanly bearing, such as will exercise 
an unconscious influence for good over the young.” * 
Religion as a school exercise is made practicable in 
Germany, from the fact that there are but three leading 
confessions in that country — the Lutheran, the Catholic, 
and the Jewish. When convenient to do so, pupils are 
assigned to schools in accordance with the confession to 
which they belong, so that one school will be all Luth- 
eran, another all Catholic, and a third all Jewish. Where 
this division is impracticable, and twenty-five belonging to 
a given denomination are found, a special teacher of that 
faith is appointed to instruct them. A smaller number 
may be cared for in other ways, such as instruction at 
home or at church given by approved teachers. Were the 
Protestants of Germany as evenly divided among rival 
denominations as they are in the United States, it might 
be that the present unanimity of opinion respecting re- 
ligious instruction as the natural and necessary basis of 
moral education in public schools would cease to exist. 
Even as matters stand, the present system is often sharply 
challenged by Germans as to its rationality and results. 
Notwithstanding these dissenting voices, however, Ger- 
mans are perhaps more unanimously in favor of a reli- 
gious basis for ethical training than are Englishmen. 
Aside from the positive moral system implied in cate- 
1 Russell, J. E., “German Higher Schools,” p. 215. 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING ABROAD I9gI 
chism, commandments, and Bible texts, no effort is made 
to inculcate a systematic ethical code. Nor is much 
effort made to realize the potential moral value of the 
school subjects, as recommended in this volume. So 
sharp, indeed, is the antithesis between the keen, analyti- 
cal study of secular knowledge, wherein every statement 
that can be is challenged to justify itself to reason, and 
the non-analytic presentation of matters of faith, that 
some have claimed that German religious instruction in 
schools conduces more to unbelief than to belief. 
The chief function of German schools, as officially 
conceived, is the making of “ God-fearing, patriotic, self- 
supporting citizens.” Much stress is laid upon patriot- 
ism, the inculcation of the true German national spirit 
through direct appeal in history and song (e.g. Die Wacht 
am Rhein; Deutschland, Deutschland tiber Alles, iiber 
Alles in der Welt, etc.), and through the indirect influence 
of monuments to great men and in commemoration of 
important national events.!_ The Kaiser declares that he 
wants the schools to turn out young Germans, not young 
Greeks and Romans. The recent accomplishment of 
German unity after a thousand years of dissension and 
division, the still more recent rise to industrial greatness 
and to military importance on the ocean, make such an 
effort to inculcate the new national spirit seem natural

and Home Education, April, 1910.

and perhaps inevitable. In a still newer nation, Japan, 
we shall find an even more strenuous effort to accomplish 
similar results. 
  3. France! 
85. France has completed in the last twenty-five years 
what she began in the Revolution; namely, the complete 
separation of state and church in education. She has 
eliminated from her schools, both elementary and second- 
ary, the participation of the priesthood and of religious 
orders in the moral education of the children, and, what is 
more remarkable, she has, in shutting out these religious 
leaders, also rejected the religious teaching they repre- 
sent. Consequently, the basis of moral instruction has 
shifted from the religious basis to that of personal and 
civic sanctions. The causes for this momentous change 
are many and intricate, and quite beyond the bounds of a 
brief survey like the present. One or two may be men- 
tioned. France has never been wholly reconciled to the 
church since the Revolution; it is equally true that the 
priesthood has never become thoroughly reconciled to the 
state. Before that event, the nobility owned one-half of 
all the property in the nation, and paid no taxes. The 
church owned one-sixth of the wealth, and likewise paid 
no taxes. The third estate, owning the remaining one-

  GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING ABROAD 193 
third, paid all the taxes. Coupled with this fact was 
the equally impressive one that the nation’s rulers had 
surrendered themselves to a program of extravagance and 
moral corruption. The revolutionists classed the church 
with the nobility, and while they banished and executed 
nobles, they drove out the priests and seized the property 
of the church. 
But now when priests and religious orders are barred 
from teaching religion in the schools, why should the 
French shut out the very religion that the majority of her 
people confess? This, too, is a complex matter, but a 
single fact throws some light upon it. Unlike the Eng- 
lishman, who ignores a logical difficulty until compelled to 
respect it, the Frenchman is ultra-logical in his mental 
constitution, and is always more inclined to follow the rea- 
sonable, as he understands it, than he is to conform to the 
traditional and authoritative. Said M. Buisson in 1896: 
“While other countries have had the good fortune, the 
marvellous good fortune, to pass through Protestantism, 
France has been compelled to pass directly from Cathol- 
icism to Free Thought. Nothing has facilitated the 
transition; nothing has permitted our people to enlighten 
itself gradually. The ideal in all its splendor was set 
before it, and out of the darkness the decree went forth: 
‘March toward the ideal!’ ” 
France alone, of all European countries, has under- 
taken to conduct her moral instruction and training upon 
oO 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  194 ETHICAL TRAINING 
a non-religious basis. There has been not a little waver- 
ing as to what this basis should be. Among the sanctions 
tried are the natural religion of Jules Simon, Kant’s 
categorical imperative, the positivism of Comte, utili- 
tarianism, and finally social solidarity, of which the 
world has heard so much in recent years. Says M. 
Pécaut: ‘There is in this (moral) teaching a germ in- 
finitely precious; the first attempt of society to draw 
from its own bosom, and from no other source, the ele- 
ments of the entire education of the soul. Fear not this 
germ will perish. It will go on developing. And in 
proportion as civil society, freeing itself from its chains, 
develops in reason, and in understanding of the nature 
of man, the moral teaching will grow with it in depth 
and power.” + 
To the second query, Shall moral instruction be direct 
or indirect? France answers, It shall be direct — be 
formulated into a definite code, not moral and religious, 
but moral and civic. Says Harold Johnson, in the Re- 
port:? “From the first, moral instruction appears to 
be the aim rather than moral training; the enlighten- 
ment of the intelligence in moral matters, rather than 
the steady formation of habits and character. No child 
need leave the French public primary school in ignorance 
of the fundamental moral distinctions. Has he not com- 
1 See Report, Vol. II, pp. 6-7.

-P-A-G-E-207
GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING ABROAD 195 
mitted to heart hundreds of réswmés of moral lessons; 
repeated hundreds of them word for word; inscribed 
countless maxims in his copy-books ; composed numerous 
compositions on all the virtues; gazed daily on mottoes 
on the blackboard and walls; copied them in the writing 
lesson — by every means at every hour has he not had 
moral facts impressed on his memory, even if they have 
not penetrated deeper into his constitution? 
“ This pure intellectualism, even in the moral instruc- 
tion, is the more marked as we approach the adolescent 
stage, when teacher and pupil in higher primary school, 
in lycée and normal college, revel in the subtlest dialectic 
in truly Socratic fashion and grapple with the profoundest 
moral problems. In the /ycées especially this procedure 
appears to me to be followed by quite fatal results. In 
fact, I have scarcely been able to discover in the secondary 
schools any moral education at all, but I have found there 
a hotbed intellectualism which tends to engender through 
a premature study of philosophy, unbalanced by any 
effective moral discipline, an almost universal scepticism.” 
Says Rev. Edward Myers, a Catholic writer: “The 
new morality is essentially social; the problem is man’s 
adaptation to his social surroundings — which impose 
obligations upon him in return for advantages received ; 
the individual conscience is but an echo of the social con- 
science. The individual has duties to himself because of the 
duties he owes to society, and because any fault against 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  196 ETHICAL TRAINING 
himself will recoil upon society, upon the future of so- 
ciety. Inner morality has disappeared ; external circum- 
stances alone, so far as they are favorable or unfavorable, 
create morality; evil and pain become synonymous, and 
that alone is morally evil which causes another to suffer.” + 
The judgment of most observers of the French system 
of moral instruction is that it is far too formal and too 
intellectual; that it does little to develop attitude, and 
almost nothing to establish habit and volitional efficiency. 
At present it is a more or less violent and defiant reaction 
against ecclesiasticism in the moral training of the young. 
When this spirit of opposition is no longer felt to be nec- 
essary; when hostile criticism from the advocates of the 
old régime softens or disappears, we may expect that 
sincere regard for the welfare of youth and the good of 
the state will make this instruction more genuine and 
more effective. 
4. Japan 
86. Japan is an Oriental country, and the conditions 
of her ethical life are not likely to be duplicated in any 
Western land; yet her example in ethical training is most 
instructive, since the effort to make every child imbibe 
the national spirit in all its fulness is so earnest and 
thoroughgoing. 
Like France, she teaches a definite code of morals, in- 
cluding the ceremonial she has inherited from the past ; 
1 Report, Vol. II, p. 64. 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING ABROAD 107 
but, unlike France, she does not attempt to base this in- 
struction upon civic and personal sanctions. Nor does 
she follow the example of Christian Europe, outside of 
France, and base this moral training upon the received 
religion; but upon a basis that is half religious, half civil, 
and entirely Japanese; namely, upon a double rev- 
erence, first, towards the Mikado, and, second, towards 
ancestors. 
Japan has brought with her into the modern world the 
primitive man’s worship of his ancestors, and she has but 
just emerged from feudalism; moreover, she has always 
had the greatest reverence for the Mikado as the spiritual, 
as well as the civic, head of the Empire. Contrary to 
European experience, the Mikados of Japan have had 
an unbroken line of descent for twenty-five hundred 
years, so that the moral system of Japan is older than 
Christianity. Japan can hardly be said to have embraced 
religion; on the contrary, religion (Buddhism) may be 
said to have embraced Japan, since it made itself accept- 
able by adaptation to Japanese conditions, recognizing 
ancestor worship,-reverence for the Mikados, and by in- 
serting great Japanese names into its calendar of holy 
persons. 
When, therefore, in 1890 the Mikado sought a secure 
basis for moral instruction and training in the public 
schools, he found one ready at hand in the semi-religious 
relation he bears to his people and in the relation his an- 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  198 ETHICAL TRAINING 
cestors bore to theirs, both relations being made doubly 
sacred by ancestor worship. He issued, accordingly, the 
following Imperial Rescript : — 
“ Know ye, our Subjects : 
“ Our Imperial Ancestors have founded our Empire ona 
basis broad and everlasting and have deeply and firmly 
implanted virtue; our subjects ever united in loyalty and 
filial piety have from generation to generation illustrated 
the beauty thereof. This is the glory of the fundamental 
character of our Empire, and herein lies the source of our 
education. Ye, our Subjects, be filial to your parents, 
affectionate to your brothers and sisters; as husbands 
and wives be harmonious; as friends true; bear your- 
selves in modesty and moderation; extend your benevo- 
lence to all, pursue learning and cultivate arts, and there- 
by develop intellectual faculties and perfect moral powers ; 
furthermore, advance public good and promote common 
interests; always respect the constitution and observe 
the laws; should emergency arise, offer yourselves 
courageously to the state; and thus guard and maintain 
the prosperity of our Imperial Throne coeval with heaven 
and earth. So shall ye, not only be our good and faith- 
ful subjects, but render illustrious the best traditions of 
your forefathers. 
“The way here set forth is indeed the teaching be- 
queathed by Our Imperial Ancestors, to be observed 
alike by Their Descendants and the subjects, infallible

for all ages and true in all places. It is Our wish to lay 
it to heart in all reverence, in common with you, Our 
subjects, that we may all thus attain to the same 
virtue. 
“The 30th day of the roth month of the 23rd year of 
Meiji.” ! 
The Japanese code of morals in secondary schools is not 
unlike that common to Occidental nations. It embraces 
the following topics : — 
Obligations to self. Body; health, life. Mind; intel- 
lect; emotion; will. Independence; occupation, prop- 
erty. Personality. 
Obligations to family. Parents; brothers and sisters; 
sons and daughters; husband and wife; relatives; an- 
cestors and the house; servants. 
Obligations to society. Individual; personality of 
others; person, property, and honor of others; secrets 
and promises, etc. (confidence); gratitude; friendship; 
relations of the elder and younger; of the superior and 
inferior (in social position), of master and servant, etc. ; 
the female sex. 
Public; codperation; order of society; progress of 
society. 
Corporate bodies. 
The State; the constitution and the laws; patriotism; 
1See article by Baron Kikuchi, Report of an International Inquiry, 
Vol. II, pp. 319-349. 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  200 ETHICAL TRAINING 
military service; taxation; education; public service; 
public rights; international relations. 
The Imperial house; loyalty; the founder and other 
ancestors of the Imperial house; the Imperial destiny. 
Obligations to humanity. 
Obligations to nature. Animals; natural objects; the 
true, the good, and the beautiful. 
Though explicable on historic grounds, the difference 
between the Japanese basis for ethical training and that 
of the Western world is striking, and in a way startling. 
In our own country ecclesiastic differences, rivalries, and 
dissensions absolutely inhibit all efforts to secure a public 
appeal to religious sanctions, while France feels compelled 
to reject them entirely, and England is in a perpetual tur- 
moil about them. In Japan, on the contrary, every citi- 
zen can give his heartfelt assent to the established ethical 
basis, which is at once an expression of his deepest rever- 
ence, and the warrant for his country’s glory and security. 
Here all is difference, division, dissension; there all is 
agreement, unity, and concord. Americans must forego 
what many of them feel is most sacred and eternal, for 
that which is at best but human and changing. On the 
surface, therefore, Japan seems to have every advantage 
over us in the solidarity of her people concerning the 
final sanctions of her ethical life ; but, fundamentally, we 
must conclude that there are some things more important 
in the final destiny of a people than the unanimity that  
-P-A-G-E-213
GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING ABROAD 201 
comes of ancestor worship and reverence for Mikados. 
Among these are individuality with its freedom and 
responsibility; and dynamic institutions with their dia- 
lectic progress, in which each person is a “ functioning 
unit in a functioning whole.” We can afford to wait for 
unity, until increasing reasonableness shall overtake de- 
clining partisanship. Meantime, we must get along the 
best we can with the means at our disposal. The studies 
are ours, and we have the students, the teachers, and 
the schools; with these we can build a rational social 
solidarity, if not an Oriental feudal unity. 
5. Other Countries 
(1) Belgium 
87. Belgium is predominantly a Roman Catholic 
country, and though the unrest that has agitated France 
and compelled the separation of church and state in 
education is also felt in Belgium, yet the church is still 
empowered to supervise and arrange for, or provide reli- 
gious instruction in schools. If the communal teachers 
do not give it, the clergy may, either by themselves or 
their lay nominees. Inspection is vested in the represen- 
tatives of the church, so that conformity and orthodoxy 
in the instruction are amply secured. 
“One mischievous result of the Belgian effort to sepa- 
rate church and state, as in France, is that religious instruc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  202 ETHICAL TRAINING 
tion and moral education have come to be regarded on 
both sides as different and even incompatible things. The 
government and the church regard the French school 
system with abhorrence, while the Belgian admirers of the 
French school system regard the Belgian government 
and church with detestation.” ! 
Another effect of the strife is to prevent the govern- 
ment from enacting a compulsory attendance law. The 
consequence is, that when parents highly disapprove of 
what is done in the schools, they may keep their 
children at home. 
Aside from religious instruction, there appears to be 
little or no systematic effort to impart a code of morals, 
while civic dissension naturally prevents any effective 
attempt to impart national ideals. 
(2) Denmark 
88. As in Belgium, there is much controversy con- 
cerning the law which compels dogmatic religious instruc- 
tion in the schools, this time from the Lutheran stand- 
point, some 98 per cent. of the population belonging to 
that confession. Aside from that involved in religious 
lessons, there is little attempt at imparting a systematic 
moral code. How much or how little shall be at- 
tempted, is left to the individual teacher. Much stress is 
laid upon history in training for citizenship, and upon 
1 Report, pp. 121-122.
-P-A-G-E-215
    
GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING ABROAD 203 
hygiene and physical education for their value in devel- 
oping will and character. 
(3) Norway 
89. In Norway, as in Germany, religion stands first 
in every curriculum of study. Although Norway has 
escaped much of the controversy of Belgium and Den- 
mark, there is in that country a strong conviction that 
schools exist for intellectual training, and that the home 
is the best place for the development of moral power. 
Little effort is made to give systematic moral training 
aside from that involved in religious instruction. 
(4) Switzerland 
go. In Swiss secondary schools all religiousinstruction, 
which is substantially that of Germany, is given by the 
clergy, but attendance at the religious exercises is not 
compulsory. 
“ The free air of the mountains blows through the Swiss 
educational system. Education in Switzerland is demo- 
cratic; a civic and tolerant spirit pervades the lessons ; 
the bureaucratic spirit is nowhere conspicuous.” ! 
“ Among the Swiss teachers at the present time, the 
interest in the problems of moral education is so absorb- 
ing that it may almost be described as hypnotic. This 
state of mind results from the discovery of the fact that 
1 Report, p. 202. 
   
-P-A-G-E-216
  204 ETHICAL TRAINING 
every teacher is supposed to educate his pupils morally, 
and that he thinks he is doing it, while really he is accom- 
plishing extremely little. It has been assumed without 
reflection that no one need be specially prepared for in- 
fluencing children morally, though scarcely any part of 
education requires so much conscious preparation.” * 
(5) Canada 
gt. The experience of English-speaking countries allied 
to England is particularly instructive to teachers in the 
United States, for they furnish various solutions of the 
religious problem, upon a basis of substantial unity con- 
cerning racial ideals. In Canada the old provinces of 
Quebec and Ontario have separate schools for Catholics 
and for Protestants, each controlling their own religious 
instruction. Quebec has 4646 Roman Catholic and 
869 Protestant schools; Ontario has 428 Roman Catho- 
lic, 5 Protestant, and 5793 public schools. “ The public 
schools must be opened with the Lord’s Prayer, and closed 
with the reading of the Scripture and the Lord’s Prayer, 
except when the teacher claims to have conscientious 
scruples. Pupils are not required to be present at such 
exercises if their parents or guardians object. The clergy 
of any denomination may arrange for giving religious 
instruction once a week after school hours, to pupils of 
their own faith; but emblems of a denominational char- 
1 Report, p. 206.
-P-A-G-E-217
  GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING ABROAD 205 
acter are not allowed to be exhibited during the school 
hours in a public school.” ! 
In Manitoba the religious exercises are at the option of 
the school board. When held, they must be conducted 
immediately before the closing hour of school, from 
which pupils may be excused at the desire of the parents. 
The religious exercises must be entirely non-sectarian. 
They are given by clergymen or authorized teachers. 
The remaining provinces permit religious exercises in 
the schoolroom outside regular hours, but neither pre- 
scribe nor recognize such instruction as a subject of the 
school program. 
“There are many schools in every province of Canada 
which have a wide reputation for excellence. The moral 
training in such schools is their cardinal merit. The 
systems of moral instruction in these schools are as various 
as the personalities of the principals.” ? 
(6) New South Wales 
92. General non-sectarian religious instruction forms 
part of the regular curriculum in all schools in New South 
Wales. Periods of from 14 to 24 hours a week are de- 
voted to civics and morals, the lessons being based on four 
Scripture books issued by the Irish National Board. 
There is also provision for denominational instruction 
1 Report, p. 286. 
2 Report, p. 293. 
   
-P-A-G-E-218
206 ETHICAL TRAINING 
during one hour each school day, but, as in all similar 
provinces, with the ‘‘ conscience clause.” This privilege 
is exercised chiefly by the Anglican church; to a less ex- 
tent by other Protestant denominations, including the 
Salvation Army; by the Jews in some of the city schools, 
and only rarely by the Roman Catholics. Clergymen 
usually give such instruction. 
(7) Victoria 
  93. In the secondary schools of Victoria, five being 
organized after the model of the so-called “ Public 
Schools” of England, the moral instruction is given 
mostly through religious lessons, supplemented by the 
work of the University Christian Union, “ which, owing to 
its sensible methods, has a strong hold upon Australian 
boys.” Use is made of literature and history to aid moral 
instruction, but rarely in systematic form. 
(8) New Zealand 
94. Here teachers are enjoined to “ enforce the prin- 
ciples of moral conduct by examples taken from history, 
biography, poetry, and fiction and by anecdote, allegory, 
and fable.” By the terms of the Education Act the teach- 
ing within the regular school hours must be entirely 
secular. “ This is generally held to exclude the use of
-P-A-G-E-219
  
GENERAL SURVEY OF ETHICAL TRAINING ABROAD 207 
parts of the Bible, either as literature or-for the illustra- 
tion of moral principles.” + 
Discussion : — Varying application of the several national 
aspects of ethical instruction and training to similar problems 
in the United States, as affected by existing conditions.
